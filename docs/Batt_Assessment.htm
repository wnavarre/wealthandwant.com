    February 6, 2007
</p>
<p>Assessment has historically been the Achilles heel of the real property tax,
  and is an important reason why the public resents it. We really have two taxes,
  one on land value and one on improvements, each with very different dynamics,
  and until people realize the significance of this, nothing else matters. Buildings
  depreciate just like cars, computers and refrigerators, 0.5% to 1.5% yearly;
  land appreciates. Land typically increases in market price because the surplus
  of community enterprise comes to settle on locations in the form of economic
  rent. So, unless one revalues frequently, things get quickly out of line. A
land value tax (LVT) recaptures that surplus for public use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>1</em></strong></font></p>
<p>The tax on the building part causes many problems: it discourages responsible
  maintenance, the highest and best use of sites, fosters sprawl development,
  eviscerates urban cores, and depletes the environment. But taxation of land
  values is really the superior revenue source, as some eight Nobel prizewinning
  economists have attested.<font size="-1"><strong><em>2</em></strong></font> It conforms to all the textbook principles of sound
  tax theory &#8211; neutrality, efficiency, progressivity, stability, simplicity,
  administrability.<font size="-1"><strong><em>3</em></strong></font> Yes, the property tax is progressive, despite what some
  people have said.<font size="-1"><strong><em>4</em></strong></font> Especially the land part &#8211;tenants pay nothing, and
  LVT is the only tax that actually fosters economic development and vitality.<font size="-1"><strong><em>5 </em></strong></font></p>
<p>There was a time when critics complained that it was difficult to assess the
  land and the building components separately. Hence, standards for assessment
  were outrageously low.<font size="-1"><strong><em>6 </em></strong></font>Now GIS triangulation algorithms are not only more
  accurate but also cheaper and quicker. It would be worth the State&#8217;s
  investment to use its battery of GIS techs to avail itself of and improve upon
  this work; the payoff would be enormous. It is now possible for the record
  of every parcel sale to be quickly entered into the database, then passed over
  to the Assessor&#8217;s office each night, thereby maintaining a real-time
  cadastre of a municipality. Present costs per parcel for a complete revaluation
  are anywhere from $60 (upstate) to $100 (downstate), but the cost can be reduced
  to less than $10 once the computer technology is instituted.<font size="-1"><strong><em>7</em></strong></font> Apportioning
land value for condos and coops is just as easily done.</p>
<p>Many American assessors make the mistake of first valuing structures and then
  treating land components as residuals.<font size="-1"><strong><em>8</em></strong></font> The failure to conform to standard
  practices elsewhere in the world typically leads to over-valuing structures
  and gives an advantage for depreciation on corporate tax schedules. To this
  extent, assessors serve the interests of the finance, insurance and real-estate
  industries. The distortion can be seen in the fact that the aggregate land
  value proportion in a typical American city is &frac14; to 1/3 of the total
  tax base, far less than in municipalities elsewhere.<font size="-1"><strong><em>9</em></strong></font> Greenwich, Connecticut,
  a city that employs the building residual method, has a land value proportion
  of 71 percent. The Mastick Commission Report done for the New York State Legislature
  in 1932 reports that the aggregate assessed land and improvement component
in New York City was $12 Billion for each.<font size="-1"><strong><em>10</em></strong></font></p>
<p>New York State and its people pay
  a price for not taxing the surplus that accretes to land sites
  in the form of economic rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>11</em></strong></font>      Land,
  one must recall, has a fixed supply &#8211; what economists call
      inelastic. This means that any tax imposed on land sites is incorporated &#8211; capitalized &#8211; into
      the market value. The more tax is added, the greater the downward pressure
      on the land price. This makes housing more affordable up front. It&#8217;s
      a simple case of the buyer &#8220;paying now or paying later.&#8221; (There
      are economic pressures that work in the opposite direction that may stabilize
      site prices, but that&#8217;s a secondary point of little consequence here.)
      By society not recovering the economic rent from locations, market prices
      rise and so do taxes, witness California and Florida. This rise in values
      gives some titleholders windfall gains and prices young households out
      of the market and leads others to keep more housing than they need. It
      is better to collect the rent and thereby stabilize prices. It helps economic
      vitality in the long run. For those who find that any burden is difficult &#8220;now,&#8221; they
      can defer their tax until selling later &#8211; some 24 states have a provision
like this.<font size="-1"><strong><em>12</em></strong></font></p>
<p>It is also important to understand the enormously steep gradient of land values.<font size="-1"><strong><em>13</em></strong></font>  Urban locations can be hundreds of times more expensive than peripheral areas.
  Since central cities are largely commercial in nature, residential parcels
  farther out have a much lower land value, and farmers&#8217; land value is
  essentially trivial if not already protected by other save-harmless provisions.
  The problem is much of high value urban land sits underused or vacant &#8211; often
  as much as a third<font size="-1"><strong><em>14</em></strong></font> -- and taxing land value fully typically induces the better
  use of those parcels. When a property tax is shifted to a land value tax, most
  homeowners pay less, and derelict high value parcels pay more. They are prompted
  to develop rather than being held off the market for speculative
gain.<font size="-1"><strong><em>15</em></strong></font> </p>
<p>The important point is to get the land values assessed at what they should
  be, and frequent review is important as much as is accuracy. Maryland has state
  assessors that do one-third of the counties each year, so valuations are never
  more than three years old. I have been part of a team that simulates how LVT
  works anyplace in Maryland &#8211; see <a href="http://www.marylandlandtax.org">www.marylandlandtax.org</a>. We&#8217;re
  doing similar simulations in New York, though the assessment data is often
  far poorer. One can see the results for twelve counties at <a href="http://www.newyorklandvaluetax.org">www.newyorklandvaluetax.org</a>.
  Phasing out taxes on improvements typically gives most homeowners a break.
  This policy is legal in New York, and it awaits a trial in a city with good
  land assessments. Amsterdam tried doing this a decade ago, but abandoned it
  after one year due to poor assessments and lack of public understanding. With
  good land assessments, a quick adjustment in the computer application will
  both relieve lots of political and economic pressures and revitalize many moribund
urban economies.</p>
<p>I have addressed in passing all the bills in question.<font size="-1"><strong><em>16 </em></strong></font>But it is especially
  important, I believe, to look at the incidence of each component of any tax
  on real property &#8211; both land and improvements &#8211; because up-to-date
  studies are needed. Some colleagues of mine have done some work in Baltimore,
  but it relies on block and zip code data related to housing, and this is very
  gross analysis. I know of some studies that have looked at progressivity but
  have ignored the burdens on renters and on non-residential property. My work
  (unpublished) shows that households typically pay about half of all property
  taxes, and the remainder is paid by by non-residential property owners. With
  LVT, although homeowners are the overwhelming number of titleholders, their
  burdens are typically small, only the land under their houses. Taxing only
  land values immediately relieves the one third of households, mostly poor people,
who own no land at all. </p>
<hr width="40%">
<p><font size="-1">1Taxing land value has its origins in classical economic theory,
    and was most clearly elucidated by 19th century advocate Henry George&#8217;s
    <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, a book that sold more copies by 1906 than any work
    ever published except the Bible. Today, the power of computers and the increasing
    availability of data make it possible to test Georgist hypotheses empirically
    for the first time. This exciting prospect has absorbed my attention since
    leaving the New York State Legislative Tax Study Commission in 1992 after
    serving there for close to a decade. What had been only plausible ideas now
    are proving valid&#8212;for many instances online, see <a href="http://www.urbantools.org">www.urbantools.org</a>.
    Sweden and Norway have just this past summer allocated $10 million each to
    a network exploring and advocating land value taxation and capture, and
    growing attention to such regimes now constitutes a worldwide dialogue. See,
    for example, the UN Habitat sponsored project under the auspices of the Earthrights
Institute at <a href="http://www.earthrights.net/projects/globallandtool.html%20">www.earthrights.net/projects/globallandtool.html </a></font></p>

<p><font size="-1">4 Only two empirical studies have ever been done on the subject,
    but both concluded that the real property tax is mildly progressive. When
    land and improvements, the two elements of the property tax, are taken separately,
    it becomes even clearer why this is so. See Peter Mieszkowski, &#8220;The
    Property Tax: An Excise or a Profits Tax,&#8221; Journal of Public Economics

<p><font size="-1">6 By far the largest proportion of land value is in cities,
        typically upwards of 90 percent, and the ability to accurately assess
    such parcels is very much dependent upon data on adjacent sites. The official
        handbook of The International Association of Assessing Officers states
      (p.547) that &#8220;the chief measure of uniformity [in aggregate analysis] is the
        coefficient of dispersion (COD), which, depending on the nature of the properties
        involved, should not exceed 10.0-15.0 for residential properties, 15.0-20.0
        for commercial properties, and 20.0 for vacant [i.e., rural] land.&#8221; Joseph
        K. Eckert, et al, <em>Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration</em>, Chicago:
        IAAO, 1990. The revolution in computerized assessment is fast making
      such tolerances far too generous, and will soon in fact at least be halved.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">9. This researcher has collected data on some 2,700 of the
    10,000 assessment districts in the nation, and calculated the mean land aggregate
    land value of each of those districts. The mean of all those total means
    is approximately 39 percent land value. My city of Albany had a percent land
    value for the total 28,000 parcels of a bit over 17 percent. The residential
    parcels taken separately had an aggregate 18+ percent land value; the non-residential
    parcels a bit over 11 percent. One can understand how it is more advantageous
    to be able to depreciate 80 or 90 percent of a real estate asset rather than,
    say, 50 percent. A recent study found that land&#8217;s share of single family

    most depressed city in the nation under Federal distress criteria. Since
    that city&#8217;s phase-in of ever greater tax rates on land than on improvements,
    Mayor Stephen Reed notes that &#8220;Harrisburg has registered in excess
    of $3.1 billion in new investment. The number of businesses on the City&#8217;s
    tax rolls has increased from 1,908 to more than 5,900. Taxable real estate
    values have increased from an aggregate of $212 million to over $1.6 billion.
    The number of vacant properties has been cut by 85%.&#8221; (Letter to Philadelphia
    Controller, May 1, 2003.)The crime rate has been reduced 54% and the fire
    rate has dropped over 76%. Mayor Reed, re-elected continually since 1982,
