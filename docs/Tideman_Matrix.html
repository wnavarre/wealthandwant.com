<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
REAL Matrix into which we&#8217;ve all been born is the economic paradigm
that rationalises the ownership and transfer of land as a free, fair,
efficient and perfectly normal thing to do.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">The writer, Prof. Nic Tideman, is a
highly-qualified American Geoist academic, philosopher and ethicist
(and a vego, of course!). Dare to break free of The Matrix, and read
on&#8230;&#8230;</span></div>
<br>
The initial distribution of land - the origin of property in land - is
military, legal, and political, not economic. The prime business of
nations throughout history has been to gain and defend land. What was
won by force has no higher sanction than <span
 style="font-style: italic;">lex fortioris</span>, and must be
kept and defended by force.<br>
<br>
After land is appropriated by a nation the original distribution is
political. The nature of societies, cultures and economies for
centuries afterwards are moulded by that initial distribution,
exemplified by the differences between Costa Rica (equal
partition) and El Salvador with its fabled "Fourteen Families" (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Las
Catorce</span>), or between Canada and Argentina. <br>
<br>
Political redistribution also occurs within nations, as with the
English enclosures and Scottish "clearances", when one part of the
population in effect conquered the rest by political machinations, and
took over their land, their source of livelihood. Reappropriation and
new appropriation of tenures is not just an ancient or a sometime thing
but an on-going process. This very day, proprietary claims to water
sources, pollution rights, access to rights of way, radio spectrum,
signal relay sites, landing rights, beach access, oil and gas, space on
telephone and power poles (e.g. for cable TV), taxi licences,
etc. are being created under our noses. In developing countries of
unstable government the current strong man often grants concessions to
imperialistic adventurers who can bolster his hold on power by
supplying both cash up front, and help from various US and
UN agencies from the IMF to the United States Marine Corps.<br>
<br>
Ordinary economic thinking today would have it that a nation that
distributes land among private parties by "selling to the highest
bidder" is using an economic method of distribution. Such thinking
guides World Bank and IMF economists as they advise nations emerging
from communism on how to privatise land. The neutrality is specious, at
best. Even selling to the highest bidder is a political decision, as
19th century American history makes clear.<br>
<br>
The right to sell was won by force, is not universally honoured, and
must be kept by continuous use of force. In practice, selling for cash
up front reserves most land for a few with front-money advantage,
inside information, good contacts, corrupt aids, etc. The history of
disposal of US public domain leaves no doubt about this and it is still
going on with air rights, water, radio, landing rights, fishing
licenses, etc. Choices being made currently are just as tainted as
those of 19th century history.<br>
<br>
Selling land in large blocks under frontier conditions is to sell at a
time before it begins yielding much if any rent. It is bid in by those
few who have large discretionary funds of patient money. Politicians,
meantime, treat the proceeds as current revenues used to hold down
other taxes today, leaving the nation with inadequate revenues in the
future. <br>
<br>
The ability to bid high does not necessarily come from legitimate
savings. The early wealth of Liverpool came from the slave trade. High
bidders for many properties today are&nbsp; middle eastern potentates
who neither produced nor saved the wealth they control. Other high
bidders are criminals, who find the "sanctity of property" a splendid
route for laundering their gains, and a permanent shelter against
further prosecution.<br>
