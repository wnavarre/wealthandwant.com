<b>How Sharing Earth Brought Peace</b>
</center>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Jeffery Smith, Portland, OR </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span> </p>
<p>Since forever, humans have claimed and counter-claimed every
square inch of this planet. Occasionally, these disputes have ended
peacefully. What has worked in other times and places might work
again in the Mideast. Delivering a double dividend, what settled land
disputes also developed moribund economies and revived developed
ones. Among others, New York, now aiming to rebuild, has used this
policy before. Because it's growing popular among environmentalists,
greens could lead the US to geonomics. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bloodless Resolutions</span> </p>
<p>On a distant ridge at dawn, a Palestinian might gaze across the
desert at the hills where his fathers before him had grazed sheep,
where now sprout Israeli settlements. Many American suburbanites,
too, cannot go home anymore, to childhood&#8217;s field or woods or
marsh, now filled or clear-cut or leveled and covered by monotonous
boxy structures. An Australian aborigine knows a similar scene of
displacement and an effective means of redress. </p>
<p>At a British Parliament hearing, an elder testified, "our land
claim doesn't take one piece of land from anybody." What they want
instead is a share of land's rent. Redirecting rent, the money we
spend on the nature we use, enables society to curb taxes on useful
effort. Minimizing taxes on things we create individually while
collecting rent from things created to benefit us all equally is
geonomics. Wherever tried, to the degree tried, geonomics has worked.
</p>
<p>Three times in history, territorial antagonists yielded peacefully
to geonomics.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Denmark, the crown prince was so eager to try
physiocracy (the au currant version of geonomics), that he deposed
his uncle, the king.  </li>
  <li>In California, runaway land concentration (one
rancher had over a million acres) provoked a schoolteacher to run for
office just to legislate a tax on land values, not buildings.  </li>
  <li>And in
Taiwan, a retreating general was so desperate that he implemented on
the island what he had merely promised on the mainland.  </li>
</ul>
Thus, during
the 1840s in Denmark, the 1890s in California, and the 1940s in
Taiwan, large landowners found it too expensive to hoard land, so
they sold off their excess at prices the peasants could afford and
the tedious struggle between landlord and tenant ended without
bloodshed.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mideast implementation</span> </p>
<p>These cases involved different classes, not different cultures.
Yet with a new twist the rent rebate that worked within society may
work between societies. The Koran urges landlords to not gouge
tenants but to consider land a trust. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In Israel, admonished to not
own land forever, since the land is Mine (Leviticus), the National
Trust leases all the land to the occupants. These strictures could
lead to geonomics.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Israel and Palestine would
establish a steward to collect land
dues and disburse rent dividends a la Alaska's oil dividend. </span>Since
land is more valuable in Israel than in Palestine, Jews would pay in
more than Arabs, yet everyone would get back the same. And since
Israelis prosper, they drive up land values; having Jews as co-owners
developing land, raising its value, fattening everyone's Citizens
Dividend Arabs might accept that. Profit does make for strange
bedfellows. Two archrivals, China and Taiwan, recently agreed to
explore for oil together. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mideast Development</span> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">While sharing rent may
soothe hurt feelings, collecting it
stimulates development.</span> As a World Bank report acknowledged, all
the
Asian Tigers first had land reform before becoming Tigers. Land taxes
impel owners to put their land to its best use, which requires
employment and construction. As workers exchange wages for goods,
they generate more output for everyone. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using geonomics, people
have turned some of the poorest lands into
the richest economies. Hong Kong is a barren rock owned by the
public. The city collects enough site-rent to keep taxes on effort
way down. </span>Thus prices are low and investment and income high,
moving
FORTUNE magazine to name Hong Kong the world's best city for
business. In a different culture, Mexicali (Mexico) replaced the
property tax with a land tax and bettered itself. </p>
<p>If Palestine does forgo taxes, it'd become a tax haven, attracting
money from wealthier neighbors without incurring debt. As Palestine
sustains development, it could sell bonds at a lower rate. When
Palestinian bonds are selling on Wall Street, overlapping
self-interest will wither the appeal of terrorist rhetoric. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">New York, Old Story</span> </p>
<p>New Yorkers benefited before from geonomics. After World War I,
the city lacked housing. Borrowing a page from former mayoral
candidate Henry George, the council exempted new buildings but not
underlying sites from taxation for the next ten years. During the
first half of the Roaring 20s, new construction more than tripled
while in other big cities it barely doubled. Economic good times came
to an end when owners in 1928 began to anticipate the expiration of
the exemption. Stalled housing starts helped trigger the Great
Depression. </p>
<p>More recently, Mayor Rudy Giuliani used to welcome the school year
by <span style="font-weight: bold;">suspending for a week the tax on
shoes and clothes</span>. Shoppers
saved, stores profited, and the city took in more revenue. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If the
city zeroed out taxes on all sales and wages, customers and workers
would flock to the Big Apple, pumping up site values even higher,
providing a fat fund for fixing up infrastructure. </span>That'd help
owners
redevelop both lower Manhattan and the blocks of vacant lots and
abandoned buildings in the Bronx and Bedford-Stuyvesant. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reject recession</span> </p>
<p>To invigorate our traumatized economy, politicians push tax
buttons and pull subsidy levers. Sometimes they get it right. In the
1970s around the city of Melbourne (Australia), some towns lost
businesses while others gained new firms even as the economy was
shrinking. The towns losing companies had the conventional property
tax, which falls mainly on buildings, not on land speculation. The
towns gaining enterprise had a site-value tax that prodded owners to
keep their land at its best use which meant having tenants who hired
people and sold goods. Denmark in the 1950s raised its rate on land,
quickening employment while slowing inflation. Then in the 60s,the
nation reduced its income tax burden for one year, both investment
and output soared. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important endorsers</span> </p>
<p>When Johannesburg (SA) taxed land three times greater than
buildings, it recycled sites faster than any other city in the world.
Using urban land efficiently over and over absorbs development that
would otherwise sprawl onto rural land. Since taxing site-values, not
improvements, in-fills cities, Seattle's Northwest Environment Watch,
a spin-off of WorldWatch (which also endorses geonomic policy),
dubbed the property tax shift "the sprawl tax". The Sierra Club,
Friends of the Earth, and most major groups endorse shifting the
property tax from buildings to locations. </p>
<p>Some influential constituencies have supported geonomics. In the
80s, thanks to taxing land six times higher than buildings,
Pittsburgh kept neighborhoods stable, housing affordable, and crime
low. Rand-McNally named the Steel City "America's Most Livable City"
twice. And the Commission on Affordable Housing set up by the first
President Bush endorsed this property tax shift. Pro-business
supporters include Milton Friedman, Jack Kemp, and the Philadelphia
Association of Realtors. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">America's role</span> </p>
<p>As the Chinese character notes, crisis is half opportunity. To
counter global recession and resolve the Mideast stalemate, Western
governments would:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) eliminate tariffs on imports from
Palestine
and elsewhere; <br>
(2) eliminate subsides to domestic producers, so they
must compete with imports; and <br>
(3) set a good example; shift from
subsidies to a Citizens Dividend and from taxes to resource dues. <br>
</div>
All
of us would save boatloads of money from no taxes on imports, sales,
salaries, and homes. Our governments would stuff their treasuries
with the rent from sites, resources, and sinks (environment as dump
site).
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Besides rent from land
titles, resource leases, broadcast
licenses, and standards waivers, revenue could be raised, too, from
monopoly patents, utility franchises, and corporate charters.
Charging full market value for these pieces of papers, we'd rake in
trillions each year from the privileged elite. </span>We'd still be
the envy
of the world but no longer the master of the world. The terrorist
crisis would make America better; it'd get us to do what we should
have been doing all along. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Beyond borders</span> </p>
<p>After terrorists toppled New York's twin trade towers, young males
in the dusty streets of Palestine danced in celebration. They wore
blue jeans, t-shirts, and Nike shoes. Our influence extends
everywhere; we have no choice but to lead. The US should put these
geonomic reforms on the table and not budge until a Mideast economic
partnership treaty gets signed. We'd make all future aid contingent
upon reaching an accord. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Where to draw a line in the sand
becomes a lot less contentious
when land and oil are no longer spoils of war and when neighbors do
not endure drastically different standards of living. Growing up, we
learn to not fight over toys but to take turns. Societies need to
learn this, too.</span> </p>
<p>Early last century, Gifford Pinchot, first head of the US Forest
Service, said: "The earth belongs of right to all its people and not
to a minority, insignificant in numbers but tremendous in wealth and
power. The people shall get their fair share of the benefit which
comes from the development of the country which belongs to us all
with equal opportunity for all and special privileges for none." A
man in a Republican administration could say that then. We need to
hear it again now.</p>
