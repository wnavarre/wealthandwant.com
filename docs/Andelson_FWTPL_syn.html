  the Oppressed on Every Continent</span><br>
  <br>
  At the start of the 1990s, while the Berlin Wall and the authoritarian
  regimes in Eastern Europe toppled, Latin American communities and
  clergy who were operating under the banner of liberation theology began
  throwing off the yoke of oppression.<br>
  <br>
  The uprising of subjected peoples around the world lends immediacy to
  the search for genuine liberation. While many emphasize political
  matters, equally critical are the ethical and economic underpinnings of
  liberation. To ignore these will likely result in a tragic
  disillusionment for the people who have made the enormous sacrifices to
  chart new courses.<br>
  <br>
  In <span style="font-style: italic;">How the Other Half Dies</span>,
  Susan George wrote that "The most pressing cause of the abject poverty
  which millions of people in this world endure is that a mere 2.5% of
  landowners with more than 100 hectares control nearly three quarters of
  all the land in the world - with the top 0.23% controlling half." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To recognize this social plague for what it
  is, and to avert a backlash of despair, requires a clear understanding
  of two great themes: the Promised Land and the Wasteland.</span><br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Promised Land is the hope of the
  landless, literally, land, the gateway to opportunity.</span> Abraham
  in Mesopotamia and the Israelites in bondage in Egypt so wished for
  their own land that they left homes and familiar surroundings and
  risked death to seek the distant place God had promised, a land rich in
  milk and honey, where a day's labor would put food on the table and
  allow their children to grow into adulthood. This exodus pattern has
  been repeated over and over, from the migrations of prehistory to the
  boat people of our day. For centuries, immigrants have poured into the
  Americas, looking for the inheritance denied to them in the Old World
  -- their portion of land.<br>
  <br>
  But the Promised Land is not so much a geographic place as it is a hope
  and a vision of a just social order. Modern society has many wondrous
  features, but it certainly is not the Promised Land in its full glory.
  Indeed, we are "modern captives" who sense the Promised Land as a
  primitive instinct, as a deep longing, and as a cry from the depths of
  our captivity that the world should be different.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">All of us, no less than the Hebrews in
  Egypt, are captives of structures imposed upon us. To enslave people,
  today as three thousand years ago, is to rob them of the value of their
  labor. Millions of working people living in severe poverty are robbed
  of the fruits of their labor.</span> Through various forms of
  exploitation, especially the monopolization of land rights, large
  segments of humanity are oppressed, dehumanized, held in bondage. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">One factor enabling governments to
  legalize land theft and lend respectability to exploitative landlordism
  is the general silence of religious and intellectual leaders about
  humanity's common rights to land.</span><br
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">We begin to penetrate and overcome
  this silence when we realize that the Wasteland is wasted land,
  unfulfilled potential, producing no "milk and honey."</span>
  Speculators in both urban and rural areas hoard land on which the
  hungry, the homeless, and the jobless could feed, shelter, and employ
  themselves. Keeping valuable lands idle causes artificial shortages
  that drive up rents which poor people must pay for poor land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Land hoarding deserves much of the blame
  for creating the Wasteland: it forces people into the "desert.</span>" There,
  people find the oases controlled by more land monopolists who must be paid
  a ransom for access to nature's life-sustaining water. And
  as we will see, the primary focus of Biblical economic laws was the
  prevention of precisely this sort of usurpation of God's gifts to all
  creatures.<br>

The <span style="font-weight: bold;">midbar</span>, the biblical
Wasteland, is only part desert. It has towns and pastures, but it lacks
the "fullness of life." This anomaly is mirrored in the modern
Wasteland, crowded with factories, skyscrapers and mansions -- along
with ugly blight and squalid slums.<br>
<br>
The point of departure of liberation theology is the recognition of the
awful fact that millions lead subhuman lives. The rural landless seek
refuge in cities, often becoming squatters in barrios or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">favelas </span>with open sewage and no
safe water supply. They may earn fifteen dollars a month if they find
work at all. Children live in the streets and go to bed hungry. Illness
and drought, and even complaining of their lot, may lead to premature
death. And they can see the Mercedes behind the iron gates of walled
mansions. (Ironically, <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">mercedes </span>is
also a Spanish legal term denoting title to a large grant of land.)
Like poor Lazarus in the parable of Jesus (Luke 16:19-31), they survive
on the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table. When judgement comes
to the rich man, he receives no mercy because he had shown none.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="2._Latin_American_Colonialism_and_its"></a>2. Latin American
Colonialism and its Legacy of Bondage</span><br>
<br>
Just as the Hebrews in Egypt toiled beneath the yoke of Pharaoh and his
taskmasters, so did the peoples of Latin America for centuries endure
bondage to colonial rulers.<br>
<br>
And just as remnants of the slave mentality persisted among the Hebrews
in the wilderness, so does the legacy of colonial attitudes and
institutions persist in Latin America today.<br>
<br>
The image of Christ dying in passive agony on the cross, and the image
of the Blessed Virgin as a dolorous woman in mourning and pierced by a
sword, are common in popular Latin American Catholicism. They speak of
centuries of impotence under Spanish and other foreign masters. Even
today many practicing Roman Catholics approach <span
 style="font-style: italic;">carnival </span>as a temporary relief
from suffering -- a reality that was present yesterday and will be here
tomorrow, always. In this sense, <span style="font-style: italic;">carnival
</span>is escapism -- for a few days. Then real life continues.<br>
<br>
The origins of this suffering are clearly to be found in the
aristocratic system imposed by papal bull and the armed might of Spain
and Portugal, a system that relegated the indigenous Indian population
to a life of slavery, at best. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Inter
Caeteris</span>, Pope Alexander VI designated King Ferdinand and Queen
Isabella "lords and masters" of the New World. Thus were the treasure
stores of gold and silver, and later coffee and beef, thrown open -- to
a well-defined elite.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">encomienda </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">was the basic instrument used by the
Spanish empire for settling Latin America. This was a grant of Indians
to an </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">encomendero
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">who assumed the obligation, in
principle, of Christianizing and civilizing them. The Indians, "in
exchange", were required to provide labor and tribute to Spain. </span>We
look back upon this epoch as a period of brutal and cynical "pacification" of
the indigenous people by conquering exploiters. But it is important to recognize
that the <span style="font-style: italic;">encomenderos
</span>who were charged with "Christianizing" the natives took their
jobs seriously enough to allow the clergy to move in and do their
evangelical works without interference. It may be tempting, now, to
view those early missionaries as merely cynical agents of colonial
expansionism -- but in fact, it could not have been so. The enduring
pervasive influence of the Catholic Church in Latin America attests to
the success of those missionaries on the front lines. Had they not been
motivated by a sincere Christian faith, they could not have left such
an indelible mark on an entirely different culture.<br>
<br>
However, religious works cannot avoid their political context (an
insight of the liberation theologians). Although in theory the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">encomienda </span>was not a grant of
land, in practice many of the <span style="font-style: italic;">encomienderos
</span>were also granted <span style="font-style: italic;">mercedes</span>,
or legal title to vast tracts that gave rise to the late estates. After
the <span style="font-style: italic;">encomienda </span>system was
abolished, this control of land allowed the economic exploitation of
the natives to continue.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Two types of large landed estates
survive to this day from the colonial period: </span></p>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;"><li>the <span style="font-style: italic;">hacienda </span>(or <span
 style="font-style: italic;">fazenda</span>, in Portuguese), raising
  cattle and a diversity of crops for local use or sale; and 
</li>
  <li>the plantation, raising a single exportable crop.  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Initially, Indians were given as
slaves to the landholders. Later, the "freed" natives were tied to the
landowners through debts brought on by a subsistence wage system. The
shortage of good land off the estate made it easy for the landlord to
attract or coerce labor onto his estate.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This pattern continues today with an
underclass largely descended from the Indian and African slaves, along
with other dispossessed groups. The haciendas and plantations are noted
for their inefficient husbandry. Landowners face few social or economic
pressures to become good managers, and often live in the cities leaving
the estates to be run by overseers</span>. Consequently, the landowners
often do not make large profits, but that is not their objective. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Their primary concern is the
maintenance of the two paramount features of the status quo, which go
hand in hand.</span><ul>
  <li>First, labor is very cheap, because workers have no alternative
place to employ themselves, even though massive tracts of good land are
held nearly idle by the land barons.  </li>
  <li>Second, the cost of holding on to huge estates -- i.e., the taxes
charged by the public for the privilege of retaining possession -- are
low or effectively nonexistent.  </li>
</ul>
Strong incentives for good stewardship are as absent as the landlords.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There is also little incentive to
productivity; most of the population has no share in the fruits of the
land or the profits of the estates. </span>The colonial system of land
tenure discourages the creation of capital, with most of the surplus
from the land going to purchase luxury goods that are produced at the
expense of more useful manufacture or more often are imported, thereby
straining the country's balance of payments. The situation in the
cities is no better for the poor. who are drawn there by word of mouth,
radio, television and films that present the cities as if they are the
Promised Land. Of course, the image is false. So many landless folk
seeking employment in the cities have turned them into places of great
degradation. Urban land monopoly and speculation create tremendous
housing difficulties for the poor. For example, in 1950, 36% of
Brazil's people lived in cities, in 1988, 75% do so. Thus, the city of
Sao Paulo has grown from ca. 2.2 million in 1950 to ca. 17 million in
less than forty years. Of these, we are told that one third are <span
 style="font-style: italic;">favelados</span>, landless urban
squatters, and over 2.5 million are street children.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Indeed, the primary purpose of holding
vast amounts of land, as Andre Gunder Frank writes in </span><span

Land and the Promise of Land Reform</span><br>
<br>
The underclasses in Latin America envision something better for
themselves and their children. As a consequence, many Latin American
countries have attempted to institute some type of land reform. Since
the structures of oppression were not developed autonomously, many of
the reforms were aimed at foreign exploitation. Examples include the
nationalization of the oil fields in Chile in 1923, in Argentina in
1924, in Mexico in 1938, in Brazil in 1950, and in Peru in 1969.
Sometimes, however, the nationalization has targeted advantaged groups
within the country, such as that of Bolivia's tin industry in 1952,
when more than half the industry was owned by the Pati&ntilde;o family.
(This, interestingly, follows the colonial practice of reserving gold
and silver for the king, and is more characteristic of Latin America
than of the former English colonies, the United States.) Outside of
legislating control over mineral and gas resources, however, there have
been relatively few real attempts at rural agrarian land reform, and
virtually none at urban land reform.<br>
<br>
Mexico attempted land reform in the mid-1800s after expropriating the
Church's estates, and in 1917 after the revolution that toppled the
Diaz oligarchy. Before the revolution began in 1911, two-tenths of one
per cent of the population owned estates, and 88.4% were landless
laborers. The goal of the Mexican constitution of 1917 was to
redistribute some of the land among the peasants, directly in small
holdings, and as grants called <span style="font-style: italic;">ejidos
</span>to communities. The latter allowed individuals the right to
cultivate plots of community land without buying or renting them. It
seemed like a good idea, but there was not enough land to give small
holdings to all the landless laborers. Over a quarter of the national
territory (more than 55 million hectares) was expropriated and
redivided between 1924 and 1970. But with the withdrawal of state
support in the form of credit, water resources, transportation and
marketing advantages, and technical assistance, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ejidos </span>could not compete
successfully with private farms. Other land redistribution attempts
have occurred in other Latin American countries, such as Bolivia, Peru,
and Cuba, with similar mixed results.<br>
<br>
Latin America's most promising approach to land reform was the "Law of
Emphyteusis" adopted in 1826 under the influence of Argentina's
founding president, Bernardino Rivadavia. Emphyteusis, in ancient Roman
law, denoted a perpetual lease of lands and tenements in consideration
of annual rent and of improvements. Its enactment quickly resulted in
new settlements, new employment opportunities, and the cultivation of
hitherto neglected lands. A series of decrees was promulgated to
correct administrative defects, but before they became operative,
Rivadavia resigned. His bitter opponent, Colonel Dorrengo, proceeded to
emasculate the program, a process completed by dictator Juan Manuel de
Rosas, who conferred huge land grants upon himself and his minions,
eliminating almost wholly the public collection of ground rent. The
inland provinces became practically depopulated, and the Emphyteutic
Law was finally repealed in 1857.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Effective land reform in Latin
America, as elsewhere, has scarcely taken place.</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">One of the major obstacles is
that many governments are run or controlled by a powerful elite that
owns the most valuable land, and often retards and corrupts the reform
process.</span>  </li>
  <li>Foreign enterprises also fight the reforms by threatening to
withdraw their investments.  </li>
  <li>They are aided by fiscally conservative politicians who argue
that stability is necessary for economic development, even at the
expense of ignoring the exploitation of the poor, who are poorly
represented in the political process.  </li>
  <li>And the few that have been enacted have been plagued by a host of
problems, and often merely reposition the former landowners, thanks to
compensation for expropriated lands, as the new monopolists of trade
and money lending, able to renew their exploitation of the poor.  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Turning to their religious heritage
for answers to severe injustice and suffering due to land monopoly
seems natural to liberation theologians and their followers. In the
Bible, the Promised Land is characterized by the "eminent domain" of
God. The abundance of the land comes with the recognition that the
earth is the Lord's. Otherwise, we continue in the Wasteland. </span><br>

Wasteland: The Just Society vs. Baal Worship</span><br>
<br>
Fertile ground for the emergence of liberation theology was provided by
the clash of views over the role of politics in the Latin American
Church in the first half of this century. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One problem encountered was how to
acknowledge God's sovereignty in history when the everyday world was
structured in ways that seemed to deny it. </span><ul>
  <li>Where could one find a divine presence in a civilization that, in
so many ways, seemed so uncivilized?  </li>
  <li>And was it up to individuals or governments to establish a reign
of righteousness?</li>
</ul>
Leonardo Boff points to three models of the Church that have impacted
on the liberation dialogue in Latin America. 
<ul>
  <li>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"the Church as City of
God"</span> holds that politics and government are essentially outside
the realm of religion, which is for individual salvation.  </li>
  <li>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"The Church as </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Mater et Magistra</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">" </span>sees the Church as educating and
persuading political leaders to work for social betterment.  </li>
  <li>Third, <span style="font-weight: bold;">"The Church as Sacrament
of Salvation" </span>has the religious community opening itself to the
world and actively collaborating with the state in uplifting the
members of society.</li>
</ul>
Finding all three historical models of the Church wanting, Boff
suggests a fourth, drawn from his experiences in the Brazilian basic
ecclesial communities. This model, which can be called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"The Church of People-hood and Justice for
All",</span> would be much more participatory, avoiding centralization
and domination. Being democratic, it would emphasize the community more
than the individual. Behind Boff's model is liberation theology's
concern for the loss of "people-hood" in Latin America and in much of
the world.<br>
<br>
The new wave of Latin American theologians couple their critique of
"individual Christianity" with an affirmation of the broader concept of
being a "people of God." In the Bible, we are reminded, God has a
chosen people. He loves the poor, oppressed, and landless -- as a
group. He hates he oppressors -- as a group. It is the people who leave
the Wasteland and enter the Promised Land. And although the generations
had passed away, their children and grandchildren repeated the history
of Egyptian oppression and God's salvation in the first person: "And
the Egyptians treated us harshly, and afflicted us, and laid upon us
hard bondage. Then we cried to the Lord... and the Lord brought us out
of Egypt with a mighty hand." (Deut. 26:5-10)<br>
<br>
The Judeo-Christian meaning of liberation is clarified by some
attention to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Baal</span>, the most
active "foreign god" of the Canaanite pantheon. To the Canaanites,
fertility depended upon sexual union between Baal and his sister and
consort, Anath. Baal worship consisted in reenacting the mating of the
gods in orgiastic rites with temple prostitutes.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Beyond maintaining natural fertility and
harmony, Baal religion was used by the aristocracy to uphold the social
order. Canaanite tenants worked as dispossessed farmers on estates
owned by magnates, the temple, and the king. They worshiped the
landowners, the baals, who held dominion over both the land and the
peasants themselves. </span>Old Testament exhortations against Baalism
emphasize <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the proper way to
worship Yahweh: by acting with mercy and justice towards one's fellow
humans.</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Because justice does not prevail when
some, like the baals, claim the land and its bounty while others are
excluded from these privileges, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Hosea </span>denounces Israel for
betraying its covenant to recognize God as the true owner of the earth.</span>
And <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Amos</span>,
referring to the greed for possessing the land and its fruits, said God
is angered by those "who trample upon the needy, and bring the poor of
the land to an end" (Amos 8:4).<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> Amos'
indictment of Israel mentions oppression of the poor and cultic
prostitution as if they were one (Amos 2:6-8). This seems strange until
one recognizes that the link between these two sins is a wrongful
concept of land ownership.</span> Recall that Baal-worship and its
sexual rites glorified inequitable land possession and control. In the
Prophets, the role of land is crucial in the divine providential
scheme, and the flouting of just principles of land possession has
grave consequences. Human beings are caretakers, not the owners, of
God's creation.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Amos and Hosea underscored that being
a caretaker of the earth, while defining people's relationship to the
land, also defined people's relationship to one another. Being a
caretaker meant loving justice and doing mercy, letting go of selfish
possession and the desire for power over others by usurping their means
of livelihood, and instead becoming, like God, compassionate. Consider
what a revolutionary break this represents from Baal worship, which
idolized control of the soil and deified the landowners!</span><br

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="5._Poverty_in_the_Wasteland:_The"></a>5. Poverty in the
Wasteland: The Preferential Option for the Poor</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Jesus
expressed the contrast between ownership and stewardship in the pithy
saying: "You cannot serve God and mammon" </span>(Matt. 6:24; Luke
16:13). Again we see the real sting of Baal worship. Possessions,
understood apart from their Creator and their usefulness to man, become
"master." They become idols that dehumanize and kill. Stewardship never
entails the passive acceptance of social mores that allow possessions
to become masters (Luke 16:1-13). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus,
being a caretaker of God's land means having a different view of
reality than is prevalent in a world ruled by possessions.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Jesus opens his ministry by claiming
as real what Isaiah had hoped for: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent
me to proclaim release of captives and... to set at liberty those who
are oppressed"</span> (Luke 4:18).<br>
<br>
Society turned upside down is the topic of Jesus's keynote address in
Luke: the poor and hungry can be happy because they will no longer be
poor and hungry. But Jesus does not stop at this announcement, he goes
on to call people to stewardship. He asks men and women to love their
enemies and to be merciful as God is merciful (Luke 6:27-49). He urges
them to do no less than act as a community where God, not mammon,
rules. These are radical demands.<br>
<br>
Latin American liberation theologians point out that, according to the
Exodus story and to Luke's gospel in particular, God's chosen people
are the refuse of society. The reversal -- the reordering of those who
are on top -- is good news to the poor! The recipients of God's grace,
however, are not always poor, oppressed, or helpless. The patriarchs,
the judges, the Roman centurions, and many others blessed by God
certainly were not. Why did God act on their behalf as well? God is
faithful, and acts favorably for those who respond to him with faith,
as Paul points out (Rom. 1:16).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The church's "preferential option for
the poor" must be seen as an application of the injunction to do
justice and love mercy.</span> As Gustavo Gutierrez has always
insisted, we must maintain "both the universality of God's love and
God's predilection for those on the lowest rung of the ladder of
history. To focus exclusively on the one or the other is to mutilate
the Christian message."<br>
<br>
Liberation theologians and other social reformers often fall into the
trap of romanticizing the poor, as did Nicolas Berdyaev in his early
demi-Marxist days: I then thought that the proletariat, as a working
and class-conscious group, exploited but at the same time free from the
sin of exploitation, possessed the psychological structure that is
favorable to the revelation of the truth...<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The temptation here is to think of
God's bias for the poor in terms of a higher spirituality brought about
by poverty. Yet involuntary poverty is scarcely any guarantee of faith.
If it were, its promotion ought to be a primary mission of evangelism,
and the exploitation of the disadvantaged a cause to make the Church
rejoice. The biblical bias is rather to be traced back to the nature of
God himself.</span><br>
<br>
God, finally, is the one who rejects power and takes upon himself, in
the person of his son, the ultimate sacrifice in solidarity with all
who are crucified by the power structures of this world. God not only
has compassion for the poor, he becomes, like them, weak. God not only
reverses society, he appears on the cross as a manifestation of this
reversal. He appears, Paul wrote so vividly, as foolishness, a
stumbling block, weakness, and uses "what is low and despised in the
world... to bring to nothing things that are" (Cor. 1:18-31). God
becomes weak in order to become one with his people. He wishes to be
worshipped genuinely for the sake of his loving essence, not falsely
for the sake of attributes which compel, out of fear, a counterfeit of
worship. Thus Christ, in Dostoyevsky's powerful symbolism, spurns the
Devil's temptation to make use of miracle, mystery, and authority,
inviting instead a faith that finds in Truth and Goodness their own
intrinsic validation. It is in this sense that Jesus said, "My kingdom
is not of this world" (John 18:36), for in this world predatory power
assails the innocent and must be contained and curbed by power
harnessed to their defense.<br>
<br>
"I have overcome the world" (John 16:33) may be interpreted to mean
that Truth and Goodness are triumphant simply because of what they are
and that nothing external can affect them. But human life and freedom
cannot be made to depend entirely upon the spiritual condition of other
men, society and its rulers. The rights of the individual must be
safeguarded in case that spiritual condition proves to be a low one or
not sufficiently enlightened by grace. As Nicholas Berdyaev put it, "A
society that chose to be based solely upon grace and declined to have
any law would be a despotic society.... It is impossible to wait for a
gracious regeneration of society to make human life bearable."<br>
<br>
As a citizen of the spiritual order, the Christian lives under grace --
and is not restrained by power or authority. But in this life he or she
is also, inescapably, a citizen of the secular order, where power must
be checked by power and political means employed to serve the ends of
grace, moving the world closer to a likeness of the Promised Land.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="6._Suffering_in_the_Wasteland:"></a>6. Suffering in the
Wasteland: Independence -- or In Dependency?</span><br>
<br>
The Wasteland is a disturbing transition zone between Egypt and the
Promised Land, between bondage and liberation. So Latin American today,
in its second century after independence, finds itself in a wilderness
between colonial subjugation and genuine self-determination.<br>
<br>
Liberation theologians point to institutional evil, rather than
individual evil, as the major factor keeping the poor trapped in the
Wasteland. They shift the critical focus from problems caused by evil
leaders to the oppression caused by large impersonal forces. And they
further point out that these forces are not to be found solely in
developing nations. (For example, in most societies, even developed
ones, male-dominated social structures dehumanize women.) They remind
us how a military-industrial complex, multinational corporations,
government bureaucracies, giant banking centers, or other powerful
institutions or organizations may depersonalize citizens, depriving
them of effective control over their own lives.<br>
<br>
The 1950s was an optimistic decade of developmentalism. But by 1967,
Pope Paul VI questioned this optimism in his encyclical, Populorum
Progressio. He saw rich nations developing quickly while poor nations
developed slowly. He saw discord between people and nations arising
from glaring worldwide inequalities of power and possessions. These
conflicts arose in part, the Pope said, from too narrowly conceiving
development as limited to economic growth. He called for broadening the
goal to promote the good of every person, with emphasis on the whole
person.<br>
<br>
While in parts vague and offering no radical solutions, the Pope's
encyclical nevertheless dramatized how poor nations may be held captive
by economic dependence on rich ones, and served to correct a popular
belief that economic growth alone is sufficient for progress.<br>
<br>
Four years later, Gustavo Gutierrez raised a more substantive critique
of developmentalism in his epochal work, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">A Theology of Liberation</span>. As
he saw it, underdevelopment, instead of being a step on the way to
progress, is really the historical end-product of the economic
expansion of the great capitalist countries. The amount of fat of
wealthy nations is directly related to the amount of hunger of poor
nations. Thus the first step toward liberation must be to sever the
bondage of dependence. Gutierrez did not purport to be stating anything
original, but simply advanced, in a theological context, ideas drawn
from Andre Gunder Frank, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and other secular
Latin American social scientists who had produced various systems of
dependency theory, based, in some cases, on Lenin's doctrine of
imperialism.<br>
<br>
It would be fatuous to deny that some of Latin America's poverty is
traceable historically to the operations of First World companies and
to the intervention of First World governments, as dependency theory
holds. Due to the influence of Gutierrez and later Boff and others,
dependency theory became a cardinal tenet of liberation theology.
However, the theory is now recognized by Boff and Gutierrez as being of
questionable value as a key to the solution or even diagnosis.
Gutierrez now writes that the theory "does not take sufficient account
of the internal dynamics of each country or of the vast dimensions of
the world of the poor."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The existence of dependence does not
automatically justify the charge that it stems from exploitation. </span>This
charge assumes a zero-sum situation where one region can increase its
wealth only at the expense of other regions, which is to overlook the
evidence that the world's wealth is not static but constantly being
magnified by human enterprise. Economically, Canada is heavily
dependent upon U.S. trade and investment, yet its standard of living is
among the highest on earth -- due, in no small measure, to precisely
that trade and investment. Albania, by contrast, was until recently the
least dependent of all nations; under Enver Hoxha it followed a policy
of almost total isolation, and neither traded nor maintained diplomatic
relations even with other Marxist states. Yet its standard of living
was the lowest in Europe -- due, in no small measure, to precisely that
policy.<br>
<br>
Insofar as dependency theory is (in a limited sense) analytically
correct, the social ills to which it calls attention could be
substantially dispelled by the proper allocation to the public of land
and land value, or rent. Instead, most of the land rent is
misappropriated by foreign corporations or domestic land-owning
oligarchies. We will return to this very important point in Chapter 8.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="7._Detours_in_the_Wasteland:_Marxism_and"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">7. Detours in the Wasteland: Marxism and
Liberation</span><br>
<br>
Liberation theologians have been influenced, in varying degrees, by
aspects of Marxism such as some versions of dependency theory and the
concepts of alienation, surplus value, class struggle,and socialism.
But they have not been slavish devotees of Marx, nor have they ignored
other significant secular movements such as Freudianism,
existentialism, and phenomenology. Still, although it is now being used
with increasing reservation, Marxism still retains a measure of
vitality in liberationist thinking, and the influence of Marxism has
distorted the socioeconomic outlook of liberation theology.<br>
<br>
Alienation is a concept co-opted by the youthful Marx from Hegelian
idealism. In Marx's view, alienation refers to how we are separated and
misled by the projections of human experience in both abstract thought
and social institutions. This is a harmful separation that divides a
person within as well as from others, undermining a sense of being
truly whole and "at home."<br>
<br>
Marx found the source of alienation in the exchange relationship in
general, and the wage relationship in particular. Under this system, a
person sees work and its products as external to him or herself, a
means to satisfying other ends, and work relationships (bosses,
employees, co-workers, etc) also as means to other ends. No longer
protected by patriarchal associations, feudal bonds, religious
sanctions, etc., the worker is thrown into the "cash-nexus" of
capitalism and confronts directly the impersonal market, which faces
him as a tyrant and an anarchic force that neither employees nor
employers are able to predict, control, or understand.<br>
<br>
According to Marx, capitalist alienation is not a matter of the
division of labor per se (since this is a universal feature of all
economies) but "the enslaving subordination of the individual to the
division of labour" which reduces the person to a functional cog in the
machine.<br>
<br>
Liberation theologians have linked the conquest of alienation with the
abolition of the profit system, leading to the emergence of what
Gutierrez calls the "new man" -- free, unselfish, creative, socially
responsible -- the shaper of his own destiny. "Our revolution,"
proclaims Jose Porfirio Miranda, "is directed toward the creation of
the new human being." The liberationists' most massive systematic
effort, a five-volume work by Juan Luis Segundo, is entitled Theology
for Artisans of a New Humanity. All this accords with the Marxist view
that human nature is plastic and can be transformed by structurally
altering material relationships. But it does not accord with the
traditional Christian acknowledgment that human nature is sinful and
can be transformed only through the operation of divine grace in human
hearts.<br>
<br>
For Marx, since commodity production is most developed under
capitalism, so too is alienation and exploitation. This exploitation is
hidden by "the fetishism of commodities" -- the social relations
between labor products mediated by money. The measure of exploitation,
for Marx, is found in the difference between the value of labor (wages
paid) and the value of the commodities sold. This difference, realized
as profit by the capitalist, Marx called "surplus value". Capital
itself is nothing but stored-up labor, Marx wrote, deserving no further
return (i.e., interest), and sterile without the application of current
labor. It creates no value but simply absorbs it. New value is produced
by current labor, but the worker is nominally paid no more than the
value of the necessaries of life habitually required by the average
laborer. Surplus value, the difference between this and the market
value of his product, thus constitutes "stolen wages."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Marx's fallacy is his failure to
recognize that capital tremendously enhances the value-producing power
of current labor, without which current labor would be very nearly
sterile. If people had not stored up labor by refraining from immediate
gratification, and instead using and often risking their wages to
increase wealth, capital would not exist.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Initially, stored-up labor is the only source of capital; later, the
rent of land can be converted into capital. But Marx viewed capital
even in its initial formation as the expropriated product of the labor
of others. To the extent that he was partially correct in this, the
expropriation, as he himself indicates, must be laid mainly at the door
of the landowner.<br>
<br>
Marx's dialectical materialism holds that social classes are determined
by historical development of various modes of production, and that
class struggle must inevitably lead to a dictatorship of the
proletariat, a transition on the way to the abolition of all classes
and the emergence of the classless society. Yet in Latin America, the
proletariat -- Marx's industrial wage-workers -- constitute the top
quarter of income earners. The truly marginalized are the tenant
farmers and other agricultural workers along with the jobless or
underemployed urban slum-dwellers. But Marx considered the agricultural
workers of his day to be hopelessly reactionary, and the urban
lumpenproletariat to be hopelessly degraded into beggars, criminals,
and "scabs."<br>
<br>
Liberation theology, however, borrows from Marx to suit its own vision.
Substituting the poor for the proletariat, liberationists hold that
theology must grow out of the revolutionary practices of the
marginalized and exploited masses. But, the poor exhibit the same range
of tendencies as other classes, from the virtuous to the vicious, a
fact which complicates liberationist claims that the poor are special
repositories of the truth.<br>
<br>
In spite of the recent collapse of socialist states, socialism, or a
perception of it, still has a strong hold on many who are trying to
overcome economic oppression. Marx was vague as to the structure of a
post-revolutionary society. Describing the aims of the Paris Commune of
1871, Marx wrote, "It wanted to make individual property a truth by
transforming the means of production, land and capital, now chiefly the
means of enslaving and exploiting labor, into mere instruments of free
and associated labor," and, he declared, "this is Communism." This
sounds surprisingly consistent with a free market and with the goals of
genuine land reform, but it is far from consistent with what he really
meant by communism: the total abolition of the market.<br>
<br>
What is supposed to happen after the inevitable overthrow of
capitalism? Production will be for use and not for profit, but at first
the products will be distributed (by means of noncirculating labor
certificates) in terms of the amount of socially useful labor each
individual performs. In the "higher phase" of communist society,
distribution will be according to the formula "From each according to
his ability, to each according to his needs."<br>
<br>
Marx gave little more detail beyond these hints of labor certificates
and central planning. What are the criteria planners would use in
allocating both material resources and labor (human beings)? And how
would this process not contradict Marx's vision of freedom to shift
from one occupation to another at will, even several times a day? And
what is to prevent the initial dictatorship from becoming a
self-perpetuating oligarchy?<br>
<br>
Liberationists ignore the history of state socialism, which has time
and again introduced capitalist "impurities" to correct its dismal
performance -- beginning as far back as Lenin's "New Economic Policy."
These measures have been necessary because socialism's view of human
nature as either naturally noble or almost totally malleable is
fallacious. While many do respond unselfishly and heroically in crises
such as war and natural disaster, such behavior cannot be sustained in
a large-scale way as a regular day-to-day routine. Insofar as
populations can be conditioned to behave selflessly, they are also
reduced to regiments of biped ants.<br>
<br>
An economic system is best founded on the assumption that people are
basically self-centered. And the art of government, Archbishop Temple
observed,"is the art of so ordering life that self-interest prompts
what justice demands."<br>
<br>
The critique made here owes a lot to the work of Michael Novak,
particularly his book <span style="font-style: italic;">Will It
Liberate?</span> But while Novak takes liberation theology seriously
and seeks genuine dialogue, he is disappointing, not so much in what he
says as in what he fails to say. (This may be why he is perceived by
many liberationists as an apologist for North American capitalism.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">While he speaks of the need to use the
taxing power in Latin America to promote and maximize economic
creativity rather than repress it, nowhere does Novak offer a model of
such enlightened tax policy -- and nowhere does he advance any concrete
suggestions as to how to address the land question. Yet the two, tax
reform and land reform, are indeed intimately connected; true
liberation demands both.</span><br>

Many liberation theologists ignore the role of land ownership and do
not even include land in the indexes of their books. Yet none would
deny that land hoarding and land access are fundamental issues of
justice and economic development.<br>
<br>
The following two passages by Henry George, the economist who made the
most definitive statements on land's role in political economy,
illustrate the fundamental characteristics of land that are missed or
ignored by modern economic analysts of the left and the right:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Does
the passenger who enters a railroad car obtain the right to scatter his
baggage over all the seats and compel the passengers who come in after
him to stand up? ... We arrive and we depart... passengers from station
to station, on an orb that whirls through space -- our rights to take
and possess cannot be exclusive; they must be bounded everywhere by the
equal rights of others. Just as the passenger in a railroad car may
spread himself and his baggage over as many seats as he pleases, until
other passengers come in, so may a settler take as much land as he
chooses, until it is needed by others -- a fact which is shown by the
land acquiring a value....</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">On the land we are born, from it we
live, to it we return again -- children of the soil as truly as is the
blade of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that
belongs to the land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material
progress cannot rid us of our dependence upon land.</span></div>
<br>
Beneath all ideologies, there are basic factors and relationships that
underlie economic behavior. To understand the (otherwise inexplicable)
omission of attention to land's economic importance, it is useful to go
back to these basics.
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The term "<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Land</span>" refers to the whole
material universe, exclusive of people and their products. </span>Not
the creation of human labor, yet essential to labor, it is the raw
material from which all wealth is fashioned. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It includes not only soil and minerals, but
water, air, natural vegetation and wildlife, and all natural
opportunities -- even those yet to be discovered.</span> It is a
passive factor of production, yielding wealth only when labor is
applied to it.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Labor
    </span>includes all human powers, mental and physical, used
directly or indirectly to produce goods or to render service in
exchange. Labor is often thought of as work that is done for hire, at
fixed wages, mainly excluded from the risk-taking and decision-making
that is normally classed under the heading of "entrepreneurship". Yet
labor, properly understood, includes all human exertion in production
-- including mental exertion. The payment to labor is called <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Wages</span>. And
it is important to remember that the payment, or return, to labor does
not include any returns that are the result of monopoly.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Capital
    </span>is the economic term that is most profoundly misunderstood
and confused. For the term to make sense in any systematic analysis of
wealth distribution, we must define capital in its classical sense as
"wealth which is used to aid in further production, instead of being
directly consumed." Since production is not completed until the product
is in the hands of the consumer, products on their way to market, or
"wealth in the course of exchange," are also considered capital.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, the objective of all economic
behavior is the satisfaction of human desires. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Human beings always seek to
satisfy their desires with the least exertion</span>: this self-evident
proposition lies at the heart of our concepts of economic value and
exchange. </span>The primary thing needed for satisfaction is, of
course, the tangible things, made from natural resources, that satisfy
human desires and have exchange value. Things that meet these four
fundamental criteria are termed "wealth". But money, bonds, and
mortgages are but claims upon and measures of this value; they are not
the wealth they symbolize.<br>
<br>
A clear understanding of these basic definitions points immediately to
the primacy of land as an economic factor. Human beings have
inescapable material needs of food, clothing and shelter. Regardless of
how long a chain of exchanges they may pass through in a modern
economy, these things ultimately have their source in the land; they
can come from nowhere else. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Human
beings need land in order to live. But if we must pay rent to a private
land "owner" for access to the gifts of nature, it amounts to being
charged a fee for our very right to live.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Land's value goes up when population
increases and technological and economic development make labor more
productive. Those who "own" land often withhold it from use, expecting
to capture its increased value in the future -- thus, the possession of
land enables people to take an income that they did nothing to produce.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Speculative withholding of land
has disastrous consequences. Peasants who seek land on which to survive
are pushed out to poorer and poorer lands.</span> These "sub-marginal"
lands become their alternative place for self-employment. With such a
poor alternative, they have no choice but to accept very low wages.
Rent -- the payment to landowners -- absorbs more of the wealth
produced on all sites.</span><br>
<br>
Land speculation also prevents development near the center of cities,
pushing it to the outskirts while the center decays from neglect and
slums increase. The "<span style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl</span>"
engulfs farms and forests, even as it raises the price of land, making
use and development more costly.<br>
<br>
Rapid destruction of the Amazon rain forest in Brazil dramatizes how
the unnatural phenomenon of sprawl has an ominous worldwide impact on
the environment. In Brazil, ten per cent of the landowners own 80
percent of the land, while one million peasants are forced off the land
each year. And a mere one per cent controls 48 percent of the
cultivable land. The only place in Brazil where there is land for the
taking is in the Amazon rain forest. The destruction of the rain forest
is caused by a system that perpetuates artificial land shortages.
Nearly four-fifths of Brazil's arable land is covered by sprawling
latifundios, most of which are held by speculators who produce nothing.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Here is the root cause of poverty.
When laborers are faced with the choice of either bare subsistence
wages or land that can barely maintain life, labor itself is
marginalized and cannot effectively bargain on its own behalf. Wages,
generally, on all land, are driven down toward the point of bare
subsistence. Returns to capital are also depressed for the same reason,
deterring investment. When this is carried to an extreme -- when people
can no longer afford the goods being produced and when there is little
profit in applying capital -- the economy collapses. The inflated land
market, on which the speculative frenzy has fed, collapses too.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Since the Great Depression, such total ruin has been minimized in more
developed nations through Keynesian measures: monetary expansion,
massive public works and welfare programs. In Third World countries,
such Keynesian expedients, which support high speculative rent levels,
work only if demand for exports is strong. When that demand weakens,
the weight of external debt becomes so crushing as to defy redemption.<br>
<br>
The Third World debt crisis is taken by many as the clearest sign of
the correctness of dependency theory. It is asserted that Western
moneylenders have extended loans to corrupt regimes, knowing that the
nations' peoples would have to sacrifice to bear ever-increasing
burdens. But when we recognize the land problem as the basic cause of
the kind of economic collapse that has led to the "foreign debt
crisis", it becomes clear that Western financial interests did not
create those maladies but rather exploited the hapless economic
policies of developing nations for their own gain.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some defenders of the status quo admit
that all land titles may be traced either to acts of force or fraud (or
to the more respectable-sounding "priority of occupation"). But, they
add, we cannot start over; society has for centuries given legal
sanction to private landed property. Innumerable contracts have been
executed on the basis of this sanction, and these include the good
faith purchase of land. For society to withdraw this sanction, they
claim, would be a breach of trust.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
passage of time, however, cannot turn a wrong into a right.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Kings and popes and governments
never had the moral right to vest in perpetual ownership what God
intended for the benefit of all. </span>If the acquisition of a
benefit under the law were to establish such a vested right, no law
could ever be amended, since it would invariably work to someone's
disadvantage.<br>
<br>
Obviously, change that further rends the fabric of society is usually
self-defeating. And the vast majority of beneficiaries of unjust
structures -- the beleaguered middle classes -- are not intentional
wrongdoers but passive recipients of unearned wealth from a flawed
system they did not create. The dismantling of these structures,
therefore, should, whenever possible, be done in ways that avoid
excessive hardship for them. But it must be done.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="9._Claiming_the_Promised_Land:_A_New"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">9. Claiming the Promised Land: A New
Jubilee for a New World</span><br>
<br>
In the book of Joshua, we find that although the Promised Land is a
gift from God, it is a gift that has to be claimed. Even before the
actual conquest of the Promised Land, the Mosaic Law prescribed a
method whereby possession of land was to be rendered pleasing in God's
sight. The Canaanites' claim was forfeited by their idolatry, with
human sacrifice and temple prostitution, and by their exploitive,
monopolistic social order. By contrast, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Israel, to make good its claim,
had to institute a social order that would guard against the
desecration, pollution, and injustices of which its predecessors were
guilty, and would secure to each family and to every generation within
the Hebrew commonwealth the equal right to the use of the land, of
which the Lord was recognized as the sole absolute owner.</span><br>
<br>
They began with a census of the tribes and families before the conquest
(Num. 26:1-51). Every tribe, excepting Levi, and within each tribe
every family, was to receive its proportionate share, according to size
(Num. 26:55-56), and ultimately, to ensure fairness, by lot (Num.
34:16-29). The actual distribution, according to these provisions, was
concluded at Shiloh (Josh. 19:51). <span style="font-weight: bold;">According
to ancient historian Josephus, the territory was not divided into
shares of equal size but of equal agricultural value. The landmarks
that protected these allotments were protected by the public and solemn
denunciation of a curse against anyone who should dishonestly tamper
with them</span> (Deut. 27:11-16; 19:14).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">As discovered again in our own
century, it is easier to devise a one-time fair apportionment of land
that it is to keep the system from falling apart. This is why the
ancient law established the Jubilee year. At the end of every fifty
years, any alienated lands -- given away, sold, or lost from unpaid
debts -- would be restored to the original families.</span> Temporary
possessors were to be compensated for any unexhausted improvements they
may have made on the land. Concentrated landownership, and the division
of society into landed and landless classes, was thereby prevented from
creeping into the system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
Jubilee effectively took the profit out of landholding as such, leaving
no incentive for speculation. When it was observed -- and historical
records indicate that it was observed for long periods -- the Jubilee
system successfully removed the root cause of poverty from the Jewish
society.</span><br>
<br>
The influence of the Jubilee idea upon <span style="font-weight: bold;">early
Pennsylvania colonists</span> is evidenced by the inscription on the
Liberty Bell of the biblical words enjoining the Jubilee year:
"Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants
thereof." (Lev. 25:10) The founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn,
advocated that all men be "tenants to the public", and to defray public
expenses instituted a tax on land.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Environmental concern also goes back
to biblical land laws. </span>To prevent the exhaustion of the soil, a
periodic fallow was ordered. "During one year in every seven, the soil,
left to the influences of sun and frost, wind and rain, was to be
allowed to 're-create' itself after six years' cropping, exactly as the
tiller of the soil renewed his strength, after six days' work, by his
Sabbath day's rest."<br>
<br>
As noted, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the tribe of Levi did not
share in the equal division of the land, since it was charged with
carrying out religious and public duties</span>. Its members were
entitled to an indemnity from the eleven tribes who received the land
that otherwise would have gone to them. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This indemnity was the tithe -- one-tenth
of the product from the land occupied by the eleven other tribes.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Here, in principle, is the formula for
a just land system in almost any time or place. The compensation to the
Levites maintained the substance of equal rights to land, alongside of
and compatible with unequal physical division of the land itself.</span>
As Frederick Verinder pointed out in his book <span
 style="font-style: italic;">My Neighbour's Landmark</span>, joint
heirs of a house may share it equally by occupying it equally or
unequally but "paying the rental into a common fund, from which each
draws an equal share; or they may let the whole house to someone else
and divide the rent equally."<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> So it is with
land. Sharing equally in the economic rent or value of land through the
application of that value to common uses from which all benefit,
renders private ownership and unequal partition of land morally and
pragmatically benign.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The modern equivalent of removing
one's neighbor's landmark is thus not the private ownership of land per
se, but rather the private appropriation of land value.</span> "The
profit of the earth is for all" (Eccles. 5:9). The Old Testament ethic,
to assure everyone the same natural opportunity, asserts that all
people have an equal right to economic rent, and the Levite tithe
demonstrates that the socialization of rent offsets the ethical and
practical harm resulting from private land ownership. But there is
another basis for its advocacy: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent
should be taken by society because it is a social product. Rent arises
in large measure from two societal phenomena: the mere presence of
population, and community activity in a particular area. </span>More
people means more demand for space on which to live and work. Community
activities such as roads, schools, protection, parks, sewage, utilities
and other public services, as well as the totality of private
commercial and cultural operations, all make land more productive or
desirable. It follows that a community which funds such improvements
out of its rent fund will be provided with a stable and growing fund
with which to maintain and improve them. And unlike conventional taxes,
the collection of this fund will enhance, not penalize, the production
of wealth.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Individuals, in their bare capacity as
landowners, do nothing to produce land value. By withholding sites from
use, whether for speculation or for other reasons, they may generate
scarcity, artificially inflating rent, but this does not reflect any
positive contribution to production on the part of landowners.</span><br>
<br>
While land value is not the only type of unearned increment, unearned
income resulting from such advantages as talent, genes or luck is not
at the expense of others. Even Karl Marx admitted: "The monopoly of
property in land is even the basis of the monopoly of capital." Marx
could have -- but did not -- champion the abolition of land monopoly;
instead he advocated its transfer from private into state hands. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It was left to Henry George to expound how
the universal principles of justice found in the Mosaic model could be
applied to the modern age in all its economic aspects -- rural and
urban, agricultural and industrial, technologically undeveloped or
advanced.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What George advocated was to leave
land titles in private hands but to appropriate land rent via the
existing machinery of property taxation. "I do not propose either to
purchase or to confiscate private property in land. The first would be
unjust; the second, needless....It is not necessary to confiscate land;
it is only necessary to confiscate rent." No owner or tenant would be
expropriated or evicted. No limit would be placed on the quantity of
land one could hold, as long as the annual rent were paid.</span><br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coordinately with the capture
of rent as public revenue, taxes on products of human labor --
improvements, personal property, services, commodities, wages, etc. --
would be reduced and ultimately eliminated.<br>
<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span><br>
George considered his remedy no mere human contrivance. He saw the
growth of land value and the easy means of equitably distributing it as
an expression of benevolent supernatural design: "As civilization goes
on... so do the common wants increase and so does the necessity for
public revenue arise. And so in that value which attaches to land, not
by reason of anything the individual does, but by reason of the growth
of the community, is a provision intended -- we may safely say intended
-- to meet that social want."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">George's remedy goes a long way to
stop current inequity and prevent future inequity. While past inequity,
in the form of accumulations of capital based on previous land
speculation and monopoly cannot be accurately redressed, these fortunes
can be impelled to serve the needs of the public via investment in
production, not by further investment in land speculation and monopoly.</span><br>
<br>
Dependency theory, to the degree that it hits upon one of the causes of
Third World poverty in exploitation by foreign investors, can find in
George's land value tax the constructive practical approach it lacks.
Neither erection of trade barriers nor legal restriction of foreign
ownership is called for. As one Australian writer puts it:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(W)hen
investors from one country buy property in other countries they are
seeking <span style="font-weight: bold;">site rent</span>, which they
hope to obtain directly from tenants, or indirectly by selling land in
the future when the price or capital value has increased.... The site
rent that is so attractive to overseas investors can be kept in the
country quite easily - - by shifting taxation from labor onto land."</span></div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Because George asserted, "We must make
land common property," he is sometimes erroneously regarded as an
advocate of land nationalization. But, as we have seen, he was nothing
of the sort. </span>The expropriation of land makes it practically
impossible to fairly compensate people for the improvements to land,
which are their legitimate property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">George's system
renders to the community what is due to the community, without doing
any violence to the wealth that has been fairly earned by productive
workers.</span><br>
<br>
Common property in land is sometimes discredited by equation with what
Garrett Hardin calls "<span style="font-style: italic;">The Tragedy of
the Commons.</span>" Referring to the common lands that were a major
English institution until the mid-nineteenth century, Hardin describes
the tendency of individuals, each rationally pursuing self-interest, to
overgraze, denude, and use the commons as a cesspool. That which
belongs to everybody in this sense is, indeed, in danger of being
valued and maintained by nobody.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">enclosure movement</span>
ultimately brought an end to this ecologically destructive process, but
not without literally pushing people off the land, exacting a baneful
price in human misery that might well be termed <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">"The Tragedy of the Enclosures." </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">George hit upon a way of securing the
benefits of both commons and enclosures, while at the same time
avoiding their evils. Land value taxation rectifies distribution so
that all receive wealth in proportion to their contribution to its
production. This liberates the economic system from exploiters who
contribute little or nothing.</span> Apportioning the wealth pie fairly
increases the incentive to increase the size of the pie. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The market becomes in
practice what capitalist theory alleges it to be -- a profoundly
cooperative process of voluntary exchange of goods and services. </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Paradoxical
though it may seem, the only way the individual may be assured what
properly belongs to him or her is for society to take what properly
belongs to it: The ideal of Jeffersonian individualism requires for its
actualization the socialization of rent.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Just as Marxists err in insisting that
everything be socialized, extreme capitalists err in insisting that
everything (even public parks and forests!) be privatized. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The middle way is to recognize
society's claim to what nature and society create -- the value of land
and its rent -- so that working people, including entrepreneurs, may
claim their full share of what they create.</span> In this balanced
approach can be found the authentic verities respectively inherent in
socialism and individualism.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="10._The_Promised_Land_and_the_Kingdom_of"></a>10. The Promised
Land and the Kingdom of God</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Promised Land, like Eden, is a
place of unhindered scope in which to glorify God and manifest his
will. But it is not the Kingdom of God. It represents liberation from
external bondage -- from oppression and restricted access to material
opportunity.</span> It is the temporal matrix within which the Kingdom
may find full expression. But it is not itself the Kingdom. Although it
is a heresy that locates this Kingdom exclusively in the afterlife or
an ethereal paradise, Jesus declared it to be "not of this world" (John
18:36) but "within" (Luke 17:21). It is no reproach to Henry George
that he lost sight of this distinction between the Promised Land and
the Kingdom of God, enraptured by his vision of a just society:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With
want destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the
fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of jealousy and
fear that now array men against each other; with mental power loosed by
conditions that give to the humblest comfort and leisure; and who shall
measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? Words fail the
thought! It is the Golden Age.... It is the culmination of Christianity
-- the City of God on earth, with walls of jasper and gates of pearl!
It is the reign of the Prince of Peace!</span></div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By equalizing opportunity, political
and economic liberation tend to draw both poor and rich into the middle
class. As an expression of social justice, this constitutes a genuine
advance, ethical as well as material. But it is no easy guarantee of
spiritual gain.</span> Middle-class traits include virtues such as
industry, thrift, restraint, commercial and professional rectitude,
but, on the other hand, low prudentialism, self-satisfaction, and an
inclination to regard material well-being as a sign of righteousness.
Hence, even in the Promised Land, what Paulo Freire calls "<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">conscientization</span>"
(roughly, consciousness-raising through social commitment), emphasized
and refined by liberation theology, must continue although in a
different vein. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Kingdom of God
will flourish only when outward liberation gives rise to inward
liberation</span>, a victory over the limitations of the bourgeois
ethos.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"The Earth Is the Lord's" (Psalm
24:1). This statement tells us something about God. </span>He is
attached to the land and loves it. He is not a spiritual abstraction
oblivious to the Wasteland in which we live. God is the maker of the
world of eating and sleeping, working and begetting. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It also tells us something of our place in
this world.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">With God as the
true owner of the earth, every person has a right to the produce which
equitable usufruct yields to his or her efforts.</span><br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To
recognize that "<a href="Andelson_TEITL.html">the earth is the Lord's</a>" is to see that the same God
who established communities has also in his providence ordained for
them, through the land itself, a just source of revenue. Yet, in the
Wasteland in which we live, this revenue goes mainly into the pockets
of monopolists, while communities meet their needs by extorting
individuals the fruits of their honest toil. </span></big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If ever there were any doubt that
structural sin exists, our present system of taxation is the proof.
Everywhere we see governments penalizing individuals for their industry
and creativity, while the socially produced value of land is reaped by
speculators in exact proportion to the land which they withhold. The
greater the Wasteland, the greater the reward. Does this comport with
any divine plan, or notion of justice and human rights? Or does it not,
rather, perpetuate the Wasteland and prevent the realization of the
Promised Land?</span><br>
<br>
This not meant to suggest that land monopolists and speculators have a
corner on acquisitiveness or the "profit motive," which is a well-nigh
universal fact of human nature. As a group, they are no more sinful
than are people at large, except to the degree that they knowingly
obstruct reforms aimed at removing the basis of exploitation. Many
abide by the dictum: "If one has to live under a corrupt system, it is
better to be a beneficiary than a victim of it."<br>
<br>
But they do not have to live under a corrupt system; no one does. The
profit motive can be channeled in ways that are socially desirable as
well as in ways that are socially destructive. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Let us give testimony to our faith that the
earth is the Lord's by building a social order in which there are no
victims.</span><br>
