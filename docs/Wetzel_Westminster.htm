<p><em>This appeared on an email list I'm on, and I share it with the permission
  of the person who wrote it. The writer, Dave Wetzel, works for Transport for
  London (TfL) which coordinates the transportation system for London, England,
  and he wrote it to a correspondent in Australia.
 While I don't know quite how their conversation started, his preceding email
  said this: </em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Do you think we should all share God's earth?</p>
  <p>    Or would he want the Duke of Westminster and his ilk to grab it all?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>When his correspondent was not sure who the Duke of Westminster is,
    or where  Dave was headed with this
statement, Dave responded with this (Mayfair, Belgravia and Victoria are posh
    neighborhoods in central London):</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Eddie, you are a good Christian.
  </p>
  <p>You live in Australia on a farm and say you don't know who the Duke of Westminster
    is.</p>
  <p>Can I tell you a true story?</p>
  <p>If land is a gift of God then surely would God not want all his children to
    enjoy its benefits?</p>
  <p>On planet earth &#8212; fewer than 10% of its inhabitants own and control
    over 90% of the natural wealth. The other 90% pay them rent to use what God
    gave to
    all.</p>
  <p>My organisation, TfL, runs the Victoria Coach Station. London's terminus for
    inter-city bus journeys by coach.</p>
  <p>Who travels inter-city by coach &#8212; the poorest travellers or the rich?</p>
  <p>I'd suggest the rich fly, go by train, or go by car &#8212; it is the poorest travellers
    who go by coach.</p>
  <p>Transport for London does not own all of the coach station. One third of
    the land and the old in-bound coach shed is owned by &quot;Grosvenor
    Estates.&quot;</p>
  <p>We pay them &pound;230,000 per annum for the use of their land.</p>
  <p>But where do we get the money from?</p>
  <p>We charge the coach companies a fee for every coach that comes into the coach
    station and a part of that goes to our landlord.</p>
  <p>Where do they get the money from?</p>
  <p>They get the money from their ticket prices.</p>
  <p>So every poor traveller is contributing towards the &pound;230,000 given
    to Grosvenor Estates, which is owned by the Duke of Westminster. (His family
    name was &quot;Grosvenor&quot; until Queen Victoria elevated one &quot;Hugh
    Grosvenor&quot; to
      the peerage in 1874.) They have owned most of Mayfair,
    Belgravia and parts of Victoria for hundreds of years. </p>
  <p>So, we have the absurdity, . . . . . . . . nay the obscenity!, of the poorest
      travellers in the country, subsidising the third richest man in the country,
      to the tune of &pound;230,000 per annum! </p>
  <p>Surely, the value of this land only arises because people live and work in
    our great city?</p>
  <p>So surely it is all the people that should benefit from land wealth?</p>
  <p>We SHOULD pay rent for the land.</p>
  <p>All of the land. </p>
  <p> But <em>not</em> to the rich Duke, but to the Government, so that they can use this
    natural wealth to pay for schools and hospitals etc.</p>
  <p>And not from this one site, but from all the land in the country.</p>
  <p> AND if there is any wealth left over &#8212; and I'm sure there would be
    &#8212; the Government could return it to all of us in the form of a land
    dividend.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1677, Sir Thomas Grosvenor married 12 year old Mary Davies and heiress
      of a scrivener in the City of London, (heiress of 500 acres of rural land on
      the outskirts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London">London</a>. )</p>
  <p>As London grew, this property became the source of the family's immense wealth,
      as it was developed into the fashionable areas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfair">Mayfair</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgravia">Belgravia</a>, which
      remains the basis of the family fortune. At least 500 roads, squares and buildings
      bear their family names and titles, and the names of place and people connected
      with them, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grosvenor_Square">Grosvenor
      Square</a>, Belgrave Square, North Audley Street,
      South Audley Street, and Davies Street. This is now held by a company called
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grosvenor_Group">Grosvenor Group</a>. The family's main country seat is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton_Hall_(Cheshire)">Eaton
      Hall</a>, six miles outside
      the City of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester">Chester</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire">Cheshire</a> with a minor seat at Ely Lodge in<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Fermanagh"> County
      Fermanagh</a>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In the House of Commons other members of the Grosvenor family sat in one of
      the two seats for the City of Chester from 1715 to 1874 without a break. For
      forty-two years of this period they held both the Chester seats, while other
      members of the family often represented other constituencies.</p>
  <p>The marriage portion which the guardians of the twelve-year-old Mary Davies
      were able to offer the young Cheshire baronet Sir Thomas Grosvenor in 1677
      consisted of some five hundred acres of land, mostly meadow and pasture, a
      short distance from the western fringes of built-up London. Not all of this
      was to be available in immediate possession and the income from the land was
      at that time relatively small, but its potential for future wealth was realized
      even then. The area with which this volume is particularly concerned was only
      a part of that vast holding, approximately one hundred acres in extent and
      sometimes called in early deeds The Hundred Acres, (ref. 1) lying south of
      Oxford Street and east of Park Lane. With only minor exceptions this part of
      Mary Davies's heritage has remained virtually intact to the present day and
      forms the Grosvenor estate in Mayfair. The history of the ownership of this
      land before it came into the possession of the Grosvenor family is, however,
      best told as part of the history of the larger holding which the third baronet
      acquired on his marriage.</p>
  <p>Today the bulk of that inheritance is still, despite the sale of some of the
      less select parts, enjoyed by her descendants, and is now administered by the
      Grosvenor Estate Trustees.</p>
  <p>Born himself in 1951, the present Duke of Westminster&#8217;s company owns
      and manages 300 acres in Belgravia and Mayfair and real estate worth $1.6 billion
      worldwide, including properties in Canada, the United States and Australia,
      as well as the 225,000 acre Abbeystead grouse moor in Lancashire. The Duke&#8217;s
      family fortune was estimated at &pound;3.75 billion in the 2006 <em>London
      Sunday Times</em> Rich List. As well as homes in London, his family home is
      set in the
      beautiful Cheshire countryside in the north of England.</p>
