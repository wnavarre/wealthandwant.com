<font

<br>
<b>Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</b>
<p>YOU MAY THINK the largest category of assets in this country is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Most capital gains are land-value
gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain."
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This price appreciation is actually
a "land gain," that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</p>
<p>Of course, investing most surplus income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most new entries into the </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span style="font-weight: bold;">
or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.</p>
<p>Over the past 40 years I have specialized in the study of the
factors that raise or lower the nation's overall real estate prices
-- rising income and savings levels, shifting interest rates and the
financial sector's supply of mortgage credit, as well as changes in
the tax laws and related market-shaping rules. This work for Wall
Street banks and institutional investors was burdened by the absence
of reliable data on the value of land and buildings. The official
nationwide real estate statistics do suggest that a politically
motivated asymmetry is at work in the economy, benefitting real
estate, which I shall now attempt to identify.</p>
<p><b>Hiding the free
lunch</b></p>
<p>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</p>
<p>Chicago School economists insist that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Two appraisal
methods</b></p>
<p>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways. Both start by estimating its
market value.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">replacement </span>cost
(which usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
little land value) or their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">depreciated
    </span>value (which gives an
unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</li>
  <li><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing the land,
and treats the difference as representing the building's value. The
first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map for the
district or city. This displays fairly smooth contours for land values.
Overlays would show zoning variations. Most of the variations in
property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
in neighborhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
maximize the site's current economic value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the Fed's land-residual appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve
multiplies the building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</p>
<p>If it is agreed that any explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
<b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</p>
<p>If these two criteria are accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done.</p>
<p><b>How land gets a
negative value!</b></p>
<p>THE DRIVING FORCE behind the anomalies is the political lobbying
eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, The
Bubble.</p>
<p>For many years Federal Reserve Board in its Flow-of-Funds, Balance
Sheet of the U.S. Economy, broke down its estimates of economy-wide
real estate values between land and buildings. The problem arose when
the Fed discovered that its methodology produced nonsensical results
-- a negative value of $4 billion for all land owned by non-financial
corporations in 1993. This number resulted from imputing land values
by subtracting the estimated replacement cost of buildings from
overall property market prices. The "land residual" method left
little room for land value, as replacement values continued to rise
even when market prices were declining. In such downturns the
calculated replacement value absorbed nearly all the market value of
corporately owned real estate.</p>
<p>Increases in property values were explained as construction cost
increases, original cost times the annual rise in the Commerce
Department's construction price index, typically 3 percent. Its
tendency to rise steadily appears to explain the rise in property
values by wage inflation and rising costs of materials. On this logic
real estate prices seem merely to keep up with inflation. There is no
hint of unearned gains or a free lunch.</p>
<p>In economic downturns, however, market values for properties dip
below the estimated replacement-cost trend of their structures. The
Fed estimated that it would cost more to rebuild the corporately
owned structures than the overall market price of their properties
would justify. On the basis of this calculation land was assigned a
negative value so as to account for the excess of replacement cost
over the market price.</p>
<p>Everyone recognized the absurdity of calculations depicting all
the corporate land in America as having a negative value in 1993.
Suppose somebody same to you and said: "I'll give you $4 billion, but
there's a catch. Along with the $4 billion in cash, you will have to
accept ownership of all the land owned by every non-financial
corporation in the United States." Most people no doubt would see
that they were being given assets much more valuable than $4 billion,
and would jump at the offer. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Fed's statistic would be dismissed
as a comic exercise showing how economists tend to lapse into
otherworldly speculation. But in this case the motive is all too
worldly. Looking beneath the surface, one finds the not-so-invisible
hand of self-interest by the real estate industry and its financial
backers.</span></p>
<p>To give the Fed economists their due, they evidently came to the
conclusion that their statistics were fatally flawed. The September
1997 balance sheet estimates made a start along new lines by
including a calculation reflecting the original (historical) cost of
buildings. This gave land a positive value. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But nationwide totals
were no longer compiled. No longer was there a line labeled "land,"
nor does the Fed publish a residual number for market value less the
historical cost (or even the replacement cost) of buildings. Instead
of making better land estimates, the Fed has dropped what had become
a political and statistical hot potato. 1994 is the last year for
which it has estimated economy-wide land and building values.</span></p>
<p>This leaves in limbo the macro-economists and business analysts
whose business is to explain the <b>finance, insurance and real
estate (FIRE)</b> sector's dominant role in the economy. According to
the land-residual appraisal technique, high-rise buildings seem to
have the lowest land values. Real estate interests argue that this is
realistic, because at least in New York City the higher a building
is, the more of a subsidy its developers need, given the economics of
space involved for elevators, surrounding air space and so forth. The
land itself is assigned a negative value as a statistically balancing
residual reflecting the difference between the building's high
construction costs and its lower market value.</p>
<p>On this basis much of New York's most highly built-up land would
seem to have a negative value, including the World Trade Center even
before its Sept. 11 destruction. While a low-rise building might be
built on this site without subsidy, a skyscraper would need a
subsidy, implying a negative land value.</p>
<p><b>Where did all the
land value go?</b></p>
<p>AS REAL ESTATE AGENTS explain to prospective buyers, the three
keys are "location, location, and location." So we are brought back
to the role played by land-value gains in the strategy pursued by
investors and developers.</p>
<p>In view of real estate's dominant role in the economy, it is
ironic that no attempt has been made to provide better statistics.
<b>My research has shown that the Fed's methodology undervalues land
by as much as $4.5 trillion.</b> As matters stood in 1994, for
instance, the Fed estimated the U.S. economy to hold some $20
trillion in real assets (excluding human capital, for which no
official statistics are published). The land's value was calculated
to be $4.4 trillion, and building values $9 trillion. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">My estimates
based on historical values suggests that land rather than buildings
represents two thirds of the nation's overall real estate value -- $9
trillion, leaving building values at just half this amount.</span></p>
<p>A partial selection of real estate statistics continues to be
published. The Fed estimated that, for 1996, households and
non-profit institutions held $11.4 trillion in tangible assets.
Nearly 80 percent ($8.2 trillion) of gross household wealth took the
form of real estate (whose $3.6 trillion in mortgage debt represented
nearly two-thirds of the household sector's liabilities). Non-profits
held $0.8 trillion. Real estate also accounted for nearly half ($3.4
trillion) of the $6.9 trillion in tangible assets owned by
non-financial corporate business.</p>
<p><b>One obvious problem with the land-residual approach is that
many buildings would not be rebuilt in their existing form.
</b>Occupancy use changes over time. In Lower Manhattan and many
other inner-city areas, industrial factories, commercial loft
buildings and even office buildings on Wall Street have been
gentrified into residential properties. After New York City's near
bankruptcy in 1975 over 40,000 manufacturing spaces in Manhattan were
shifted from commercial to residential purposes. A similar conversion
of industrial structures to residential or high-density commercial
use is found in most large American cities. It is part of the
economy's de-industrialization (euphemized as "the postindustrial
economy"), as described for instance in Robert Fitch's <i>The
Assassination of New York</i>. As formerly commercial and industrial
districts have changed their character, site values have skyrocketed.
That was all part of the Regional Plan developed early in the 20th
century.</p>
<p>Many sites are worth more when they can be delivered vacant, any
buildings are torn down, so that developers can start with a bare
site. Buildings left standing are given new uses; most people would
not want to reproduce these buildings as they are. For instance,
Manhattan's highest-rent district until the World Trade Center
bombing of September 11, 2001, was Tribeca, the downtown <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">TRI</span>angle
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">BE</span>low <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">CA</span>nal Street into which
artists and other individuals
(including myself) seeking large roomy spaces at low prices moved in
the late 1980s. These buildings had lost their value after New York
City almost went bankrupt and industry began to migrate. Many
landlords simply walked away from their properties and let them
revert to the City, which auctioned them off at distress prices.</p>
<p><b>The commercial loft building in which I lived rose in price
from $40,000 in 1986 to $120,000 in 1980 and $4,000,000 in 2000.</b>
This sharp increase cannot be explainable by rising building costs.
<b>The building itself steadily deteriorated.</b> All that increased
was its site value. Today, of course, that property a block from the
World Trade Center has fallen back in price, just as many new buyers
had renovated their structures. The site's value changed without any
significant reference to construction costs. One must infer that it
is the site that determines the property's value.</p>
<p><b>A curious asymmetry</b></p>
<p>IF THE APPRAISAL controversy is framed in terms of business cycle
analysis, then the statistician finds no reasonable alternative to
seeing that when the cycle rises and falls, the difference must be in
the land, not buildings. <b>What people are buying are not
reproduction costs, whose fluctuations over the course of the credit
cycle are relatively minor. They are buying site value, which is in
limited supply, akin to a natural monopoly.</b> Most of all, real
estate investors and homeowners are buying the right to resell their
property as prices are bid up by what they expect to become an
increasingly affluent economy fuelled by an abundant supply of
mortgage credit.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The land-residual approach
appears to work as long as a fairly
constant proportion of land to buildings is maintained.</span>
Statistically, this can occur only when property prices are rising at
about the same rate as commodity prices and wages. But business
cycles snake around the economy's basic trends, rising steadily and
then plunging sharply. This fluctuation is what causes the most
serious problems for statisticians.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In a thriving real estate market
appraisers typically use a rule
of thumb in allocating resale prices as between land and buildings to
reflect their pre-existing proportions. Buildings typically are
assumed to account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of the
property's value. As a result, building values are estimated to grow
along with a property's overall sales value. </span>This appraisal
practice
is made to appear plausible as the pace of asset-price inflation
tends to go hand in hand with rising construction costs, and hence in
the theoretical replacement cost of buildings.</p>
<p>As noted, the anomaly occurs when real estate prices fall. Real
estate prices are volatile, while construction costs rarely dip more
than slightly, if at all. When real estate prices turn down, they
often plunge below the reproduction cost of buildings. Hence, the
residual ("land") rises and falls much more sharply than do building
replacement costs (which are estimated as rising at a fairly steady
pace) and overall property values.</p>
<p>The result is a curious asymmetry. Building prices seem to be
responsible for the rise in real estate prices, while land prices are
held responsible for their decline. When the fall in property values
intersects the rising reproduction-cost trend, the land residual
turns negative.</p>
<p>Because this land value often represents the owner's equity, this
decline may prompt heavily indebted owners to default on their loans
or even to walk away from their property, which reverts to the bank
or other mortgage holder. In this sense the financial system itself
is based largely on real estate, as the economy learned in the
savings and loan (S&amp;L) deposit insurance crisis of the late
1980s. Real estate prices reflect the supply of property (including a
fixed supply of land) as compared with the fluctuating supply of
mortgage credit, which tends to be a function of the economy's
overall liquidity.</p>
<p><b>Site values as the
economy's "credit sink"</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TO CLARIFY MATTERS it may help to
think of "land" in the broad
sense of comprising all elements of property value that cannot be
explained in terms of capital investment and its profits. </span>This
category includes the site's locational value. Site value is the
essence of long-term planning by real estate developers at the local
level. But an examination of the economy-wide figures shows property
prices to be determined by broad macroeconomic factors, headed by the
availability of mortgage credit. Real estate is the major recipient
of bank credit, and price waves or cycles are determined largely by
the supply of mortgage loans and their interest rates.</p>
<p>Stated the other way around, the costs of reproducing buildings
and structures are "sunk costs." Price trends are determined not by
yesterday's supply prices but by today's market demand as
supplemented by mortgage credit. If anything, buildings, plant and
equipment wear out and depreciate, but their obsolescence is offset
(and indeed, usually more than offset) by the rise in their site
value. This rise reflects the desirability of real estate as an
investment vehicle, the prime recipient of the economy's savings and
source of new credit.</p>
<p>After 1990, for instance, when commercial banks found real estate
to be largely "loaned up," they reduced the rates paid to depositors,
as they did not have an alternative use for these deposits. The
allocation of America's savings shifted away from banks and their
real estate lending to other forms of investment as depositors began
to shift their savings into money-market funds invested mainly in
bonds, and then into mutual funds invested largely in stocks. This
shift was largely responsible for the stock market's remarkable
takeoff, substantially in advance of the real estate recovery.</p>
<p>One would think that land prices would play a central role in
modern business cycle analysis, if only because a large share of
stock market value consists of corporately owned real estate. Since
the late 1940s "concealed value" in the form of properties carried at
outdated book values reflecting low acquisition prices was a major
factor behind corporate raiding, mergers and acquisitions. Aggressive
firms employed accountants to pour over the Stock Exchange's 10K
reports searching for such hidden values. But macroeconomists lacked
the statistics needed to follow how the business cycle affected land
prices, that is, the "non-building" aspect of real estate value. This
made it difficult to provide meaningful analyses of corporate net
worth and the causes of its rise and fall.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How, then, can business cycle
statistics be collected without land
values as a prime indicator?</span> After all, it is the inflation of
real
estate asset prices that provides real estate owners with the
collateral to justify further borrowing from banks to acquire yet
more property. And by the same token, falling land prices extinguish
the collateral that backs the banking system's savings, leading to
financial insolvency.</p>
<p><b>The real estate cycle is essentially a credit cycle.</b>
Traditionally, land acquisition has been the object of recycling
savings and extending new credit. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Site
values are the economy's
"credit sink" as well as its ultimate "savings sink."</span> This is
why
real estate values reflect the economy's rising and declining
financial surplus. Profits fall as business upswings approach their
crest and the economic surplus available for saving declines. A lower
volume of loanable funds means that less credit is available to real
estate developers, speculators and homebuyers, curtailing their
ability to bid up prices with borrowed funds. Borrowing to buy
buildings is discouraged by the fact that when interest rates rise,
more of the rental income must be paid to lenders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">In sum, just as real estate lending fuels
land speculation, so the
withdrawal of such credit leaves property markets to decline,
sometimes with a crash, as occurred in Japan after 1990 when its
financial bubble burst. Should this rise and fall be attributed to
buildings or to land? It seems to me that inasmuch as the price rise
and fall is homogeneous, applying to parking lots as well as to
skyscrapers, we should attribute it to land. This achieves the
logical symmetry of applying to the downturns as well as upturns in
the real estate cycle.</p>
<p>One clear sign of land-price inflation is that one category of
land rises or falls much more rapidly than others. A widening
disparity usually reflects a financial inflation. In Japan, for
instance, high rates of saving were recycled to a remarkable extent
into construction and real estate acquisition. Japanese authorities
produced detailed land-value statistics for each category of land,
showing property values during the Bubble years 1985-90 rising at an
accelerating pace until 1991, and then turning downward. The A-shaped
rise and fall was steepest for the most expensive land surrounding
the Tokyo palace, while land for single-story wooden residential
housing rose and fell least steeply. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A
land-value map placing the
highest values at the center and the lowest values in the outlying
areas would tend to reflect a land-price bubble when price ratios
steepened.</span> On the other hand, a fairly level set of land values
between the central city and its outskirts would indicate relatively
less rent of location, and hence less land-value disparities. Using
this analogy to examine New York City's midtown area, the steep
land-value curve has been fed by credit as affluent buyers sought the
most prestigious locations. Land sites have become the receptacle of
the economy's surplus savings.</p>
<p><b>Immortally aging
buildings</b></p>
<p>INCOME TAX LIABILITY may be minimized in two ways.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The most general -- and also the most economically pernicious
-- is through the tax deductibility of interest</b>. The working
assumption is that interest charges are a truly inherent business
expense, not simply the result of a business decision taken by
investors to leverage their equity. For interest to be an inherent
business expense, interest-bearing debt would have to be a factor of
production, which it is not. Properties would yield their rent
regardless of how they are financed. Investors choose to rely on debt
rather than equity financing because the tax laws favor it, thanks to
the political lobbying of <span style="font-weight: bold;">institutional
creditors ("the debt lobby")</span>. Homeowners too deduct interest
payments, which encourages borrowing.</li>
  <li><b>The second way to minimize tax liability, is to depreciation
the building, that is, annually deduct from taxable income part of the
purchase price until it's all deducted and the building is "written
off." </b>It's the most unique tax advantage enjoyed by the real estate
industry. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Investors are able
to depreciate their buildings based on their assessed acquisition
price, regardless of the actual building costs involved or the level of
economy-wide land-price inflation. </span>Investors depreciate
buildings at rising prices even when prior owners already have
depreciated these structures once or even many times. For real estate
owned by households and partnerships (the latter being the preferred
legal instrument for holding residential apartment buildings and office
buildings), the Fed has estimated much higher proportions of land to
buildings, but these estimates also overvalue buildings relative to
land. <b>Every time a property changes hands at a higher price,
building assessments are raised proportionally - and begin to be
re-depreciated for these higher valuations, regardless of how often the
buildings already have been written off! There is no limit as to how
often a building can be re-depreciated.</b> What matters is simply how
often the property changes nominal hands.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This fiscal privilege has created a
phantom real estate economy.
Buildings acquire death-defying lives, metamorphosing time and again
for the purpose of enabling their owners to avoid paying income
taxes.</span> For commercial real estate investors as a whole, the
repeated
depreciation of buildings has made commercial real estate investment
largely exempt from the income tax. Homeowners are not permitted to
charge depreciation on their own residences, but only on buildings
that they rent out.</p>
<p>The tax laws governing depreciation thus turn largely on how much
value is assigned to buildings relative to the land, which is not
depreciable. Like manufacturers, real estate owners are permitted to
count part of the revenue over and above their current expenses as a
return of their capital investment, as distinct from taxable earnings
on capital. No income taxes are levied on this part of their revenue.
That is only fair, because an investor who buys a $100 bond only pays
tax on the interest, not on the original $100 principal. Likewise,
industrialists can recover their initial investment in plant and
equipment without being taxed. Their "sunk cost" gets reimbursed, so
that they get their capital back by the time the equipment wears out
or becomes obsolete.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For real estate, however, the
economics are unique. Machinery
rarely can be re-depreciated, but this is not true of buildings as
long as they are kept in proper repair. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance and repairs
typically consume about 10 percent of the rental value.</span> For
business
owners, the explicit purpose of this expenditure is to maintain the
building's value intact, so that it can survive year after year and
avoid obsolescence while its site value rises. If a building is sold
at a higher price, its assessment usually is raised.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Suppose a
property is sold for twice the $1 million the owner paid for it. The
local appraiser is likely to say; "I see you've sold your building
for $2 million. Under my rule of thumb, I appraise the land as half
this value, and the building as half, so that gives you a $1 million
dollar building." Under this rule, the building that was formerly
priced at $500,000 can be re-depreciated at a price that builds in
this $500,000 gain. In this way a substantial portion of the rise in
site value of non-depreciable land is treated as depreciable building
value.</span></p>
<p><b>Real estate
industry's priorities</b></p>
<p>REAL ESTATE LOBBIES recognize that what is not seen is less likely
to be taxed. What is not quantified for public policy-makers to see
clearly may avoid taxes, leaving property owners with a larger
after-tax return. They prefer land-residual's capital gains
statistics at the national level, even as individual investors seek
site-value gains at the local level.</p>
<p>This explains the seeming irony that investors in an industry
dealing primarily with the development of land sites have campaigned
to minimize the statistical treatment of land. Relegating land to
merely secondary status enables the real estate industry to depict
its "capital" gains as resulting from cost inflation and hence the
reproduction costs of buildings -- whose value is allowed to be
depreciated and re-depreciated at rising values over time. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The free
lunch of land-price gains is unseen as attention is diverted from the
real estate bubble and land-price inflation to building costs. These
fiscal considerations help to explain why it has been so hard to get
Washington to produce national land value statistics.</span></p>
<p>The 2001 Nobel Prize was awarded to economists who recognized the
unevenness of market knowledge. It would seem that this asymmetry
exists especially in the real industry. Investors and developers know
that the name of the game is capital gains. They use one set of
statistics to calculate their Total Returns, but get government
statisticians and Congressional authors of the nation's tax laws.to
support a different logic for their tax returns.</p>
<p><b>Tax favoritism for real estate was defended in Congress on the
ground that it was in the public interest to provide a special
inducement to the real estate industry to build more homes and office
buildings.</b> But as Adam Smith observed, every industry represents
itself as serving the public interest. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Can one really say that
investors borrowing 70 percent of private-sector loans to ride the
wave of asset-price inflation are more in the national economic
interest than favoring direct investors to build new plant and
businesses that employ labor rather than pricing homes, office
buildings and industrial sites further and further out of reach of
those who must earn their income by increasing society's productive
powers?</span></p>

      <b>THE
FREE LUNCH: </b>
      </center>
      <b>Its cost to citizens<br>
      <br>
      </b>The recycling of savings into new mortgage lending has fueled
an economy-wide inflation of asset prices for land, homes, and
commercial properties, as well as stock market and bond prices. If what
rises in value is mainly the land site, then the property owners appear
as passive beneficiaries enjoying a free lunch. The property is their
major asset and the mortgage their major debt. While doing little to
increase the value of the building beyond having picked a good location
and making the normal maintenance, they ride the crest of asset-price
inflation of land. Indeed, take-home earnings have drifted down over
the past two decades, but house prices have soared.
      <p>These "capital gains" for households are part of the new
phenomenon that has been popularized as "labor capitalism." As Margaret
Thatcher's crowd has put it, "Sorry you've lost your job; I hope you've
made a killing on your Council House or home in the real estate
market." The free lunch.</p>
      <p>For the two-thirds of America's and Britain's populations who
are home owners, this free lunch from asset-price inflation of land has
proved to be a silver lining in the post-industrial economy. For the
remaining third of the population, however, the price of access to home
ownership is receding rapidly. Today it hardly is possible for most
renters to earn the money to acquire their own homes. The entry price
has been bid up too high by those hoping to gain from asset-price
inflation even as labor's earnings have been declining.<br>
<br>
      <b>Its cost to the
economy</b><br>
Once a building has taken all its depreciation, investors have a tax
motive to sell the property and buy another. The sales price obviously
will be higher if the new buyer can begin depreciating the building all
over again, for the property will yield more after-tax revenue. This
financial trick turns the real estate sector into a game of musical
chairs, while enabling property owners to avoid income taxation. The
end result is to free more of their cash flow to pledge to mortgage
lenders as interest, in exchange for loans to buy more and more
property that is rising in price. This is the anatomy of the dramatic
increase in land-prices, called the real estate bubble. The tragedy of
modern economies is this divergence of saving away from financing new
direct investment and employment, to inflate a financial and real
estate bubble. When the bubble bursts there will be little new tangible
wealth creation to show for it, only a wave of insolvency, bankruptcy
and foreclosures as the Western economies begin to look more like that
of Japan since its bubble burst a decade ago. America's and Europe's
largest economic expansion may similarly give way to a long depression.
Its cause will remain invisible as long as the politically powerful
real estate interests keep getting land undervalued and its income
masked as capital gains on the national income and product accounts</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>For hundreds of years property's value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunities abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></p>
<p>Whether the gains come from selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</p>
<p><b>Nationwide the capital-gains dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's
nearly complete success in escaping the tax
collector has placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.</span></b></p>
