<small><strong>Share Rent, Transform Society<br>
Jeff Smith's remarks at Who Owns America? II </strong></small><strong>
</strong>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Jeff Smith, Portland, OR, was one
of the presenters on a
panel on Property Rights on June 4, 1998, in Madison, WI. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Who
Owns America? II</span> event was cohosted by North American Program,
Land Tenure Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison and <a
 href="../themes/Lincoln.html">Lincoln
Institute of Land Policy</a>, Cambridge, Mass.&nbsp;&nbsp; University
of Wisconsin-Madison Professor Jane Larson moderated the panel, on
which Ben Brown of the John Marshall Law School and Kenneth Barden of
Dayton, OH also made presentations. </p>
If society decided to share among its members all the
annual value of society's sites and resources and air space, what
would happen?&nbsp; <br>
<br>
If someone buys a ticket to Super Bowl and decides not
to go and sells it for more than its face value, he could face the
wrath of the law. If he bought a super location and sold it for more
than he paid for it, he could become a
pillar of society. Temporary ownership for profiteering is illegal;
but if permanent ownership, it is legal. If only we had a single
standard, I think society
would change for better. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It doesn't
matter who owns what. What
matters is who gets the rent.</span> We have millions of acres of
forest we Americans own together, and we are losing rent on it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The word property cannot convey the
distinction between
rent and land. </span>Ralph Borsodi came up with an alternative, a
trust
that would claim publicly and occupy privately and use sparingly and
compensate neighborly. Share the rent with
neighbors. A word for that is <span style="font-weight: bold;">geonomics,
earth-focused economics.</span> It
hones in on all this flow of rent that is so overlooked. Shift the
focus to sharing; then owning of land loses
importance and belonging to earth regains its importance. It is a
different identity for human beings as parts of the economic
system.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The amount of <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">rent </span>has
to total some amount. If you ask
how much taxes are, you get a figure, or how much wages or interest
are, you could get a figure. No one does a good job of keeping track of
how much we spend or how much nature we
use. In some of the best estimates, Ronald Banks in England estimates
that the flow of rent is as great if not more than any of those other
flows. Assuming that is true, <span style="font-weight: bold;">if not
allowed to collect in the wrong pockets, but redirected to
everybody's pockets,</span> we can expect a solution. How would you do
it?

<ul>
  <li>You could collect it via service tax, extractive tax, user
fees; there are many different ways to collect. <br>
  </li>
  <li>You can return it to
the residents of the region, through subsidies or dividends.
Alaska has an oil dividend to citizens, and different kinds of
taxes exist everywhere. It is a matter of disbursement.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If you were to choose the Libertarian
version, and rely
on fees and dividends, you get a geobonus, an added benefit.</span> You
would quit distorting prices, you could pull government back in a
sense. Now taxes and subsidies at the margin can make
housing unaffordable to maintain, so the apartment owner lets his
apartment building become dilapidated and causes nearby owners to do
the same. He can breed a slum. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
We subsidize water and make water cheap for farmers in
Arizona to irrigate their land, and we then have taxes to pay for
environmental absurdities. Shift to fees and dividends and have prices
precise and use the weight of the market to guide
our choices toward sustainability. If we had this price leveling, we
could get the market to work right. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There are four reasons this could be
fair.</span> In history
three times when land tax was applied on increased value, it also
increased land ownership, and tenure was extended. 
<ul>
  <li>Last century
in Denmark, land taxes were increased.  </li>
  <li>In the 1890s in
California irrigation districts, they went from a few ranches to many
small farms.  </li>
  <li>In the 1950s a land tax in Taiwan broke up huge plantations and
resulted in many family farms. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the past, land owners owed services
  to king, but in
  this age of equality then we owe our neighbors. We have an equal
  right to the earth. </span><br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The community creates rent.</span>
  Land value rises when
  infrastructure goes on land. Technology progresses when the community
  becomes more tranquil and density goes up. Density is a really good
  measure of land value. No one owner by
  himself is responsible for density. Rent from land value is justified
  because all should share in the rent. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">If the community collected the rent,
  it would motivate
  owners not to speculate in anticipation of a higher future return.
  There would be a tendency to infill in the city and make cities
  more efficient.</span> It would make mass transit more efficient. We
  could collect some rent in a greater amount as ecological security
  deposits for gas stations with gas pump brownfields. We could actually
  put a surcharge on gasoline and put the playing
  field back to level between cars and other transportation. If we
  collected ground rent around transit stops and dedicated that income
  stream to the transit system, we could run a free
  system. When built, BART (Bay Area CA Rapid Transit) did a study and
  found it could run BART free. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">If we had free
  mass transit, people would choose to ride instead of drive.</span>
  It becomes more efficient and more people use, increasing the
  mobility of citizens in the region. If we get people out of cars,
  that reduces air pollution, noises, run off, and use of
  resources. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is not just collecting ground rent
  but also untaxing
  other systems. Untax labor and make it more affordable.</span>
  Enterprises
  such as recycling and reforestation, weatherization, reconstruction,
  and health enterprises are labor
  intensive and made more expensive artificially by taxing labor. We
  subsidize business: free roads for the timber industry, cheap water
  for agribusiness. Stop those subsidies and recycling could
  compete. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  On a level field, recycling would roll over extraction
  of virgin material. We could spare forests and salmon and have a
  healthier eco system. Look at restoration. Money has to come from the
  public treasury but we could look at it as public
  investment. Pay for restoration and land values increase, so land
  dividends would increase. Direct investment benefits the entire
public. </p>
<p>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Now the public is paying for private
  parties. That is
  not fair.</span> Look at the economy. Take taxes off homes, and they
  become
  more affordable. Have some kind of land charge, and housing stock
  increases as sites get developed. Affordable
  housing helps stabilize neighborhoods. In places that do have the
  land tax, i.e., Australia and New Zealand, they have fewer
  disputes with assessment. Assessors say their job is so much
  easier now. If land is less profitable and less of a political
football, it is less tense in local politics.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you take taxes off labor and
capital, more investment
flows into jobs, and we would have close to full employment, so labor
could demand full market value for services. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We could double the income of the
average worker with no loss in
standard of living.&nbsp;</span></li>
  <li>If fewer demands are placed on government by
citizens, it doesn't have to borrow so much.  </li>
  <li>If you reduce the amount of tax on the economy, and reduce the
amount of
redeemable notes, then we should be able to eliminate inflation. It
is unmasked. You can see lower prices; the cost of living goes down. It
will change social relationships.  </li>
  <li>Labor and
capital make up, with higher wages for labor, lower taxes for
capital, and more investment funds.  </li>
  <li>Labor can negotiate from a
position of strength.  </li>
  <li>Capital might want to share management
decisions and spread that risk of liability to workers. It tends to
reduce hierarchy and increase equality in society.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
What other social relations might change? Increase land
ownership participation in community and it benefits community, with
town hall meetings and block parties. Those kinds of communities have
less crime. Pittsburgh has six times
greater land tax than improvements, more affordable housing, and less
crime.<br>
<br>
The main indicator of economic health is called the GDP.
A good measure would be <span style="font-weight: bold;">leisure</span>,
the amount of time off from labor to
maintain a comfortable standard of living. If we shift, it would shrink
the work week, and help get rid of rush
hour traffic.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The green tax would reduce the role of economics in
politics.
