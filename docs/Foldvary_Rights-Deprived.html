<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Underprivileged
or Rights-Deprived?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">by Fred E. Foldvary, Senior Editor<br>
<a href="http://www.progress.org/">Progress Report</a></div>
<br>
Poor folk are often labeled "underprivileged" and richer folk are
called "privileged." For example, there is a book titled "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">One Nation, Underprivileged: Why American
Poverty Affects Us All</span>." But "privileged" and "underprivileged"
are confused and misleading expressions. If you think the poor are
"underprivileged," then you don't really understand poverty.<br>
<br>
What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
right.<br>
<br>
Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the money.
If he got a subsidy from the government, say for not growing corn, or
protection from competition, then indeed that person is privileged. But
if he got rich from working hard and investing well, then he is not
privileged, because he earned the wealth. Working and investing are not
privileges, but rights.<br>
<br>
So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in special
protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
of their earnings from labor.<br>
<br>
Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.<br>
<br>
Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
their right to work and save!<br>
<br>
The biggest privilege world-wide is subsidies to landowners. Land
values get pumped up from governmental services and goods such as
streets, highways, bridges, mass transit, parks, local and national
security, fire protection, and subsidies such as for schooling and
water. Landowners are privileged to get land rent from tenants or the
implicit geo-rent of their land, the extra value paid for by taxes on
workers and enterprises.<br>
<br>
There has been confusion about what is a right and what is a privilege.
For example, driving a car is often called a privilege, for which one
requires a license. Perhaps legally, driving is treated as a privilege,
but actually, traveling is a natural right, and driving should legally
be a conditional right, contingent on being a safe driver accountable
for any damage.<br>
<br>
Some consider a patent a privilege, but it too is a right. A patent
would be a privilege if some lucky persons got patents because they
have brown eyes while blue-eyed inventors don't get patents. But if all
persons have the same rules for getting patents, a patent ideally
should be an application of contracts, a simple way of having a
standard contract when selling an invention, where the buyer agrees not
to copy the invention for commercial sales.<br>
<br>
Some also consider a corporation to be a privilege, since the firm has
a charter from a government. But limited liability applies also to some
partnerships and to some non-corporate assets such as bonds. Moreover,
it is a right rather than a privilege to operate a business, and a
corporation should simply be a type of organizational structure with
the technicality of treating the entity as a legal owner, as are
trusts, cooperatives, associations, and other entities.<br>
<br>
Real privileges are favors arbitrarily given to some groups and not
others. 
<ul>
  <li>Religions have privilege when their doctrines are enforced by
law, imposed on those not holding those beliefs. For example,
Christians are privileged when the law prohibits private enterprise on
Sunday.  </li>
  <li>Alcohol and tobacco producers and sellers are privileged when
they can sell their products but competitors such as marijuana growers
are prohibited.  </li>
  <li>Farmers are privileged when they get protection from imported
food.  </li>
</ul>
A real privilege favors one cultural, religious, or economic interest
over another peaceful and honest practice.<br>
<br>
The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
These people lack privileges which others have. The proper remedy is
not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
rights for all; privileges for none!"<br>
