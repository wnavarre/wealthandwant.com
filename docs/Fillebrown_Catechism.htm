    Catechism of Natural Taxation</span><br>
    Charles B. Fillebrown</p>
    <p>Some years ago when President of the Massachusetts
    Single Tax League I started a correspondence and series of conferences
    with a large number of students of political economy including more
    than 100 professors in the leading colleges and universities of the
    country. The purpose was to ascertain whether it might be possible to
    secure agreement of recognized authorities concerning the fundamental
    economic principles on which the science of taxation must rest. The
    project met with such cordial approval at the hands of the economists,
    and proved so interesting and profitable that it finally resulted in a
    round-table conference at the Annual Meeting of the American Economic
    Association held at Madison, Wisconsin, in December 1907.1 The final
    canvass of opinions showed an overwhelmingly majority agreed upon
    three propositions stated in the following Catechism, No. 39.2</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. See <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual
Meeting of the American Economic Association,</span>
1907, pp. 117-29; also <span style="font-style: italic;">The A B C of
Taxation</span>, pp.187-90.<br>
2. Quoted from an introduction to the edition of the Catechism which
was published in the <span style="font-style: italic;">National
Magazine</span> for November, 1912.&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span><br>
</div>
 "Largely out of the correspondence elicited by The
ABC of Taxation this Single-Tax Catechism has grown." As described by
an economist not in sympathy with the single tax:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">It simplifies the method of treatment,
supplies needed definitions and explanations, and meets the objections
naturally raised by honest seekers after the truth. In fundamental
doctrine no change has been required either in general principles or
their practical application. Thirteen editions of the Catechism have
been privately printed and circulated. They have given opportunity to
make such changes as has seemed desirable after considering the
hundreds of criticisms and suggestions received from critics, friendly
as well as otherwise disposed. From correspondents and other friends,
indeed, so great assistance has been derived that the Catechism has
really become a joint product of scores of collaborators.<br>

</div>
<em>Q1. What is a tax?</em><br>
A. A tax is a compulsory contribution of
individual product or the value of such product toward the needs of
government.<br>
<br>
<em>Q2. What is meant by the single tax?</em><br>
A. The payment of all public expenses from economic
rent, the normal revenue, thus eventually abolishing all taxes.<br>
<br>
<em>Q3. What is meant by economic rent?</em><br>
A. Gross ground rent &#8212; the annual site value of
land &#8212; what land, including any quality or content of the land itself,
is worth annually for use &#8212; what the land does or would command for
use per annum if offered in open market &#8212; the annual value of the
exclusive use in control of a given area of land, involving the
enjoyment of those "rights and privileges thereto pertaining" which are
stipulated in every title deed, and which, enumerated specifically, are
as follows: right and ease of access to 
<ul><li>water, and 
  </li>
  <li>health inspection,  </li>
  <li>sewerage,  </li>
  <li>fire protection,  </li>
  <li>police,  </li>
  <li>schools,  </li>
  <li>libraries,  </li>
  <li>museums,  </li>
  <li>parks,  </li>
  <li>playgrounds,  </li>
  <li>steam and electric railway service,  </li>
  <li>gas and electric lighting,  </li>
  <li>telegraph and telephone service,  </li>
  <li>subways,  </li>
  <li>ferries,  </li>
  <li>churches,  </li>
  <li>public schools,  </li>
  <li>private schools,  </li>
  <li>colleges,</li>
  <li>universities,  </li>
  <li>public buildings &#8212;</li>
</ul>
utilities which depend for their efficiency and economy on the
character of the government; which collectively constitute the economic
and social advantages of the land which are due to the presence and
activity of population, and are inseparable therefrom, including the
benefit of proximity to, and command of, facilities for commerce and
communication with the world &#8212; an artificial value created primarily
through public expenditure of taxes. For the sake of brevity, the
substance of this definition may be conveniently expressed as the value
of "proximity." It is ordinarily measured by interest on investment
plus taxes.<br>
<br>
<em>Q4. What is the ethical basis of the single tax?</em><br>
A. The common right of all citizens to profit by
site values of land which are a creation of the community.<br>
<br>
<em>Q5. What is meant by equal right to land?</em><br>
A. The right of access upon equal terms&#8212;preference to be secured only upon payment of a premium that will
extinguish the equal rights of all other men.<br>
<br>
<em>Q6. What is meant by a joint or common right to land?</em><br>
A. A joint or common right to the rent of land &#8212; a
right such as heirs-at-law have to share the income of or rent of an
estate.<br>
<br>
<em>Q7. What is meant by land value?</em><br>
A. Its site value &#8212; its selling or market value &#8212; its net value to
the purchaser &#8212; the capitalization of its net rent &#8212; the value supposed
to
be adopted by the assessors as the basis of
taxation.<br>
<br>
<em>Q8. How about fertility value?</em><br>
A. On the surface of the globe are countless
varieties of exhaustible fertility, i.e. chemical constituency,
differing in kind and degree, from the nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and
carbon of the soil to the carbon of the coal, the gold, and the
diamond. Fertility as an attribute need not be predicated of
agricultural land alone. Economic fertility belongs equally to any
other land which yields to labor its product whether in food, mineral,
or metal. Land may be fertile in wheat, corn, and potatoes. It may be
fertile in cotton, in tobacco, or in rice. It may be fertile in
diamonds, in gold, silver, copper, lead, or iron. It may be fertile in
oil, coal, or natural gas, in a water power or water front. The value
of artificial fertility is an improvement value. The value of natural
fertility of any kind is a site value.<br>
<br>
<em>Q9. Does not the single tax mean the nationalization
of land?</em><br>
A. No; as Henry George has said, "the primary error
of the advocates of land nationalization is in their confusion of equal
rights with joint rights. ... In truth, the right to the use of land is
not a joint or common right, but an equal right; a joint or common
right is to rent."* It means rather the socialization of economic rent.
It simply proposes gradually to divert an increasing share of ground
rent into the public treasury.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">*A Perplexed Philosopher, Part III,
Chapter XI: Compensation</div>
<p>  <em>Q10. What is the distinction between the taxation of
  land and the taxation of rent?</em><br>
  A. Taxing land means, in the ordinary use of the
  words, to tax the land upon its capital value, or selling value, at a
  given rate per $100 or $1,000 of that value. Taxing rent means taxing
  the annual value, or ground rent, at a given percentage of that rent.
  It is in one case a tax on rent; in the other is a tax on capitalized
  rent.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q11. Does not the common right to rent involve
  common ownership of land?</em><br>
  A. Not in the least. When the economic rent is
  appropriated by the community for common purposes, individual ownership
  of land could and should continue. Such ownership would carry all the
  present rights of the landowner to use, control, and dispose of land,
  so that nothing like common ownership of land would be necessary.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q12. Did not Henry George believe in the abolition
  of private property in land?</em><br>
  A. Assuredly not. If he did, why was it that he
  suggested no modification whatever of present land tenure or "estate in
  land"? If he did, how could he have said that the sole "sovereign" and
  sufficient remedy for the wrongs of private property in land was "to
  appropriate rent by taxation"?<br>
  <em><br>
  Q13. What is meant by the right of property?</em><br>
  A. As to the grain a man raises, or the house that
  he builds, it means ownership full and complete. As to land, it means
  legal title, tenure, "estate in land," perpetual right of exclusive
  possession, a right not absolute, but superior to that of any other man.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q14. What is meant by the right of possession?</em><br>
  A. As to land, if permanent and exclusive, as on
  perpetual lease, it means the right to "buy and sell, bequeath and
  devise," to "give, grant, bargain, sell, and convey" together with the
  rights and privileges thereto pertaining, in short, the same definition
  for <span style="font-style: italic;">possession </span>that the law
  applies to <span style="font-style: italic;">property</span>.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q15.&nbsp; What should be the limit of revenue under
  the single tax?</em><br>
  A. The same as under any other system of taxation,
  the cost of government economically administered.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q16. Did not Henry George hold that the full
  ground rent of land should be taken in taxation?</em><br>
  A. No! Not only did he concede a margin of rent to
  the landlord, but as a matter of fact, as Thomas G. Shearman said, "not
  all the power of all governments" could collect in taxation all of
  ground rent.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q17.&nbsp; You would not say that land is a product
  of industry?</em><br>
  A. No; but the annual site value of land is a
  product of the growth and industry of the community.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q18. You would not say that the supply of land can
  be increased?</em><br>
  A. No; but fresh demand is constantly requiring not
  only an increase in the public equipment of land already in use, but
  also the constant extension of such equipment to new area.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q19. Why should buildings and all other improvements
  and personal property and capital be exempt from taxes?</em><br>
  A. Because a tax on them falls upon industry, and so
  increases the cost of living, while continuing the invidious exemption
  of the present net land value.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q20.&nbsp; Why should stocks and bonds be exempt?</em><br>
  A. Stocks, because they are only paper certificates
  of property which itself has been taxed once already. Bonds, if
  legitimate, because a tax on borrowed money is paid after all by the
  borrower and so becomes an added factor in cost of production, and
  consequently in the cost of living.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q21.&nbsp; What is meant by an "old tax" or a "new
  tax"?</em><br>
  A. By the term "old tax" is intended the taxing
  force at last change of ownership; by a "new tax," one the imposed
  since then.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q22.&nbsp; What is privilege?</em><br>
  A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Century Dictionary</span>, "a special and
  exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes of
  persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right."<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of
  privilege?</em><br>
  A. That it is the law-given power of one man to
  profit at another man's expense.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q24.&nbsp; What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
  A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public
  service corporations, of the net rent of land created by the growth and
  activity of the community without payment for the same. Also, the less
  important privileges connected with patents, tariff, and the currency.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
  A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor,
  stored-up wages; an instrument of production paid for in human labor,
  and destined to wear out. Capital is the natural ally of labor, and is
  harmless except as allied to privilege. Privilege is none of these, but
  is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for and perpetual lien upon
  the future labor of this and succeeding generations. Capital is paid
  for and ephemeral. Privilege is unpaid for and eternal. A man
  accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
  in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is
  an instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This
  illustrates that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q26.&nbsp; How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
  A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually
  abolished by lower rates, or by taxation, or by both, in the interest
  of the community.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
  A. Because such payment is fairly due from grantee
  to the grantor of privilege and also because a tax upon privilege can
  never be a burden upon industry or commerce, nor can it ever operate to
  reduce the wages of labor or increase prices to the consumer.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
  A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an "old" tax, it is a burdenless
  tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their tenants; most landlords
  who let land and also the
  tenement houses and business blocks thereon avoid all share in the tax
  burden.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of
  wealth?</em><br>
  A. Wealth as produced is now distributed
  substantially in but two channels, privilege and wages. The abolition
  of privilege would leave but the one proper channel, viz., wages of
  capital, hand, and brain.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q30.&nbsp; How would the single tax increase wages?</em><br>
  A. By gradually transferring to wages that portion
  of the current wealth that now flows to privilege. In other words, it
  would widen and deepen the channel of wages by enlarging opportunities
  for labor, and by increasing the purchasing power of nominal wages
  through reduction of prices. On the other hand it would narrow the
  channel of privilege by making the man who has a privilege pay for it.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q31. How can this transfer be effected?</em><br>
  A. By the taxation of privilege.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q32. How much ultimately may wages be thus increased?</em><br>
  A. Fifty percent would be a low estimate.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q33. What are fair prices and fair wages?</em><br>
  A. Prices unenhanced by privilege, and wages
  undiminished by taxation.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q34. Why does not an increase in ground rent tend to
  cause an&nbsp; increase in prices?</em><br>
  A. Usually sales increase faster proportionately
  than rent, thus reducing the ratio of rent to sales. The larger the
  product, the lower the individual costs. The larger the gross sales,
  the lower the competitive prices.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q35. Why should land be singled out to bear the bulk
  of the burden of taxation?</em><br>
  A. Because in the private appropriation of the net
  rent of land is found the bulk of privilege.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q36. How much does this particular form of privilege
  amount to?</em><br>
  A. It amounted for 1914 to approximately $40 million
  for Boston and more than $200 million for Greater New York.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q37.&nbsp; Does the single tax imply or involve the
  municipalization of public utilities?</em><br>
  A. No. A public franchise value is a land value
  which the single tax would assess at the same rate as other land
  values. The municipalization of the public utilities themselves is a
  different question, and is no necessary part of the single tax.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q38. What are the three legs of the tripos, the
  threefold support upon which the single tax rests?</em><br>
A. They are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    (1) The social origin of ground rent &#8212; that the
      site value of land is a creation of the community, a public or social
      value.<br>
    <br>
    (2) The non-shiftability of a land tax &#8212; that no
      tax, new or old, on the site value of land can be recovered from the
      tenant or user by raising his rent.<br>
    <br>
    (3) The ultimate burdenlessness of a land tax&#8212;that the selling value
      of land, reduced as it is by the capitalized tax that is imposed upon it,
      is an untaxed value. Whatever lowers the
      income from land lowers proportionately its selling price, so that
      whether the established tax upon it has been light or heavy, it is no
      burden upon the new purchaser, who buys it at its net value and thus
      escapes all part in the tax burden which he should in justice share
  with those who now bear it all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <em>Q39. Is not land peculiar in that it is a gift of
  the Creator, and is not a product of labor?</em><br>
  A. Yes, that is true of land itself, but not of the
  value of land.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q40. What is meant by a capitalized tax?</em><br>
  A. It is a sum, the interest of which would pay the
  tax.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q41.&nbsp; Why would the single tax be an
  improvement upon present systems of taxation?</em><br>
  A. Because: (1) The taking for public uses of that
  value which justly belongs to the public is not a tax; (2) it would
  relieve all workers and capitalists of those taxes by which they are
  now unjustly burdened, and (3) it would make unprofitable the holding
  of land idle.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q42. Should not all people pay taxes for the
  protection of their property?</em><br>
  A. Yes, and that is what they are doing when they
  pay their ground rent. To tax them again, as is now done, is double
  taxation.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q43.&nbsp; Do all people, then, pay ground rent?</em><br>
  A. Yes, in proportion as they are users of land
  having any value.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q44.&nbsp; Why, on similar lots of land, should one
  man with a $10,000 building be taxed as much as another with a $100,000
  building?</em><br>
  A. Because the value of the privilege of occupancy
  and use is the same in both cases.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q45. Why tax $1,000 invested in a vacant lot while
  exempting $1,000 invested in New York Central stock?</em><br>
  A. Because: (1) the land is made worth $1,000 and so
  maintained at public expense without any contribution from the owner;
  (2) the $1,000 New York Central stock adds nothing to the public
  expense, but a tax upon it, if collected at the source, falls directly
  on the road and thence upon the public, and so adds to the cost of
  living.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q46.&nbsp; Would it not be confiscation so to
  increase the tax on land?</em><br>
  A. What would be confiscated? No land would be
  taken, no right of occupancy, or use, or improvement, or sale, or
  devise; nothing would be taken that is conveyed or guaranteed by the
  title deed.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q47.&nbsp; What is the distinction between taxation
  and confiscation?</em><br>
  A. The sovereign state may appropriate private
  property of its citizens in two ways: (1) by confiscation; (2) by
  taxation. When one particular man by treason or otherwise has forfeited
  his rights as a citizen, the land and houses and personalty of this one
  man may all be "forfeit to the crown," while the validity and sanctity
  of 9,999 other men's rights are in no way infringed. This is
  confiscation. On the other hand, when the state, in order to obtain the
  revenue to meet the expenses of government, levies tribute upon its
  10,000 citizens impartially, this is taxation.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q48.&nbsp; But would it not be an injustice to the
  landowner?</em><br>
  A. If it be an injustice to tax hard-earned incomes
  (wages) to maintain an unearned income (net economic rent) that bears
  no tax burden, how can it be an injustice to stop doing so? There can
  be no injustice in taking for the benefit of the community the value
  that is created by the community.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q49.&nbsp; What is the lesson of the inevitable
"capitalization" of the land tax?</em><br>
A. It is that an unfair discrimination in favor of
  the landowner can never be overcome until all taxes are paid out of
  ground rent; then all men will enjoy total exemption equally with the
  landowner.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q50.&nbsp; How could the landowner escape the
  alleged burden of an increase in his land tax?</em><br>
  A. Simply by assuming the legitimate role of a model
  landlord, by putting his land to suitable use, in providing for tenants
  at lowest possible price the best accommodations and facilities
  appropriate to the situation that money can buy.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q51.&nbsp; Does not a land tax increase house rent
  or store rent?</em><br>
  A. The landlord, as a rule, exacts the full ground
  rent for the use of his land. Neither by taking three dollars nor $30
  per thousand in taxation can land to be made worth any more for use.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q52.&nbsp; In old cities, it is not nearly all the
  land in use?</em><br>
  A. About one half the area of New York and Chicago
  is classed by the assessors as vacant. In Boston the proportion is:
  occupied, 45 percent; vacant, 43 percent; marsh, 12 percent.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q53.&nbsp; How would the single tax effect the
  farmer?</em><br>
  A. It would greatly reduce his taxes. His buildings,
  stock, and crops would be exempt. His land is at present assessed at
  nearly twice its proper unimproved value, while town and city land is
  often valued at less than one half its actual value, thus subjecting
  him to a more than fourfold disadvantage.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q54.&nbsp; What relief could it bring to strictly
  agricultural towns, where the unimproved land values are very small?</em><br>
  A. However poor the town or heavy the taxes, it
  would at least tend the equalize their present tax burden. The assessed
  value of land in the three smallest towns of Massachusetts, Alford,
  Holland, and Peru, is $282,335, or more than three times that of the
  buildings. Allowing one half of the assessed valuation of land to be
  improvement value, the unimproved basis for taxation would be $141,168,
  or 60 percent more than the buildings. Thus an apportionment according
  to unimproved land values, increasing ever so slowly, would seem to be
  fairer than one according to improvements, which require constant
  renewal.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q55.&nbsp; How would the single tax effect the
  tenant?</em><br>
  A. It would neither increase nor decrease his land
  rent. It would reduce his house rent by the amount of the house tax.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Q56.&nbsp; How would it affect the man who owns the
  house he lives in?</em><br>
  A. In nearly every case it would reduce his taxes.
  Roughly speaking, his taxes will be less or greater in proportion as
  his house is worth more or less than his land.<br>
  <em><br>
  Q57.&nbsp; Would the single tax yield sufficient
  revenue for all government purposes, local, state, and national?</em><br>
  A. Careful estimates by Mr. Thomas G. Shearman
  indicate that all present taxes amount to not much more than one half
of the annual site value of the land. But he said:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The honest needs of public
government grow faster than population and fully as fast as wealth
itself. Local taxation will increase rapidly; and it ought to do
so..... This does not imply that ground rent will not be sufficient to
supply many, possibly all, of those additions to human happiness which
Henry George has pictured in such glowing words. But such extensions of
the sphere of government must take place gradually; or they will be
ruinous failures, simply because the state cannot at once furnish the
necessary machinery for their successful operation.</div>
<p>  <em>Q58.&nbsp; What expected result of the single tax
needs studious emphasis?</em><br>
A. That it would unlock the land to labor at its
present value for use, instead of locking out labor from the land by a
prohibitive price based upon the future value for use.<br>
<br>
<em>Q59.&nbsp; Is it correct to say that "land" is one
thing, and the "rent of land" another and quite different thing, and
that to take in taxation the rent of land it is not necessary to take
the land itself?</em><br>
A. Ninety-one professors of political economy have
answered "Yes." Twenty-three have answered "No."<br>
<br>
<em>Q60.&nbsp; Do you believe that economic rent ought
to furnish a larger proportion of public revenue than it does now?</em><br>
A. One hundred nineteen professors of political
economy have answered "Yes." Eight have answered "No."<br>
<em><br>
Q61. Do you think there would be any injustice in
taking by taxation the future increment in the value of land?</em><br>
A. Fifteen professors of political economy have
answered "Yes." Ninety-four have answered "No."<br>
<br>
<em>Q62.&nbsp; Would it be wise to take gradually in
taxation, say, 1/4, one half, or 3/4 of the future increase in economic
rent?</em><br>
A. One hundred and one professors of political
economy have answered "Yes." Twenty-nine have answered "No."<br>
<br>
<em>Q63.&nbsp; How could the single tax be put into
operation?</em><br>
A. By gradually transferring to land all taxes not
already on it.<br>
<br>
<em>Q64.&nbsp; How might such a plan be worked out?</em><br>
A. If fifty cents per thousand should be deducted
yearly for 30 years from the rate on all property other than land, the
reduction would finally amount to $15 per thousand, and it would then
be practically exempt from all taxation.<br>
<em><br>
Q65.&nbsp; But how could it be worked out in case of
the land?</em><br>
A. Recognizing that a right thing may be done in a
wrong way, it is insisted that a right way ought to be found to do a
thing that ought to be done. The following is presented as a natural
and convenient <span style="font-style: italic;">unit of calculation</span>:
To be exact, <span style="font-style: italic;">an average of about 20
percent of the gross ground rent of land is now taken in taxation, for
instance, in Boston, as well as for the whole state of Massachusetts.
If an additional one percent should be taken each year for 30 years, it
would amount at the end of that period to 30 percent, which, added to
20 percent, would make 50 percent, or one half, which is about the
average proportion that present taxes levied on all property bear to
gross ground rent. Meantime few landowners would feel the change, much
less be prejudiced by it.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

The following variable illustrations, A, B, and C, make clear.</p>
<p align="center">  <span style="font-style: italic;">A "Modus Operandi"</span><br>
  <br>
A <span style="font-style: italic;">Increase of Present Tax</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>For instance, applied to the assessment of a specific lot of land for
  which the user pays a gross ground rent of say ......&nbsp; $68.00<br>
  Of which amount there is taken in taxation, 1915 ..... $18.00<br>
  <br>
  Leaving a net income to the owner of&nbsp; .... $50.00<br>
  The selling value (presumably also the assessed valuation) would be at
  5 per cent ... $1,000.00<br>
  Proceeding to take yearly from now on 1 per cent additional of the
  gross ground rent of $68 for a period of thirty years would amount in
  all to 30 per cent of $68, equal to&nbsp;&nbsp; .... $20.40<br>
  Which, added to the tax already taken .... $18.00 <br>
  Would give at the end of thirty years, from the $1,000 worth of land
  alone, everything else being exempted, a total tax of .... $38.40.<br>
  Which is not much more than one half of the gross ground rent of ...
  $68.00<br>
  <br>
  The opening exhibit in detail would stand as follows:<br>
  In 1915 the tax on this $1,000 worth of land was $18.00<br>
  In 1916 the tax would be $18 plus 68 cents (1 per cent of the gross
  ground rent, $68); equal to .... $18.68<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $49.32<br>
  In 1917 the tax would be $18 plus $1.36 (2 per cent of the $68),
  totaling .... $19.36<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $48.64,<br>
  In 1918 the tax would be $18 plus $2.04 (3 per cent of the $68) or
  $20.45<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $47.96<br>
  In 1945 the tax on the land would be $18 plus $20.40 (30 per cent of
  the $68) or&nbsp; ... $38.40<br>
  With all improvements exempted.<br>
  Reducing the owner's net rent from $50 to $29.60.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>The taking in taxation of any desired proportion of the future
increment could be accomplished simply by continuing the present
valuation and present rate as constant factors, and making a separate
individual assessment of the increment tax after the following or

instance, to take in taxation 50 per cent of the future increase:<br>

In applying this formula it would be necessary after the first few
years at least to increase the rate to correspond to the decrease in
assessed valuation due to this new tax.&nbsp; For computations upon

Q66.&nbsp; What has the single tax to say about the taxation of forest
lands?<br>
A. Perhaps the majority opinion would be to tax annually all forests
old or new on what would be the value of the land if denuded of all
growth -- a stumpage tax to be collected upon old growth timber when
cut, but not upon new growth such as may be reasonably classed as a
cultivated crop.<br>
