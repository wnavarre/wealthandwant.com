<center><b>Comments on the NTIA's Comprehensive Policy Review <br>
of Use
and Management of the Radio Frequency Spectrum</b>
<p>Nicolaus Tideman</p>
</center>
<p>Both on grounds of justice and on grounds of efficiency, a
market-based system of allocating rights to use the radio frequency
spectrum, with public collection of the value of rights granted, is
best. The right to use the frequency spectrum is a scarce resource,
whose value is derived primarily from the mere existence of the
spectrum and not from the efforts of those who might be granted use.
Thus the whole population has equal respectable claims to use. But
efficient use of the resource requires exclusive assignment of
frequencies within particular geographical areas. Therefore justice
is served by requiring those who receive the privilege of use to
compensate the rest of the population for that privilege.</p>
<p>The most practical way to assess the value of spectrum use is to
create an options market in spectrum use rights. If every user were
required to pay the amount that some other would be willing to pay
for the use of a similar resource, that would achieve simultaneously
the public appropriation of the value of the frequency spectrum, the
efficiency of continuity in assignments, and private retention of the
component of the value of frequency allocations that arises from the
labor and capital that have been invested in particular
applications.</p>
<p>The required options market could be created in the following way.
Once a year or so the NTIA would solicit bids for spectrum use from
anyone who wished to participate. These "spectrum assessors" would be
required to make offers on a wide range of frequencies, perhaps as
many as would typically be allocated to several dozen users. To avoid
appropriating the value resulting from the labor and capital of
users, assessors would be required to provide assessments that did
not take sudden jumps at particular frequencies, and that varied
geographically according to reasonable factors such as population
density and income. Each assessor would post a bond, guaranteeing
that if a frequency allocation became available, someone could be
found who would be willing to pay the assessed rent. If no one wished
to pay the assessed rent, the frequency would be assigned to the
person who bid the highest rent, and the assessor's bond would be
docked for the shortfall. For his services, an assessor would be
given something like 1% of the rent collected from those allocations
for which he was the assessor who stated the highest value. This
mechanism would have the virtue of what is called in economic theory
a "second-price auction."</p>
<p>To achieve the greatest economy in use of the spectrum, it would
be best that all spectrum users--military, scientific, non-profit,
etc., be charged for their use. With the revenue that would then be
collected it would be possible to provide money with which all such
users whose activities are socially valued could pay their rental
charges. The routing of the funds through the Treasury and back to
the users would serve to alert all decision-makers to the value of
the resources in alternative activities, which could be expected to
lead to more economical use of these scarce and valuable
resources.</p>
