<center><b>Canada's System of Revenue Sharing </b>
<br>
Mason Gaffney
<p>[an extended excerpt from a speech delivered in Canada.
<br>
Reprinted from Good Government, December, 1986] </p>
</center>
<p>It seems to me therefore that we need to face up to the question
that is known in my trade as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal
Federalism, that is, how is money
going to be distributed by the federal government out of its
so-called surplus, either to people or the States, or localities?</span>
When we look at this issue, which is definitely a Georgist issue,
we'll find interestingly enough that a lot of economists have gotten
there first. Many of these are Canadian economists, and without
exception they talk about rent. They talk about rich provinces and
poor provinces, and the rich provinces are those that have resource
rents. And when they say rent they are not talking about Frank
Sinatra's voice, or Bridget Bardot's figure. They're talking about
the income of natural resources. Now it's not just a question of
distribution here&#8230; but a whole question of whether a growth
oriented policy will sell at the local level.</p>
<p>The reason it's so hard to sell growth policies at the local level
today in the United States is very much due to the fact that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">t</span><b style="font-weight: bold;">he
United States federal government taxes people and it gives
subventions</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> to landlords. So the
landlords can get the
subventions without having the people. So who needs people?</span>
That's it
in a nutshell. We need to reverse that, I think, if we're going to be
able to make Georgism work at the local level. <small> </small><small> </small><small> </small><small></small></p>

<p><b>Cannan's Law</b></p>
<p>The last time I discussed this subject was in Las Vegas before a
tax group. I started out by saying 'I hope there are no Canadians
here!' It would be vain to say that to this group, so I'll say I hope
there are no sober Canadians here, at least none who possess a high
degree of expertise on this subject, because I may have to skip over
some of the high spots. I lay some claim to being Canadian myself, I
should say. I have two children who have dual citizenship because
they originated in Canada, or possibly three children depending on
where you stand on the right-to-life controversy. But at any rate I
would like to emphasise that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
Canadian system of revenue
distribution, fiscal sharing, or equalisation as we call it in
Canada, is much more based on correct principle than the one you find
in the United States. </span>By 'correct principles' I mean the ones I
just
enunciated.</p>
<p>At any rate, let's begin by looking at the similarities between
the federal systems in the United States and Canada. In both
countries we find something called '<b>vertical balancing'</b> which
means that the senior governments send money to the junior
governments. We find also something called '<b>horizontal
balancing</b>' which means that the payments are made more to the
poorer governments, those that are poorer on a per capita basis, than
to richer ones. We have the principle that the Crown may not tax the
Crown. We've an economic principle, which I'll call <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Cannan's Law</span>. The
cannan here is not a weapon, but an economist of very little note,
Edwin Cannan, who however did make one very important point. He made
it in the period when the single tax in England was on everyone's
lips. And if you read the <i>Economic Journal</i>, the stuffy,
establishmentarian journal of the economics profession, it's full of
criticisms of the Single Tax.&nbsp;</p>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"

  </tbody>
</table>
<p>No respectable English economist could fail to write at least one
article criticising the Single Tax. And Edwin Cannan criticised it in
the following way. He said, in effect, local taxation of land makes
private land an open range. His idea was something like Garret
Hardin's idea of the 'tragedy of the commons'. Or I should put it the
other way around because Hardin came later and he obviously borrowed
from those who wrote earlier.<b> But the general idea is, you may
think you have tenure control of land but if the municipal government
can tax that land and use that money to finance public welfare
services, public education and other things that are open to all
comers, then you will end up with an uneconomical distribution of
population.</b> You'll have more people clustered around the honey
pot in places like Vancouver where there's a lot of economic rent per
capita than you will in areas with less economic rent per capita.
</p>
<p>So we found in the mining country of Northern Minnesota back in
the days when iron ore was worth something. They had the best schools
in the mid-west there at the iron mines and all those Finnish miners'
kids got first rate educations. You run into them everywhere now:
they've become an awful nuisance -- very well educated though. </p>
<p>All this tends to distort the economical allocation of population
and also to reduce the incentive of local government to provide
public services that are open to all comers. That I refer to as
Cannan' s Law. And you find that, of course, in all countries. It's
an economic law. </p>
<p><b>Hammer's Law</b></p>
<p>At the same time, in both countries you find something I will call
Hammer's Law. This is not a carpenter's tool but again the name of a
man, an economist in Missouri, who observed in 1935 that <b>if you
compared population to land values in the different counties of his
State (in the very poor counties of the Ozarks the land was hard
scrabble land of very little value, with the very rich lands in the
north-western part of the State, which resembles Iowa) you found that
the population density was much greater on the very poor land of the
Ozarks than it was on the very rich land of the northwest.</b> He
took this to be a sign of market failure. Three years later the
Establishment got to him and he said, well maybe I can rationalise
this after all. But actually it's the American counterpart of the
familiar pattern in the less developed countries where the flat land,
the good flat land, is used for grazing cattle at a very low level of
productivity, and the mass of the people in their minafundia are
found on the hard scrabble land on the steep hill sides. I call it
<b>Hammer's Law of Market Failure</b> where, because of the operation
of the land market, whose evils we are so familiar with, you do not
get the population distributed over the land in an economically
rational manner, because of the tendency of the better land to be
agglomerated into large holdings which are not optimumly developed.
Comparing States, this results in the fact that a poor State like
West Virginia has large numbers of people living on very poor land,
and a wealthy State like Iowa (speaking now just of farming) has a
small number of people on very good land. And this results in
inter-jurisdictional equalisation problems. In Canada this takes the
form of the Maritime provinces in the east being densely populated
like the Ozarks and the wealthier, in a sense, western provinces
being underpopulated. </p>
<p>Now another similarity to the two countries us that the
subventions that do go from the federal government to the provinces
in Canada (and you find a similar thing in the United States) do not
come from the richer provinces. They come instead from the general
fund, the general taxpayer.<b> There is in other words more vertical
balancing than there is horizontal balancing (horizontal balancing
you remember means equalization among the different
jurisdictions).</b> It's a little like what somebody said about
foreign aid. 'Foreign aid is a device by which poor people in rich
countries are taxed to subsidize rich people in poor countries.'</p>
<p>We'll see that equalisation in most countries works something like
that; that is, in addition to this inter-provincial equalisation,
there's a tax shift involved where local sources of taxation like the
property tax are being displaced by the federal income tax. I suppose
Ferdinand Marcos would be a splendid example of the kind of person I
was talking about in the poor country and in West Virginia you have
all these coal companies whose owners live in Palm Beach, whose
shareholders live in Palm Beach and such places, who benefit from an
inter-state equalisation that benefits West Virginia. Well these are
similarities. Now differences. </p>
<p><b>Amount of Equalization</b></p>
<p>I learned that if you want to get along in this country you have
to emphasise the differences. If there's anything a Canadian fears,
it's not the hostility of the United States, it's the embrace. When
Canadians say 'Vive la difference' they are not being male
chauvinists, just regular chauvinists. So, let's look at the
differences. </p>
<p><b>The federal aid in Canada goes to provinces, whereas in the
United States it goes to specific cities, The U.S. Congressman likes
to have his fingerprint, as they say, on every dollar that goes from
Washington.</b> The Canadian provinces are much larger and stronger,
and fewer than the American States. There is much more horizontal
balancing among provinces in Canada than there is among States in the
United States. The Maritimes for instance get about 50% of their
provincial revenues from equalisation entitlements. Fifty percent.
Nothing in the United States matches that. In fact, if you look at
the U.S. Constitution, it's quite specifically planned to prevent
that sort of thing. Equalisation is not what the Founding Fathers had
in mind. On the contrary, there is a provision which you may be
familiar with which says that direct taxes will be apportioned among
the States according to their respective populations. So in the
States the idea has been: <b>Tax the States according to their
population and then give the money back according to political
power.</b> In the United States Senate it means that the smallest
State has just as much clout as the biggest State or would have if
their senators weren't so merchantable. (I mean, in California when
we need something we just look to Nevada or one of those places for a
Senator who is having difficulty raising funds for his next election.
But that's another story.) </p>
<p><b>Another difference is that the Crown provincial owns a very
large share of the public domain, especially in the western
provinces</b>. I wouldn't want to overstate that difference. Alaska
after all owns Prudhoe Bay and California owns three miles offshore
-- that includes the Wilmington Basin off Long Beach. You get a lot
of State revenue from those things. But it doesn't really compare
with 94% of British Columbia being owned by the Crown provincial.
That makes a difference. We'll see that part of the game in Canada is
the effort on the federal government to prevent the provinces from
fully extracting that economic rent from their Crown lands for public
purposes. </p>
<p><b>Surpluses</b></p>
<p>Another difference is that Canadians are much more restrained and
self-controlled than Americans, and therefore they've managed to
build up enormous surpluses. There's something called the <b>Alberta
Heritage Fund</b>, where instead of just blowing that money as it
came in, they squirreled it away and saved it up and it's now
considered I believe the largest single block of available capital in
North America: $6-10 billion (I lost sight of the figures somewhere
as they were going up). But can imagine Howard Jarvis in Alberta with
his beady eyes on the Alberta Heritage Fund? Why, when we built up a
surplus of just a few million dollars in Sacramento Howard Jarvis
climbed all over everybody, 'We've got to cut taxes.' And that's when
we got 'Proposition 13'. Saskatchewan has a Heritage Fund too, quite
modest compared with Alberta's, but worth mentioning.</p>
<p><b>Shared Rent</b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But the most delightful
distinction about Canadians is the strong
and explicit recognition among almost everyone, even if he's an
economist, who discusses this subject, that different resource
endowments are the basis of inter-provincial differences.</span>
<b>Equalisation in Canadian politics means sharing the economic
rent.</b> Everybody talks that way. Canadian economists even when
they come to the States talk that way. Just as though rent were a
permissible word in polite discourse. It's very refreshing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">However
there's a very selective attitude towards rent -- towards what rents
are shareable, I should say.</span> </p>
<ul>
  <li>Rents from oil and gas are fair game. </li>
  <li>Forest revenues are fair game. </li>
  <li>Mineral revenues of other kinds are fair game. </li>
  <li>Water power is fair game. </li>
</ul>
<p><b style="text-decoration: underline;">But now how about the rents
that are generated by the valuable
lands of Montreal, or Toronto, or some of those other big and
powerful cities in the east?</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>They are not fair
game.</i></b> As a matter of fact, if you pore through the fine print
of the equalization law, which I did on the airplane, you find the
most interesting exception to what's included in the formula. I'll
explain the formula to you in a moment if you are still awake.</p>
<p>The formula says that the greater the capacity to raise taxes that
a province enjoys, the less will be its equalization payment. And
various potential tax bases are included in this formula. And one of
those is the property tax. But then you look at the fine print and
only the improvements are included.<b><i> The land is specifically
excluded.</i></b> Very pecular. In the formula as it's commonly
printed you don't see that exclusion; it's only in the footnote. But
in the footnote it says 'Instead of the value of land we will
substitute the gross provincial product.' Of course, all right
thinking people know that land value is in direct proportion to the
growth of the provincial product. Or do they? I always thought that
was the product of other inputs. <b><i>What it means is that if a
province has a great deal of valuable land which is not being used to
a highest and best use, that valuable land will not be included in
its potential tax base, and it can continue to get subventions from
the federal government.</i></b> Whereas on the other hand if its
potential tax base includes oil and gas, then the revenues that it
receives from that, or the ability it has to receive revenues from
that, is counted against it in the sharing formula. So this is a very
peculiar sort of rent sharing. Some rents are shared and others are
not. You might even call it a conspiracy against Alberta. I'm sure
that's the way they look at it. </p>
<p><b><i>Now another difference is the high degree of foreign
ownership.</i></b> <i>Actually there's no higher degree of absentee
ownership in Canada than there is in the United States but it is much
more visible because it's international absentee ownership, whereas
our absentee owners live in some other corner of the United
States</i>, at least some of them do, or in Canada -- we have quite a
few of them. Of course Hong Kong, Belgium, you name it. This high
degree of absentee ownership, as Bob Williams more than hinted this
morning, is one of the reasons for the success of the populist
parties. They recognise property ownership is an alien phenomenon in
some considerable measure and therefore a legitimate target for
attack. <b>Some economists say that the ideal taxpayer is a
non-resident alien. In the case of these foreign owned resources
you're getting pretty close. </b></p>
<p><b>Sharing Formula</b></p>
<p>Now another thing about Canada is that it is a net exporter of
these resources which are being shared and, because of this, <b>price
control is a major mechanism for sharing the rents.</b> In short, the
price of Alberta oil is being held down below free market levels and
thus that economic rent, in part, is being shared with the consumers
in the eastern part of the country. This works out well, coupled with
a phenomenon that might be called negative dumping. (Dumping is when
you sell things overseas for less than you sell them at home.) Canada
is more rational, they sell them for more, especially in the United
States. They even have export duty on oil. Of course if United States
puts an import duty on, that's not fair. </p>
<p>Another characteristic is <b>eastern population dominance</b>.
Alberta and British Columbia have the resources of Texas and
California, without the votes, which makes them more vulnerable of
course. </p>
<p>Now let's look at the sharing formula. <b>The sharing formula in
Canada is essentially based on population and potential tax base.</b>
And it can be made to look very complicated but I think I've boiled
it down to its essence. <b>You take a province's percentage of the
population of Canada, and then you take the percentage of the tax
base that it has, subtract that and that gives you another
percentage. And then you multiply that times the total tax revenue
that's collected throughout Canada from that tax source, and then you
pay them that amount out of the provincial treasury. </b></p>
<p>Let's give an example here. Let's say Alberta has what, 7% of the
population (don't make a liar out of me now for a percentage point)
-- this is only for illustration. Say it has 7% of the population and
it has 85% of the oil and gas base. Well, you subtract 85% from 7%,
you get 78%, minus 78%. Very important, minus 78%. And then you
multiply that times the total amount of money that's collected by all
the provinces from oil and gas, and well, what that means in effect
is that Alberta doesn't get any money from the federal government.
Now if it had worked out the other way, Say Prince Edward Island, and
again these are hypothetical figures, (although I've got the real
figures in here, but you don't want me to take the time to look them
up), say it's got 8% of the population and 4% of the tax base, Then
you subtract the 4 from the 8 and you get 4% and you multiply that
times all the money that's collected from this tax base, and
hypothetically say we're talking about oil and gas. Then 4% of that
tax base is paid from Ottawa to Prince Edward Island to help them run
their government. That is basically the equalisation formula. But you
do it tax by tax, then you add them all up. </p>
<p>Now the way this works is: Prince Edward Island gets paid some
money because their equalisation number came up positive. But if it
comes out negative, as in the case of Alberta, that doesn't mean that
they have to pay any money to Ottawa. It's strictly a one-way street.
So who does pay this? Well, it's the general taxpayer. And that's
what I meant of course when I said that this is a system where poor
people in rich provinces subsidise rich people in poor provinces. But
let me get back to that in a moment. Now it helps us understand this
if we look at the impact of the oil price revolution on this formula
because it was originally set up before the oil price revolution. And
then when that occurred it naturally change the quantities. </p>
<p>Actually the difference in per capita income is not very great,
personal income that is, as reported for tax purposes. The difference
between Alberta and almost any other province in terms of oil
revenues per capita is extremely great. So that's where most of the
inter-provincial differences come from, and therefore that's what
triggers off most of the payments. </p>
<p><b>When the oil price revolution came it meant of course the oil
rich provinces got a lot more money out of oil. The royalties went
up. Leasehold sales brought more money, there was more profit from
Crown corporations, which is a form of royalty as Bob Williams
explained this morning. They also levy taxes on the industries in the
normal way. All this increased the payments that were due to the
have-not provinces, without increasing the contributions from the
have provinces. Because, remember, this thing just works in one way.
So the median taxpayer in Ontario got soaked because he, and median
taxpayers everywhere who paid the federal tax bills, were called upon
to increase their payments to the federal govemment so that the
federal government could pay more money to the poor provinces.
</b></p>
<b>Royalties</b>
<p>The next episode in this drama might be called 'the Empire strikes
back', with John Turner as Darth Vader. This was back in '74 or so.
He said, since these pesky western provinces are collecting so much
economic rent from their Crown lands by raising their royalties and
going up with the market, what we are now going to do is to fool hem.
We are going to say that these royalties are not deductibles for
federal income tax purposes. And since all the provincial income
taxes are piggybacked on to the federal tax, or most of them, that
also went for provincial income tax purposes. Thus in effect the
provinces were penalised for this effort to collect economic rent at
the provincial level. This had two objectives. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The good reason and the obvious reason was to protect the federal
revenues. </li>
  <li>But the subtler one, I think, was one of protecting the major
rent barons by assuring that the provinces would not get carried away
with raising their royalties. In effect, the provincial governments
were being penalised by the federal government for raising royalties. </li>
</ul>
<p>And although in the short run this obviously damaged the lessees
and they screamed bloody murder in the not so long run it forced the
provinces to back off on their royalties and it certainly forced them
to sell their leaseholds for lower prices in he future. Those that
hadn't yet been sold because the anticipation that the roya1ties
would not be deductible. So as it was viewed in the western
provinces, and I think correctly, this was an attempt on the part of
the government in Ottawa to protect the absentee owners of western
resources from provincial populism. </p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that John Turner got his training with
the Bechtel Corporation, just like George Schultz, or perhaps with
him. </p>
<p>It was at this time I think that the profit made by the British
Columbia Petroleum Corporation that exported gas and extracted
economic rent on the pipeline -- that was recognised as a royalty and
was not deductible. Price control of oil was made very stringent and
the export tax on oil was imposed at a high level. Well, in that
wonderful Canadian way, there was a compromise. There's always a
compromise. The compromise here that affected Alberta especially was
that the weight of oil in the equalisation formula was reduced in
that the only revenues that were counted in the fomula were revenues
that were taken for current use, and when they put money into the
Alberta Heritage Fund that wasn't counted. And that I suppose helps
account for the build up of the Heritage Fund. </p>
<p><b>The conclusion of all this is that the Canadian system is
really better in terms of its Georgist implications because the
payments to the provinces, with all the faults that I've described,
are essentially based on population. Population is in the formula.
And if you compare this with the way things are done in the States,
population plays a very minor role in the formula for equalisation
payments in the United States. </b></p>
<p><b>What To Do</b></p>
<p>Now, how should it be done? Well, there's a well known Georgist
economist who figured this out a long time ago and wrote an article
about it. His name is <b>Colin Clark</b>. There are two Colin Clarks
extant. There's one in Vancouver, who is a Marxist mathematician
turned resource economist, who's written some very interesting
things, and I wouldn't criticise him for the world, especially if
he's here. But he's not the one I'm referring to. The other one was a
premature Arthur Laffer who wrote about 20 years ago that once a
government took 25% of GNP, that was an upper limit on taxation. And
he made a great name for himself writing that, and it's probably not
true but that's how he became famous. But aside from becoming famous,
he's a very good Georgist economist. <b>He came up with a plan for
collecting economic rent at the federal level, and he said what we
really should do, and this I think is the ultimate equalisation
payment, is <i>we should classify local jurisdictions according to
land value per capita, and those that have the least land value per
capita, we'll leave all of that land value for them to use for local
purposes. But then we will graduate the federal land tax according to
the amount of land value per capita in the jurisdiction, and thus we
