<p><strong>My Personal Involvement<a name="MPI"></a></strong></p>
<p>  It is over two decades since the New York State Legislative Tax Study Commission<a href="#endnotes"><em>1</em></a> released
  a series of &#8220;Working Papers&#8221; addressing the design and
    administration of the State's tax code. I served as the staff political scientist
    there for nearly a decade, and had a small part in the development of some
    of its ideas. One of the papers was titled &quot;<strong><em>Who Pays
    New York Taxes?</em></strong>&quot; My
    comments here are on that one report, specifically with respect to its conclusions
    about New York's real property tax. It is the only paper where the property
    tax was discussed at all, and it did so only as a matter of completeness.
    This is because the mandate of the Commission as stipulated by the authorizing
    statute precluded any examination of the property tax; another task force
    not too long before had examined that realm of fiscal policy.<em><a href="#endnotes">2</a></em> But this is
    the part that I now wish to address, even given its peripheral attention
by the Commission staff.</p>
<p>At the time I joined the Commission staff, I had no special expertise in tax
  policy, or even in economics. So with a team of more experienced people specifically
  retained for the tasks of the Commission's charge,<a href="#endnotes"><em>3</em></a> I was the most reticent
  about, and also the most accepting of, conclusions offered by the staff and
  its director. The staff director, Richard (&#8220;Rick&#8221;) Pomp, was a
  law school professor with a long resume of published work specifically on tax
  policy. He had studied with Harvard&#8217;s Learned Hand Professor of Law,
  Oliver Oldman, and soon afterwards himself became the Alva P. Loiselle Professor
  at the University of Connecticut School of Law. On leave from his position
  as a professor, he became full time Director of the Commission for over two
  years, and its work essentially reflected his views. The other five of us were
  really aides to Professor Pomp's agenda. The charge was to look at New York's
  tax structure &#8211; from top to bottom &#8211; and to make judgments about
  possible improvements using the broadest framework it could muster. Following
  the 1985 federal income tax reforms, State taxes that piggybacked on these
  revisions were obliged to restructure themselves. And the Commission had a
  hand in suggesting broad simplification by moving from several graduated rates
  to two broad rates. These changes were made by other staffers after Pomp had
returned to his teaching position.</p>
<p>By the time I left the Commission staff in June of 1992, I had acquired a
  fair amount of expertise in tax policy, at least from the standpoint of its
  politics, philosophy, history, and economics, even though I still found its
  law and accounting well beyond my reach. Moreover, because I found corporate
  tax policy too abstruse, I elected to focus my attention on those areas I felt
  I could perhaps master and contribute to best &#8211; user fees, the sales
  tax, and the personal income tax. The Commission and its staff produced in
  total about ten papers, most of them by the time Professor Pomp had completed
  his contract with the Commission. After 1986, the Commission had little to
  show for its record, and the turnover in staff in subsequent years meant that
  less and less was expected of it. I elected to stay because I was able to use
  the considerable free time to &#8220;retool&#8221; my academic background and
  skills, just as if I was on a salaried fellowship. When Sheldon Silver was
  chosen as the new Assembly Speaker in 1992, I was shortly thereafter ushered
  out the door having bargained to have ten years (and one day) of New York State
  service. That assured me a small pension and guaranteed health insurance for
  the rest of my days. Not really able to return to academia, I also now had
  the freedom to pursue paths that were impossible as an employee anywhere else.</p>
<p>My choice was to explore a tradition of economics and tax policy that I had
  discovered toward the end of my Commission service: the philosophy of Henry
  George. In the summer of 1993, I flew to Los Angeles to attend the <a href="http://www.progress.org/cgo/conf07.html">annual
  conference</a>  of the <a href="http://www.progress.org/cgo/">Council of Georgist
  Organizations</a>; I had become fascinated with these,
  to me, totally new ideas. I have counted myself a Georgist ever since. Never
  in the course of ten years reading and discussion of New York's tax policy
  options did anything even close to this perspective cross the horizon. And
  it is fair to assume that the staffers on the Commission today &#8211; it still
  exists &#8211; have no inkling of what narrow perspective they work from. Even
  with ample evidence that the framework of neoclassical economics on which most
  of the contemporary American tax system rests is collapsing, tax professionals
  have carried on with little awareness of its pitfalls. Alternate schools of
  economics are quickly growing in many quarters &#8211; very frequently outside
  of conventional university economics departments. There is even ample evidence
  now that the still prevailing neoclassical economic paradigm can be shown to
  violate the laws of physics!<a href="#endnotes"><em>4</em></a> Professional tax literature, however, shows little
  evidence of being aware of any of this.</p>
<p>Two further observations about the Commission are necessary here: First, the
  reason why the staff products retained the status of &#8220;working papers&#8221; and
  were never finalized was that they would otherwise have required the approval
  of the Commission members themselves. Nominally the Commission had members
  of both parties and both houses, but in fact the Commission was totally an
  Assembly Majority (Democratic) operation. It would never have been possible
  to secure any real consensus, and retaining the working paper status maintained
  the facade of provisional work and still allow release for whatever use might
  be made of them. Second, several of these papers were subsequently published
  together as an issue of the Albany Law Review, and solely under Professor Pomp's
  name &#8212;  without any recognition of the fact that he was assisted in
  the statistics, the economics, the subcontracting, and editing by a New York
  State Assembly
  Commission.<a href="#endnotes"><em>5</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Analysis of &#8220;Who Pays?&#8221;</strong><a name="Analysis"></a></p>
<p>  Sufficient time has passed, I think, that I can now freely make observations
    on some work of the Tax Study Commission, particularly both since I have
    more expertise on tax policy and because the Commission's work really reflected
    the views of Professor Pomp and no one else. Only one paper touched on the
    real property tax, and only in a few passages. It was originally contracted
    to University of Missouri Professor Donald Phares, and this draft was then
    rewritten by the Commission (i. e., Rick Pomp) to be released as a working
    paper. &#8220;<strong><em>Who Pays New York Taxes?</em></strong>&#8221; is accessible, by those with
    resources, in major libraries at least in New York State. The most recent
    statistical data available at that time was for 1980, and in only three paragraphs
    of the thirty-three pages of text is the real property tax treated explicitly.
    An additional seventy pages have occasional references to it, with some rather
    interesting tables and graphics. All of these, however, are somewhat misleading.
    Were Messrs. Phares and Pomp consciously part of the confusion common in
    dealing with matters of property taxation or were they simply unaware of
    the sleight-of-hand that underlies most of the work in this area? My personal
    view is that they were simply not interested in probing more deeply into
    an area that was really beyond the Commission's scope. Still, the authors
    recognized that &#8220;Property taxes are the fiscal mainstay of local government.
    The incidence of the property tax is of substantial consequence in evaluating
the State's overall tax structure.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">6</a></em></p>
<p>As for their treatment of the New York Local Property Tax, the authors first
  identified seven separate categories of real property: owner-occupied, rental,
  commercial, industrial, public utilities, farmland, and unimproved. This is
  a somewhat unusual classification, different even than those universally used
  in New York State.<a href="#endnotes"><em>7</em></a> One can see immediately that there will necessarily be
  some overlap &#8211; &#8220;unimproved&#8221; parcels can sometimes be assigned
  in other categories according to their zoning. And rental property is commercial,
  whomever the tenants may be, whether households or businesses. </p>
<p>To their credit, however, the authors devoted considerable attention to the
  issue of tax shifting, which is never an easy subject, including a discussion
  of taxes on real property. They recognized that no shifting occurs for vacant
  parcels and titleholders therefore bear the full burden. So also for homeowners.
  For rental properties they assigned 50% of the burden to tenants, 25% to corporate
  stockowners, and 25% to real estate owners. For commercial, industrial, farmers,
  and public utility parcels, the shifting was put at 67%. In every instance
  where shifting is recognized, the part never shifted, of course, is the land
  component, and this is implicit in their assumption. These were referred to
  as &#8220;consensus incidence assumptions regarding the property tax.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">8</a></em></p>
<p>A third consideration they recognized is the potential for tax exporting to
  other states, more often important for classes other than residential property
  but still significant. It occurs both on account of titleholders being out-of-state
  and also because of what is known as the &#8220;federal offset,&#8221; i.e.,
  the deductibility of state and local taxes for federal tax itemizing. For all
  New York State and local taxes taken together, they estimated that roughly
  10% percent of total revenue is exported, but for real property taxes, the
  total exported is only about half that.</p>
<p>Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of shifting,
  the distinction between land and improvements was opaque. This is a remarkable
  oversight, because improvements typically depreciate at the rate of 0.5 to
  1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate.<a href="#endnotes"><em>9</em></a> And in view of the fact
  that assessments in New York localities have historically been very infrequent,
  one can understand how the land values are in reality a far higher proportion
  of parcel value than assessments would suggest.<em><a href="#endnotes">10</a></em> This means that in a period
  of seven years, for example, a property parcel could easily increase in price
  by 50 percent, far more if recent real estate market history is to be illustrative.
  Moreover real estate prices varied greatly in their rates of change during
  this time span; upstate New York was largely stable, but downstate localities
  experienced huge booms and busts.</p>
<p>Recognition of this would tend to favor what is known as the &#8220;new view&#8221; of
  property tax incidence, an acceptance of the idea that &#8221;the burden of
  the tax on improvements remains with the owners of capital in the form of a
  lower net return instead of being shifted to users of property in the form
  of higher rents or prices.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">11</a></em> Proponents point out that &#8220;the tax
  on improvements is essentially a nationwide tax on capital . . . [and therefore]
  its incidence will depend on the characteristics of supply and demand for capital
  nationally rather than on a single market.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">12</a></em> The effect of this is to
  make the tax &#8221;highly progressive.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">13</a></em> Nonetheless, in a small footnote,
  Messrs. Pomp and Phares elected to go with the &#8220;old view&#8221; in stating
  that, &#8220;it seems most appropriate to assume that the new view does not
  apply to the analysis of tax burdens within one specific state (underlining
  in original). Thus, the old or traditional view was adhered to in the analysis.
  . ; that is, the excise effect of the tax was considered dominant.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">14</a></em>  The ubiquity of New York's property tax, and that it has over 1,300 local assessment
  and tax districts, may well have escaped their notice.</p>
<p>This point is significant because the authors took great pains on several
  occasions to emphasize that the New York real property tax was the &#8220;most
  regressive element in the State's tax structure.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">15</a></em> In the Executive
  Summary, two of the thirteen bullets stressed that &#8221;the dominant influence
  in the tax system is the local real property tax,&#8221; and that &#8221;the
  local property tax is highly regressive, particularly the owner-occupied component.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">16</a></em></p>
<p>This was portrayed graphically, along with an accompanying table, using fourteen
  separate tax brackets showing effective tax rates ranging in a U, or a &#8220;reverse
  J curve,&#8221; from a high of 20.51 percent of income for the lowest group,
  to 3.37 percent for the second to highest group.<a href="#endnotes"><em>17</em></a> Nowhere in the Report is
  there an indication of what income measure was employed &#8211; Federal Adjusted
  Gross Income or Taxable Income, most likely. But it may also have been household
  income. If so, this could well have excluded significant income sources, particularly
  from those households receiving social security income and/or retirement income
  for New York State or local pensioners which is not taxable for state purposes.
  Whatever, this was recognized implicitly in the observation that &#8221;many
  persons are only temporarily in the lowest class ($0 - $4,199 for 1980) because
  of retirement, short-term unemployment, and so forth. If their income were
  measured over a longer period of time, rather than on the basis of only one
  year, they would not fall in the lowest class. Thus, the [drastically high
  effective tax rate] figure for this class . . . overstates the true burden
  on this group.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">18 </a></em></p>
<p><strong>A Deeper Examination of the Property Taxation Quagmire<a name="Deeper"></a></strong></p>
<p>  This last caveat suggests what is likely the most critical failing of the
      Report. The use of an income snapshot as the basis for measuring the effective
      tax
      burden on owners of real property reflects a misunderstanding of how tax
      equity should be construed. The value of property titles is a measure of
      wealth, and is likely to have little if any bearing on any momentary snapshot
      of income in a household. This confusion lies at the very core of difficulties
      in assessing the fairness of the property tax. Several studies of tax equity
      involving the real property tax fail to recognize that they are using income
      as a benchmark for analysis, even while the tax is upon wealth.</p>
<p>The problem as I see it is the mixing of two separate dimensions of economic
  value &#8211; what are frequently referred to as stock and flow. Stock value
  is a variable that has no time dimension, e.g., the stock of capital, or what
  in real estate is typically understood as the market price of a parcel.<a href="#endnotes"><em>19</em></a> Flow,
  by contrast, is the quantity of an economic variable measured over a period
  of time. So the flow of an investment may be measured as the amount of investment
  expenditure or the amount of income return in a given time, such as in a yearly
  period.<a href="#endnotes"><em>20</em></a> We can easily understand stock when looking at the value of a house
  or an office building just as we can for a car or a computer, as it represents
  the investment of labor and capital, and can be priced based on market supply
  and demand, depreciation, and replacement value much as with any other manufactured
  good.</p>
<p>The other component of a real property parcel is the land value, which reflects
  a market price based on very different criteria. Despite the apparent reality
  that land is visible and tangible, land prices reflect the value of location
  more than they do the material content they contain. This is easy to understand
  when one reflects that if some earth is removed from a site and brought to
  another place, the prices of each site is largely unaffected.<a href="#endnotes"><em>21</em></a> Location value
  has duration, and the value of this flow of rights for exclusive use of a site
  requires a flow price rather than a stock price. This flow is really what classical
  economists refer to as ground rent or economic rent.<a href="#endnotes"><em>22</em></a> Also known as &#8220;land
  rent,&#8221; it is defined as &#8220;a payment to a factor beyond what is needed
  to put that factor into use; [it is a price for use] beyond what is needed
  to maintain a market for land.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">23</a></em> Land has a selling price because we
  have come to regard land sites as objects, as commodities to be traded,<a href="#endnotes"><em>24</em></a> and
  they are understood to have a static price, as a stock rather than as a flow.
  That stock price really needs to be understood instead as the &#8220;present
  value&#8221; of the flow of ground rent minus taxes. &#8220;Present value&#8221; is
  an economic term that refers to &#8220;the worth of a future stream of returns
  or costs in terms of their value now.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">25</a></em> Consideration in this way brings
  to the fore other concerns and factors.</p>
<p>The market price of a location depends not only on ground rent and taxes,
  effectively its present value, but also upon the &#8220;discount rate,&#8221; or
  interest rate, that prevails in the market used to calculate its returns and
  costs. When interest rates go up, the market prices of sites fall, just as
  for any other economic encumbrances placed on locational sites. </p>
<p>The market prices of sites also fall if taxes go up and nothing else changes.
  However, an increase in taxes is often accompanied by improvements in any obligations
  linked to parcel locations. These too are sometimes easily &#8220;commodified,&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">26</a></em>  and may vary according to time period, changed neighborhood expectations, emergency
  conditions, government regulations, and so on.<a href="#endnotes"><em>27</em></a> These contingent links often
  constitute services that raise the market prices of sites more than the taxes
  depress them. Still another way of understanding the value of locations is
  to see them as capitalized transportation costs.<a href="#endnotes"><em>28</em></a> Savings in transportation
  are likely to be expressed in the market price of sites. One way or another
  people are willing to pay for access to exchange markets: either in the form
  of site proximity or in the form of travel expenses. It is the reason why urban
  cores have higher site rents than peripheral areas and hinterlands. Hence the
  differential value of locations, dependent, not on anything titleholders do,
  but rather on the quality of community amenities. These all have a price.</p>
<p> The prices for services that raise land rents, like the services themselves,
  should be regarded as flows rather than as stocks. But, ironically, our payments
  for such services are not understood as flows affecting site values at all,
  but are seen rather as related to stock prices. The values of our property
  parcels are viewed solely as stocks, and therefore our taxes are seen as stock
  taxes. </p>
<p><strong>Henry George&#8217;s Solution: Taxing the Flow of Land Rent<a name="HGSolution"></a></strong></p>
<p>  If land values are really the present values of anticipated future ground rents,
    one can certainly treat them as flows rather than stocks, just as community
    services are continuous flows. The amount of rent flowing through a site
    and through the economy is not negligible; what estimates have been made,
    where indeed the economic data allow it to be made, suggest that it is roughly
    a third of a nation&#8217;s GDP.<a href="#endnotes"><em>29</em></a> The question is whether it makes more
    sense to. Should we elect to continue property tax regimes as we do, it would
    make better sense to tax buildings as stocks and lands as rent flows. But
    this raises the question whether real property should be exempt from all
    taxes, as some have argued.<a href="#endnotes"><em>30</em></a> What rationale exists for taxing lands, whether
    as stocks or flows; and why do we tax buildings? I will argue below that
    taxing buildings and the failure to adequately tax land both have deleterious
    consequences for the whole economy. </p>
<p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any sort,
  so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained largely as
  a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or two have buildings
  represented any significant capital value; prior to the rise of major cities,
  the value of real property lay essentially in land. American cities today typically
  record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at least when the valuations
  are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of total taxable value, that is,
  of land and buildings taken together.<a href="#endnotes"><em>31</em></a> Skyscrapers reflect enormous capital
  investment, and this expenditure is warranted because of the enormous value
  of locational sites. Each site gets its market price from the fact that the
  total neighborhood context creates an attractive market presence and ambience.
  By taxing buildings, however, we impose a penalty on their optimum development
  as well as on the incentives for their maintenance. Moreover, taxes on buildings
  take away from whatever burden would otherwise be imposed on sites, with the
  result that incentives for their highest and best use is weakened. Lastly,
  the technical and administrative challenges of properly assessing the value
  of improvements is daunting, particularly since they must be depreciated for
  tax and accounting purposes, evaluated for potential replacement, and so on.
  In fact most costs associated with administration of property taxation and
  appeal litigation involve disputes over the valuation of structures, not land
  values. </p>
<p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
  are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or not.
  As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,<a href="#endnotes"><em>32</em></a> a tax
  on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax theory.
  Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking at ground
  rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock. The technical
  ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or as can also
  be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by the
  application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording of
  sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
  data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
  of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
  allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
  Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
  reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are easily
  created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic features.
  These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local or regional
  economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest market vitality
  and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed in ways that
  overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income is recognized
  as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood as such. </p>
<p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And what
  happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more than
  a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has since.
  He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by human hands
  or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land. Particular
  land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location for market
  exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless whether those
  who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent of their potential,
  the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with their full capacity.
  This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago observed that, &#8220;Landlords
  grow richer in their sleep without working, risking or economizing. The increase
  in the value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
  should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">33</a></em>  Absent its recovery by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to
  opportunistically situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected
  rental value is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching
  a market price and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery
  in taxes what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
  the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
  in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
  as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">34</a></em> It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
<p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
  created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell as
  a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
  earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common stock
  for men to labor and live on.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">35</a></em> This passage likely needs a bit of parsing
  for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since Roman times, has
  almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right to use the property
  of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;<em><a href="#endnotes">36 </a></em>Note also that
  Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not allotted
  to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to the living&#8221; might
  be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists who, taking an
  idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do not inherit the
  earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The presumption
  that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim that does not
  withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin ultimately to force
  or fraud.<a href="#endnotes"><em>37</em></a> </p>
<p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
  derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
  logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
  be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the recapture
  of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source of taxation.<a href="#endnotes"><em>38 </em></a></p>

<p>1. The formal name under the authorizing statute is the New York State Legislative
  Commission on the Modernization and Simplification of Tax Administration and
  Tax Law. It was first authorized in 1981, and has continued to receive funding
to the present time.</p>
<p>2. Shortly before, the Legislature had authorized the creation of the Temporary
  State Commission on The Real Property Tax, jointly accountable to Governor
  Cuomo, Senate Majority Leader, Warren Anderson, and Assembly Speaker, Stanley
  Fink. Its Executive Director was Laurence Farbstein. This commission continued
throughout the 1980s.</p>
<p>3.  The staff of the Legislative Tax Study Commission had six people for its
  initial and most productive years. There were two lawyers, an accountant, an
economist, a political scientist, and a secretary-administrator.</p>
<p>4.  This is amply demonstrated by economist Nicolas Georgescu-Roegen, <em>The
  Entropy Law and the Economic Process</em>. Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
  1971, and corroborated by Herman Daly, Steady-State Economics, 2nd Edition.

<p>10.  In recent years a greater effort has been made to bring assessments into
  line with actual market prices, but there is still no requirement in New York
  State that this be done. Connecticut now requires assessments every five years,
  and the State of Maryland takes responsibility for doing one-third of the localities
each year. </p>

potential liability to titleholders.</p>

<p>24.  One recent historical chronicler notes that, &quot;by the middle of the
  eighteenth century, the American idea of landed property had evolved beyond
  its English roots. Americans had begun to speculate on land. It had become
  a commodity.&quot; This would come to characterize treatment of land worldwide
  before very long. See. Andro Linklater, <em>Measuring America</em>. New York: Walker &amp; Co.,
  2002; and Robert J. Miller, <em>Native America: Discovered and Conquered</em>. Westport,
  CT: Praeger Press, 2006. This writer&#8217;s reviews are online at the Amazon.com

<p>27. An easy illustration is the requirement that sidewalks be cleared of snow
  within a certain interval after a storm. Alternate street parking, ration of
  privilege for communal amenities, garbage pick-up, and so on are all obligation
  linkages that may affect the market price of locations. Still more obvious
  still are community services like schools, libraries, public safety services,
and so on.</p>

<p>30.  It is not difficult to find people who argue for this solution, and there
  are no shortage of opinion pieces, legislative bills, and other evidence of
  this sentiment. A Google search on &#8220;abolish property tax&#8221; turned
up over a million hits.</p>

<p>34.  &#8220;Deadweight loss is the loss of producer&#8217;s or consumer&#8217;s
  surplus stemming from the price of a good being higher than marginal cost or
  to a tax that increases the cost. A lower quantity is purchased than would
  be the case without a tax or under ideal conditions, such as the elimination
  of artificial barriers to entry. (Fred E. Foldvary, <em>Dictionary of Free-Market
  Economics</em>. Northampton, MA: Edward Elgar Publishers, 1998. p. 103.) The attachment
  of economic rent to land sites means that a market of less than perfect competition
exists, thereby engendering deadweight loss.</p>

revealing that the term does not appear in The MIT Dictionary at all.</p>
<p>37.   This is a point that is made vigorously by disciples of Henry George.
  Central to many of the Georgist websites, I find the one at <a href="http://www.answersanswers.com">www.answersanswers.com</a>  particularly articulate on this point. George&#8217;s own speech, &#8220;Thou
  Shalt Not Steal,&#8221; delivered in New York City in 1887, is a classic, accessible
online at <a href="http://www.wealthandwant.com/HG/George_TSNS.html">www.wealthandwant.com/HG/George_TSNS.html</a>.</p>
<p>38.  Two prominent and early proponents of Henry George&#8217;s ideas wrote
  books with those very titles. Thomas Gaskell Shearman&#8217;s book, Natural
  Taxation, was published in 1895 and revised in 19ll; Charles Bowdoin Fillebrown&#8217;s
  book, <em>Principles of Natural Taxation</em>, was published in 1917. Both had extremely
  wide circulation and have considerable value in understanding the history and
context of the period. See my reviews on www.cooperativeindividualism.org. </p>
