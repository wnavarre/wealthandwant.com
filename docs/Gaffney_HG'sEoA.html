<small><b>Epilogue: how the
public demonstrates its preference for resolutions over dismal
choices</b> <br>
</small><br>
<p><a name="Introduction: Resolutions vs. t"></a><b>Introduction:
Resolutions vs. trade-offs</b></p>
<p>It is part of George's genius that his proposals solve one problem
by resolving it with another, turning two problems into one solution.
It is something like tuning up the orchestra for a concert, turning
dissonance into harmony, and keeping the beat together, turning
cacaphony into rhythm. It is the mark of good solutions that they
reconcile and resolve, rather than simply "trade-off."
<font size="-2"><i>1</i> </font> </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">1 If you ever immerse yourself in
mathematics deeply enough to find different proofs of the same
proposition, you recognize the epiphany when it all comes together, and
everything supports and confirms everything else. Then you know you
have the right answer. Good ideas and good policies support and
reinforce each other. </font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>That is what George means when he writes that "the laws of the
universe are harmonious." That is what Founding Fathers like
Washington, Jefferson and Franklin meant by a "natural order." Like
them, George is a deist in spirit, a believer in the consistency of
the universe. The concept that some things are more "natural" than
others is not arbitrary. The clue that one has found the "natural"
law is that it makes forces harmonize and team together instead of
clashing, and neutralizing each other.
<font size="-2"><i>2</i></font> The principle of constructive
synthesis - a touch of Hegel - is another way of perceiving the value
of turning cacaphony into harmony.<font size="-2">
<i>3</i></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">2. In this view, the "natural harmony" is
  recognized by its power to reconcile. Deadlocks and standoffs resolve
  into teamwork, yielding gains at little or no cost. Today, philosophers
  may avoid terms like "natural law." Call it what you will, it is a
  powerful idea and a worthy goal. Fashions and terms change: principles
  endure.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 3. Richard Noyes recently published Now the
    Synthesis. A synthesis is a reconciliation and resolution, a harmonious
    blending of the best of what had appeared (or had been made to appear)
    to be clashing forces between which hard choices must be made. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Economists today offer us mainly "trade-offs" and hard choices. For
every good thing we must give up another, so net gains are just
marginal. That is the approved posture: it makes one seem
hard-headed, worldly, and practical. Too much positive thinking
sounds suspiciously optimistic, and invites rebellious cynical
muttering that "there ain't no free lunch." It goes back at least to
Malthus, who offered mankind the hard choice of food vs. sex. That
sort of thinking is what made people call economics "the dismal
science."</p>
<p>A true resolution is much more to be desired. To get one good
thing we get a second one as well. It is remarkable how many "hard
choices" are turned into benign resolutions in George's program. He
is a genius at finding the essential harmony of interests now
concealed beneath confused thinking. Instead of a dismal trade-off,
there is a "free lunch," or "synergy": the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts. Such grand resolutions, when possible, deserve to
be called "true win-win solutions." <font size="-2"><i>4
</i></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">4. As commonly used today, "win-win
solution" is just a euphemism for a trade-off, in which the loser of a
resource "wins" by getting paid. Often it is worse: the "winnings" of
one or both parties represent resources stolen from the public domain,
while concealing the loss to the public.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The most obvious such true win-win
solution is putting the
unemployed to work. </span>Recognizing this truth is no monopoly of
George:
Keynesian economists long insisted that there is no social cost in
putting the unemployed to work. It is a measure of the bankruptcy
and myopia of many economists today that even those voices are muted,
and that obvious gain is denied: working is called a "sacrifice of
leisure," just another trade-off. Unemployment has become
"job-searching." <font size="-2"><i>5</i></font> It is more likely a
sacrifice of burglary, vandalism, drug-use, jail time, loitering,
looting, collecting welfare, and sullen misery. Trading such bad
time for the gratification, pride, on-the-job learning, and moral
uplift of working is not a trade-off, but a double gain. It is a
true "free lunch," if you will.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">5 Before long, some economist will
proclaim that sleeping on heating grates is "home-searching."</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> Many economists today react to such ideas with reflexive
disbelief. They put down optimistic claims by calling them
"panaceas," too good to be true. TAANSTAAFL
<font size="-2"><i>6</i></font> is their slogan; cynicism their
preferred posture. However, false pessimism is just as false and
damaging as false optimism. A truer slogan is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TITSTAAFL: "There Is
Too Such a Thing As A Free Lunch."</span> It's rather a question of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">WIGGI?:
"Who Is Going to Get It?"</span>. Many dismal alleged trade-offs are
just
someone's mental blocks that stand athwart the path to abundance, or,
worse, ways to control and exploit us. Often, in fact, "we can have
it all." Is it too good to be true? Let us itemize the many
resolutions of alleged trade-offs and standoffs that George's program
will achieve.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">6 "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free
Lunch."</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Two of George's resolutions are to reconcile efficiency and
equity, and to square taxes and incentives.</b> That is a good
start, and a compelling vision. What more can a reasonable person
ask of economic policy than to resolve these ancient basic standoffs
that have confused and divided us, blocked understanding, deadlocked
constructive action, and seized up the polity for generations? It is
an achievement on a par with resolving Evolution and Creation, except
George's program is something we can do something about and put to
use. As we proceed, however, we will see sixteen such resolutions in
George's program.</p>
<p><a name="1. Equity, Efficiency, and Ince"></a><b>1. Equity,
Efficiency, and Incentives </b></p>
<p><a name="a.  Equity and efficiency"></a><b>a. Equity and
efficiency</b></p>
<p>George refutes the commonplace idea that we must choose between
equity and efficiency. This idea is premised on identifying "equity"
with price and rent controls designed to help the poor against the
rich; or with counter-incentive progressive income taxation, with its
warping, suppressive effects. George rejects both price controls and
progressive income taxation, and identifies a different tax policy
that brings us both equity and efficiency together. He would untax
productive activity, and instead base taxes on land, in proportion to
its value. <b>This combines the magic of justice with the magic of
incentive. </b></p>
<p> George's land tax promotes equity toward the landless in at least
four ways. </p>
<ul>
  <li>One, it relieves them of taxes, to the extent that landowners pay
more; </li>
  <li>Two, it makes jobs by removing all tax penalties from hiring
workers, and also because the land tax, a fixed charge, spurs
landowners to use land to earn cash to pay the taxes;</li>
  <li>Three, while jobs are generating new money incomes, new
production supplies more goods and services. Those give substance to
the money incomes, precluding inflation such as poisoned the springs of
Keynesian "fiscal stimulus";</li>
  <li>Four, it offers the landless new chances to acquire land
themselves, as old owners release surplus lands to the market. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="b.  Reconciling progressivity a"></a><b>b. Reconciling
progressivity and motivation.</b></p>
<p>A land tax abates concentration of wealth and power without
limiting ambition or enterprise. It taxes wealth while sparing both
capital and income. It puts no cap on ambition and enterprise,
except to redirect those useful traits into creation, production,
hiring, and capital formation, and away from the zero-sum game of
land-grabbing. </p>
<p>It requires no incentive-warping progressive rate: all land is
taxed at the same rate, in proportion to value. The tax achieves
progressivity by using the observed reality that wealth rises with
income, faster than income; and landholdings rise with wealth, faster
than wealth. Otherwise put, the land tax offsets concentration
because ownership of wealth is more concentrated than income; and
ownership of land is more concentrated than other forms of wealth. As
George said, "The great cause of the concentration of wealth is
concentration of the ownership of land."
<font size="-2"><i>7</i></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">7 Data in support of these points are
found in M. Gaffney, "The Taxable Capacity of Land," bound herein; and
in M. Gaffney, "The Property Tax is a Progressive Tax," on reserve.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>At the state or local level, George's program is the answer to
California Governor Pete Wilson' dilemma, and every governor's
dilemma:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it untaxes and attracts capital, and encourages capital
formation, without giving away the store, or untaxing the rich, or
starving the schools and police.  </li>
  <li>It raises state revenues from the
richest people while attracting business and wealth with the very
same stroke.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The unique, remarkable quality of a
property tax based
on land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land, however high the tax rate. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Not one square foot will walk out
of town. The only bad thing to say
about this tax's incentive effects is that it stimulates
revitalization, and makes jobs.</span> If some people think that is
bad,
maybe they are the problem.</span>
<p>So George's simple program not only reconciles efficiency and
equity, it squares taxes and incentives. </p>
<p><a name="2. Reconciling demand side and"></a><b>2. Reconciling
demand side and supply side economics</b></p>
<p><b><a name="a.  Aggregate.  Consumption and"></a>a. Aggregate.
Consumption and production</b></p>
<p>George's tax program stimulates both the demand side and the
supply side. Here is the gist of why it works where other methods
fail. <b> A land tax spurs landowners to use land to earn cash to pay
the taxes. A land tax creates pressure on owners to hire and produce
more; other taxes create pressures to hire and produce less.</b> That
works because it is a fixed charge: it cannot be avoided by
underusing land, and it is not increased by using it. It applies
leverage to landowners, just as would a fixed debt service. Leverage
means that a landowner, by raising gross output 20%, for example, may
raise his net income by 100%.</p>
<p>On the demand side, to repeat, </p>
<ul>
  <li>it makes jobs by removing tax penalties from hiring workers and
creating capital. </li>
  <li>Second, a land tax creates pressure on owners to hire more; other
taxes create pressures to hire less. </li>
  <li>Third, untaxing capital and its income raises the incentive to
invest, answering those who still dispute Say's Law. </li>
  <li>Fourth, tax revenues are spent locally (whereas rents paid to
absentee owners are spent distantly). </li>
</ul>
<p> The program operates at the same time on supply. Unlike the
travesty of supply-side stimulus offered from Washington these last
several years, this is supply-side economics with a real kick. It
works through tax transformation rather than tax
reduction.<font size="-2"><i>8</i></font> This is "true fiscal
stimulus." A land tax creates pressure on owners to produce more;
other taxes create "fiscal drag," i.e. pressures to produce less. We
can raise taxes (if desired), and stimulate supply in the same
stroke: there is no hard choice to make between them. The increase
of supply gives substance to the rise of demand: there is a flow of
new goods to meet the flow of new demand. This precludes inflation,
the fatal flaw in Keynesian "fiscal stimulus" (which is all on the
demand side).</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">8 The total tax take may be raised or
lowered, as a separate issue.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Georgist fiscal stimulus achieves full employment not only without
inflation, but also without deficits. The stimulus works through the
motivational effect of the tax on landowners. Unlike other taxes,
stimulus rises with the rate of taxation. We may run surpluses and
retire debt, pumping capital into the private sector, while still
providing fiscal stimulus from government. That rise of land taxes
will not lower, but raise the MRORAT (discussed next).</p>
<p><a name="b.  Investing and Saving"></a><b>b. Investing and
Saving</b> </p>
<p>Untaxing new investing raises
<a name="MRORAT (the marginal rate of re"></a><b>MRORAT (the marginal
rate of return after taxes)</b>. This is what Keynes called the
"marginal efficiency of capital," which he identified as "the
inducement to invest." To demand-siders, it is the motor that drives
the macro-economy, raises national income via the multiplier effect,
and offsets the propensity to save.</p>
<p>Georgist tax policy raises MRORAT in at least three ways. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First is the obvious lowering of direct taxes on capital and its
income. </li>
  <li>Second is the lower payroll tax, part of which is borne by
investors when they hire workers. Lowering this tax raises returns to
investors, especially to those who invest in labor-using operations. </li>
  <li>Third is the higher pressure on landowners to attract capital and
hire labor. </li>
  <li>A fourth way is cumulative: any policy that has basic stimulative
effects raises aggregate demand, which in turn raises investor "animal
spirits" in a benign upward spiral. <font size="-2"><i>9</i></font>
    <blockquote><font size="-1">9 The common Presidential practice of
trying to raise spirits by "jawboning" is a recognition of this effect.
Jawboning alone is usually transparent and futile, however: there must
be substance first; then, jawboning is not even needed.</font></blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> Untaxing buildings obviously draws in outside capital, which is
good locally, but is not capital formation to the whole economy. In
Keynesian models, higher income leads to higher saving, and does
create new capital. Supply-siders today worry more about raising the
rate of saving from any given income. In supply-side models it is
more important to increase the rate of saving, without depending
entirely on the Keynesian effect, where higher income raises saving.
Also, from the nationalist viewpoint, it is better to supply
investable funds from domestic savings, to minimize foreign
ownership. </p>
<p>Land taxation helps here, too. Land taxation, if heavy enough to
count, lowers the investment value of land, through "tax
capitalization". There is a diminishing marginal utility of savings
to any wealth-holder, meaning the more you have, the less you need
more. With land devalued, those needing wealth seek substitute
assets to replace land in their portfolios. To acquire those
additional assets they must save more, and invest the savings in real
new capital, rather than land.</p>
<p>Thus, Georgist taxation meets the proper goals of supply-side
economics: raising output, and raising saving. It reconciles
supply-side economics with taxation by providing a mode of taxation
that stimulates instead of dragging down production and employment.
<font size="-2"><i>10</i></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">10 What Georgist policy does not meet are
the improper goals of supply-side economics, that is camouflaging
unearned incomes as needed stimuli for capital formation and
production. Alas, this is how "supply side" has actually been misused
in Washington these last several years.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="3.  Micro &quot;structural&quot; reform c"></a><b>3. Micro
"structural" reform coupled with macro reform</b> </p>
<p>A weakness of Keynesian policy is its scorn for structural reform,
e.g. combating monopolies and sticky markets. It relies solely on
Federal fiscal policy. Its focus is so narrow that even monetary
policy, which seems so closely allied in spirit, is regarded as rival
rather than complementary. Thus, when inflation pricked the
Keynesian bubble, there was little left to offer except the dismal
Phillips Curve trade-off.</p>
<p>Georgist policy improves the structure of the economy in at least
five ways.</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">a. It erases the "wedge
effect" of indirect taxes, while maintaining tax revenues.</span> This
might be called a "True Laffer Curve effect" - what Laffer and Reagan
promised in 1980, but Reagan could not deliver. The wedge effect is
both warping, and, in the aggregate, anti-incentive.
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">b. It actually lubricates the
land market in the very process of extracting more tax revenues from
it. </span>It is better than "neutral" (lacking in wedge effects). It
subjects landowners to a cash drain that is more potent than mere
"opportunity cost" in prompting landowners to put land to its "highest
and best use," i.e. to allocate it optimally in the manner prescribed
by economic theory. The writer has developed this point elsewhere. <font
 size="-2"><i>11</i></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote><font size="-1">11 "Land as a distinctive factor of
production," bound herein. "Tax reform to release land," on reserve. </font>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">c. It combats monopoly restriction of
output by making it costlier to withhold land from use. Likewise, it
combats monopsonistic exploitation of workers.</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">d. It unlocks urban land markets
that are frozen up by the tendency of firms to buy and hold land for
possible future expansion. </span>This is a form of vertical
integration which, like all withholding actions, is self-reinforcing
and self-validating, hence cumulative in its impact. That is, if A and
B are tying up surplus land for their possible future needs, that
forces C, D, and E to do the same because they cannot rely on the open
market to supply the land when and if needed. <i>A fortiori</i>,
speculative preemptors who hold key parcels to profit from others
attempts to assemble buildable parcels, or to compete in key markets,
force others to do likewise in self-defense. The pooling function of
the free market is impaired. Conversely, the gains from correcting such
market failures are also self-reinforcing and cumulative, providing us
with many "free lunches."</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">e. It makes landownership more
available to small business, and new businesses, by lowering the market
price of land.</span> It substitutes a deferred annual charge for a
high price up front. This has the same effect as extending credit to
all market agents on identical terms, thus offsetting the otherwise
overpowering bias of credit rationing and discrimination in lending.
Large surpluses of land are released to the market as the tax cost of
withholding land forces it to be sold.</p>
</blockquote>
It should be apparent that each of those effects helps markets
work they way competitive theory says they should. Their aggregate
effect is overwhelming.
<p>Some Georgists have made their case on structural grounds alone. We
have seen, however, that these are in addition to the macro
effects.</p>
<p><a name="4.  Local, state, and national"></a><b> 4. Local, state,
and national applications</b></p>
<p>Georgist policy can be applied at any level: local, state, or
national. To some extent it is even applied at a world level,
through the U.N., with its concept of "common heritage" applied to
oceanic resources of the deep seabeds. </p>
<p>Georgist tax policy can also be applied at any tax rate, low or
high. A low rate does a little good; a high rate does a lot of
good.</p>
<p>In this Century, strenuous efforts have been made to box the
property tax into the local level, where local particularism tends to
cap the rate. In England, this policy is identified with the
half-brothers, Austen and Neville Chamberlain. Neville was so
successful that in 1938 he was forced to face Adolf Hitler without
any armed support, with the disaster at Munich. In America the
Federal government last taxed land in the Georgist manner during the
Civil War. After 1913 it taxed the income from land, but in recent
years the income tax has degenerated into a payroll tax primarily. In
tandem with the other payroll tax it has become a primary cause of
our depressed labor market.</p>
<p>In 1920, about half of all <b>state</b> revenues (not counting
local) came from state property taxes. These tended to focus on
land, rather than capital, much more than now. Both the state and
Federal governments could tax land again, any time the voters send
that message.</p>
<p><a name="5.  Relieving labor without bur"></a><b>5. Relieving
labor without burdening capital</b></p>
<p>Georgist tax policy would downtax labor without uptaxing capital,
and without lowering public revenues. That is possible because the
economic world is not dualistic. There is a third factor, land,
which George would tax instead.</p>
<p>The taxable capacity of land is surprisingly high. It has been
concealed conceptually by many sophisms inherent in modern economic
theory, and concealed statistically by rolling land rent into other
categories. A good deal of potential rent has also been aborted by
the counterproductive tax methods used on buildings and labor. This
is a big topic, treated in "The taxable capacity of land," and "How
to revive a dying city," bound herein, and "Adequacy of land as a tax
base," and "The synergistic city," on reserve.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A great deal of latent rent would
be generated by new, full
development. It is not just the individual sites that matter here,
but the synergistic community effects of active renewal and full,
timely development. </span></p>
<ul>
  <li>The positive neighborhood effects of replacing
old buildings with new are irresistible and contagious, raising land
prices all around.  </li>
  <li>The converse is also true: the negative
neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand without replacement
are depressive.  </li>
</ul>
Thus, when you take the tax off new buildings, and
put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick off a general
process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope into optimism:
optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax base.
<p>New development likes to anchor onto healthy neighborhoods. Richard
Hurd, father of urban studies in America, taught us in 1902
that land values are marked by <b>continuity in space</b>. It's
still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles endure.</p>
<p>Even Heinrich von Thuenen, father of location theory, approached
cities in an arid, antiseptic way that left out most of the sperm and
egg, enzyme and ferment that today we call urban linkages and
synergy. George was a <i>mensch</i>, like Holly Whyte or Jane
Jacobs, seeing cities in intensely human, interactive terms. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">George
saw cities as </span><i
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">foci</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> of
communication, cooperation,
socialization and exchange, and these as the basis of civilization.
He saw cities as the new frontier, an endless series of new frontiers
because the city as a whole enjoys increasing returns: the presence
of people with good mutual access, associating on equal terms,
expedites cooperation and specialization through the market.
</span>Multivariate interactions in cities are synergistic. Indeed,
while
each part -- each parcel of land -- is developed in the stage of
decreasing returns, the composite city is generally in a stage of
increasing returns, thanks to synergy: the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts, and increases to the whole yield more than the sum
of increases to the parts. </p>
<p>Urban blight is cumulative and self-reinforcing: blighted
buildings cast a pall on land around them, discourage upkeep and
stifle renewal. Whatever slows renewal of one site therefore slows
the neighborhood, which reflects back blight to the first, a vicious
downward spiral. </p>
<p>Conversely, new buildings help stimulate renewal around
them.<font size="-2"><i>12</i></font> The rule is that new
buildings draw tenants from old and weaken other Defenders so other
owners have to renew, too. When they do, where better than next to
the newest, hottest building? So renewal is cumulative, just like
blight, only upwards in a benign spiral. A benign spiral is a "free
lunch," the kind that cynics say "there ain't no such thing as." These
matters are treated in the works cited above. </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-2">12 There are exceptions. Some new
buildings, especially banks and corporate headquarters, sterilize a
block with blank walls. I will not defend that, but the exception is
not the rule; the abuse is not the precept. </font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When a city untaxes buildings its land prices, the new tax base,
are pushed up. Competition for sites raises the tax base -- not
buildings, now, but land prices derived from ground rents. Using the
higher base the city can improve public services, if needed, but
without taxing any building, without scaring away any generators of
fiscal surpluses. In this scenario, buildings raise the tax base
indirectly, by raising the value of land around them. So do
productive people, when their wages are not taxed away. </p>
<p>Land prices are raised just by the expectation of new buildings'
being tax free. The mere expectation will <i>immediately</i> boost
the value of land, even before the new buildings go up.</p>
<p><a name="6.  Urban renewal without subsi"></a><b>6. Urban renewal
without subsidizing evictions</b></p>
<p>Georgist tax policy helps renew cities, without subsidizing or
administering teardowns and "clearance" of old buildings and
neighborhoods. Georgist policy does not speed renewal by penalizing
old buildings, but by encouraging new ones. It does not subsidize
new ones, it just stops penalizing them. Teardown is never an end in
itself; it only comes when incidental to releasing land for new
buildings of greater capacity. This matter is covered in "How to
renew a dying city," bound herein.</p>

<p><a name="a.  Taxing land sharpens market"></a><b>a. Taxing land

</b> Thus it makes the land market work better, and follow its
natural infilling, centralizing tendency. Curbing urban sprawl does
not overrule the land market; it is a byproduct of making the market
work better. Richard Hurd, as cited above, noted that land values
are marked by continuity in space. That means the market is telling
owners to develop land contiguously; to anchor new building to
established strength. Sprawl, then, is not market driven, but
market-defying. It is the product of market failure. Georgist
taxation makes the market work better.

<p><a name="b.  Fosters resident ownership,"></a><b>b. Fosters
resident ownership, civic participation</b></p>
<p>Riverside, CA built itself a lovely downtown pedestrian mall, back
when that was in vogue, and has been sorry ever since. Nothing worked
out, retailers deserted, and half the stores are empty. Recently I
asked the developer of Tyler Galleria, a success, why he thought
downtown failed, and got the answer in two words: "absentee
ownership." I should have known, I've preached it for years. </p>
<p>An agricultural adviser in Fresno once told an impressionable boy
"The best dressing for soil is the owner's shadow, applied daily." In
town they say "Who's keeping the store?" Absentees aren't the
only negligent owners, nor are they all bad. Torpid owners are the
problem and they come in many forms. Basically, to make a city go
you want to be rid of owners who see real estate mainly as a cash cow
for their retirement, and replace them with owners who see it as a
vehicle for their enterprise, who "apply their shadows" daily. Those
shadows will also follow them into local civic clubs, and
enterprising downtown and neighborhood associations for making joint
improvements.</p>
<p><a name="8.  Reconciles common rights to"></a><b>8. Reconciles
common rights to land with private tenure</b></p>
<p>Georgist policy harmonizes collectivism and individalism;
government and the market; common rights and private tenure. It has
been called "commons without tragedy," because it lets common-access
resources like fisheries and open ranges be closed off, without
destroying common rights. The principle is simple and basic. Common
lands, with open access, become overcrowded. Optimal management
calls for restricting entry and usage. Entry is limited by issuing
licenses (or leases, permits, concessions, possessory interests,
etc.). However, instead of giving these away gratis, as is the
current practice, they are leased out annually to the highest bidder.
Thus, those excluded are compensated, while those included get only
what they pay for.</p>
<p>As to land already in private tenure, taxation asserts common
rights to the income of that land, without impairing private tenure
rights. Indeed, private tenure is strengthened when the owner can
truly say "This is my land, I pay the taxes on it." Squatters,
trespassers, and vandals may be evicted with a clear conscience:
their common rights have been protected otherwise, through the tax
system. Thus, the policy reconciles common rights and heavy taxation
with the free market and strong private tenure rights. </p>
<p>In addition, taking tax revenues from land lets capital and labor
go untaxed. Private property in labor - the basic right of a person
to himself, as posited by John Locke - and private property in
capital, the right of a person to the full value of what he saves,
are strengthened.</p>
<p><a name="9. Paying the debt while also m"></a><b>9. Paying the
debt while also making jobs</b></p>
<p>President Clinton has adopted a policy based on the premise that
Keynesian "fiscal stimulus" is really "crowding out," so paying the
debt can stimulate the private sector via "reverse crowding-out." The
problem here is that it is based entirely on pushing more
investable funds into the private sector, with nothing to raise the
demand for those funds.</p>
<p>Georgist taxation lets the debt be paid, while at the same time
raising investing opportunities in the private sector, as shown
above. </p>
<p><a name="10. Making labor cheaper to hir"></a><b>10. Making labor
cheaper to hire without lowering wage rates</b></p>
<p>Georgist policy removes the many big tax wedges between worker and
employer, and employer and customer, and worker and consumable goods.
Thus labor can cost the employer less, while the worker gets more
disposable income after-tax. Many economists inveigh against the
minimum wage, claiming it overprices labor. It is a matter of
suspicion that they are then silent on the deadly effects of the
payroll tax, which affects workers at all levels. Sales taxes, too,
cut into real wages, yet many of these same economists would raise
sales taxes and introduce VAT. President and Mrs. Clinton now speak
seriously of raising payroll taxes even more, to finance the new
health plan.</p>
<p>There is a high elasticity of demand for labor. This may be
observed in farming, for example, where landowners have avoided union
wage rates simply by shifting their land from fresh fruits and
vegetables to labor-sparing uses like small grains or cotton.
Conversely, removing the payroll tax burden will move owners to shift
land back into labor-using enterprises.</p>
<p><a name="11.  Adding people and capital"></a><b>11. Adding people
and capital w/o diluting resource base</b></p>
<p>Georgist policy lets a region, nation, or the world add population
and/or capital without diluting its resource base. It is as though
rescuers pulled drowning people into a lifeboat, and their presence
made the boat expand instead of sink! Call it <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"The Accommodating
Lifeboat Theorem."</span> It sounds like the Miracle of the Loaves and
Fishes, but it is a different kind of miracle: synergy. It comes
from the power of enlarging the market, as described by George in his
chapter on the effects of increased population, and Adam Smith in his
aphorism, "the division of labor is limited by the extent of the
market." An indication of it is that bigger cities around the world
have more land value per head than small ones, as documented by
William Alonso. </p>
<p>We must temper this claim. Bigger cities are often located on
better land, so size isn't all that accounts for Alonso's finding.
However, more than sheer size, and more than good natural location,
is the internal circulation of a city. Georgist policies are
essential to financing good circulation, containing sprawl, and
inducing private land development complementary to the circulatory
system.</p>
<p><a name="12.  Fostering economy in gover"></a><b>12. Fostering
economy in government in the very process of raising revenue</b></p>
<p>Anti-governmentalists often identify any tax policy with public
extravagance. Georgist tax policies, on the contrary, help save
public funds in at least two general ways.</p>
<blockquote>a. Putting the unemployed to work saves many public costs,
like welfare, obviously, crime-fighting, and, ultimately, putting down
civil disturbances and insurrections.
  <p>b. Putting the unemployed to work also raises demand and, by so
doing, helps make plain to all the desirability of unleashing supply.
Now, supply in some industries is deliberately held down to support
prices. U.S. agriculture is a good example: supply restraints are
transparent because they are matters of public law. The U.S.D.A. pays
landowners to fallow some 60 million acres each year, to raise food and
clothing prices. Under Georgist policy those acres would go to work
producing food and paying taxes, both.</p>
  <p>c. Georgist policies obviate subeconomic extensions of public
works, which now are pushed by the powerful combination of land
speculators seeking increments, the jobless seeking work, and the
homeless seeking shelter. Georgist policies open up the naturally
better land to settlement, thus relieving the pressure to invade flood
plains, steep erosive slopes, flammable brushlands, wetlands, and other
places that soak up heavy public funds to reach, develop, service, and
protect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, these policies deflate the "rent-seeking"
motivations of land speculators to sue for state and federal aid. Under
George's scheme, the unearned increments secured by
"rent-seeking" lobbying for public works would be taxed away.</p>
<p>In the longer run it seems reasonable to expect that more genuine
productive job opportunities at home would reduce the pressures for
military spending, at least those portions which are strictly
boondoggling of a make-jobs nature. </p>
<p><a name="13.  Enhance evironment and con"></a><b>13. Enhance
evironment and conserve resources while making jobs </b></p>
<p>Georgist tax policy acts to abort subeconomic extensions of public
works, as noted just above. Not only does this save public funds, it
protects the environment. Saving public funds and saving wildlands
and waters are perfect complements.</p>
<p>"Jobs vs. the environment" is the dismal trade-off offered by
confused thinking. A Georgist economy is resource-saving as well as
job-making. It saves resources by focusing human activities
intensively on the lands that are used, leaving or releasing marginal
lands for wildlife, recreation, wetlands, watershed protection, etc. </p>
<p>There was once a tendency for environmentalists to oppose human
use of land wherever and whenever they could. Now, most of them are
looking at the whole human system. The Sierra Club is supporting
urban infilling, seeing that demands that are not met here are bound
to pop up there.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> John Baden, a Pacific
Northwest forest economist,
sums it up in a few words: timber should be grown on lands that are
flat, warm, wet, and near markets.</span> Georgist tax pressure applied
to
those "Site I" lands will promote exactly that, leaving the steep,
arid slopes for scenery, watershed, and recreation.</p>
<p><a name="Summary"></a><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Dismal trade-offs, deadlocks, and standoffs are just mental blocks
and smokescreens. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George began
with a quest for justice in
sharing the rent surplus. He found that justice and efficiency are
not at odds, we can have both.</span> This trade-off that many
economists
expound is a stall, a put-off to enervate and unman us so we won't do
anything. It may ease the conscience to think justice must be
sacrificed for efficiency, and schools starved and libraries closed
to free up incentives, so nothing, really, can ever be done. We all
feel compassion by nature but, to survive and stay whole in this
world of beggars and bandits, learn to harden our hearts and cork it
in. We learn to screen out evidence of suffering and injustice, and
rationalize what we cannot deny. This mindset, while understandable,
is unaffordable in a period of dangerous national decline, and
growing division between haves and have-nots. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">What we have shown here is not just that
we can have both justice
and efficiency, but more, we cannot have either one without the
other. If we don't share rents efficiently, in the Georgist manner,
social and political pressures will continue to cause inefficient
sharing and eventual dissipation.</p>
<p>Economic discourse is afflicted with pessimists who firmly cling
to mutually inconsistent positions at the same time, each posing an
insoluble problem. Some, for example, believe the world is racing to
starvation, and favor limiting demand through birth control, while in
another context they deplore "overproduction," or "underconsumption,"
and favor choking off farm production to keep farmers from losing
money. George, of course, would see demand as the answer to supply,
and land as the field on which the twain may meet and satisfy each
other, leveling them upwards.</p>
<p>Again, some favor cheap power and good roads for rural areas,
regardless of cost, and then favor low-density zoning to keep people
out. George, of course, would favor infilling to make full use of
short interior lines at high capacity, and lower cost per
customer.</p>
<p> <a name="A summary of reconciliations"></a><b>A summary of
reconciliations</b></p>
<p>Herewith is a summary of reconciliations that Georgist tax policy
achieves. </p>
1. Couples equity with efficiency.2. Couples progressivity with motivation.
    Abates concentration of wealth and power while widening the scope of productive
    ambition
  and enterprise.3. Makes more jobs without inflation. Raises demand-side and
supply-side together, "leveling them upwards."4. Raises both inducement to invest and inducement to save, at
any income level. Also raises saving by raising income level.5. Couples structural reform and macro reform.6. May be applied at local, state, and national levels, together
or jointly, in small degrees or large.7. Relieves labor of taxation without burdening capital, and vice
versa.8. Renews cities without subsidizing evictions.9. Contains urban sprawl, infills and coordinates cities without
superimposing planning on the market.10. Fosters resident ownership and civic participation without
laws against absentee ownership, or other use of compulsion, but in
the very process of lubricating land markets.11. Asserts common rights to land while strengthening private
tenure. Permits of privatizing without giveaway.12. Allows paying off public debts while fostering full
employment through (true) fiscal stimulus.13. Makes labor cheaper to hire while
raising real wage rates (take-home pay, disposable income). Thus makes jobs without
lowering
wage rates or "making work."14. Lets regions, nations, and the world add population and

<p><a name="Epilogue: how the public demons"></a><b>Epilogue: how the
public demonstrates its preference for resolutions over dismal
choices</b></p>
<p>Preaching hard trade-offs is not popular. Voters see through it
as a confession of cluelessness. We hear a lot about voter apathy,
but voters have responded positively at various times to candidates
with positive resolutions, or apparent ones.</p>
<p>Remember the "Phillips Curve" of the late 1970s? "The public has
to grow up and choose," the gurus said with some condescension. It's
either inflation or unemployment. Soon the voters came up with a
third choice, they retired those unavailing later Keynesians.</p>
<p>Next it was Reagan and Laffer, who said you can have lower tax
rates and higher tax revenues, more defense and a lower deficit. Talk
about panaceas! This one proved to be a fraud, but the voters
loved it until they slowly realized the promise couldn't possibly be
delivered.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Now it is the <b>privatizers</b>.
They have learned to sell the
product by soft-pedaling "trade-offs." Instead, they talk about
"win-win" solutions, a new euphemism for trade-offs that camouflages
them as resolutions, and hides the sneaky truth that much of the wins
come from privatizing public property without compensation. The
public will stop falling for it as they finally realize that most of
these are really "win-win-lose" solutions, with the public as the
loser.</p>
<p>30 years ago, it was "demand-side economics" (as it was later
called). It was mostly Keynesian "fiscal policy," with some
monetary policy, also demand-sided, as its Tweedledum rival. Keynes
became popular because orthodox economists, unavailing, had reduced
themselves to posing a hard choice. To escape from depression, they
said, you must first suffer dismally: cut wages, consume less. It's
like a hangover, you must repent of the good times you had in the
roaring twenties. The voters rejected that preaching thumpingly.</p>
<p>Keynes had better news. He said you can have it all: raise wages,
consume more, enjoy more public services, and in result find people
saving more and working more! People who followed his ideas won
elections for years. With all its faults and charlatanism, Keynesian
economics was at least optimistic and hopeful. It lasted until his
successors fell into the dismal trade-off mode of the Phillips
Curve.</p>
<p> Before that it was the New Deal panacea: national planning. Before
that, at least in the States under Herbert Hoover, it was
business "Associationism": cartels, plus peace pacts, red-baiting,
debt retirement, the corporate state, two chickens in every pot and a
car in every garage. We know where that led.</p>
<p>Before those panaceas there was Henry George. He, like popular
figures after him, was anything but dismal. He, too, said "we can
have it all." It made his ideas very popular. We are often told
that Georgism never really made it, but that is warped history. It
never "took over" lock, stock and barrel, but it won substantial
minorities, to whom real concessions were made. His ideas were at
their political crest roughly from 1901-20. <font size="-2"><i>14</i></font>
They were incorporated into The
Progressive Movement.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">14 They were carried towards the top by
such well-known figures as David Lloyd George in England, Alexandr
Kerensky in Russia, Sun Yat-sen in China, hundreds of local and state,
and a few powerful national politicians in both Canada and the U.S.A.,
Billy Hughes in Australia, Rolland O'Regan in New Zealand, Chaim
Weizmann in Palestine, Francisco Madero in Mexico, and many others
around the world. In the States, they were an integral part of the
Progressive Movement, which for a time dominated both our major
parties. In England, Lloyd George's budget speech of 1909 reads in part
as though written by Henry George himself; some of<a href="../auth/Churchill.html"> Winston Churchill's
speeches</a> <i>were</i> written by Georgist ghosts.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the other panaceas cited, George's never failed. It would
be fairer to say it fell to the loss of young leaders in World War I,
and the marathon Red Scare that dominated much of the world from 1919
to 1989. The Red Scare energized property defenders everywhere; by
confusion, its victims included Georgism. It made Georgists pull in
their horns until their message lost its vigor and excitement: its
resolving qualities, which were derided as "panaceas." Now, with the
fall of the Soviet Empire, is a good time to pick up where the
Progressive Movement was aborted.</p>
