in the case of the High Tax plan: --
      <p>1. The wit of man can not so fix it as to help all trades in a fair
        way. What helps one hurts the next. If you put a tax on tools to help
        the trade that makes tools, you, of course, hurt the trade that has to
        use such tools, and as new trades spring up this mess grows worse and
        worse.</p>
      <p>2. Aid has now to be lent to new trade, as pap is fed to babes, and
        it is a case of pay, pay, pay, till the child is grown up. But, strange
        to say, it does not grow up at all, but with each year of its age, calls
        for more and more pap.</p>
      <p>3 No man on earth, let him be wise as he may, can tell what is paid
        now to any one trade by the Tax plan, nor what they do for what they
        get.</p>
      <p>5. There is nought so hard to get rid of as a tax once put on goods.
        It will grow, but it will not come off.</p>

      on the goods that come in; that is paid by those who send them. There is
      not one such case which is of any use to our home trades. The tax can only
      aid the home trades when it puts up the price and thus gives them a chance
      to get more gain, but the only case in which the man who sends in goods
      pays the tax is one in which the price does not go up. Here is a man in
      France who makes a pill. No one else knows how to make it, so he sets the
      price as he likes at some point twixt what it costs him and what he can
      charge so as to sell any. If the U. S. puts a tax on pills, it would be
      for him to send no more pills in, or to pay the tax out of his own purse
      so that they could still be sold in the States at the old rate. But what
      good would that do those who make pills there? Or here is a case of a man
      who has wheat to sell and he deems it best to sell it in a land that is
      near by. Though he pays the tax on it, there is no rise in the price, as
      the land he sells in has wheat to spare. What good does this do to the
    wheat men of the land? A rise in price is what they want.</td>

      spring up, if not to share in the gain from the rise in price? No doubt
      the fight that in due time takes place (if they do not all join in a Trust)
      brings down the price, but not to a point so low as it would be if the

      there is here and there a Work that is hard to start, but which, if once
      put on its feet, would be a great boon. The thing is to pick these out.
      No doubt there are men all round us who, if they got the right help &#8212;      if
      they were put at ease, and had time to read and think and plan &#8212; would
      come to be great men, and give back to the world much more than they have
      got. But the thing would be to find just the right men. Who could pick
      them out? If it were left to a free fight for the aid we may be sure the
      right ones would not not win, but it would go to those who had the most
      cheek or push or help from friends. So it is with aid to trades. No one
      can tell just which it will pay to help, and in the fight the strong gain
      the prize. Babe trades have just as much chance as young pigs would have
      in a scrap round the trough with full grown swine. And in any case it is
      not more sure that aid will do a young trade good than that it will be
      wise to give great wealth to a young man as he starts out in life. It oft

      of a tax on goods sent in, which goods are made or could be made at home,
      it will be seen that we can only in any case aid some trades &#8212; those,
      that is to say, which make goods of the kind that is brought in. Here is
      a man in the live stock trade. He has a big stock farm which he runs at
      great cost, and which gives work to scores of men. If we are to aid all
      trades we can not pass by this one. But (in the case of the States) live
      stock is not brought in at all, it is only sent out. How, then, can a tax
      on live stock aid this farm? And when we come to trades of the land are
      in the same of the whole list there are just a tax. So to talk of aid in
      this way to all is to talk stuff. If our plan was aid by means of Doles
      we could treat all in a fair way, but it is the Tax plan we have now to

        course the tax can only give help to some trades (those in their goods)
        but yet this times will be made good all round." What do you think of
        this plea? Let us put the case in this way: Here is a small town where
        times are dull. Two smart men live there, and they rise up and one of
        them says:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Friends, things are in a bad way here,
        and we want to make good times for you all. This is our plan. Let each
        one in the town pay us a tax of three pence per day. It is not much,
        and you will scarce feel it. It will be but a small sum even for those
        of you who have wives and kids to pay for. Yet this slight tax will,
        as you may see, give our town two rich men in a short time, to wit, self
        and friend. We will turn to and spend our wealth. We will be quite free
        with it. We will buy the best food and drink, and lots of it; we will
        build fine homes, lay out parks and grounds, give fetes and treats, and
        play the part of lords in all ways. This will make trades brisk, and
        call for work of all kinds for which we will pay well. The high pay you
        will get will give you in turn a chance to live well and spend more in
        the shops, so that things will look up for those who work farms, and
        in short make things hum all round." </div>
      <p>What, think you, the folk of the town would say to all this? Would they
        not say: "You two chaps must take us for fools!" Yet there is as much
        to be said for this scheme as can be said for the plea that to aid some
    trades is to aid all.</p></td>

    <td>But let us take it that a High Tax could be made to aid all. It would
      then do what we see could be done by the plan of Doles we speak of &#8212;       that
      is, each could get a fair share of help from the top to the foot of the
      list. Well, what then? Let us take such a plan in the case of this same
      town and see how it would work. Each man there would pay a tax to each
      trade, but, of course, when he came to count up the whole sum he thus paid
      he would find it far more than came back to his own hand as his share,
      or, at most, he would get back no more than be had paid out. It is plain
      that this would be the case of much cry and no wool. You can see how it
      works out when you think of
      aid to all; but when, as by the High Tax plan the aid goes but to a few,
      you do not see the fraud on you quite so well. You see the big Works with
      the tall stack which sends forth the black smoke and is so hard at it from
      morn till night, and you say - see there! What a fine thing it is to thus
      build up a trade and "give work" to such a crowd! But you do not see that
      a share of that tax goes out of your own pouch and does not come back to
      it; nor do you see that the waste and loss of such a "plan of aid" adds
      to the cost of all you have to pay with the part of your wage you have
      left. It is true a High Tax makes "more work." But so does the rain that

    <td>A man who is thought to have had a great head [Horace
Greeley] once said, "I need iron and I must buy it; you say it is my part to
get it cheap. Yes, but you see, I buy iron not (in real truth) with cash, but
with the fruit of my toil. That fruit is in the form of books, and it will pay
me to give ten pounds a ton for iron made at home by men who can and do buy my
books, than take it for five pounds a ton from a strange land where my books
are not bought. The real cost to me of the iron is less, and my case is that
of men
in all lines of work in this land."&nbsp;</td>

    <td>This sort of chaff will catch some birds, but it is mere chaff. The point
      is this: could the same time and skill in his land bring forth more wealth
      in some
other form than iron? If not &#8212; if the land was one in which iron could
be made
with great ease and much gain&#8212; then there would be no need of a tax to "shield" the
trade; but if so, if work in the iron line could, as a fact, only be done as
it were by force, as plants
are grown in a hot house, then the time and skill would bring line, and the wealth
made sent off in trade for iron. In that case all would have more gain and could
buy more books. In the case as he puts it, the fact is that he has been made
to pay ten pounds for skill that, if put to some other form of work, would have
cost but five. His loss is as sure, and of the same kind, as if he had been made
to hire a small boy to do a man's work, and pay a
man's wage. </td>

      by those who sell. Yet it ought to work both ways if it is true. If it
      makes no odds that you have to buy at a steep price, it ought to be just
      as fair for the law to make the shop men sell at a price less than cost.

      to say the least it has a queer sound when we speak of "goods." Yet grave
      men say this as if they meant it, and no doubt they do mean it; yet we

    <td>Now, if the plan was to put a high tax on all the goods that were sent
      out and no tax at all on what came in, it would seem more apt to make us
      all rich, for the land that has the best store of good things must be the
      best place to live in. But if such a plan were brought up, the High Tax
      men would raise a great howl. What would they say? Why, that if you did
      not send goods out you could not get things of more worth to bring in,
      and so your land would lose more and more. Quite true, but do they not
      kill their own case when they say that? Their case is, bear in mind, that
      we grow in wealth only as we send out more than we get in! And of course
      there is no truth in this. Trade, when it is fair and just, has gain on
      both sides of it, for each gets what is of more worth to him than what
      he gives. Each pound of goods sent out means more than a pound (in worth)
      brought back. If it were true that a land did well when it sent out more
      than it brought in, then it would reach the top notch of gain if it sent
      out all its goods and got none back at all! From this point of view there
      ought to be cause for great joy in the fact that rich girls in the States
      wed poor lords from John Bull's land, as they take with them huge bags
      of gold for which nought comes back; and it must be a fine thing, too,
      that more and more of the men who work farms in the West send rent each
      year o'er the sea to the swells who own the land and are so kind as to
      let them work it. If, now, the States could only have a war, and get the
      worst of it, and be made to pay a big sum to the land that beat them, what
      a fine spec it would be! It is hard to think that men are to be found who
      talk such stuff as this and mean it, yet it is true. You may read it in
      books by men who are said to be quite sane, too. It is a queer twist in
      thought, that you do well
when you sell, but not when you buy.</td>

    <td>How came this queer form of thought to take root? Why do sane men hold
      the view that the more goods a land sends out, and the less it brings in,
      the more rich it grows? That it pays more to sell than to buy? When wild
      tribes trade they give goods for goods; and this is the way in which some
      rude forms of trade still go on in our towns, as when men come round for
      grease and give soap for it. No such man ever thinks that he does well
      when he gives more soap than the grease he gets is worth. But trade is
      not now done as a rule in this rough form. Cash, or notes, or bills or
      some such "sign" for goods are used, and not the things that are dealt
      in. But to this fact we may trace all the fog that is in the minds of
    men on the point we have in hand.</td>

    <td>Of course, as trade went on, some sign for wealth had to be got. One
      man might want to give a drove of hogs for a house, but he would not care
      to drive the pigs for miles, nor could his friend move the house. But with
      some such thing as gold as a sign of value the trade could be made quite
      well. To be sure, in the first place they would need to know just how much
      wealth the unit of gold was worth, so that they could count the worth of
      things they were to trade; the same as, ere you could tell the length in
      yards of a rope, you must have a yard stick to fix what you mean by a yard,
      and the same of weight and bulk, we must first come to one mind on what
      is meant by a pint; a quart, and so forth. As the world goes on, trade
      tends more and more to be done through the use of cash, bills, notes of
      hand, and such things; and as these things are dealt with day by day we
      get to think of them more than of the goods they stand for; and at length
      we are apt to get the thought that cash is worth more than the things you
      give for it, etc. When a man buys a coat and gives the cash for it, the
      shop
man says, "Thank you." Why does not the man say "thank you" for the coat? Whence
springs the idea that the cash is worth more than the coat? No doubt from the
fact that cash is a thing you can turn into any form of goods at once, for all
are swift to sell for cash, but to trade a coat for some thing you may want,
say a pair of boots, you must find some one who has the sort of boots you want
and who at the same time is in need of the size and sort of coat you have to
give. The cash seems worth more than the coat, since you can change it for what
you may want with so much more case. If the man who went to the shop for the
coat gave, not cash, but eggs and cheese in trade for it, the terms buy and sell
would not rise in his mind, he would think of it as a trade, and it may be the
shop man would not
say "Thank you." In this case they both sell and both buy, and both think of
it as a fair deal; but if cash is used, they think one buys and the other sells,
and he who sells gets the best of it. It is not so; the cash stands for just
the worth of the coat, and the man sells the cash as much, as if it were eggs
and cheese. But such is the twist in our thought on this point that we cling
to the view that he who sells gets the best of it. So, when we turn our thoughts
to the Trade of a land, we still have this idea, and thus think that a land which
sells most and buys least is the land that gains. But in truth and fact, it is
the man who buys more goods (that is, gets in more goods) than he sells (that
is, gives out) who gets rich. If he sells for, say, 10, and with that 10 buys
goods worth to him 20, does he not gain? And so with a land. If it gets for its
exports that which is worth twice as much in the form of imports, why should
we think it
a loss? You see where the twist of thought is? When we use the word "sell" we
think of cash, and it means not give out goods but get in gold, and when we use
the word "buy" it means not get in goods but give out cash. But it comes straight
when you keep in mind that it is
goods we want and not the "sign" for them.&nbsp;</td>
