          of the
            Rent of the Bare Land, and there would be but this One Tax to pay.      </p>

    a House for Gain. Do we not Hurt him the same way when we Tax a House?</p></td>

    <td><p>Now, to bring the Book to a Close, I ask you, my Child, Do you see the
      Cat? </p>
      <p>By this I Mean do you see Through the One-Tax Plan, and grasp the
        Thought that it would in Truth make men Free? </p>      <p>That Thought is like the
        Trick which you have seen in a Print on a Card, as in this Cut. It is
        a lot of Trees, and you are told to Find the Cat. At First you can see
        no Shape of a Cat, but at last you Find it and it is then so Plain you
        see it with Ease. So when you once see the One-Tax Plan it will Grow
        on you in the same Way. The Cat is in the Grove at the Top of this Page.
        And in the square space you read these Words, &quot;A tax on Land Rent
      will make us Free.&quot; </p>
      <p>I have Shown you how it will Do this, my Child,
    and now I bid you Good-By. </p>
    <p>Go Thou and Spread the Light. </p></td>

      <p>Enough! the lie is ended; God only Owns the land;<br>
        No parchment deed hath virtue unsigned by His own hand;<br>
        Out on the bold blasphemers who would eject the Lord,<br>
        And pauperize his children, and trample on His Word!</p>
      <p>Behold this glorious temple, with dome of starry sky,<br>
        And floor of greensward scented, and trees for pillars high,<br>
        And song of birds for music, and bleat of lambs for prayer,<br>
        And incense of sweet vapors uprising everywhere!</p>
      <p>Behold His table bounteous, spread over land and sea,<br>
        The sure reward of labor, to every mortal free;<br>
        And hark! through Nature's anthem there rises the refrain:<br>
      &quot;God owns the Earth, but giveth it unto the Sons of men.&quot;</p>
      <p>But see, within the temple, as in Solomon's of old,<br>
        The money-changers haggle, and souls are bought and sold;<br>
        And that is called an owner's which can only be the Lord's,<br>
        And Christ is not remembered, nor His whip of knotted cords.</p>
      <p>But Christ has not forgotten, and wolfish human greed<br>
        Shall be driven from our heritage; God's bounties shall be freed;<br>
        And from out out hoary statutes shall be torn the crime-stained leaves<br>
        Which have turned the world, God's temple, into a den of thieves!</p>
