      would be to stop the game of those who live on rent, and as this means
      of wealth to those who toil not has gone on a long time, it has in some
      way got to seem a "right," and men shrink from the thought that it must

      a "wrong," and it must be brought to an end if men are to be made free

      host of those, too, who; though they earn their bread by work of some kind,
      yet hold land and hope to make gain in this way as well, who take a firm
      stand for things as they are. These, for the most part, do not know that
      to all who work the tax on land rent would be a great gain, which would
      more than make up for what they would lose in rent. But the drones, who
      sit on the back of Toil and live on the toll they get for the use of God's
      earth, would be slain by such a tax. That, in short, is just what it is

      the tax off what a man earns, and he will have the means to stop the small
      drains he now has on his purse. But of what use can it be, to put an end
      to the small thefts if you leave that big thief who will then but get the

      the shops and find work for all who can work. This calls for wise and good
      men, men who are all but gods, at the head of the State, and how are we
      to be sure to get them? Such a plan would not do till all men were made
      good. But there is no need of such a plan. There are some things the State
      can do and should do &#8212; Take charge of those lines of trade which
      in any case must have the aid of the State or of the town, such as railways,
      trams,
      gas, phones and so forth. But all lines in which a man could start on his
      own hook, which do not need to wield the powers of the Crown, should be
      left for the free will of each man. The true rule is &#8212; to each man
      what is his &#8212; to the State what is the State's. So long as man may
      own land
      on the terms that are now in vogue, so long will it seem that the two forms
      of Toil (Labor and Capital) are foes. They are not, but the true foe of
      both is the land lord as such. <strong>It is due to the same cause &#8212; that
      some men now own the earth &#8212;  that there seems to be a great wrong
      in competition. We can have, in fact, no such thing as true competition
      where land is held
      in the way it now is, for one part of the race is tied up, as we may say,
      and has no chance.</strong> We could not live if we had no air, or if all the air
      should press on but one side of us, for then it would pin us down and kill
      us. As it is, we are free so far as air goes, we can breathe all we want
      of it, and it is all round us so that we do not feel its weight at all.
      In the same way, give men a free path to the land so that, if need be,
      they can in any case work and live, and not have to beg the right, and
      competition would be fair, and would prove a good thing for all, since
      each would get his
full due.</td>

    <td>The cause of True Free Trade is the cause of the Rights of Man, and as
      such, where once it is known it goes to the heart, and calls forth all
      that is best and most God-like in us. To pack it all into a few words &#8212; 
      <strong>we must make the earth as free to all as air and light and the
      warmth of the sun are now free.</strong> We may be sure that had Greed and Grasp been able
      to build walls round the air or the light these would at this day have
      been held for rent, and the law would
back up
the "rights" of those who thus held them. And we would find those who sought
to get true free trade in air and light, as well as in goods, would have to bear
the name of "cranks." Well, though air and light are now free, land is not, and
we need it just as much if we are to live. The time has come for the fight. Let
us draw our swords and press on. The cause is one we may be proud to fight in,
and if need be to die for. What, then, shall we do? Take the first step first.
Break down the High Tax wall. Seek to have the tax on goods cut off. Seek to
get a law that will give the folks of a town or State the right to tax what they
think should bear a tax, and to set free what they think should be free. And
while at work in all these ways and in all ways that are on the straight and
true path, let each man spread the light with tongue and pen as best he may.
Let each take a part in the Free Trade fight which is now on, for this is on
the right line, poor as the end it aims at is. Yet it gives a chance to throw
light on True Free Trade, and on the path the Bull must tread to get the twist
out of the rope that now holds his nose to the post. He must go step by step
in the track which leads to the great truth that man may not own land rent, since
he may not own men. </td>

    <td>We set out to make a search for the truth as to which of the two plans
      was best for "those who have to work" &#8212;  the High Tax, or what
      they call Free Trade. We have found that the High Tax plan has no help
      at all in
      it for this class, and can but harm them. It is, in short, a scheme by
      which the few may by law tax the many. We have found that Free Trade as
      they have it in John Bull's land, though a step in the right line, does
      not prove to be the boon it was meant to be. And the cause of this we have
      seen in the fact that though trade is free (that is, there is no tax on
      most goods brought in) land is not free. The source of wealth is shut off,
      or held for rent or toll. We have found that land rent is the one thing
      that goes up, with each step the world takes, that all that art and skill
      have done to make toil light and wealth great, counts for next to nought
      for the mass of men; they get no such share of the loaf as they have a
      right to. Those who hold the land have a right by law to take "all that
      is left," so that no plan or scheme can ease the lot of the wage slave
      while that state of things lasts. If it should rain food and clothes and
      all the forms of wealth we need from the sky, it would not help the man
      who has no claim to the land on which they would fall. The end of our
      search, then, has brought us to this clear truth &#8212;  the plan that
      will aid one and all and be fair and just is True Free Trade, in which
      the land
      will be set free as well as the things which are made from the land &#8212;      in
      which men will be free to work as well as to trade. It is in the path of
      this True Free Trade that the wage slave must go to loose the rope that
      now binds him to the post. The work first to our hand is to get the tax
      off goods bit by bit, and with each step in this line get it put more and
      more on land rent. In due time we will reach the point where land can only
      be held for use. The day of the ground hog who holds it for a rise will
    be done; he must use it, or drop it and let some one else have a chance.</td>
