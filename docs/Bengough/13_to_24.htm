      <p>Then how can he own a Sheep? -- for he can no more make

      <p>Yes, in a way he can make Sheep. Sheep are Bred

        can, if

        such things. </p>
      <p>As Man finds out new Ways to save Toil, or as the Crowd

      more ease, and there is more Sale for them. </p>

    <p>It is a Man at Work with a Pick. </p>
    <p>Does he Dig? </p>
    <p>Yes, he
      Digs in the Land. </p>
    <p>What is his Name? </p>
    <p>We call him Toil. </p>
    <p>Will he Dig all
      Day? </p>
    <p>No, he will Dig but part of the Day, and then he will Rest. He can
        make as Much in that time as he Needs for his Keep, and then he will
      Read so as to Feed his Mind, and Play that he may have Health. </p>
    <p>You say
      he can &quot;Make as Much as he Needs.&quot; What is it he Makes? </p>
    <p>We
      call it Wealth. This Word just Means all that is got by Toil. </p>
    <p>But could
            Toil get any Wealth if he were with his Pick out on the Sea or up
      in the Air? </p>
    <p>No, he must be on the Land. Toil and Land are the two Things
              by which all Wealth is Got, and there is no other Way to get Wealth
          in all the World. There is not a Thing that Man has, or that he can
    have, but what comes from Land and Toil.</p></td>

      <p>Yes. </p>
      <p>What does he Mean to do with them? </p>
      <p>He is on his
                Way to where Toil is at Work. He means to give Toil the Use of
          the Plow and
      Oxen in his work on the Land. </p>

                      read
                          it on his Ox. By the use of the Plow in place of the
          Pick, you see, he will aid Toil to do much more, and so get much more
          of
              a Crop,

      <p>Who are these two Men, and why do they Dance and Tear as if they were
      Mad? </p>
      <p>They are Toil and his Friend. </p>
      <p>They have done the Work, and now they
            are mad at the Worm which eats the Fruit. You see the Fruit is Wealth
            -- that is, what was got by the Joint Work of the Two on the Land.
          The Fruit is to be cut in two Parts, one for Toil, which we call his
          Wage,
      and one for his Friend, which we call In-ter-est. </p>
      <p>Is it Strange that
              they are Mad at the Worm, which means to Eat up most of the Fruit?
      Did the Worm help them to get this Fruit of Work? </p>
      <p>No; but the Worm
            owns the
                Land out of which they have to get all the Wealth that can be
        got, and so it Claims its share in the form of Rent. But the Worm does
          no Work.
    It's Plan is to let them Work, and then take Toll. </p></td>
