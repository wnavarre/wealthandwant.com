      spread at all. Now of course it ought to spread, and men should share it
      on some right rule or law. What is that law? This: It should go to those
      who work, and form a fair rate of pay for the work they do by hand or brain. </td>

      work, or at the least keep that pay from a fall." This is not proof; it
      is mere say-so. We have shown that, in fact, a high tax has no such force.
      It does not make "good times for all," for we do not need to be told that
      bad times come to lands that have the plan in full swing. And we know that
      pay does go down, and that there are spells in which men are "out of work," that
      is, get no share of wealth at all. But note this: It is not true at all
      times that that which helps or hurts the mass of men helps or hurts each
      one in the State. Fires and floods hurt some, but may be a means of gain
      to others. A fall in stocks is a loss to this man, but may mean a great
      gain to that one. </td>

    <td>Now we pass on to say that, since such a tax plan (as is its aim) puts
      up the price of goods, it makes the great mass pay more than they ought
      for what they buy, and gives to the few more than they could have got in
      a free field for what they sell. It thus plays pranks with the spread of
      wealth. It is those who thus get more than their fair share that are so
      loud in praise of the high tax scheme. But though the scheme may be a good
      one for those who sell goods that are put up in price in this way, how
      can it get for the plain man who works more than his fair share, or how,
      in short, can it do aught to make it sure that he gets even his fair share?
      He does not sell goods; he sells work of brains or of hand. There is no
      tax on this sort of thing; there is no wall to keep men out. A smith sells
      his skill to make tools, and he gets worth of the tools he makes in the
      form of cash, and with this wage he buys what he needs &#8212; clothes,
      food and so forth. Now, what good does it do him to put up the price of
      such things, by means of a tax, since the tax can not raise his wage in
      the same way? Let us say that, as a rule, he has to work one week to earn
      the price of a coat. By means of a fresh tax, say that coats rise to twice
      the cost they were. This is all right for the firms that make coats, but
      it means that the smith will have to work two weeks to get a coat now. </td>

      To be sure some men grow more rich now than e'er they did in any past age,
