        is not a great Sum. You pay that out of what you Earn, and then you keep
          the Rest. The Tax on your Barn, House, and so on, is Gone. Store goods
          would be Low, for there would be Free Trade, and you could Sell your
          Grain for at least as Good a Price as you now get. The Tax weight would
          fall on the Town Lots which are of High Worth, where it Ought to fall.

      <p>He is at his right Work. </p>
      <p>What!
      Is it, then, his Work to Rob this Man of the Bread he has made? </p>
      <p>A
          Part of it &#8212; Yes. The Man who makes Bread has to give up some Loaves
          each
              year to the State in the shape of Tax, just as the Man who makes
          Shoes, and he who makes Coats, and so on, have each got to Give Up
        some of
            the Things they have Made. The Cop stands for the Law that takes
        these Goods.      </p>
      <p>But why does the Cop have to do so?</p>
      <p> For this cause: As you see
            in the Cut, the Land Lord has Gone Off with the Fund from Land Rent
          which would have been all the State needs; and now the Law must send
          the
              Cop
                to Rob
                  in this Way to make up for the Loss of the Fund. Is it not
    a Queer way to do?</p></td>

      <p>Who is this Man with the great Load on his Back? </p>
      <p>That is Toil. This
          means that the Plan of the State now is to put the Tax Load on those
          who Work, and the Things they make by their Work. Some of this Tax
        is Straight, and you See and Know how much it is; and Some of it is Put
      On in a Shape that you can not well See and Count. </p>
      <p>But why does the
          State
            pile the Tax on Toil when there is a Fund which Springs out of the
      Land? </p>
      <p>See, it goes in to the Fat Man's Hat, though he does not Work.
            Is not
      this what God meant as a Fund to help the State? </p>
      <p>It is, but Man
          is so Wise, he thinks he Knows more than God, so he lets that Fund
        go to the
                Man who Owns the Earth, and in its Stead he Piles the Tax on
        to poor
      Toil. </p>
      <p>But the State is a Firm Friend of Toil, is it not? </p>
      <p>Oh,
    yes. As you will See. </p></td>

      <p>What is this? </p>
      <p>It is a High Wall. It is built by the Wise State all round
          the Bounds of the Land to Keep Out Cheap Goods that Foes might want
      to Send in. </p>
      <p>But if the Wall keeps out Cheap Goods, the like Goods our
          own
      Men make will be Dear, will they not? </p>
      <p>Yes, they May, but you see
          we will Keep our Cash in our own Land, so we can Buy even if they are
          Dear.
            And
              more, they will not be Dear long, for lots of Works will be set
      up, and the Price will soon Fall to a Fair Rate. </p>
      <p>And poor Toil, will
          soon
              get
      Rich, will he not? </p>
      <p>So they Say. But see! there is a Hole in the
            Wall, and All who Please may come in to Beat down Toil in his Wage.
          Toil must buy Dear Goods, but Work for a Cheap Wage. That is what it
          Means,
                but
    Toil Votes for the Wall!</p></td>
