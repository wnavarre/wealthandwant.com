        </center>
        <p> As I sit down to write, I glance out, and in a field I see a big
          black Bull. He is tied to a stake and he has gone round and round till
          he has his nose close to the post, and there he stands and roars and
          paws the ground. Poor chap! He has lots of strength, but it does him
          no good. If he but knew it, he could, of course, turn, and go round
          and round and thus get the rope loose. But he has not the head for
          that.</p>
        <p> I see in this Bull and his sad fix the type of those who toil yet
          go in want. They, too, are in a wide field, where there is no lack
          of wealth, and they want all sorts of good things for which they would
          be glad to give their work; but they can by no means get more than
          will just keep them in life. They, too, paw and roar as we may say,
          for we hear the cry of the poor all through the land. But, like the
          Bull, they know not how to get free. They have not the wit to see their
          way out of the snarl nor will they, as a rule, give ear to those who
          could teach them how. Yet, till they know the truth, they can not be
          made free, for you can not drive men out of their fix as you can a
          Bull.</p>
        <p> The Bull in the field got tied up in this way by his own act; and
          so did the men of toil fix their own fate in the way we see it. They
          have the strength; they have the votes; they are the ones who rule
          in all lands we call free, so it is all their own fault. Theirs has
          been the lack of sense, and theirs it is to undo the evil. But this
          they can not do till they see just what is wrong and how it is to be
          made right. What they need is light. When once they see their way out
          we may trust them to get out.</p>

            great bull is tethered by a ring in his nose. Grazing round and round
            he has
            wound his rope about the stake until now he stands a close prisoner,
            tantalised by the rich grass he cannot reach, unable even to toss his
            head to rid
            him of the flies that cluster on his shoulders. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">This bull, a very type of massive strength, who, because he has not
            wit enough to see how he might be free, suffers want in sight of plenty,
            and is helplessly preyed upon by weaker creatures, seems to me to be
            no unfit emblem of the working masses.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">But until they trace effect to cause, until they see
              how they are fettered and how they may be freed, their struggles and
              outcries are as vain as
            those of the bull. Nay they are vainer. I shall go out and drive the
            bull in the way that will untwist the rope. But who shall drive men to

      laws that men pass can not make right wrong nor wrong right, and it is

      prove their faith the true one. Is the faith in the "tax on goods" a true

      and, of course, these are bound to work for it; and it gets strength, as
      well, from the feuds and wars that go on in the world. In view of these

      for the plan that claims it can shield them from such a state of things;
      such, they are told, is the aim of the "High Tax
Plan." No such claim seems to be made by those who talk for Free Trade; they
do not pose as the great friends of Toil. They seem to have, in truth, hard hearts,
for they talk of God's law as the real cause of Want; and on the same ground
on which they fight a tax on goods they fight all laws to fix hours of work,
rates of pay and so forth. The truth is these men are for Free Trade so far as
that has
to do with "buy and sell," but they do not seem to think the term has aught to
do with the right of a man to work, or how to share up the wealth in a fair and
just way when it has been made. Thus, you see, they leave out one half of the
truth. It is not strange that, thus set forth, Free Trade must seem the foe of
toil, and earn the ill-will of those who work. But, to be fair, we must see to
it that we set forth true Free Trade side by side with the true High Tax plan;
as only then can we come to a just view of the case.</td>

The High Tax plan claims to "shield" those who work. But why, we ask, should
this class need a shield? The old, the sick, the lame, and such, are the ones
who need care and help, but why talk of aid for those who work, and who must,
of course, be the well, the young, those with good brains or strong arms? Does
this not strike you as queer, in the first place? If there is a thing that a
grown man hates it is to be made a child of. If those who do the work of the
world
need to be "kept," as it were by whom are they to be so kept? It must be by those
who do not work, that is to say, by those who live by alms or by theft, for there
are but these three grades of men in all the world, those who work, those who
beg and those who steal. Think it out, and see if you can name one more class.
Is it not plain that since all must live by means of food, clothes and roofs
&#8212; that is, "wealth" &#8212;  and since all wealth on earth is the fruit
of work, it
must be that those who work "keep" those who do not? Let those who toil think
this out, too. Adam was the first son of Toil, but there
was no one to "shield" him, was there? The fact is that those who have to live
by the sweat of their brows have been made game of by the use of a word which
we may well call a trick term. That word is "Protect." It is a good, true word
in its right place. It means to shield, to keep, to bless. We all feel that it
is a right thing for a man to pro-tect his house, his dear ones, or the land
he lives in. That is the true sense of the word. So some cute head hit on this
term as the name of the High Tax plan. But it by no means stands for the same
sort of thing in that case. In its fair and right use the word means to ward
off ills, and to do this for one and all. But does the High Tax ward off ills
when it keeps out goods? And does it help and bless those who want the goods
when it thus keeps them out or makes them dear? And does it deal with one and
all in the same way? What would we think of a man who, as the head of a home,
should shield his big boy and give no care at all to his babe? Yet this is the
way in which the High Tax plan works and must work, as we shall see. And if so,
you will grant that to call it "Protection" is to use a trick name. Do not let
a mere name fool you. See how it works; that is the real thing. Put the mere
name out of mind, and go on and see what there is in it. Two facts may be found
side by side, but it may be there is no real link 'twixt them. A man gets more
of a wage in the States than he could get in John Bull's land, that is one fact.
Sam goes in for Pro. and John for what he calls Free Trade (but which is Free
Trade with a string to it). That is fact two. Well, what then? Is it safe to
nail it down at once as a truth that the High Tax is the cause of the high wage
and Free Trade of the low? By no means. The high wage in the States does not
prove that Sam's plan is sound any more than the great growth of trade in the
old land proves that Bull's plan is the right one, for there are other facts
which may have to do with it. There are, in short, such hosts of facts that bear
on the weal and woe of man, that we must sift them out with care, or we are sure
to go wrong. Now, first of all, we must get to
know: (1) What "Protective Tariffs" are, and (2) What they do. If we start with
what we know to be true, and are quite sure of and then go on step by step with
due care, we may trace this thing out through all its twists and turns, and reach
the real truth. That is what we now set out to do, and all we ask of him who
reads is that he will
not trust to our mere "say so," but bring each step we take to the test of his
own good sense.&nbsp; </td>

      be, but is
      it not what your "law of truth" leads to? If it is mad, the fault is with
      your law. It means that you dare not go where it leads; in short, it will

not think peace and love would be bad for the world. Still, I am for the High
Tax and hold it to be the true plan; but you must
not go too far with it." But this will not do. The fact that you must stop
at some point in this way proves, as we say, that your path is a wrong one from
the first. A straight line from the true can not lead to the false. Note the
fix you would be in, if with the faith you hold in the High Tax, you went to
preach to a tribe of wild men. You would first set forth the love of God, and
how men should love and serve each other and do good, even to those who hate
them; and then you would go on to say that by the laws of this same God each
tribe must build walls to bar out trade on all hands. Don't you think, now, this
thing of walls and bars is more like a scheme which man has got up, and has no
base in any law of God? Or would you say that what is true of a man is not true
of men &#8212; that in one sphere love is the true way; in the other strife is

by ill-paid toil. But why do you not act on this view, and break up each new
machine that is made which saves work and so makes things cheap? And why do you
not stop up gas wells that tend to drive out coal more than the tax on coal does?
And why

      You can lead a horse to a trough, but can you make him drink? And if he
      won't drink do you need to put a bag on his mouth? These men may wish to
      send in goods, but if no one cares to buy them, do you need a high wall

      those goods. These are the
folks the High Tax hits; these are our "foes" in the case! When we are at war
our foe tries the first thing to close our ports. Why? So that we can not get
the goods in that we want. He thus deals a blow to our land and he aims it, you
see, not at those who send the goods, but at us, who want to buy them. His hope
is to starve us out. This is the act of a foe, and just what we might look for,
but what say you to the same act on the part of a friend? Yet this is what the
High Tax plan comes to, and it seeks this end by a tax on the goods we want,
to make them so dear that they will not be brought in. Of course, this harms
those who would send the goods, as it hurts their trade, but its chief hurt comes
to those who want the goods and can not now get them, but must buy at home and
pay far more for, it may be, worse goods. Is this not a queer thing, that we
seek to do to our own land in times of peace what our foes seek to do to us in
times of war? And please bear in mind that the goods thus sent to our shore are
not goods sent in on sale or chance of sale. No. All that are sent in have been
bought ere they are sent &#8212;  bought by those in our own land who want
them. <strong><em>And thus it comes to pass that the men who vote and shout for the High

      There are calls for them from those who live in the place where he has
      his shop. Why these calls? To meet wants that come up day by day and hour
      by hour, and which each sane man seeks to meet with the least cost. No
      man will give five bob for a hat if he can get as good a, hat for half
      that price, which is the same thing as to say no man will give two days'
      work to gain what he could get for one day's work. He acts in this way
      by a law which lies at the root of his soul; and by a law just as deep
      he seeks to trade. As blood flows through the veins of a man, so trade
      flows through the veins of a state or a town. It is trade that makes men
      what they are, and what they have grown to be since the days when they
      dwelt in trees and in caves, and each man sought to meet all his own wants
      by his own act and skill. In our day, when each man makes but one form
      of wealth, or some part of that one form, and trades what he makes for
      all forms of wealth he needs (that is, gets his wage in cash and buys what
      he wants), he can live what we call a full life, and trade is the blood
      of that life. So it is plain that just in so far as you thwart trade, or
      by any means tend to block it, you by that much drive the race back to
      the old low plane from which it came up. Trade is the life of the race
      and the lamp which sheds the light of help and peace through all the world.
      We can not have too much of it, nor can it be too free. If God did not
      mean trade to be free as air He would have so made the world that each
      tribe &#8212; or each man &#8212; would live in a lone way and deal with
      no one, but we all know the world is not built on that plan. The whole
      trend
      of
      things is to bring in the day when each shall be for all and none for self.
      In the face of this well known fact what can we say for such a plan as
      this of a High Tax on goods? Take this case: Here is a man who sees fit
      to trade a horse he does not want for two cows he does want. Now, what
      sense would there be in a law that would say to this man, No, you shall
      not make such a trade, it is best that you raise your own cows, and let
      your friend breed a horse of his own. Yet that is just what the law does

<p><a name="CHAPTER VIII: THE PLAN TO KEEP"></a><b>CHAPTER VIII: THE
PLAN TO KEEP OUT GOODS</b></p>
The High Tax plan has in view, not to get funds for the State, but
to keep out strange goods and so tend to build up trade at home. This
is to be done, of course, in a way that is fair to each and all
trades -- to treat them all the same; to aid ail and hurt none. Such
is the aim.
<p>Now, we must ask in the first place, Is it well to shield the
trade of the land at all? And in the next place, if. so, Is this plan
the best by which that can be done? For, of course, this is not the
only plan that might be thought of. Let us grant for the time that it
is wise to thus shield trade. It can be shown that this can be done
at least as well by bounty as by Tax, and with scarce any of the
evils of the Tax plan.</p>
By the Bounty Plan: --
<p> 1. We could give aid to each and all trades, and to each new
one as it sprang up.</p>
<p> 2. We would not have to give the aid till the trade had shown
that it had a right to it.</p>
<p> 3. We would know just how much help each got and what had been
done to earn it.</p>
<p> 4. We could stop the doles when they had been kept up a fair
length of time.</p>
<p> 5. The doles, while fair to each and all lines of trade, would
cost far less than has to be paid by the Tariff plan in the form of
high price for goods.</p>
<p> 6. We would not need the army of guards, spies, clerks and so
forth3 and could save what we now pay them.</p>
<p> 7. There would not be the same scope for fraud and lies and
false oaths.</p>
<p> 8. There would not need to be any rise in the price of
goods.</p>
Here are at least eight points which the plan of Doles can claim
to score. For, in the case of the High Tax plan: --
<p>1. The wit of man can not so fix it as to help all trades in a
fair way. What helps one hurts the next. If you put a tax on tools to
help the trade that makes tools, you, of course, hurt the trade that
has to use such tools, and as new trades spring up this mess grows
worse and worse.</p>
<p>2. Aid has now to be lent to new trade. as pap is fed to babes,
and it is a case of pay, pay, pay, till the child is grown up. But,
strange to say, it does not grow up at all, but with each year of its
age, calls for more and more pap.</p>
<p>3 No man on earth, let him be wise as he may, can tell what is
paid now to any one trade by the Tax plan, nor what they do for what
they get.</p>
<p>5. There is nought so hard to get rid of as a tax once put on
goods. It will grow, but it will not come off.</p>
<table width="90%" border="0" cellpadding="1">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF00">Missing points?</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. A rise in the price of goods is the heart of the whole scheme.
If there were no such rise where would the "aid" come in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is hard, in short, to know what can be said for this plan. Some
few pleas are made, but these have the slight fault that they are not
true.</p>
<p>(a) It is said that we who put up the wall do not have to pay the
tax on the goods that come in; that is paid by those who send them.
There is not one such case which is of any use to our home trades.
The tax can only aid the home trades when it puts up the price and
thus gives them a chance to get more gain, but the only case in which
the man who sends in goods pays the tax is one in which the price
does not go up. Here is a man in France who makes a pill. No one else
knows how to make it, so he sets the price as he likes at some point
twixt what it costs him and what be can charge so as to sell any. If
the U. S. puts a tax on pills, it would be for him to send no more
pills in, or to pay the tax out of his own purse so that they could
still be sold in the States at the old rate. But what good would that
do those who make pills there? Or here is a case of a man who has
wheat to sell and he deems it best to sell it in a land that is near
by. Though he pays the tax on it, there is no rise in the price, as
the land he sells in has wheat to spare. What good does this do to
the wheat men of the land? A rise in price is what they want.</p>
<p>(b) It is said, too, that a high tax wall does not make things
dear, as it tends to cause more mills to spring up, and these fight
for the trade and so bring down the price to what it was at first.
Why do more mills spring up, if not to share in the gain from the
rise in price? No doubt the fight that in due time takes place (if
they do not all join in a Trust) brings down the price, but not to a
point so low as it would be if the wall had not been put up-if there
was no tax on the thing made.</p>
<p>A tax can not fail to raise the price of that on which it is put,
in the whole range of goods that are sent in from o'er the sea. It is
only in the case of "goods" of a rare kind that this may not take
place. If a stamp tax were put on the press it may be the Times would
cost no more than it now does, for the firm that owns the Times might
choose to keep the price as it is so as to hold those who now read
it, and to that end would pay the tax and not charge it in the price.
But the Times is a rare sort of "goods."</p>
<p>So much for the tax plan. We see that it is not at all so good as
the Dole plan would be, and we have come far short here of all that
might be said with truth of its bad points. If it is wise at all to
shield the trades of a land let it by all means be done by fair and
square doles paid out of a poll tax or a straight tax in some
form.</p>
<p>But we have now to ask, Is it, in any case, and by any plan, wise
to try to "shield" trades and thus aid them to grow?</p>
<br>
<p><a name="CHAPTER IX: IS IT WISE?"></a><b>CHAPTER IX: IS IT
WISE?</b></p>
<p>For what trades should we set up the shield, for a few or for all?
On this point there are two views held. Some say that only new trades
should be thus dealt with, to give them a chance to get well on their
feet; but the view held by most is that "home" trade as a whole
should thus get help.</p>
As to the first. It has been found, where tried, that when once
these Babes get a taste of pap, they will not let go. But there is no
doubt that there is here and there a Work that is hard to start, but
which, if once put on its feet, would be a great boon. The thing is
to pick these out. No doubt there are men all round us who, if they
got the right help -- if they were put at ease, and had time to read
and think and plan-would come to be great men, and give back to the
world much more than they have got. But the thing would be to find
just the right men. Who could pick them out? If it were left to a
free fight for the aid we may be sure the right ones would not not
win, but it would go to those who had the most cheek or push or help
from friends. So it is with aid to trades. No one can tell just which
it will pay to help, and in the fight the strong gain the prize. Babe
trades have just as much chance as young pigs would have in a scrap
round the trough with full grown swine. And in any case it is not
more sure that aid will do a young trade good than that it will be
wise to give great wealth to a young man as he starts out in life. It
oft proves a curse to him.
<p>Since, then, we can by no means pick out the young trades for aid,
we must give help td all or none. We come, then, to the next view,
that "home" trade at large must have aid.</p>
Now, it is clear in the first place that, as the aid is to take
the form of a tax on goods sent in, which goods are made or could be
made at home, it will be seen that we can only in any case aid some
trades -- those, that is to say, which make goods of the kind that is
brought in. Here is a man in the live stock trade. He has a big stock
farm which he runs at great cost, and which gives work to scores of
men. If we are to aid all trades we can not pass by this one. But (in
the case of the States) live stock is not brought in at all, it is
only sent out. How, then, can a tax on live stock aid this farm? And
when we come to trades of the land are in the same of the whole list
there are just a tax. So to talk of aid in this way to all is to talk
stuff. If our plan was aid by means of Doles we could treat all in a
fair way, but it is the Tax plan we have now to deal with.
<p>In face of the hard fact thus set forth, does not the case for the
High Tax plan at once fall to the ground? "Oh, no," cry its friends.
"Of course the tax can only give help to some trades (those in their
goods) but yet this times will be made good all round." What do you
think of this plea? Let us put the case in this way: Here is a small
town where times are dull. Two smart men live there, and they rise up
and one of them says:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Friends, things are in a bad way
here, and we want to make
good times for you all. This is our plan. Let each one in the town
pay us a tax of three pence per day. It is not much, and you will
scarce feel it. It will be but a small sum even for those of you who
have wives and kids to pay for. Yet this slight tax will, as you may
see, give our town two rich men in a short time, to wit, self and
friend. We will turn to and spend our wealth. We will be quite free
with it. We will buy the best food and drink, and lots of it; we will
build fine homes, lay out parks and grounds, give fetes and treats,
and play the part of lords in all ways. This will make trades brisk,
and call for work of all kinds for which we will pay well. The high
pay you will get will give you in turn a chance to live well and
spend more in the shops, so that things will look up for those who
work farms, and in short make things hum all round." </div>
<p>What, think you, the folk of the town would say to all this? Would
they not say: "You two chaps must take us for fools!" Yet there is as
much to be said for this scheme as can be said for the plea that to
aid some trades is to aid all.</p>
<p>But let us take it that a High Tax could be made to aid all. It
would then do what we see could be done by the plan of Doles we speak
of -- that is, each could get a fair share of help from the top to
the foot of the list. Well, what then? Let us take such a plan in the
case of this same town and see how it would work. Each man there
would pay a tax to each trade, but, of course, when he came to count
up the whole sum he thus paid he would find it far more than came
back to his own hand as his share, or, at most, he would get back no
more than be had paid out. It is plain that this would be a case of
much cry and no wool. You can see how it works back no more than he
had paid out. It is plain that this would be the case of much cry and
no wool. You can see how it works out when you think of aid to all;
but when, as by the High Tax plan the aid goes but to a few, you do
not see the fraud on you quite so well. You see the big Works with
the tall stack which sends forth the black smoke and is so hard at it
from morn till night, and you say - see there! What a fine thing it
is to thus build up a trade and "give work" to such a crowd! But you
do not see that a share of that tax goes out of your own pouch and
does not come back to it; nor do you see that the waste and loss of
such a "plan of aid" adds to the cost of all you have to pay with the
part of your wage you have left. It is true a High Tax makes "more
work." But so does the rain that wets the hay on a farm.</p>
<br>
<p><a name="CHAPTER X: AS TO HOME TRADE"></a><b>CHAPTER X: AS TO HOME
TRADE</b></p>
<p>To say "let us keep our marts for our own trades, and bar out the
goods that would come to us o'er the sea; let our own land make all
the goods it needs, and so keep our cash in our own purse," this
(which we hear so oft, and which is thought so wise) is the same as
to say, "let us keep our mouths for our own home-made bread," or or
"let keep our trips our own legs make."</p>
<p>Our lives are full of wants, and these we seek to meet. If we are
sane we seek to meet them in the best way, and that is time, or toil,
or both. A man who would walk round a block when he could take a
short cut to the place he had in view would be a mere dunce. The man
who would not ride though he was in haste, so that he might use his
own legs, we would call a fool. So good sense bids us make or buy the
things we need in our own land, if it best suits us to do so; if it
does not so suit us let us buy where we please. Is not sense our best
guide as to the way in which we shall get the things we have need of?
If we are to work out this rule to the end, what of all those things
which are not to be had at all in our land? Are we to just go in need
of them? This is so mad an idea that no one will act on it. Sense
tells us once more that the way to get things is to set our hands to
the sort of work we can do best, and then trade the things we make
(and which we do not need) for the things we need, but can not make.
You need salt, let us say. Will you then make it in your own land;
dip a pot of brine out of the sea and boil it till all goes off in
steam and leaves the salt, or will you trade the boots and coats you
can make for the salt which is got from mines in far off lands? It
would be just as good sense to say that the world ought to be cut
down just to the size of our own land. It is not more wise for a land
to try to "make all things it needs" than for a man to do so, and of
a truth it is not the way in which God meant us to act.</p>
On what grounds is it held, then, that we should keep home trade
for home marts? On three:<br>
1. That home trade has' more gain in it.<br>
2. That even though the high tax on goods puts up the price of
goods made at home, the real cost is no more.<br>
3. Even if it were more, those who pay it get it back.
<p>I. That there is more gain in a trade twixt John Bull and Pat than
there would be in the same trade twixt John Bull and Hans is not
true. Good sense laughs at it.</p>
II. The "real' cost" of a thing is not set by the more or less
toil it took to make it, but by the toil it would take to make what
you could get it for. A man who could make a pair of boots well and
in a short time, if he should try to make a coat, would do the work
ill and take far more time. The coat would be dear. It would not be
sold at its "real cost" for that would be the worth of what the man
could do in the boot line with the same toil and time. A good part of
the price would be mere waste of skill in a wrong line, and thus it
is with the price of goods made at home that could best be made o'er
the sea and got in trade.<br>
<br>
A man who is thought to have had a great head [Horace
Greeley] once said, "I need iron and I must buy it; you say it is
my part to get it cheap. Yes, but you see, I buy iron not (in real
truth) with cash, but with the fruit of my toil. That fruit is in the
form of books, and it will pay me to give ten pounds a ton for iron
made at home by men who can and do buy my books, than take it for
five pounds a ton from a strange land where my books are not bought.
The real cost to me of the iron is less, and my case is that of men
in all lines of work in this land."&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This sort of chaff will catch some birds, but it is mere chaff.
The point is this: could the same time and skill in his land bring
forth more wealth in some other form than iron? If not -- if the land
was one in which iron could be made with great ease and much gain -
then there would be no need of a tax to "shield" the trade; but if
so, if work' in the iron line could, as a fact, only be done as it
were by force, as plants are grown in a hot house, then the time and
skill would bring line, and the wealth made sent off in trade for
iron. In that case all would have more gain and could buy more books.
In the case as he puts it, the fact is that he has been made to pay
ten pounds for skill that, if put to some other form of work, would
have cost but five. His loss is as sure, and of the same kind, as if
he had been made to hire a small boy to do a man's work, and pay a
man's wage.
<p>You will hear it said that high price makes no odds, since we pay
it to our own folk in our own land. This is nice, but it is said as a
rule by those who sell. Yet it ought to work both ways if it is true.
If it makes no odds that you have to buy at a steep price, it ought
to be just as fair for the law to make the shop men sell at a price
less than cost. But, you tell them that, and hear what they will
say.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><a name="CHAPTER XI:&nbsp;GOODS OUT AND IN"></a><b>CHAPTER
XI:&nbsp;GOODS OUT AND IN</b></p>
<p>"It is a gain to send goods out, a loss to bring then in." So we
are told (this is known as the "Balance of Trade" Doctrine). It would
be all right, if what we spoke of were pests we were glad to be rid
of -- but to say the least it has a queer sound when we speak of
"goods." Yet grave men say this as if they meant it, and no doubt
they do mean it, and no doubt they do mean it; yet we should think a
dog had less than dog sense if he should snarl when you gave him a
bone and wag his tail when you took the bone from him.</p>
<p>If each man in the land got in more wealth than he gave out he
would be apt to get rich; but it seems that if they all did this at
once they would grow poor! Strange, to be sure!</p>
Now, if the plan was to put a high tax on all the goods that were
sent out and no tax at all on what came in, it would seem more apt to
make us all rich, for the land that has the best store of good things
must be the best place to live in. But if such a plan were brought
up, the High Tax men would raise a great howl. What would they say?
Why, that if you did not send goods out you could not get things of
more worth to bring in, and so your land would lose more and more.
Quite true, but do they not kill their own case when they say that?
Their case is, bear in mind, that we grow in wealth only as we send
out more than we get in! And of course there is no truth in this.
Trade, when it is fair and just, has gain on both sides of it, for
each gets what is of more worth to him than what he gives. Each pound
of goods sent out means more than a pound (in worth) brought back. If
it were true that a land did well when it sent out more than it
brought in, then it would reach the top notch of gain if it sent out
all its goods and got none back at all! From this point of view there
ought to be cause for great joy in the fact that rich girls in the
States wed poor lords from John Bull's land, as they take with them
huge bags of gold for which nought comes back; and it must be a fine
thing, too, that more and more of the men who work farms in the West
send rent each year o'er the sea to the swells who own the land and
are so kind as to let them work it. If, now, the States could only
have a war, and get the worst of it, and be made to pay a big sum to
the land that beat them, what a fine spec it would be! It is hard to
think that men are to be found who talk such stuff as this and mean
it, yet it is true. You may read it in books by men who are said to
be quite sane, too. It is a queer twist in thought, that you do well
when you sell, but not when you buy.<br>
<br>
<p><a name="CHAPTER XII: A TWIST IN THOUGHT"></a>CHAPTER XII: A
TWIST IN THOUGHT, THAT'S ALL</p>
<p>How came this queer form of thought to take root? Why do sane men
hold the view that the more goods a land sends out, and the less it
brings in, the more rich it grows? That it pays more to sell than to
buy? When wild tribes trade they give goods for goods; and this is
the way in which some rude forms of trade still go on in our towns,
as when men come round for grease and give soap for it. No such man
ever thinks that he does well when he gives more soap than the grease
he gets is worth. But trade is not now done as a rule in this rough
form. Cash, or notes, or bills or some such "sign" for goods are
used, and not the things that are dealt in. But to this fact we may
trace all the fog that is in the minds' of men on the point we have
in hand.</p>
Of course, as trade went on, some sign for wealth had to be got.
One man might want to give a drove of hogs for a house, but he would
not care to drive the pigs for miles, nor could his friend move the
house. But with some such thing as gold as a sign of value the trade
could be made quite well. To be sure, in the first place they would
need to know just how much wealth the unit of gold was worth, so that
they could count the worth of things they were to trade; the same as,
ere you could tell the length in yards of a rope, you must have a
yard stick to fix what you mean by a yard, and the same of weight and
bulk, we must first come to one mind on what is meant by a pint; a
quart, and so forth. As the world goes on, trade tends more and more
to be done through the use of cash, bills, notes of hand, and such
things; and as these things are dealt with day by day we get to think
of them more than of the goods they stand for; and at length we are
apt to get the thought that cash is worth more than the things you
give for it, etc. When a man buys a coat and gives the cash for it,
the shop man says, "Thank you." Why does not the man say "thank you"
for the coat? Whence springs the idea that the cash is worth more
than the coat? No doubt from the fact that cash is a thing you can
turn into any form of goods at once, for all are swift to sell for
cash, but to trade a coat for some thing you may want, say a pair of
boots, you must find some one who has the sort of boots you want and
who at the same time is in need of the size and sort of coat you have
to give. The cash seems worth more than the coat, since you can
change it for what you may want with so much more case. If the man
who went to the shop for the coat gave, not cash, but eggs and cheese
in trade for it, the terms buy and sell would not rise in his mind,
he would think of it as a trade, and it may be the shop man would not
say "Thank you." In this case they both sell and both buy, and both
think of it as a fair deal; but if cash is used, they think one buys
and the other sells, and he who sells gets the best of it. It is not
so; the cash stands for just the worth of the coat, and the man sells
the cash as much, as if it were eggs and cheese. But such is the
twist in our thought on this point that we cling to the view that he
who sells gets the best of it. So, when we turn our thoughts to the
Trade of a land, we still have this idea, and thus think that a land
which sells most and buys least is the land that gains. But in truth
and fact, it is the man who buys more goods (that is, gets in more
goods) than he sells (that is, gives out) who gets rich. If he sells
for, say, 10, and with that 10 buys goods worth to him 20, does he
not gain? And so with a land. If it gets for its exports that which
is worth twice as much in the form of imports, why should we think it
a loss? You see where the twist of thought is? When we use the word
"sell" we think of cash, and it means not give out goods but get in
gold, and when we use the word "buy" it means not get in goods but
give out cash. But it comes straight when you keep in mind that it is
goods we want and not the "sign" for them.&nbsp;
<p><a name="CHAPTER XIII: AS TO HIGH PAY FO"></a><b>CHAPTER XIII: AS
TO HIGH PAY FOR WORK</b></p>
Is it true that if goods from o'er the sea are let in free, the
high wage now paid in our land will go down, since the goods thus
brought in are made by men who get a low wage? "Yes, of course!" cry
some, and so they vote to keep up the high wall. But, all the same,
it is not true. Nor do those who raise this cry show real faith in
it, for (in the States) they are most fain to keep out the goods of
those lands that pay the best wage -- such as John Bull's land -- and
are not so much in dread of the goods of lands like Spain or China,
where the pay is so poor.
<p>A low wage does not at all times mean a low cost of the thing
made; the men who work on farms in the West are paid far more than
the same class in the old land, yet wheat from the West does not cost
so much as Mr. Bull's wheat. There is a cause for this, but we only
say here it is not to be found in the size of the wage paid.</p>
Once more, how comes it to pass that goods made in a high wage
land can be sent to low wage lands and sold there at less than the
home goods made by "cheap" men?
<p>If a low wage land is to be held in fear by lands where a high
wage is paid, how comes it that in the U. S. the slave States did not
swamp the free States with their trade? and how is it that John Bull,
who pays the best wage in the East, leads the whole trade of that
part of the world? The truth is that a high wage as a rule means a
low cost of the goods made, for it means brains and skill in the men
who do the work. The wage paid is but a part of the cost. In the low
wage hand work is done in such crude ways that, tho' the pay be poor,
the goods in the end are by no means cheap. Brains and skill find out
new ways by which as much work can be done in an hour as would else
take a day, and goods thus made are cheap in the end, though a high
wage be paid.</p>
It must be borne in mind that brains and skill count for much -
far more than mere strength of arm. A fool and a smart man if of the
same strength may do just the same day's work with a spade, and it
would not be wise to pay one more than the other. But in a form of
work that calls for thought and skill, as well as strength, the smart
man would do much more in the same length of time, and if he were
paid more it could not be said the cost of the goods was more. Where
men get high pay they live well, and where they live well they do the
best work; that is the law at the base of the whole thing.
<p>True, a Boss here and there who can force down the wage of those
who work for him in a land where pay is, as a rule, high, will gain
by such a scheme; but if it were done by all, and the whole rate of
pay were cut down as low as it is in the Far East, it would mean that
the land as a whole would sink to the plane of the low wage land.</p>
A fall in the rate of pay all round in any land means what? It
just means that the share of the loaf which goes to those who make it
is less than it was. Say they got one half as things were, they now
get one third though the whole size of the loaf is the same. Where,
then, does the share they lose go? It goes in the form of more rent
to those who own the land!<br>
<p><a name="CHAPTER XIV: DOES A POOR LAND N"></a><b>CHAPTER XIV: DOES
A POOR LAND NEED A WALL</b></p>
<p>Here are two lands side by side. In one there are mines and rich
fields and streams on which boats can run, and all that one could
wish for, so that it is a great place for trade. The other has few of
these gifts. In such a case, say some, the poor land must put a tax
on goods or the rich land at its door will kill its trade. Now, is
this the case? It is not. There is, in fact, no land that has in its
own bounds all things to meet all the needs that may rise; or that
can make all forms of wealth at low cost. The best land on earth is
sure to be weak in some points, and there are no two just the same.
In points in which some are weak others are strong. That is to say,
each land finds that some lines of trade will pay well; some will pay
less, some not at all. Good sense would say, give chief care to those
lines in which your work tells for most, and then trade the goods
thus made for the things you need but could not make at such low
cost. Thus, both sides to the trade will gain, for in each case they
"make the most of their chance." Is it not mad, then, to put clogs on
trade, and so have to do at a 1oss what could be got through trade at
a gain? Is it not a queer thing, too, that while men in a poor land
say they must have a tax wall to shield them since the land is poor,
men in a rich land, (one that has all the gifts a land could ask
for), call for a tax wall so that they may work out these gifts?</p>
<p>The cry is a wrong and false one in both.<br>
  <br>
Free trade brings gain to both rich and poor lands, for by this
means they give each to each the aid they need, as in the case of the
blind man and the lame man who gave aid of eyes for aid of legs. Free
trade will give each land more of the things it wants than it could
get by the same toil if each did all its own work, just as two men,
one of great skill and one of small, can, if they work at a job and
each do the parts he can do best, do more than twice as much as one
of them could do in the same time.</p>
<p>  As has been said the toil and time it takes to make a piece of
goods of any kind does not fix the real cost of the thing. Say a man
made a coat with one day's work, and that a day's work is worth one
pound. Is the cost of the coat one pound? Ere we can say this we must
ask if this man could make coats with more skill and speed than he
could make aught else? If it should turn out that in the time it took
him to make one coat he might have done work in some line in which he
had more skill or more chance, which would have been worth two
pounds, then we must say that the real cost of the coat was two
pounds, and he has, in fact, lost one pound for that day. This is the
law of cost, and a tax on goods which acts as a clog on trade that
must tend to force folks to pay more than they ought for what they
want, or, which is the same thing, to give more of their time and
toil than they need for that which they get.<br>
<br>
Free trade is trade of free will, and it would not go on at all
but for the fact that there is gain in it to both sides. As 'twixt
rich and poor lands, the poor stand to gain more and not less than
the rich.
</p>
<p>We hear it said by some that Free Trade would be all right if all
lands would go in for it, but for one to take up that plan though all
the rest kept up their walls would be to court ruin. Look at this and
see what it means. It means that if we take down our wall it will be
a gain to those who send goods in, not to us for whom they are sent
in. So we take up the cry "Find out what they want you to do -- and
don't do it!" And we say, "Since such and such a land shuts our goods
out, would we not be fools to let their goods in?"</p>
These cries spring from the thought that goods sent out are gain,
goods brought in are loss -- or, what you sell is gain, what you buy
is loss -- the mad idea we have just dealt with. They are no more
wise than the cry "Bite off your nose to spite your face" would be. A
tax on goods thwarts those who would buy and hurts them more than it
does those who would send them the goods they want. And how can it be
good sense for a man to knock his own head to get even with one who
has dealt him a blow? No one but a child could think thus; nor is it
more wise for a state so to act; and it acts just in this way when,
for spite, it takes up a plan which brings loss to its own folk.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
It is like this: Here, let us say, are ten men who live on an
isle, and find that it suits each one to trade with all the rest. In
this way each makes the most of his own work. Now say that nine of
the men, through some wild freak of mind, see fit to burn up one
sixth of the things they thus get in trade. This would be a hurt, no
doubt, to the tenth man, for the loss of wealth by each of the nine
would, of course, leave them less to trade with him. But would he not
add to this hurt if he should say, "Well, since these fools act in
this way and so do me harm, I will get back at them on the same line;
from this time I, too, will burn a; sixth of all I get in trade."
<p>A queer tale, you say. But not so wild as you may think. To thus
burn up goods is mad, true; but to lose them in any way when you need
not lose them, is just as mad, is it not? Let us bring this tale of
the ten men on the isle to the test of facts. Here let us say, is the
U. S. The homes of that land need things of such and such a kind, and
so there is a call for that class of goods, which are made in John
Bull's land with much skill and at low cost. By the laws of Trade at
once the goods flow to the U.S. to meet the call there, and, to pay
for them, goods which John Bull can not make so well, flow back. It
is a square deal with gain to both sides, let us say six bags of
John's goods for six bags of Sam's. But Sam at length goes in for the
High Tax plan and puts up a toll gate at his port. He says by means
of a tax he will keep out these goods, and so have them made in his
own land. They are in due time so made, but now those who need them,
if they bring them in from John Bull's mart, must pay the tax, which,
let us say, is the price of one bag. They get five bags where they
used to get six, and if they buy in the home mart, they get no more
than five. Is not this the same as to get six bags and throw one in
the sea? John Bull is, no doubt, hurt by such a plan; he will not be
able to send so much goods, and so will not be able to bring back so
much in trade from Sam's land. The tax may be put up so high that he
can send no more goods of that kind at all, but he will still get
what he needs and what he can best get from Sam's mart. We say "what
he can best get" there; by which we mean what it will pay him to get
there more than it would to make; or such things as grain, of which
he can not grow a great crop in his own land. John, as a wise man,
says, "To be sure, this tax of Sam's hurts my trade with him, but I
still have the world at large to trade with more or less, and I will
try to make it more. But I must have food, and if needs be, I will
get it, or the main part of it, from Sam, as of yore."</p>
<p>But think you he would be as wise a man to say, "No! Sam, by means
of this toll-gate, hurts my trade, and makes his own folks throw one
bag of goods out of each six into the sea. I will meet him on his own
ground; a blow for a blow is my rule, so I, too, will put a tax on
goods and thus force my folks to throw a sixth of what they buy into
the sea!"</p>
God has made all men of one blood, says the Good Book; and no man
can say "I do as I please and it is nought to you." Yet the world is
so built that, in the end, the man who does good gains by it, and he
who does ill wounds his own soul most of all. Those who say that our
land should take up the high tax plan-though it is a bad one -- since
all other lands have it, are as wrong as if they should say, tell
lies, since men as a rule are false; use strong drink since so many
get drunk; spurn books, since the great mass of men care not for
them.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><a name="CHAPTER XV: CART IN FRONT OF HO"></a><b>CHAPTER XV: CART
IN FRONT OF HORSE</b></p>
<p>It must be clear to all fair minds that if there is to be a shield
at all, it must be spread o'er the heads of all the trades at which
men work. It must be for the farm, the mine and the sheep-fold, as
well as for the mill. But, as we have shown, the wit of man can form
no such shield; that is to say, can not so fix a tax on goods as to
help all and hurt none. So, what it comes to in the long run is, that
the trades that can swing most votes get the most aid. It is a wild
rush at the trough and the strong hogs will beat the weak ones. The
plan, in truth, hurts more trades than it helps, and must do so. Yet
the old cry goes on just the same -- "We must have a high wall if we
are to build up trade!" and those who raise the cry point to the
States and say, "There you see the proof -- mark what it has done for
that land! If it were not for the high wall Sam keeps up, his land at
this time would be just a lot of farms!"</p>
Is this true? No. Why, then, do scores of men who seem to have
good sense hold such views? They have heard this cry so long that
they have come to take it as true, and have not sat down to get at
the facts of the case.<br>
<br>
Mills and works of all kinds grow up where there is no wall; a
high tax does not shield, but stunts and hurts them. This is the
truth, and there is proof for it in the facts we may see round us day
by day.
<p>There were in the States scores of Mills and such Works long ere
the high tax plan came in vogue. There is the same law of growth in
this, as in a child, from the small to the great; first, the rude
stage; while the land is poor and new and has few in it, it will have
but the rude sort of works, such as the state of life calls for, and
the sort of earth or wood to be had at hand will serve to set up;
bricks and such rough goods will be made. As the crowd comes in, and
the scale of life goes up, new calls will be made and met by works of
a kind more in line with the new state of things, and in the end,
with dense crowd, large towns and great wealth we will find all lines
of Works, from the rude to the height of high art.</p>
<p>All that is said to prove that it is the growth of Mills that
brings wealth to a land, and not growth of the wealth of land that
brings mills, can be brought to prove that it is the growth of stage
art that builds up towns, and yet we know that it is the growth of a
town that brings the stage. A small place has no show at all; as it
grows in size and wealth it has first a hall in which there are shows
from time to time; then it gets a show each week; at length it can
keep up a show each night, and a play house is built, then two of
them, then three, and so on, till, as in the case of New York, you
may count them by the score. But it would be just as true to say that
it was the growth of the stage that made New York what it is, as to
say that it was the growth of Works (due to the high tax plan) that
made the States what they now are. It is a clear case of cart in
front of horse.</p>
<p>But if it is true that Works spring up by force of needs as they
rise from time to time, and keep pace with the growth of wealth, what
is the need of a tax to "nurse" them? If you could not get the men in
a small place to bear a tax to keep up a play house for shows that
thus the place might be "built up," how comes it that they do not
kick at the tax put on goods to "build up" the land they live in?</p>
<p>There is in short, but one safe thing for those who rule the State
to do, and that is to keep their hands off trade. Just let them stand
to one side and give it free scope; each move they make to "help" it
can but do it harm, for at the most all that law can do is to help
some trades at the cost of all the rest. There is no more need to
nurse and guide trade than to teach birds how to fly and when to go
south and when to come back. God, who has set a law in the bird by
which it acts, has not left the race of man void of such a sense for
trade as a bird has for flight.</p>
<p>A free field in which a man can make the most of his time and
strength of hand or head -- that is, work in the line in which he can
bring forth the most -- and then have his choice as to how and where
he will trade what he thus makes -- that is the right plan. To fence
him in with tax bars, and force him to work in lines that would not
be his free choice, and that do not pay so well, and this in the name
of "aid," is no wise plan. True, such a plan makes more "work," and
if it were "work" that was to be sought, all would be well. But no
sane man 'wants work, he wants the things that are to be got by work.
This point should be borne in mind.</p>
<p>The word "free" is the word we prize most of all the words in our
tongue. Men shout it, and sing it, and write it in gold. Let us be
free or let us die! they cry. Free to think, free to speak, free to
pray in the way we think right, free to come, free to go. But lo!
they stop short at Free to trade.</p>
<p>This, they think, is not one of the rights of man. The word so
scares the mass of men these days that when they hear it they seem
like to take a fit. Strange!</p>

<p></p>
<p><a name="CHAPTER XVI: A STRAIGHT LOOK AT"></a><b>CHAPTER XVI: A
STRAIGHT LOOK AT THE "SHIELD"</b></p>
<p>The first aim of the High Tax plan is to "shield" the home trade;
that is to say, it seeks by means of a tax on the goods sent in to
raise their price, so that the firms which make the same class of
goods at home can raise their price, too, and thus make more than
they could if there was no tax.</p>
<p>Of course, the price thus put on must be paid by those who buy the
home goods.</p>
If the tax fails to raise the price it proves to be no good, for
that is what it is for; that is its chief aim.<br>
<br>
You might think, in view of this fact, that though it might be
hard on those who buy, the high tax scheme would be sure to make all
the firms it thus "shields" rich. Yet this is by no means the case.
It is found, in fact, that the gains are as small in these lines, and
the chance of loss as great, as in those that do not have the tax to
help them. Nor is it hard to see why this is so.
<p>The rise in price is all they have to look to for gain. But they
do not get all of this. It costs them some part of it to get the tax
they want put through the House. They have to "see" the men who have
votes and square them, and pay all the costs of the game of pull and
haul. All this work comes high, and it must be done not once, but it
may be year by year. Then there is the loss that must cling to a
trade so weak that it must be kept up by the tax, and could not pay
at all on its own base. Such trades as a rule are run with great
waste, and are not kept up to date, as they would need to be if they
had to "hoe their own row." So that, it is but a small part of what
the tax adds to the price of the goods that they get in the end.</p>
As for those who buy the goods, their case is, of course, much
worse. They have to pay (1) the price of the goods plus the tax, plus
the charge on the tax. (2) The loss that may come through those who
dodge the tax, and sneak goods in free. (3) All it costs to catch and
try such crooks; (4) the bribes paid to those who are set to guard
the port and get the tax.<br>
<br>
Add it all up and the loss is a vast one. It is safe to say in
each case, the loss to all is far worse than the gain to the trade
can be. But as the loss, spread far and wide, can not be seen, while
the gain to the Mill, or what not, seems so plain, the plan on the
whole may look like a good one.
<p>A plan that will shield all trades by means of a tax has not yet
seen the light of day, nor will such a plan be found while the world
lasts.</p>
<p>More, a plan that will shield some trades and not hurt others can
  not be made. If it helps one (by a rise in the price of its goods) it
  must hurt all trades which have to make use of such goods. A tax on
  Steel is a good thing for the Steel Mills, but it harms all forms of
  work in which steel must be used; a tax on salt hurts those who cure
  fish or feed stock, and so on. Both ends of a teeter board can not be
  kept up at the same time.<br>
  <br>
  A plan to be fair should shield all and hurt none. The High Tax
  plan as it is is a gain but to the few, and this gain grows less with
  each new trade that gets into the ring, since for each new line that
  gets aid, more and more have to bear loss, and this is felt through
  the whole field of trade. If all trades were dealt with in the same
  way (as, of course, they should be by rights) then things would be in
  the same state as though none got aid. The plan would be of no use if
  it were fair. And in fact the good goes out of it at a point far
  short of aid to all. Say there are 100 lines of trade, half of which
  are of a kind which you can aid by means of a tax; and let us say
  that the part of the tax which they can get, that is, less what it
  costs them, is one fourth. Now in the first place, half of these
  trades can get no aid at all, since no goods of the kind they deal in
  are brought in, but they have to help to pay the tax in aid of the
  rest in the form of a rise in price. The whole tax is 100, and if but
  one of the trades gets aid (less what it costs) it will get 25. If
  two get aid, each will get 12/12; if three get aid, each will get
  8&frac14;, and so on. When 25 trades come in each will get no aid at
  all that will be of any use, though in the mean time all the rest
  will be at a loss. When 26 come in a loss comes in with it, and so
on.</p>
<p>  One can not find out to a jot just how such a tax works out, but
  there is no doubt there is a point at which such "aid" gets to be of
  no use; and in the States, they have gone past that point. The high
  wall there is a dead weight on the whole trade of the land; it is a
  dead weight on those very trades the law seeks to shield and nurse
  and feed. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  If the force of a tax on a class of goods is to start up works in
  that line-and this is what we may count on -- in due time rates will
  be cut down till the "good thing" that was in it is gone; there then
  is no great gain to be made by any, though the price that has to be
  paid by those who buy is more than they would have to pay had there
  been no tax. As soon as a tax is put on and there is a chance of big
  gains in any line, there is a rush in to that line, and this tends to
  pull the gains down. But here and there we note there is some force
  which serves to head off such a rush. This force takes more than one
  shape. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  As a case in point, take that of the thing we call chrome. There
  is a tax on chrome in the States, and as luck will have it, one man
  there owns the only chrome mines that are known. By means of the tax
  he can, of course, add to the price, and yet there can be no rush in
  to his line of trade. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Then the same thing may be done by what we call patent rights.
  There is a tax on wood pulp, and the man who owns the sole right to
  the plan by which paper is made from this sort of stuff has what we
  may call a cinch; and no fear of a rush. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Then, once more, the force may take the shape of a trust, or pool
  or ring, in which a lot of strong firms join hand in hand to crush
  out those who are in their line, so as to keep up the price. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  In each case it is clear that the gains made are not gains from
  work. If the tax is to be a gain to you (with no fear that it will be
  cut down) you must own some thing which no one else can get hold of.
  You then may be said to have your feet on firm rock and can put forth
  your strength to keep off the crowd that would rush in to share your
  gain. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Now there ought to be clear thought on this point. Much turns on
  it. Yet strange to say, there are few who seem to see that a line
  must be drawn to show that gain from work is not the same as gain
  from a "cinch." A man who owns a toll gate and does not have to keep
  up the road may make great gains, yet no one would claim that he does
  any real work for it. If the same man has a shop in which he makes
  boots and shoes, that, of course, is a fair form of work, and what he
  makes at it he earns in a true sense. In such a case, what we claim
  is that it is not fair to take his whole year's gain from both these
  lines, though they are put in one purse, and call them the fruit of
  his toil. In so far as he has hides and tools, wax and thread and so
  on, he is a capitalist; in so far as he works he is a laborer, and
  the gains he thus makes are interest and wages. But in so far as he
  owns the tollgate, he is a monopolist and his gain from that source
  we call Toll or Rent. He is, in fact, two men in one, for his wealth
  comes to him in two streams 'twixt which we must draw a clear line.
  Yet there is a great fog these days on this plain point. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  We hear shouts of wrath at Capitalists. It would be as good sense
  to how at Labor, for they are just two forms of the same thing. Those
  who raise the shouts thus prove that they have not clear thought, and
  do not see the line we have drawn 'twixt "work" and "cinch." In so
  far as men get wealth through their work, no odds how much they get,
  they do no harm to the rest; but, in so far as they get gain; not
  through work, but just by means of what they own-the toll they take
  in some form -- they may do harm, for what they thus get some one
  else who made the wealth must lose. Now, not a few both work and
  own-as in the case of the tollgate man I have set forth. But we can
  see that when we call such a man a "law made thief" we do not take
  note of what he gets by the trade of boots and shoes, but of that
  part of his gain which comes from the tollgate he owns. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  It is not hard to see that as the whole race of man must live on
  the ground -- since they can not live in the air nor in the sea --
  the man who owns land holds the prime key to wealth. For no wealth at
  all can be got but from the ground and from that but in one way -- by
  toil. This is true, as will at once be seen, of wealth in the form of
  crops, on a farm. And it is just as true of wealth in the form of
  sheep, cows, pigs and so forth fed and bred on a farm. This is plain
  to all. But to some it is not quite so clear that wealth is got out
  of the ground in the town and city. To be sure, it is not got in just
  the same way; but it comes in just as real a way out of the ground
  there. For a town must stand on ground, must it not? Is not the
  ground in a town worth much more per foot than the land of a farm?
  And why so? This is why: A man can make more out of land in towns.
  The wealth to be made in trade is as a rule more than is to be made
  on farms, and the work is not so hard. The chief worth of farm land
  is in what it will grow. The chief worth of a town lot is its site;
  that is, the part of the town in which it lies, with the chance for
  trade there is in it. As a town grows large the chance grows with it,
  and the lots go up in price, and in each town they range on a scale
  from low to high. Lots at the heart of a town are best for trade and
  so are worth much, from there out to the bounds, less and less. Then,
  some parts of the town have choice sites for homes, and these are of
  high worth, while less choice sites are worth less. Of each town we
  may say -- when we note the chance there is for trade, the style of
  the streets, the cars, the schools, and all things which go to make
  up a full life, -- it is worth so and so per year to live there. And
  we find that this "so and so" is, as it were, writ in the land, That
  is to say, the land is worth just what it is worth to live in the
  town. In this sense, all that the town can gain in wealth through
  trade comes out of the land, for, of course, if the land was not
  there, there could be no town. Now, is it not plain that if John
  Smith owns the site of the town he can take, by way of toll or rent
  from all who live in it all that it is worth to live there? If he
  owns one lot can he not take in the same way, all that lot is worth
  as a site for trade? And is not this the same thing as for him to
  take, as the rent of a farm, (in the form, it may be of a share of
  the crop) all that the farm is worth? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  What we call Rent is in each case the Worth of the Chance, be it
  farm or town lot, and the rent is there all the while, though John
  Smith works the chance, or lets some one else work it. In one case he
  gets the rent as well as the gain he makes by his work; in the other
  he gets the rent and leaves the gain from work to the man who has the
  use of the land. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  The great thing to be borne in mind is that each jot of wealth
  through the whole world, on farm, in mine, or in town, must be got
  out of the ground by means of work, and in no way else; and that it
  is such share of this wealth as goes to those who work to make it,
  and no more than such share, that forms their "pay" and gives them
  heart of hope to work on-that, in short builds up trade in the world.
  So it must be just as clear that such share of the wealth as goes to
  those who do not in any way help to make it must come off the share
  of those who do, and is a mere toll on their toil. This is the case
  with the whole share that goes in the form of Rent. The men who "own" rent
  do no sort of work for it. They get it as a mere toll on toil, and as the price
  for the use of the ground. They get it just as the
  man who owns a toll gate on the high road gets it. What does he give
  the man who comes up in the rig? He takes a toll, but what does he
  give? Nought but leave to the man to drive on. So the man who owns
  the ground gives nought but leave that work may be done. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  A man who owns ground and gets rent may, of course, work, too,
  but, if so, what he gets for his work is a wage. The part he gets in
  the form of Rent is not a wage, for he does no work for this. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Now, let us see how all this bears on the case of the High Tax
  plan. Here we find some smart folk in John Bull's land who strive to
  get rid of what they now have by the name of "Free Trade," and urge
  that the old plan of a tax on goods be a tax put on grain. This is to
"shield" the farms of the old land, and it will do so in so far as it
  lifts the price of grain. As soon as that is done there will be a
  rush to the farms, of course, for they will then have a chance to
  pay. There will be a call for farms. Lands that have of late years
  been idle will be sought. Then what? Why, of course, the lords of the
  soil -- those who own the land -- will raise the rent (as the chances
  grow bright the rent goes up, you see -- that is the rule). John Bull
  at large will have to pay more for his bread, since the price of
  grain has had a rise, but the men who work the farms will in a short
  time be just where they were, since all the fresh gain they make will
  have to be paid out in fresh rent, The men who will gain by the move
  in the end are those who toil not nor spin, but who own the land, and
  sit in their clubs and draw the rent. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  To own the ground is the short cut to get rich, and the High Tax
  plan ever plays into the hands of those who own the ground. The
  ground may be in the form of town lots or farms, or it may be what we
  call wild land, it is all the same. In the States they have a tax on
  boards. Do you think this helps the men whose trade it is to cut down
  trees and saw them up in mills? That is what it was meant to do, they
  said. But some shrewd chaps long since got hold of the land on which
  the trees grew, and it was, in fact, they who got the tax put on. The
  tax keeps out logs from o'er the lakes, and so, if the mills are not
  to close down, logs must be bought from the ring, and the tax adds to
  their price. This is a straight blow to the men who work at this
  trade, but it is a "snap" for those who own the wild land. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  And so it works all through the list. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Should mills spring up by the score, and call for scores and
  scores more of men to work in them, so that vast stores of new goods
  would be brought forth, who in the end would gain by it? So long as
  mills have to stand on ground, and those who own ground have the
  right by law to own the rent as well, is there need to ask who would
  gain? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  <a name="CHAPTER XVII: THE &quot;SHIELD&quot; IS A"></a><b>CHAPTER XVII: THE "SHIELD" IS
  A HARM, NOT A HELP</b>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  If mills and so forth can not be built up in a land which has no
  tax wall, how comes it that in the States they had firms which made
  iron and cloth goods and so forth ere the first High Tax Act in
  1789? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  If it is true that a "poor" or "new" or "young" land can not hope
  to grow in the way of mills and works if it has not a wall to bar out
  the trade of a land that is near by and is full of big mills and the
  like, with stores of cash, "hands" that have great skill at their
  work, and cheap help, how comes it that this has not been the case
  with the West in the U. S., though it has had no wall to shield it
  from the East? As the tide of life has swept from East to West, these
  works have sprung up and have gone with it. They have grown up just
  as there was call for them, with no aid from tax laws. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  In fact, they have grown up in spite of such laws. There is no
  doubt these laws have hurt the States as a whole. If free trade had
  gone on from the first the States might rule the marts of the whole
  world, where now they make but a poor show, and for the most part
  trade at a loss. When there is tax, tax, tax all round, so that all
  parts of each piece of goods are made dear, how could such goods hope
  to meet those made at a much less cost? What is the fact at this
  time? That most of what the States sends out is raw stuff from the
  farms, and most of what it brings in goods made in mills and works
  o'er the sea. There is a trade with Brazil. Goods are brought from
  there; are goods sent from mills and works in the States to pay for
  it? No. Wheat and so forth is sent to John Bull, and John squares off
  the deal with Brazil. He sends goods which Sam buys with his
  wheat. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  This is the queer way in which the high tax plan has "built up the
  trade of the States with the world at large." It is well known that
  the "Yank" is as shrewd a man, with as good brains, as can be found
  on earth. He ought of right to lead the whole race in trade. Yet it
  is the fact that he does not; he is down near the tail end of the
  list. Strange, you say. No, just what one might look for when he
  loads tax weights on all things. To get the trade of the world the
  first thing to do is to make things cheap, and here this shrewd chap
  ties his own hands, or puts a clog on his own leg in the race. We
  hear much just now of how he "dumps" goods in lands o'er the sea. It
  is true he does a good deal in this line, but is it trade that is
  square, and that has real gain in it to him? Not at all. For the most
  part he sells these "dump" goods at cost, or less than cost, just to
  get rid of them. How can he do this? you ask. Well, you see, the high
  wall at home gives him the chance to hold his home trade and force
  the folks there to pay him twice the price the goods are worth, so
  that he can keep his mills on the go all the while, and when he finds
  more stuff on hand than the home man can take he "dumps" it o'er the
  sea in this way at "any old price." This, of course, is a good thing
  for those who get the goods; let us hope the dear folk in the States
  like the plan. It seems to be most kind on their part, does it not?
"It is grand -- but it is not trade."
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Then, too, the Yank's bright, shrewd brain works all the while on
  new schemes, and brings forth ideas by which work may be done with
  less toil and cost. If he could but get and hold the trade of the
  world in these things when he had thought them out, it would be a
  fine thing for him. But what takes place? Why the tax strings so tie
  him up that he cannot do it. John Bull takes up these new ideas, and,
  as he is not bound up with tax bands, makes the class of goods on the
  plan thought out by his smart friend, cuts down the price, and takes
  the trade. Once more we must say this looks kind on Sam's part. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  If you would see one case in which tax clogs have spoilt a great
  trade for the States, take ships. Where will you find more brains and
  skill, or more wood, iron, steel and all that goes to build a ship,
  than in the States? Why, then, are no ships built there to speak of?
  Think that out. It tells the whole tale. You will find that all the
  things that go into a ship from keel to truck, from the wire in her
  stays to the brass in her log, and all that goes to fit and store
  her, has to bear a tax load. Thus once more has the kind Yank made a
  free gift to John Bull of the ship yard trade of the world. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  And then note the facts as to the coast trade. The law says that
  no ship but one which flies the stars and stripes shall sail from
  port to port on the coast of the States. The rates of freight from
  New York round the Horn to the ports on the west coast are high.
  There is no doubt they could be made much less, and yet be fair, if
  all ships were free to go in for the trade, and this would be a gain
  to those who own the goods. But ships cost so much to build at home
  that few are built, and that the rates may be kept up, the "pool"
  which owns the lines of rails fr6m east to west pay the firm which
  owns the chief line of ships a large sum each month to keep up its
  rates. Thus, once more, we see how the high tax scheme plays into the
  hands of those who own land or right of way, or some "cinch" of the
  kind. <br>

  <a name="CHAPTER XVIII:&nbsp;AS TO WAGES"></a><b>CHAPTER XVIII:&nbsp;AS
  TO WAGES</b>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  We have seen that the High Tax plan is a clog on work. On the
  whole, it tends to choke up the spring of wealth. Let us now see what
  it does for the spread of wealth. All will grant at once that wealth
  must be spread-that is, it must go, when it is once made, to serve
  some use, and this is the same as to say it must go in to some hands.
  If the whole of it goes to one man, to keep for his own, and do with
  as he wills, then it does not spread at all. Now of course it ought
  to spread, and men should share it on some right rule or law. What is
  that law? This: It should go to those who work, and form a fair rate
  of pay for the work they do by hand or brain. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  We have got to such a pitch of skill now that it seems as though
  there is no end to the wealth that can be made, and this in the face
  of tax plans that bind and thwart us. But can it be said that the law
  I have just set forth is in vogue as to the spread of wealth when it
  is made? How is the loaf cut up? Do those who make it get it in due
  share? Or do some who do not toil nor spin get a share to which they
  have no right, and thus in fact rob those who work but get less than
  they ought to get? How does the High Tax idea bear on this? That is
  what we will try and find out now. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  The point is this: Does the high tax on goods raise or tend to
  keep up the wage of the man who works; does it, that is to say, help
  him to get the share of the loaf that is his due? "Yes," say some,
"of course it does; for it makes good times for all, and so must
  raise the pay of those who work, or at the least keep that pay from a
  fall." This is not proof; it is mere say-so. We have shown that, in
  fact, a high tax has no such force. It does not make "good times for
  all," for we do not need to be told that bad times come to lands that
  have the plan in full swing. And we know that pay does go down, and
  that there are spells in which men are "out of work," that is, get no
  share of wealth at all. But note this: It is not true at all times
  that that which helps or hurts the mass of men helps or hurts each
  one in the State. Fires and floods hurt some, but may be a means of
  gain to others. A fall in stocks is a loss to this man, but may mean
  a great gain to that one. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Trade, as we have seen, is a mode by which wealth is produced
  (turn back and read once more what was said as to what this long word
  is meant to stand for), and a high tax on goods, as has been shown,
  tends to block trade -- that is, to curb the growth of wealth -- to
  make it less. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Now we pass on to say that, since such a tax plan (as is its aim)
  puts up the price of goods, it makes the great mass pay more than
  they ought for what they buy, and gives to the few more than they
  could have got in a free field for what they sell. It thus plays
  pranks with the spread of wealth. It is those who thus get more than
  their fair share that are so loud in praise of the high tax scheme.
  But though the scheme may be a good one for those who sell goods that
  are put up in price in this way, how can it get for the plain man who
  works more than his fair share, or how, in short, can it do aught to
  make it sure that he gets even his fair share? He does not sell
  goods; he sells work of brains or of hand. There is no tax on this
  sort of thing; there is no wall to keep men out. A smith sells his
  skill to make tools, and he gets worth) of the tools he makes in the
  form of cash, and with this wage he buys what he needs -- clothes,
  food and so forth. Now, what good does it do him to put up the price
  of such things, by means of a tax, since the tax can not raise his
  wage in the same way? Let us say that, as a rule, he has to work one
  week to earn the price of a coat. By means of a fresh tax, say that
  coats rise to twice the cost they were. This is all right for the
  firms that make coats, but it means that the smith will have to work
  two weeks to get a coat now. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Where does his gain come in? Would it not be true to say that in
  such a case the tax has just cut his wage down by half? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  It is all very well for the heads of great firms to tell their men
  that the high tax plan is good for those who toil for a wage; but
  what would these gents say to a plan that would let goods come in
  free but put a high tax on men? There would be a fine shout of rage.
  It would be hard to make them see that such a scheme did them good.
  With men shut out, up would go the rate of pay, and with goods let in
  free down would go the price, and groans would rise from these big
  mills and trusts. But it is a poor rule that will not work both
  ways. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Now, how can a high tax on goods raise the wage of those who work
  farms when it does not touch the goods made on farms? Wheat, live
  stock, and so forth are sent out of the States, not brought in; how
  then can a tax to keep out goods help farms? It is plain that this
  plan can not do what must be done, that is, raise the whole wage of
  farm work. The corn laws which John Bull once had kept out grain and
  put the price up to a high point, but did it raise the pay of the
  farm hands? No, it did just one thing -- put more wealth in the purse
  of the "lord of the soil" in the form of rent. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Facts all round show that a tax on goods can not raise the pay of
  those who work. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  <a name="CHAPTER XIX:&nbsp;WHAT IS TO BE DONE"></a><b>CHAPTER
  XIX:&nbsp;WHAT IS TO BE DONE?</b>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  We have thus set forth full proof that the High Tax scheme is a
  fraud. It fails at all points the claims made for it. What then,
  shall be done? Put an end to it, of course. At this there will be a
  cry: "Oh, no, don't be in haste to do that. Go slow, if it must be
  done; but to do it at once would be to bring ruin to scores of
  firms." But if it be not just, why should it not be put an end to at
  once? Why should we let a gross wrong go on to save loss to the few,
  when day by day it means loss to the many? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  If there is to be a shock to trade when an end is made of this
  fraud, let that shock be a short and sharp one. It will thus do far
  less harm than if it is drawn out through a course of years. No man
  would choose to have his leg cut off by the inch. If short work is
  made of it the rich will have to bear their fair share of such loss
  as there may be for the time, but if it is to be done bit by bit the
  poor will have to take the brunt of it, as the rich will have time to
  scheme and so fix it. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  But all this talk of great loss is vain. It comes from those to
  whom the fraud is a source of gain. They do not want to let go their
  prey. But even they are wrong when they think they would lose by Free
  Trade. All sound trade would gain. It would break up the rings and
  trusts, and bring down gains that are now got in the wrong way, but
  would not that be a boon to the land? In the case of the States, it
  would soon give them the lead in the trade of the world, their ships
  would sail the seas once more, and a great source of "graft" and
  bribes would be put an end to. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  And what are we to say of such a fact as this-that in the slow old
  days, when folk had but poor, rude tools to work with, and could not
  in ten years make as much wealth as we now can in ten months, the lot
  of the poor was bliss to what it is now? A man in those far off times
  did not have to work so hard, and got more of the good things of this
  world for his work, while he did not know at all what the fear of
  want meant. (See Thorold Rogers' "Five Centuries of Work and Wages.)
  How comes it that in both Free Trade and High Tax lands at this day
  we find such a change in the class which is at the base? These men of
  the old time had to Work but eight hours a day, and no wife or child
  of theirs had to toil out of the home. How comes it that we at this
  date are so much worse off? How comes it that there is such a crowd
  of poor in the midst of such wealth-like the man on the raft with a
  whole sea round him but not a drop to drink? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  To sweep off the High Tax, then, would not in the end help those
  who work. That is it would not prove a real cure for their ills. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Nor would it in the long run mean a square deal. When wealth is
  not spread in a fair way, it tends to grow less. Men who work, but do
  not get, lose heart and tend to cease work. Nor can we say they are
  wrong to feel so, when they see the growth of the set who do no form
  of work, but get more and more of a share, which must, of course,
  come out of the share of those who do work. If the plan now in vogue
  does not make sure of a fair spread of wealth it tends, in short, to
  vice, crime and waste. And of a truth there is no need that we break
  down High Tax walls so that more wealth may be made if we are not at
  the same time to see that it is spread in a fair way. With the plan
  we now have that would be but to make bad worse. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  And what of "hard times"? The cause of these "bad spells" we are
  told, is that too much goods is made. If this be so, would not the
  fall of the High Tax walls, if it led to free scope of brain and
  hand, mean a great growth of wealth and thus a long term of "hard
  times"? <br>

  <br>
  <a name="CHAPTER XX: FREE TRADE THAT IS"></a><b>CHAPTER XX: FREE
  TRADE THAT IS NOT FREE</b>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  At this point it is the rule for books on this theme to close,
  for, in fact, this is the end of the case as 'twixt what they call
  Free Trade and High Tax plan. And, as we look at it, the High Tax is
  out of court; it has been shown to be a scheme which is a sham from
  end to end; which does no good (but to the few who pull wires) but
  robs the poor while it sings sweet songs in their ears. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Yet we must not stop here. We said this was to be a Whole-Hog
  Book; so we must go right through to the end. For all we have said
  has been said (by means of long words, to be sure) more times than
  one could count, and yet we find that lands stick to the High Tax
  plan, and vast crowds seem to have full faith in it still. The thing
  these folks need is more light. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  You may well ask how it is that such a plain fraud can still live
  and thrive? It is not that men have no sense, as some say. The fact
  is, the root of the faith in it is deep down, and that root must be
  laid bare and shown to be false. This the books we have in mind (on
  the Free Trade side) do not seek to do. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Ere we go on to dig out this root, let us say that the pleas made
  by Free Trade men to show those who work that the High Tax is a bad
  thing for them, do not hit the mark. For what, at most, do they
  prove? That Free Trade tends to the good of men, and the High Tax
  tends to their hurt. That seems to be as far as they can go, and this
  has no real weight with "men of the world." They say, "Yes, they may
  tend as you say, but that does not prove that they will do so." A
  brick that leaves a roof tends to fall to the ground, but if there is
  a broad ledge in the way to stop it, it will not fall to the ground.
  In the same way the aids that men now have to make wealth (one man
  now able to do as much in a day as a score of men could once do) tend
  to get each man more wealth for his share or wage, but will not in
  fact do so, if, through some cause, there are crowds of men on the
  search for work and who fight for each job in sight. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Those who plead for Free Trade show that since the tax walls curb
  the growth of wealth, to take them down would tend to help those who
  toil, and they "feel quite sure" it would raise their pay. But how
  can they be sure of this till they have shown that there is nought in
  the way that might thwart this good and right end? And what is it
  these "Free Trade" men urge should be done? Not make trade Free, as
  you might think, but put on a low tax in place of a high one, that is
  all! <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  There is not much in this to stir the hearts of men, and it does
  not do so. There are men of a fair mind who will hear all that is to
  be said (or read this book up to this point) and say: "No doubt Free
  Trade has the best case, and the proof seems all right, but yet the
  hard facts of the day show that as a plan the High Tax works best." This may
  have a strange sound, but there is sense in it. What it means is, Free Trade
  as thus set forth does not meet all the facts of
  the case. And this is true. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  One of these facts is that in a "Free Trade" land -- say John
  Bull's -- the slums are as deep and vile as in any High Tax land. Why
  should this be if Free Trade gives those who work their fair share of
  wealth? Such trade has no real right to the name of "Free."
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  <a name="CHAPTER XXI: WHERE &quot;FREE TRADE&quot;"></a><b>CHAPTER XXI:
  WHERE "FREE TRADE" IS WEAK</b>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  No doubt, if the Tax wall were torn down, pay would go up, for a
  time. It did so when the Corn Laws were swept off. But this would not
  last. The case would turn out ere long to be the same as it is in
  that of the steam loom, which, though it weaves more cloth than the
  old wheel could do, has not in the end made the lot of the poor one
  whit less sad. Free Trade would, no doubt cause more wealth to be
  made, and it would bring down the price of goods. But would those who
  work get their fair share of the gain, that is the point? A glance at
  the old Home Land seems to say, no. Why, then, should the poor of
  France or the States go wild for Free Trade? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  The more goods there are made, the more each man who works ought
  to have, in a fair deal all round. The march of skill has made the
  world more rich in goods now than in all the past. Yet we have hard
  times in spells, and not a few starve. And what say the wise men is
  the cause for this? That the mills have put forth too much! This is
  what they say in lands which have what they call "Free Trade," too!
  What these wise men should show is what it is that comes in the way
  to keep the bread the poor cry for, and would be glad to work for,
  out of their mouths. Why does not this sort of "Free Trade" "raise
  the plane of the sea of toil"? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Facts can be so dealt with as to make it seem that the state of
  those who work is on the mend, that they are, in short, well off to
  what they used to be. This has some truth in it when we speak of men
  who have high gifts or great skill or (as some say) good luck. But it
  is not true of the great mass. They are worse off. A poor man has
  scarce a chance at all at this day to start in trade on his own hook
  as once he could have done. To be sure some men grow more rich now
  than e'er they did in any past age, but side by side with this is the
  fact that the slums are more deep and wide than ever. Some force is
  at work, the fruit of which is Trusts and Tramps -- Wealth and Want.
  'Twixt these two states there lies a great gulf, and we have proof
  that to change from High Tax to Free Trade as they have it in the Old
  Land would not bridge this gulf, nor fill it up, for we see it has
  not done so in these three score years it has been at work. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  <a name="CHAPTER XXII: THE REAL STRENGTH"></a><b>CHAPTER XXII: THE
  REAL STRENGTH OF THE HIGH TAX SCHEME</b>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  We may make an end of all the pleas that are put forth for the
  High Tax plan -- as we have done -- and yet not touch the thought
  from which it gets its whole strength in the minds of those who hold
  it. What is that thought? It is that in some way, say as we will,
  this plan "makes work," and as it is a plain fact that there are more
  men who seek jobs than there are jobs to be done, that which tends to
"make work" must be a great boon. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  It is true that (as we have shown) since it leads to waste, the
  High Tax scheme does "make more work," just as the rain does when it
  wets the hay on the farm. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Rain in such a case is thought to be a boon by the man who earns
  his wage by the day, though the man who owns the farm does not take
  that view. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  We read of a King who had a hard heart; and, we are told, bade his
  slaves make bricks with no straw. Had he lived in these days, and had
  he dealt with wage slaves, he would have got high praise, for did his
  plan not "make more work," or tend to make the job last a long time?
  And if there were scores of men who sought work, would this not have
  been a good thing for those who held jobs? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  It is of no use, then, to prove that "work" is not what we need
  but the "fruits of work," and that good sense tells us to get what we
  seek with the least cost of time and toil. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  We must deal with this root thought that work is a boon, and that
  he who lets us work for him ought to have our thanks. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Whence springs this root thought? Out of the fact that men can not
  now, when they need food or clothes, go and work on their own hooks
  for these things. In all lands we note that as soon as the time is
  past when men can do so, and the time comes when they need some one
  to hire them lest they starve, the High Tax scheme comes to the front
  and gains the good will of the mass as a plan that "makes work."
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Of course no man wants work for its own sake. If he works for fun,
  then he will do just such work as he can get fun out of. If he works
  for life (as is the case with most) it is the pay he has in view. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  No man will work for nought if he can help it, and the things he
  makes by his toil is his wage by rights. If his work brings forth
  nought (as in the case, say, of a man who digs for gold on his own "claim") then he gets no wage. So the man who works for a Boss and in
  the course of a day makes no new wealth at all, does in fact earn no
  wage. But as things now go in the world the wage is paid for work
  done, not for the real worth of that work. A man has "put in" a day
  and looks for his pay, and gets it, though, had he done the same work
  as it were on a "claim" of his own, he would have got none. In this
  way it has come to pass that men in their thought join the two words
"work and wage," and not (as in the old, rude days) "toil and the
  fruit of toil as wage." That is to say, work has come to stand for
"pay," and when men praise a scheme that "makes work" they of course
  mean a scheme that makes a chance to get pay. In some towns they help
  the poor with a job on the roads. The "work" is a mere form, it may
  be; it is but a plan to give a dole to those in want. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  In face of the facts as they are, there is much to say for this
  idea that what "makes work" is a good thing. Men may have strong
  arms, staunch frames, good health and a will to work. All well; and
  it is true as we have said that work is the one way by which wealth
  can be made. But what if the man is at sea on a raft? All wealth
  comes out of the ground, and that he may work a man must be, not on
  the sea, or in the air) but on the earth. Give a man strength of arm
  and hope of heart and a bit of ground, and he need ask no one to hire
  him or to give him pay. He will work out his own wage each day. But
  since it is the fact that men as a rule can not get at the land
  (which is held for rent or must be bought at a price they can not
  pay) what is there left for them but to sell their strength or skill
  to those who will buy it-that is, to those who will pay them a wage
  they can live on? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  And as those who can thus buy are few and those who wish to sell a
  great host) we can see how it comes to pass that thanks seem to be
  due, not to him who does the work, but to him who "makes it," and
  that the work is thought to be a boon. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Nor is it hard to see how this same thought takes form in the
  oft-heard view -- to which High Tax men give loud voice -- that our
  own land ought to do all its own work, and any land which seeks to do
  any of it for us acts the part of a foe. Hence, of course, the High
  Tax which keeps these foes and their cheap goods out, must seem to be
  a plan which tends to make us at home rich. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Yet all this is false, and all that flows from it must be false. "It is work we need-not that the work should bear due fruit, hut that
  it should get 'pay.'" Such is the cry. Thus, we hear it said of a
  work that cost a great deal though it was of no use when done -
"True, it has done no good; but ah! it made a lot of work for scores
  of men." If such a thought is not false at the base then fires and
  floods and wrecks of all sorts must be boons, yet who would say
  this? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  If each man in need of work were free to go at it, all would see
  that each ounce of the wealth of the world which was burnt up would
  be a loss to all, and that those who did no work were as bad as
  thieves. But with the facts as they are -- with work a boon to be
  sought as one would seek for life-we do not think of it in this
  way. <br>

  <a name="CHAPTER XXIII:&nbsp;THERE'S A TH1EF"></a><b>CHAPTER
  XXIII:&nbsp;THERE'S A TH1EF IN THE CASE</b>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  The High Tax plan seeks to curb Trade, and Trade is but the
  thought God put in the heart of man as a means by which the whole
  race should gain. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  All that can be said for this plan could be said with just the
  same force for a plan to thwart all the new means that are brought
  out to save toil. This would shut off steam and all the great things
  it has done, and in all paths of life drive us back to the "stone
  age."
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  The mass of wealth of this age and the rate at which that mass
  grows is so great that all ought to be well off, but all are not.
  Each new plan to save toil should give more ease to all; but it does
  not. The man who has eyes does not need to be told this. He can see
  the deep slums in the rich old lands; and he can note, too, that in
  such a new land as the States the poor sink while the rich rise. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  In no place does the state of those who toil, as a whole, keep
  pace with the march of the arts which aid the growth of wealth. And
  in those spots where those who work may from time to time get a bit
  more of a share, this is not due to those arts. It is due to strikes
  or threats of strikes. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  In view of these facts there is, of course, but one thing to be
  said. If there is more wealth made and those who help to make it do
  not get more for their share, there must be some pouch into which
  goes a share which should not go there. In short, there is a thief at
  large. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Who is the thief? In what way does he steal the shares of those
  who work? How can we end his theft? Here we reach the real point of
  the whole case. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  We hear a voice say-"Stop. Do not vex your soul with these things.
  Those who work are now well off to what they once were. Do they not
  eat good food and wear good clothes? Do they not have good times as a
  rule? Just think how the poor slaves had to work, and what hard times
  they had!"
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Ah! how nice, to be sure. But does this make the theft right? Let
  no such false talk switch us off the track of the thief. This is a
  Whole-Hog Book. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  <a name="CHAPTER XXIV: THE THIEF: WHO HE"></a><b>CHAPTER XXIV: THE
  THIEF: WHO HE IS, AND HOW HE DOES IT</b>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  It has been shown that the High Tax plan robs those who work, but
  to, put an end to that plan would not solve the case, for it would
  not touch the Chief Thief -- the man who owns the earth. His rule is
  to take all that is left -- all but life, and what will just keep the
  man in a fit state to work. There are not a few small thieves like
  the High Tax that thrive on the son of toil, but short work can be
  made of them when the Big Thief is done for. Do you ask, "How can it
  be theft to own the earth, that is to say, to own land rent? Some of
  the best of men own land -- do you call them by the base name of
  thieves? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  It is not the men we have to deal with; it is the law by which the
  land may now be held. That law means theft, and must so mean as long
  as it stands as it is. The blame is not on the man, be he good or
  bad, it is on the law which can work in but one way, and that is to
  take from A what he earns and give it to B, who has done no hand's
  turn for it. This is to steal; so, for short, we call it theft. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Let us see what the law now is as to land. It treats land just as
  it treats hats, coats, books, wheat and all the things which we call "goods," and
  which are made by the skill of man or grown by his care and toil. It says that
  a man can own land just as he may own a bag of
  wheat, that is, he may do as he likes with it; he may use it or not
  use it; he may let some one else use it or not, he may sell it or
  deal with it just as he wills. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Well, you say, why not? <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  I will tell you why; land is not in the same class as "goods," and
  the law has no right to treat it as if it were. Land is not the work
  of man's hands, nor can he grow it or make it less or more. It is
  God's earth and His free gift to the whole race, like the air, the
  light, the sea, and so forth. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Yes, you say, I know all that, but how is land to be put to use if
  men do not own it? True, men must own it; that 's quite right, -- but
  not on such terms as those set forth in the law as it now stands.
  Each man who holds (or owns) a piece of it should, of right, make up
  to the race what he thus takes from them-he should pay each year what
  it is worth. If a man owns a hat and sees fit to burn it up he does
  no great harm to the race, for more hats can be made; but if he owns
  a piece of the earth -- for which he pays no rent to the rest-and
  sees fit to hold it out of use, he has cut down the size of the earth
  by just that much. This is a loss which can not be made up. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  No one man can in a true sense be said to "own" land, nor in fact
  can all the men who live in one age. For those who are to be born in
  the next age are to have the same rights as men who now live on the
  earth. Each age has but the use of the earth while here. But if this
  is true, then no man can get the same sort of right to land as he may
  to a hat or boots or house, not though all who dwell on earth were to
  sign the deed. That which is not ours we can not give nor sell. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  To own land, then, ought to mean no more than this, that a man may
  have the sole right to it, to use it or hold it out of use as he sees
  fit, so long as he pays each year what the bare land is worth. Since
  the race at large can not have the use of the land while it is in his
  hands it is but right that they should have the worth of it. When
  this is paid each year, it is fair all round, and all that the man
  makes by his own use of the land ought to be his own and free from
  all forms of tax. In short while it is right that a man should "own" land it
  is not right that he should also own the land rent. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  But this is not the law as it now stands. A man may now hold land
  and by that fact he owns the rent as well. That is where the wrong
  is. 'Twixt what he pays for it in a tax to the State (where there is
  a tax at all), and what he can get for its use from some one who
  needs it in the form of rent, there is oft a great sum of gain, and
  thus we have a class that lives on land rent, that is, who get paid
  to let some one else work. And what is this rent but a part of the
  wealth which the some one else earns? And how much of it? All of it
  but such share as will keep the man in a fit state to work and to
  earn. If this is not theft in the sight of God, what would you call
  theft? Hence we use the blunt term thief for him who takes goods he
  does not earn in the, form of rent and by force of law. In past times
  men used to own slaves and take all the slaves could make, but then
  they had to keep and feed their slaves; now they own the land on
  which "free" men must work, and this gives them a right in law to a
  share of the wealth in the form of rent; nor do they have to keep or
  feed the new sort of slaves. You see, to bring forth any form of
  wealth you must have two things, the toil or skill of man, and land.
  It makes no odds which of these two you own to give you a right to a
  share of what is made, with no work on your part. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  And note this, that the funds which the State needs each year must
  be paid, out of what is left when the rent which of right is the
  State's has been paid. Thus, the man who works pays twice, he pays
  first for the use of land (that is, for leave to work at all) and
  then he pays for what the State does for him. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  When we say that the Big Thief takes "all that is left" we point
  to the fact' that the growth of land rent keeps pace with the growth
  of the race. Each move that makes life more bright and fair, or tends
  to the good of all, sends land rent tip. Free street cars would be a
  boon in large towns, but what a man might save in fares he would have
  to pay in land rent. If, in fact, gold fell from the clouds like rain
  no one would gain but the men who own the land on which it fell. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Rent is not a thing which comes by the will of man, it is the
  gauge which tells what the chance is worth in each case, and it goes
  up or down as a town grows or fails. It is there all the while, and
  is in no case the fruit of toil. By the law as it now stands rent
  goes to him who owns the land. If the man who works a farm does not
  own it, he pays the rent to some one else; if he owns the farm he
  keeps the rent, as well as the wealth his work earns. Land that is in
  use bears rent just as a tree bears leaves. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  If some men own the world on which the whole race must live, and
  have the right by law to charge for its use while not made to pay a
  fair rate for the land they thus hold, it is clear that there must be
  just what we see -- the Rich and the Poor. While this state of things
  lasts nought that 'we can do can cure the ills of men. High Tax and
  Low Tax plans both fail to do this, as we have seen. True Free Trade
  would do it. <br>

<p><a name="CHAPTER XXV: TRUE FREE TRADE"></a><b>CHAPTER XXV: TRUE
FREE TRADE</b></p>
There is no land on earth, where, as yet, true Free Trade has been
tried, for, to make Trade free in a real sense we must make land
free. That is to say, the right of each man to live on the earth as a
son of God, with no fee to pay to any man for that right, must be set
down in the law. God made the earth for all, and all must be able to
use it. But how is the law to fix it that this may be done?&nbsp;
<p>There are some Ways in which it can not be done.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. The land can not be cut up so as
to give each man his due share. Such a plan is not to be thought of.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2. The land can not be held by all in such a sense that no man has
the right to the sole use of any part of it.</p>
</blockquote>
We must find a plan which is in line with these two truths:
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> 1. That all men have the same right to
life and to the means
of life.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. That each man has a right to own the whole of what he makes
by his toil and thrift.</div>
<br>
These two truths go hand in hand. For if we are to leave to each
man the whole of what he earns, we must keep those things which God
has made, for all. We must set it down in the law that no man may own
and get rent for the light of the sun or for rain, or for land; else
he will get what he does not earn. But if we so fix it that each man
gets all the fruit of his toil, and may own nought else, then no one
can own what is not the fruit of his toil.<br>
<br>
It is not hard to see how the law could fix this. It is no more
than is done day by day. Four or five men own a ship. How do they
act? They share up what the ship earns by trade. In the same way they
may own a horse or any means of gain.<br>
<br>
So with the earth. Who owns it? All who live on it. How are they
to deal with it so that each may get his share of its worth? Let all
who hold any part of it pay a fair rent for that part; and let all
parts not thus held and paid for be free to those who wish to take
them up and pay the rent. Let this rent be paid to the State till, to
be spent for the good of all in each land. Thus all will get a clue
share-and all will stand on the one base as the free sons of God. And
the till of the State will be full though there is no tax on
goods.<br>
<br>
Ah! you say, that would have been the right plan if it had been
set up at first, but it is too late now. It would cause a great row
to change at this late day; it might bring on a war! But bear in mind
that no one asks that it be done all at once. We need but to take the
tax off the fruits of toil step by step, -- off food, barns, stores,
and the whole list of wealth on which we now pay-and make up for what
we thus take off by more and more of a tax on land rent. When in this
way we have at last got the whole of the rent, the thing is done. Of
course this will be grim death to those who live on land rent, but
what are they but drones in the hive? Each man who works with brains,
or hand, or funds, will gain, for he will then keep all he makes. If
such a man owns land, of course he can not then let it out for rent,
nor sell it at a "rise in price" -- that source of gain will be done
for -- but he will gain more as a bee than he will lose as a
flea.<br>
<br>
This plan:
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> 1. Would be a great spur to trade, since
it would throw down
the bars that now keep toil from the source of all wealth; and give
new vim to trade, as there would be no tax put on any thing that was
built or made or grown.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Would give a source of funds for
the State that would at
all times be sure, and this while it left the whole of the wealth in
the hands of those who made it.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> 3. Would put an end once and for all to
the ground hog -- the
Great Thief that now takes "all that is left."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> 4. Would pave the way for those steps on
the path of right
which all good men long to take. With true Free Trade in vogue, each
new man would mean new wealth, and a gain to all, and we might then
say with truth "there is room and a fair chance for all."</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">5. Would rob the drink curse of the
sway it now has, and put
an end to many of the ills we now mourn over.<br>
<br>
6. Would be just, for it would give to each man what was his
own of right; and to the State the funds which spring up on land by
mere force of the growth of the crowd, and costs no man the sweat of
his brow.</div>
<br>
True Free Trade means in fact that there shall be no such thing as
a tax at all. It means that the walls shall all come down, and that
there shall be no charge of any kind on trade in or out of the State,
but the one charge, a fair rate for the use of the bare land, and it
is wrong to call this a tax. When a man earns any thing it is his of
right, but to have the sole use of any one piece of the world which
God made for all is no man's right. It is a grant, as it were, from
all the rest, who waive their own claims, each one of which is as
good as his. It is not a right but a grant, an act of grace on the
part of all, and that he should pay what it is worth is no more than
fair. It is a chance for the man, and when there is no tax at all on
what he makes by the use of the chance, be his gain great or small;
the fee he pays is not a tax. Yet as we must have a name for it we
may as well let the word stand.
<p>In the term Trade there are two clear parts. When goods are bought
and sold, brought in or sent out of a land, that is but one half of
it, though it is thought of as if it were the whole. Ere goods can be
bought or sold, they must first be made, and no odds what their form
may be they are got out of the ground first of all, and then put in
shape by the skill of men's hands. This, too, is a part of trade; it
is in fact the base of trade. If, then, we are to have Free Trade we
must have free land-it must not be held in the clutch of those who
will take toll for its use. Free Trade means that there shall be free
scope to make things as well as free scope to buy and sell them.</p>
<p>A State can not go on if it has not funds, but much hangs on the
plan by which funds are got. It is the food the State lives on, and
just as in the case of a man, wrong food is sure to bring forth ills.
We have shown that to get funds by means of a tax on goods must be to
rob those who work of a part of what they earn. This is not just. It
is wrong, and we see the fruits of it on all hands.</p>
There are two forms of tax which would be just and fair:
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> 1. If it were worth while to do so, a
tax might be put on
"style." If rich folks see fit to have coats of arms and such things
just to show their wealth, they might be made to show it as well in
the form of a tax to be paid each year on their "frills."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> 2. A tax (so to call it) on land rent.
This is not the same as
a tax on land. It is on what the land as bare land is worth in each
case, and of course it does not touch what may have been built on
said land, or done to it in the way of drains, etc.</p>
This tax would make a free way to the land for Toil, and as it
would kill off the drones who now get a share of the wealth it would
tend to a fair spread of wealth in the world. With true Free Trade,
each new step in the arts would lift the whole race as it ought to
do, but as it now fails to do.
<p>True Free Trade would set free the wage slaves of our day.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><a name="CHAPTER XXVI:&nbsp;THE LION IN THE W"></a><b>CHAPTER
XXVI:&nbsp;THE LION IN THE WAY</b></p>
The way to True Free Trade is clear, but there is a lion in it. At
this dread beast men who see the path and know it is the right one to
take, shake in their boots. To set the land free, as well as trade in
goods, would be to stop the game of those who live on rent, an4 as
this means of wealth to those who toil not has gone on a long time,
it has in some way got to seem a "right," and men shrink from the
thought that it must be put an end to. Of course it is not a "right,"
but, as we have shown, a "wrong," and it must be brought to an end if
men are to be made free in any true sense. Then, it is not only those
who live on rent, but a great host of those, too, who; though they
earn their bread by work of some kind, yet hold land and hope to make
gain in this way as well, who take a firm stand for things as they
are. These, for the most part, do not know that to all who work the
tax on land rent would be a great gain, which would more than make up
for what they would lose in rent. But the drones, who sit on the back
of Toil and live on the toll they get for the use of God's earth,
would be slain by such a tax. That, in short, is just what it is for.
The lion must go so that the race may move on; or the race must sit
down and give up hope.
<p>The "rights" of the lion will not bear the light of day. As has
been well shown by one whose name is high in the halls of fame, the
first deeds were drawn with blood, and not with ink, with sword and
not with pen. That is to say, those who held the land in the first
place took it by force -- stole it. You can base no sound right on
theft. But even if the land had at first been bought from the whole
race, the case now would be just as bad, for had the race in that far
off day a right to sell our claim to the use of the earth in our day?
The law holds, as it has done from the first, that the Crown owns the
land and that those who are said to own it do but hold it at the will
of the Crown-that is, of ALL. But in the mean while there is no doubt
it is fear of the lion in the way that makes those who would fain be
the friends of man sing so small when they talk of Free Trade. They
do not dare to speak out for the real thing -- Free Land, Free Trade,
Free Men!</p>
<p><a name="CHAPTER XXVII: CHOKE OFF THE BI"></a><b>CHAPTER XXVII:
CHOKE OFF THE BIG THIEF FIRST</b></p>
<p>A great host of ills may spring from one cause, and a cure for all
of them may lie in one and the same thing, but it takes some thought
to see and grasp this. Men are prone to the idea that each phase of
ill in the world of trade needs its own cure, or that there can be no
cure but to make the heart of each man right; or for the State to
take care of all.</p>
<p>Hence at this day we have a score of "cures" held out, and men who
no doubt have the good of the race at heart are at odds as to the
thing that ought to be done. But there can be no doubt of one
thing-if a man is set on by a lot of thieves and there is one of them
who "takes all that is left," his right course is first of all to
down that thief. When this is done he will at least have some of his
goods safe, and can then get strength to fight off the rest. That is
to say, first set the land free, and take the tax off what a man
earns, and he will have the means to stop the small drains he now has
on his purse. But of what use can it be, to put an end to the small
thefts if you leave that big thief who will then but get the
more?</p>
Up to this time the Trade Union is the one and only shield Toil
has had, and this has on the whole been but of small use; while the
great mass have not even had this aid. To get their full rights by
such means is as hard as for a man in a crowd to get room, and by
sheer strength to push back those who press in on him. The whole base
of life is wrong, and it must be made right; it is built on the lie
that God made the earth for a few to own and rent out to the race at
large, when the truth is that the earth was made for all, and that
hence the rent of land must be for all.<br>
<br>
Some say the sure cure is for the State to do all things, to run
all the shops and find work for all who can work. This calls for wise
and good men, men who are all but gods, at the head of the State, and
how are we to be sure to get them? Such a plan would not do till all
men were made good. But there is no need of such a plan. There are
some things the State can do and should do -- Take charge of those
lines of trade which in any case must have the aid of the State or of
the town, such as railways, trams, gas, phones and so forth. But all
lines in which a man could start on his own hook, which do not need
to wield the powers of the Crown, should be left for the free will of
each man. The true rule is -- to each man what is his -- to the State
what is the State's. So long as man may own land on the terms that
are now in vogue, so long will it seem that the two forms of Toil
(Labor and Capital) are foes. They are not, but the true foe of both
is the land lord as such. It is due to the same cause-that some men
now own the earth -- that there seems to be a great wrong in
competition. We can have, in fact, no such thing as true competition
where land is held in the way it now is, for one part of the race is
tied up, as we may say, and has no chance. We could not live if we
had no air, or if all the air should press on but one side of us, for
then it would pin us down and kill us. As it is, we are free so far
as air goes, we can breathe all we want of it, and it is all round us
so that we do not feel its weight at all. In the same way, give men a
free path to the land so that, if need be, they can in any case work
and live, and not have to beg the right, and competition would be
fair, and would prove a good thing for all, since each would get his
full due.<br>
<br>
There are men in this day who are so rich that their names are
known all through the world. They did not, of course, earn their
great wealth; not one of them could have done so. In each case it is
toll, due to laws not of God but of men. Some take toll on goods
through the High Tax, but for the most part the toll is land rent in
some form. Give us the tax on land rent and True Free Trade, and we
will see the last of this gross wrong of some who grow rich in sloth
and the great mass who starve for want of a chance to work.
<p><a name="CHAPTER XXVIII:&nbsp;WHAT WILL YOU D"></a><b>CHAPTER
XXVIII:&nbsp;WHAT WILL YOU DO?</b></p>
The cause of True Free Trade is the cause of the Rights of Man,
and as such, where once it is known it goes to the heart, and calls
forth all that is best and most God-like in us. To pack it all into a
few words -- we must make the earth as free to all as air and light
and the warmth of the sun are now free. We may be sure that had Greed
and Grasp been able to build walls round the air or the light these
would at this day have been held for rent, and the law would back up
the "rights" of those who thus held them. And we would find those who
sought to get true free trade in air and light, as well as in goods,
would have to bear the name of "cranks." Well, though air and light
are now free, land is not, and we need it just as much if we are to
live. The time has come for the fight. Let us draw our swords and
press on. The cause is one we may be proud to fight in, and if need
be to die for. What, then, shall we do? Take the first step first.
Break down the High Tax wall. Seek to have the tax on goods cut off.
Seek to get a law that will give the folks of a town or State the
right to tax what they think should bear a tax, and to set free what
they think should be free. And while at work in all these ways and in
all ways that are on the straight and true path, let each man spread
the light with tongue and pen as best he may. Let each take a part in
the Free Trade fight which is now on, for this is on the right line,
poor as the end it aims at is. Yet it gives a chance to throw light
on True Free Trade, and on the path the Bull must tread to get the
twist out of the rope that now holds his nose to the post. He must go
step by step in the track which leads to the great truth that man may
not own land rent, since he may not own men.
<p><a name="CHAPTER XXIX:&nbsp;TO SUM UP"></a><b>CHAPTER XXIX:&nbsp;TO SUM
UP</b></p>
<p>We set out to make a search for the truth as to which of the two
plans was best for "those who have to work" -- the High Tax, or what
they call Free Trade. We have found that the High Tax plan has no
help at all in it for this class, and can but harm them. It is, in
short, a scheme by which the few may by law tax the many. We have
found that Free Trade as they have it in John Bull's land, though a
step in the right line, does not prove to be the boon it was meant to
be. And the cause of this we have seen in the fact that though trade
is free (that is, there is no tax on most goods brought in) land is
not free. The source of wealth is shut off, or held for rent or toll.
We have found that land rent is the one thing that goes up, with each
step the world takes, that all that art and skill have done to make
toil light and wealth great, counts for next to nought for the mass
of men; they get no such share of the loaf as they have a right to.
Those who hold the land have a right by law to take "all that is
left," so that no plan or scheme can ease the lot of the wage slave
while that state of things lasts. If it should rain food and clothes
and all the forms of wealth we need from the sky, it would not help
the man who has no' claim to the land on which they would fall. The
end of our search, then, has brought us to this clear truth -- the
plan that will aid one and all and be fair and just is True Free
Trade, in which the land will be set free as well as the things which
are made from the land -- in which men will be free to work as well
as to trade. It is in the path of this True Free Trade that the wage
slave must go to loose the rope that now binds him to the post. The
work first to our hand is to get the tax off goods bit by bit, and
with each step in this line get it put more and more on land rent. In
due time we will reach the point where land can only be held for use.
The day of the ground hog who holds it for a rise will be done; he
must use it, or drop it and let some one else have a chance.</p>
<p>Thus have we gone through the whole wage theme from end to end, as
we might pass through the dark shaft of a mine. We have with care
sought to find out the truth, and we have found it. The full light
has now burst on us. It is the light of True Free Trade; 'neath which
joy and peace will take the place of age long wrong, and God's will
shall be done on earth.</p>
