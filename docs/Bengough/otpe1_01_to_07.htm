          <a name="The Bull In A Fix"></a><b>The Bull In A Fix</b>
        </center>
        <p> As I sit down to write, I glance out, and in a field I see a big
          black Bull. He is tied to a stake and he has gone round and round till
          he has his nose close to the post, and there he stands and roars and
          paws the ground. Poor chap! He has lots of strength, but it does him
          no good. If he but knew it, he could, of course, turn, and go round
          and round and thus get the rope loose. But he has not the head for
          that.</p>
        <p> I see in this Bull and his sad fix the type of those who toil yet
          go in want. They, too, are in a wide field, where there is no lack
          of wealth, and they want all sorts of good things for which they would
          be glad to give their work; but they can by no means get more than
          will just keep them in life. They, too, paw and roar as we may say,
          for we hear the cry of the poor all through the land. But, like the
          Bull, they know not how to get free. They have not the wit to see their
          way out of the snarl nor will they, as a rule, give ear to those who
          could teach them how. Yet, till they know the truth, they can not be
          made free, for you can not drive men out of their fix as you can a
          Bull.</p>
        <p> The Bull in the field got tied up in this way by his own act; and
          so did the men of toil fix their own fate in the way we see it. They
          have the strength; they have the votes; they are the ones who rule
          in all lands we call free, so it is all their own fault. Theirs has
          been the lack of sense, and theirs it is to undo the evil. But this
          they can not do till they see just what is wrong and how it is to be
          made right. What they need is light. When once they see their way out
          we may trust them to get out.</p>

      prove their faith the true one. Is the faith in the "tax on goods" a true

      and, of course, these are bound to work for it; and it gets strength, as
      well, from the feuds and wars that go on in the world. In view of these
      things, we must be on our guard and go slow and sure, step by step. It
      is but fair to note, too, that there is not in the world at this hour one

      for the plan that claims it can shield them from such a state of things;
      such, they are told, is the aim of the "High Tax
Plan." No such claim seems to be made by those who talk for Free Trade; they
do not pose as the great friends of Toil. They seem to have, in truth, hard hearts,
for they talk of God's law as the real cause of Want; and on the same ground
on which they fight a tax on goods they fight all laws to fix hours of work,
rates of pay and so forth. The truth is these men are for Free Trade so far as
that has
to do with "buy and sell," but they do not seem to think the term has aught to
do with the right of a man to work, or how to share up the wealth in a fair and
just way when it has been made. Thus, you see, they leave out one half of the
truth. It is not strange that, thus set forth, Free Trade must seem the foe of
toil, and earn the ill-will of those who work. But, to be fair, we must see to
it that we set forth true Free Trade side by side with the true High Tax plan;
as only then can we come to a just view of the case.</td>

The High Tax plan claims to "shield" those who work. But why, we ask, should
this class need a shield? The old, the sick, the lame, and such, are the ones
who need care and help, but why talk of aid for those who work, and who must,
of course, be the well, the young, those with good brains or strong arms? Does
this not strike you as queer, in the first place? If there is a thing that a
grown man hates it is to be made a child of. If those who do the work of the
world
need to be "kept," as it were by whom are they to be so kept? It must be by those
who do not work, that is to say, by those who live by alms or by theft, for there
are but these three grades of men in all the world, those who work, those who
beg and those who steal. Think it out, and see if you can name one more class.
Is it not plain that since all must live by means of food, clothes and roofs
&#8212; that is, "wealth" &#8212;  and since all wealth on earth is the fruit
of work, it
must be that those who work "keep" those who do not? Let those who toil think
this out, too. Adam was the first son of Toil, but there
was no one to "shield" him, was there? The fact is that those who have to live
by the sweat of their brows have been made game of by the use of a word which
we may well call a trick term. That word is "Protect." It is a good, true word
in its right place. It means to shield, to keep, to bless. We all feel that it
is a right thing for a man to pro-tect his house, his dear ones, or the land
he lives in. That is the true sense of the word. So some cute head hit on this
term as the name of the High Tax plan. But it by no means stands for the same
sort of thing in that case. In its fair and right use the word means to ward
off ills, and to do this for one and all. But does the High Tax ward off ills
when it keeps out goods? And does it help and bless those who want the goods
when it thus keeps them out or makes them dear? And does it deal with one and
all in the same way? What would we think of a man who, as the head of a home,
should shield his big boy and give no care at all to his babe? Yet this is the
way in which the High Tax plan works and must work, as we shall see. And if so,
you will grant that to call it "Protection" is to use a trick name. Do not let
a mere name fool you. See how it works; that is the real thing. Put the mere
name out of mind, and go on and see what there is in it. Two facts may be found
side by side, but it may be there is no real link 'twixt them. A man gets more
of a wage in the States than he could get in John Bull's land, that is one fact.
Sam goes in for Pro. and John for what he calls Free Trade (but which is Free
Trade with a string to it). That is fact two. Well, what then? Is it safe to
nail it down at once as a truth that the High Tax is the cause of the high wage
and Free Trade of the low? By no means. The high wage in the States does not
prove that Sam's plan is sound any more than the great growth of trade in the
old land proves that Bull's plan is the right one, for there are other facts
which may have to do with it. There are, in short, such hosts of facts that bear
on the weal and woe of man, that we must sift them out with care, or we are sure
to go wrong. Now, first of all, we must get to
know: (1) What "Protective Tariffs" are, and (2) What they do. If we start with
what we know to be true, and are quite sure of and then go on step by step with
due care, we may trace this thing out through all its twists and turns, and reach
the real truth. That is what we now set out to do, and all we ask of him who
reads is that he will
not trust to our mere "say so," but bring each step we take to the test of his
own good sense.&nbsp; </td>

      on goods that seek to come into a land, as will tend to keep them out,
      so that those who make goods of the same kind in said land may "have a
      chance." The thought is, at base, that each land by rights ought to serve
      all its own needs; or at least make all the things it can make, and that
      such things should not be brought in from strange shores, where they may
      be made by men who work for a less wage. Thus will both Boss and Man have

      town, yea, each house, till at last you come to this &#8212;  that each
      man should make all his own things. That, you say, is mad talk. It may
      be, but is
      it not what your "law of truth" leads to? If it is mad, the fault is with
      your law. It means that you dare not go where it leads; in short, it will
      not stand the test we spoke of. If you still hold to it, you are bound
      to say that you think a reign of Peace and Love, in which all men of all
      climes would be as friends, and give their gifts each to each, with no
      walls to bar off land from land, would be a bad thing for the race &#8212;      that

not think peace and love would be bad for the world. Still, I am for the High
Tax and hold it to be the true plan; but you must
not go too far with it." But this will not do. The fact that you must stop
at some point in this way proves, as we say, that your path is a wrong one from
the first. A straight line from the true can not lead to the false. Note the
fix you would be in, if with the faith you hold in the High Tax, you went to
preach to a tribe of wild men. You would first set forth the love of God, and
how men should love and serve each other and do good, even to those who hate
them; and then you would go on to say that by the laws of this same God each
tribe must build walls to bar out trade on all hands. Don't you think, now, this
thing of walls and bars is more like a scheme which man has got up, and has no
base in any law of God? Or would you say that what is true of a man is not true
of men &#8212; that in one sphere love is the true way; in the other strife is
the true

      would it not, on your plan? You do not praise Cap. Kidd with his black

      on the way to ports where goods of the same kind could be made, would he
      not do the work now done by the High Tax? How comes it that you share with
      your Free Trade friend his joy when new roads are built, and new ways found
      for the growth of trade through the world? If the High Tax idea is the
      true one you ought to mourn. How comes it that you are as keen as he to
      see an air ship made that will fly like a bird? Should that come to pass
      what good will your walls be then to keep out trade? You will have to roof
      in the whole
land. Your cry is "down with the cheap," and you take up the cry, "cheap goods
make cheap men." That is why you say we need the wall to keep out the goods made
by ill-paid toil. But why do you not act on this view, and break up each new
machine that is made which saves work and so makes things cheap? And why do you
not stop up gas wells that tend to drive out coal more than the tax on coal does?
And why
do you talk as though the great thing was to "make" goods, not to get them for
use? Are you not at war with plain sense on all these
points?</td>

      We see two
  Lands side by side each with its own flag and with walls to keep out cheap
  goods. The idea, of course, is that if these walls were not there it would
  be bad for both Lands; Trade in each would fall off, men would be thrown out
  of work, and so forth. Each needs a shield to ward off such ills from its own
  Trade. But at length it is thought best that they should join and have one
  flag. This is don by a scratch of a pen; the two Kings sign their names and
  one steps out. What has this pen scratch to do with Trade? Not a thing. Yet
  lo! the first move that is made is to pull down the walls. How comes it that
  a scratch of a King's pen can so change the facts on which the walls were built,
  if they were facts? There is no change in the Trade of the two lands, though
  they now have the same flag and King, and if, ere this was done each had need
  of a shield, they need those shields just as much now. But, of course, good
  sense tells them 'that the folk of any one Land ought to have Free Trade in
  their own lines, and since the lines now go round both the joint states they
  act on this idea'. And of course they find it good for all. But, if so, it

      You can lead a horse to a trough, but can you make him drink? And if he
      won't drink do you need to put a bag on his mouth? These men may wish to
      send in goods, but if no one cares to buy them, do you need a high wall
      to keep them out? But there are those in our own land who do want to buy
      those goods. These are the
folks the High Tax hits; these are our "foes" in the case! When we are at war
our foe tries the first thing to close our ports. Why? So that we can not get
the goods in that we want. He thus deals a blow to our land and he aims it, you
see, not at those who send the goods, but at us, who want to buy them. His hope
is to starve us out. This is the act of a foe, and just what we might look for,
but what say you to the same act on the part of a friend? Yet this is what the
High Tax plan comes to, and it seeks this end by a tax on the goods we want,
to make them so dear that they will not be brought in. Of course, this harms
those who would send the goods, as it hurts their trade, but its chief hurt comes
to those who want the goods and can not now get them, but must buy at home and
pay far more for, it may be, worse goods. <em><strong>Is this not a queer thing,
that we seek to do to our own land in times of peace what our foes seek to do
to us in
times of war? </strong></em>And please bear in mind that the goods thus sent to our shore are
not goods sent in on sale or chance of sale. No. All that are sent in have been
bought ere they are sent &#8212;  bought by those in our own land who want
them. <strong><em>And thus it comes to pass that the men who vote and shout for the High
Tax plan one

to dodge the High
Tax though they help to put it on.</em></strong></td>

    <td>Why does the man who keeps a shop send for goods to the man who makes
      them o'er the sea? He does not want all those things for his own use. No.
      There are calls for them from those who live in the place where he has
      his shop. Why these calls? To meet wants that come up day by day and hour
      by hour, and which each sane man seeks to meet with the least cost. No
      man will give five bob for a hat if he can get as good a, hat for half
      that price, which is the same thing as to say no man will give two days'
      work to gain what he could get for one day's work. He acts in this way
      by a law which lies at the root of his soul; and by a law just as deep
      he seeks to trade. As blood flows through the veins of a man, so trade
      flows through the veins of a state or a town. It is trade that makes men
      what they are, and what they have grown to be since the days when they
      dwelt in trees and in caves, and each man sought to meet all his own wants
      by his own act and skill. In our day, when each man makes but one form
      of wealth, or some part of that one form, and trades what he makes for
      all forms of wealth he needs (that is, gets his wage in cash and buys what
      he wants), he can live what we call a full life, and trade is the blood
      of that life. So it is plain that just in so far as you thwart trade, or
      by any means tend to block it, you by that much drive the race back to
      the old low plane from which it came up. Trade is the life of the race
      and the lamp which sheds the light of help and peace through all the world.
      We can not have too much of it, nor can it be too free. If God did not
      mean trade to be free as air He would have so made the world that each
      tribe &#8212; or each man &#8212; would live in a lone way and deal with
      no one, but we all know the world is not built on that plan. The whole
      trend
      of
      things is to bring in the day when each shall be for all and none for self.
      In the face of this well known fact what can we say for such a plan as
      this of a High Tax on goods? Take this case: Here is a man who sees fit
      to trade a horse he does not want for two cows he does want. Now, what
      sense would there be in a law that would say to this man, No, you shall
      not make such a trade, it is best that you raise your own cows, and let
      your friend breed a horse of his own. Yet that is just what the law does
      say to a man if the cows are not on his side of the line that parts his
      land
from the other!</td>

      He was but one of a long line, for what good is tea in a field to Dame
      Jones? It is only in the first stage. It has to go through a lot more hands;

      it, sell it, store it, team it to the shop, and hand it out to the good
