        then, if he Sold them in a far Land, he would have to take Goods of that
            Land for his Pay, and then when he brought those Goods home he would

      will in fact make Bad Worse. </p>
      <p>So these Men say, We must make the Law more

      <p>You Know how God came to the Help of the Tribes He led out of the Dark
      Land. </p>
      <p>At one Place, the Good Book tells us, He sent them Food which fell
      on the Ground, and each Man was Free to pick up a Share. </p>
      <p>If some Man
            had Held that Land on a Deed, that Food would have been His, and
        All would have had to Pay him for it. And you have Read how, when the
        Tribe
            was in need of Drink, God told the Head Man to Strike the Rock with
          his Rod, and when he did so a Stream burst forth for the Use of All.      </p>
      <p>Just
              so is it Now. God gives us the Land, and if we Strike the Land
        with the Rod of Toil, a Stream of Wealth will come Forth. This God means
      Each One of us to Use for his own Life. </p>
      <p>But if the Rock in that Old
          Time
              had
    been Held by some Big Man, he would have made them Pay him for the Drinks.</p></td>

      <p>The good Man who was at the Head of a Town in the West saw a great lot

      <p>At
          the same time he saw a Great Deal of Land near by that was not in Use.
          So he got Leave of Those who Held the Deeds of the Land to let some
        of the Poor Use it, and then he Gave them Spuds and set them to Work.        </p>
      <p>You
        ask, How did it Turn out? </p>
      <p>Why, each of the Men who got the Use of
          a Lot got so much of a Crop for his Toil that he had no Need to ask
        for Aid
              from the Town. Give Toil the Use of Land and that is all you need
          Do. </p>
      <p>But did not the Land Lords help? </p>
      <p>Oh, yes, Much! They Got Out of the Way.

          They were once Men who had come Up to a High State of Life, up to the
          Point where We are now in this good Age and Land. But they found that
          Things got in to such a Fix some how that there was not Bread for All,
      and Work could not be Found for those who were Out of Work. </p>
      <p>Then they
            saw what a Bad Thing Steam was, and all the Means that were used
        in Mills, and so forth, to save Toil; so they went to Work and broke
        up
          all the
            Belts and Wheels so that all Work must be done by Hand. And in this
          way, by Force of the Truth they now Saw, they were led Back, step by
          step,
            to the State in which Man was in what we call the Dark Age; in Short,
    they were once more Wild Men of the Woods.</p></td>
