      and streams on which boats can run, and all that one could wish for, so
      that it is a great place for trade. The other has few of these gifts. In
      such a case, say some, the poor land must put a tax on goods or the rich
      land at its door will kill its trade. Now, is this the case? It is not.
      There is, in fact, no land that has in its own bounds all things to meet
      all the needs that may rise; or that can make all forms of wealth at low
      cost. The best land on earth is sure to be weak in some points, and there
      are no two just the same. In points in which some are weak others are strong.
      That is to say, each land finds that some lines of trade will pay well;
      some will pay less, some not at all. Good sense would say, give chief care
      to those lines in which your work tells for most, and then trade the goods
      thus made for the things you need but could not make at such low cost.
      Thus, both sides to the trade will gain, for in each case they "make the
      most of their chance." Is it not mad, then, to put clogs on trade, and
      so have to do at a loss what could be got through trade at a gain? <strong>Is
      it not a queer thing, too, that while men in a poor land say they must
      have
      a tax wall to shield them since the land is poor, men in a rich land, (one
      that has all the gifts a land could ask for), call for a tax wall so that

      it should turn out that in the time it took him to make one coat he might
      have done work in some line in which he had more skill or more chance,

      them, is just as mad, is it not? Let us bring this tale of the ten men
      on the isle to the test of facts. Here let us say, is the U. S. The homes
      of that land need things of such and such a kind, and so there is a call
      for that class of goods, which are made in John Bull's land with much skill
      and at low cost. By the laws of Trade at once the goods flow to the U.S.
      to meet the call there, and, to pay for them, goods which John Bull can
      not make so well, flow back. It is a square deal with gain to both sides,
      let us say six bags of John's goods for six bags of Sam's. But Sam at length
      goes in for the High Tax plan and puts up a toll gate at his port. He says
      by means of a tax he will keep out these goods, and so have them made in
      his own land. They are in due time so made, but now those who need them,
      if they bring them in from John Bull's mart, must pay the tax, which, let
      us say, is the price of one bag. They get five bags where they used to
      get six, and if they buy in the home mart, they get no more than five.
      Is not this the same as to get six bags and throw one in the sea? John
      Bull is, no doubt, hurt by such a plan; he will not be able to send so
      much goods, and so will not be able to bring back so much in trade from
      Sam's land. The tax may be put up so high that he can send no more goods
      of that kind at all, but he will still get what he needs and what he can
      best get from Sam's mart. We say "what he can best get" there; by which
      we mean what it will pay him to get there more than it would to make; or
      such things as grain, of which he can not grow a great crop in his own
      land. John, as a wise man, says, "To be sure, this tax of Sam's hurts my
      trade with him, but I still have the world at large to trade with more
      or less, and I will try to make it more. But I must have food, and if needs
      be, I will get it, or the main part of it, from
Sam, as of yore."</td>

    <td>A free field in which a man can make the most of his time and strength
      of hand or head &#8212; that is, work in the line in which he can bring
      forth the most &#8212; and then have his choice as to how and where he
      will trade
      what he thus makes &#8212; that is the right plan. To fence him in with
      tax bars, and force him to work in lines that would not be his free choice,
      and that do not pay so well, and this in the name of "aid," is no wise
      plan. True, such a plan makes more "work," and if it were "work" that was
      to be sought, all would be well. But no sane man 'wants work, he wants
    the things that are to be got by work. This point should be borne in mind.</td>
