      <p>Can a Fish live on the Land? </p>

      <p>Is not the Pike a bad Fish
      to do so ill a deed? </p>
      <p>It is, but you must not say so. Do you not see that
        the Pike owns the Stream, and so has a right to get Rent for the use
        of the Stream from the Perch? But the Perch can not pay, and so has to
      get out. The Pike means no ill, but Biz is Biz. </p>
      <p>But should it be the
      Law that a Pike may own a Stream? </p>

      <p>Oh, no; don't you see he Owns the Slave and may do with
            him as he
      will? The Law says a Man may Own a Slave, and that ends it. </p>
      <p>But
      it is a bad law for the Slave, is it not? </p>
      <p>Yes. It is not nice to
          be a Slave. You
      must Work, and you get no Wage. </p>

      <p>How came Men to make such a bad Plan as we now have? </p>
      <p>I will tell you.
          At first the Land of the World was Free to All, and each Man had the
          Right to the Fruit of his Toil. When there was a War, the Side that
        came off Best brought home great Crowds of their Foes. These, if not
        put to
          Death, were kept as Slaves, as a kind boon. But the Men who held the
          Slaves had to Feed them, and they soon saw it was best to Own the Land,
          and so they took the Land and the Slave was made a Serf: Then, as time
          went on, the Wage plan came to be, and the Serf gave Way to the Wage
          Slave. As Bond Slave, Serf, or Wage Slave, the Fruits of the Man's
        toil went to him who was the Boss. You see, the Rights Man lost in the
        War
          are still lost. The Boss still Owns the Land, and we have the Wage
    Slave with us this day.</p>      <p> </p></td>

      <p>Who Owns the Man? </p>
      <p>God, who made him, Owns him, but he gives Man a Free
          Will. Man has a Right to Life, and to be Free, and to seek Joy in this
          world. So he has a Right to that which he needs that he may Live. He
          must have Air or he will die; he must have the Light of the Sun or
        he can not live, and he must have Food and Clothes, and a Roof for his
        head.
          So he must have Right to use Land or he can have none of these Things.
          Nor can he be Free if he must Pay for the use of the things God has
        made by which he must Live; and he can not find Joy in this life if he
        is
          not Free, or if he must keep his Nose to the Wheel of Toil from the
        day he comes in to the World to the day he dies. Man does not live just
        for
    Bread; he Needs a chance to Train his Mind as God meant he should. </p></td>
    <td>Woodcut: The drawing has a grave on the left and a cradle on the right,
      and in between, a poor fellow with his nose held to the grindstone. The
      grindstone is labeled &quot;Toil.&quot; He looks very similar to the fellow
    on the right, the Wage Slave, in the preceding woodcut.</td>

      <p>Can they all be made of the same Size? </p>
      <p>By no Means. </p>

      <p>No, my Child, it is not Bosh, if you have due care as to what
          you Mean
          by the Words. We mean by Free that Men are born with a Right to Life,
          and by E-qual that they are born with a Right to an E-qual Chance to
          use those Things that they need to keep Life in them. These Things
        are all in the word Land. The One-tax plan will make a way for Man to
        get
          the use of the Land, with no call to pay a Land Lord, and so it will
    make Men Free and E-qual in the right Sense. </p></td>

      <p>Yet one is Fat
      and Rich, and one is Lean and Poor! </p>
      <p>How comes this? </p>
      <p>It must be that
              the Fat one has a will to Work, and so by his Toil on the Land
        gets all the
                Good Things he needs, while the Lean one will not Work and so
        must needs Starve and go in Rags. </p>
      <p>So it would seem, my Child; but things
            are not
                as they seem. The Fat Man here does not Work at all, and the
      Thin Man would fain Work for his Food, but can not get Work to do. </p>
      <p>Is
          this
              not
      Queer? </p>
      <p>Yes, it is Queer. But it will be Plain when I tell you
      that the Fat Man owns the Land, and lives on the Land Rent. </p>
      <p>Can a
          Man own Land

      <p>No, it is just a Hat. Feel
      it, my Child, for it may be Felt. </p>
      <p>Does the Man own the Hat? </p>
      <p>Yes,

      <p>Well, you see, Man may make a Hat, or he
          may buy one from the Man who has made it, and pay him for it. So when
          he

                      for

        Hide it, or Burn it, or Lend it, or Rent it out. If he puts it out of

                does no

        it,
            and if he
                      puts it out of Use he does Harm to Men, and so he may not

    same way that he owns a Hat. </p></td>
