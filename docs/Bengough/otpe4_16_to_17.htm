    <td>A plan to be fair should shield all and hurt none. The High Tax plan
      as it is is a gain but to the few, and this gain grows less with each new
      trade that gets into the ring, since for each new line that gets aid, more
      and more have to bear loss, and this is felt through the whole field of
      trade. If all trades were dealt with in the same way (as, of course, they
      should be by rights) then things would be in the same state as though none
      got aid. The plan would be of no use if it were fair. And in fact the good
      goes out of it at a point far short of aid to all. Say there are 100 lines
      of trade, half of which are of a kind which you can aid by means of a tax;
      and let us say that the part of the tax which they can get, that is, less
      what it costs them, is one fourth. Now in the first place, half of these
      trades can get no aid at all, since no goods of the kind they deal in are
      brought in, but they have to help to pay the tax in aid of the rest in
      the form of a rise in price. The whole tax is 100, and if but one of the
      trades gets aid (less what it costs) it will get 25. If two get aid, each
      will get 12 1/2; if three get aid, each will get 8&frac14;, and so on.
      When 25 trades come in each will get no aid at all that will be of any
      use,
      though in the mean time all the rest will be at a loss. When 26 come in
    a loss comes in with it, and so on.</td>

  would claim that he does any real work for it. If the same man has a shop in
  which he makes boots and shoes, that, of course, is a fair form of work, and
  what he makes at it he earns in a true sense. In such a case, what we claim
  is that it is not fair to take his whole year's gain from both these lines,
  though they are put in one purse, and call them the fruit of his toil. In so
  far as he has hides and tools, wax and thread and so on, he is a capitalist;
  in so far as he works he is a laborer, and the gains he thus makes are interest
  and wages. But in so far as he owns the tollgate, he is a monopolist and his
  gain from that source we call Toll or Rent. He is, in fact, two men in one,

    <td><strong>It is not hard to see that as the whole race of man must live
        on the ground &#8212; since they can not live in the air nor in the sea &#8212;      the
      man who owns land holds the prime key to wealth. </strong>For no wealth
      at all can be
      got but from the ground and from that but in one way &#8212; by toil.
      This is true, as will at once be seen, of wealth in the form of crops,
      on a farm.
      And it is just as true of wealth in the form of sheep, cows, pigs and so
      forth fed and bred on a farm. This is plain to all. <strong>But to some
      it is not quite so clear that wealth is got out of the ground in the town
      and city.</strong>      To be sure, it is not got in just the same way;
      but it comes in just as real a way out of the ground there. For a town
      must stand on ground, must
      it not? Is not the ground in a town worth much more per foot than the land
      of a farm? And why so? This is why: <strong>A man can make more out of
      land in towns. The wealth to be made in trade is as a rule more than is
      to be made
      on farms, and the work is not so hard.</strong> The chief worth of farm
      land is in what it will grow. <strong>The chief worth of a town lot is
      its site; that is, the part of the town in which it lies, with the chance
      for trade
      there
      is in it.</strong> As a town grows large the chance grows with it, and
      the lots go up in price, and in each town they range on a scale from low
      to high.
      Lots at the heart of a town are best for trade and so are worth much, from
      there out to the bounds, less and less. Then, some parts of the town have
      choice sites for homes, and these are of high worth, while less choice
      sites are worth less. Of each town we may say &#8212; when we note the
      chance there is for trade, the style of the streets, the cars, the schools,
      and
      all things which go to make up a full life &#8212;  it is worth so and
      so per year to live there. And we find that this "so and so" is, as it
      were, writ in the land. That is to say, the land is worth just what it
      is worth to
      live in the town. In this sense, all that the town can gain in wealth through
      trade comes out of the land, for, of course, if the land was not there,
      there could be no town. Now, is it not plain that if John Smith owns the
      site of the town he can take, by way of toll or rent from all who live
      in it all that it is worth to live there? If he owns one lot can he not
      take in the same way, all that lot is worth as a site for trade? And is
      not this the same thing as for him to take, as the rent of a farm, (in
    the form, it may be of a share of the crop) all that the farm is worth? </td>

      Here we find some smart folk in John Bull's land who strive to get rid
      of what they now have by the name of "Free Trade," and urge that the old
      plan of a tax on goods be a tax put on grain. This is to "shield" the farms
      of the old land, and it will do so in so far as it lifts the price of grain.
      As soon as that is done there will be a rush to the farms, of course, for
      they will then have a chance to pay. There will be a call for farms. Lands
      that have of late years been idle will be sought. Then what? Why, of course,

      the rent (as the chances grow bright the rent goes up, you see &#8212;      that
      is the rule).
      John Bull at large will have to pay more for his bread, since the price
      of grain has had a rise, but the men who work the farms will in a short
      time be just where they were, since all the fresh gain they make will have
      to be paid out in fresh rent. <strong>The men who will gain by the move

      it is all the same. In the States they have a tax on boards. Do you think
      this helps the men whose trade it is to cut down trees and saw them up
      in mills? That is what it was meant to do, they said. But some shrewd chaps
      long since got hold of the land on which the trees grew, and it was, in
      fact, they who got the tax put on. The tax keeps out logs from o'er the
      lakes, and so, if the mills are not to close down, logs must be bought
      from the ring, and the tax adds to their price. This is a straight blow
      to the men who work at this trade, but it is a "snap" for those who own
    the wild land. </td>

  States might rule the marts of the whole world, where now they make but a poor
  show, and for the most part trade at a loss. When there is tax, tax, tax all
  round, so that all parts of each piece of goods are made dear, how could such
  goods hope to meet those made at a much less cost? What is the fact at this
  time? That most of what the States sends out is raw stuff from the farms, and
  most of what it brings in goods made in mills and works o'er the sea. There
  is a trade with Brazil. Goods are brought from there; are goods sent from mills
  and works in the States to pay for it? No. Wheat and so forth is sent to John
  Bull, and John squares off the deal with Brazil. He sends goods which Sam buys

    <td>This is the queer way in which the high tax plan has "built up the trade
      of the States with the world at large." It is well known that the "Yank" is
      as shrewd a man, with as good brains, as can be found on earth. He ought
      of right to lead the whole race in trade. Yet it is the fact that he does
      not; he is down near the tail end of the list. Strange, you say. No, just
      what one might look for when he loads tax weights on all things. To get
      the trade of the world the first thing to do is to make things cheap, and
      here this shrewd chap ties his own hands, or puts a clog on his own leg
      in the race. We hear much just now of how he "dumps" goods in lands o'er
      the sea. It is true he does a good deal in this line, but is it trade that
      is square, and that has real gain in it to him? Not at all. For the most
      part he sells these "dump" goods at cost, or less than cost, just to get
      rid of them. How can he do this? you ask. Well, you see, the high wall
      at home gives him the chance to hold his home trade and force the folks
      there to pay him twice the price the goods are worth, so that he can keep
      his mills on the go all the while, and when he finds more stuff on hand
      than the home man can take he "dumps" it o'er the sea in this way at "any
      old price." This, of course, is a good thing for those who get the goods;
      let us hope the dear folk in the States like the plan. It seems to be most
    kind on their part, does it not? "It is grand &#8212; but it is not trade." </td>

      things when he had thought them out, it would be a fine thing for him.
      But what takes place? Why the tax strings so tie him up that he cannot
      do it. John Bull takes up these new ideas, and, as he is not bound up with
      tax bands, makes the class of goods on the plan thought out by his smart
      friend, cuts down the price, and takes the trade. Once more we must say
    this looks kind on Sam's part.</td>

      States? Why, then, are no ships built there to speak of? Think that out.
      It tells the whole tale. You will find that all the things that go into
      a ship from keel to truck, from the wire in her stays to the brass in her
      log, and all that goes to fit and store her, has to bear a tax load. Thus
      once more has the kind Yank made a free gift to John Bull of the ship yard

      on the coast of the States. The rates of freight from New York round the
      Horn to the ports on the west coast are high. There is no doubt they could
      be made much less, and yet be fair, if all ships were free to go in for
      the trade, and this would be a gain to those who own the goods. But ships
      cost so much to build at home that few are built, and that the rates may
      be kept up, the "pool" which owns the lines of rails from east to west
      pay the firm which owns the chief line of ships a large sum each month
      to keep up its rates. Thus, once more, we see how the high tax scheme plays
      into the hands of those who own land or right of way, or some "cinch" of
