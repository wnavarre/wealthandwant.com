          from the Old World. The Land was Big and Wide and Fit to Hold all Men
      on Earth if they Came, and give them Food, Clothes and Homes. </p>
      <p>Now,
          though the Land is just as Big as it was then, this is not the Case.
          Though
            it is far from Full, yet it has too much of a Crowd, and one Class

      <p>Yes, you might Put it that
              Way. There is no Free Land to be had where a Man could Live. The

    now Owns it All. That is the Whole Tale in One Word.</p></td>

            and the Pipes Tap the Wealth that is made by the Toil of the Mass
      of
            Men. One Branch of the One-Tax plan is to Tax Land Rent and Nought
        Else and the next Branch is to have the State take Charge of these Pipes
        which
      should be held by the State for all. </p>
    <p>If that were done We should
        have no Men in this World quite so Fat as we now See. Each Man would
    have to get Fat on his own Work, and All would have more Joy in Life. </p></td>

      out of the wall, and are labeled &quot;No.2&quot; and &quot;No. 1&quot; respectively.</td>

        see that a Stop has been put to the Flow of Gold in to their Hats? </p>
    <p>How
      has this been Done? </p>
    <p>By the new Plan we call the One-Tax. The Land Rent
            which they have Kept up to this Time, now has to be Paid in to the
        Till of the State as a Tax. And as for Pipe Two, as shown in last Cut,
        that
            is now Held by the State, as it Taps Lines of Trade in which there
        is not a Free Field for All. It is Right that such Lines of Trade should
            be in the Hands of the State, and that is a part of the One-Tax plan,
      as I have told you. </p>
    <p>What will the Rich Men do Now? </p>
    <p>Well, if they
          want More Wealth, they will have to Work for it. But in days to Come,
        with the One-Tax plan in Vogue, We will have no more Men who get Rich
          in
            the
    Way they got their Gold.</p></td>

        the Price shall be. Thus are they like Kings in a Land which we call

      <p>Well, you see, the Coal
            Land they hold now bears but a Light Tax as Wild Land. By the One-Tax
            plan it will have to bear a Tax at its full Worth as Coal Land, and
          can not be Held out of Use as it now is. These Coal Kings must then
        Keep their Mines at Work All the Time, so as to make them Pay More than
          the
            Tax, or let them go, and so Set the Land Free that those who Wish

      <p>What does it Mean? </p>
      <p>It Means that some Man Holds the Land, not for
            Use, but to make Gain in Case some one Else wants to Use it. He will
            get this Gain in the form of Rent or Price, while the Man who Takes
      it Works &#8212; thus he Lives on the Sweat of that Man's Brow. </p>
      <p>Does the
      One-Tax plan Mean to take this Lot from the Man who now Holds it? </p>
      <p>Not
            at all.
                The Lot will have to Pay a tax &#8212; just the Sum the Man
                would now Rent it to this Chap for. If he pays that Tax he can
                still Hold it
          and keep
                it Bare. If he does not Need it for Use, he will Drop it, and
        let
            the Man who does Need it take it and pay the Tax. You see it is Land
            Rent
    and not Land the State will take from those who now Hold it. </p></td>
