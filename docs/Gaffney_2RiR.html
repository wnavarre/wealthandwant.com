<center><b>Two-rate in reverse</b></center>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mason Gaffney, July 2003</p>
<p>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a Maryland State Assemblyman on the rise.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> He carried a new law that let tax
assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
farming,
and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
market value.</p>
<p>The ambitious Agnew climbed this ladder to become Governor of
Maryland, and then Vice-President of the United States, where his
climb ended in a bad fall. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use-value
assessment laws, however,
spread like firebrands in a gale through most of the other states. Some
assessors, prompted by some courts, were already doing furtively
what the new laws sanctioned, but the laws now mandated all to join
them.</span></p>
<p>Spiro's sparks were late to reach Wisconsin. Its use-value law
waited until 1996. Meantime, by 1987, Wisconsin's farm property tax
rate exceeded that of a comparison state, Florida, by 4 to 1. This
included a tax on buildings, and yet Wisconsin agriculture was
notably healthier than Florida's, both economically and
sociologically. 47% of the real estate value on Wisconsin farms was
in buildings and improvements, compared with 15% in Florida. Wisconsin,
the high-tax state, led Florida 3 to 1 in farm output per
dollar of farmland value; 5 to 1 in farm buildings per dollar of
farmland value, and (surprisingly) 7 to 3 in machinery &amp;
livestock. Florida, the low-tax state, led Wisconsin in measures of
concentration and inequality: in land value per farm (5.5 to 1); in
acres per farm (3 to 2); in land value per acre (4 to 1); in real
estate/all assets (11 to 8). Florida's Gini Ratio, a standard
measure of concentration, was double that of Wisconsin, when used to
measure ownership of land values. This measure is very sensitive:
doubling it entails much more than doubling the share of land value
held by the top 5% of the farms. (For details on all 50 states, and
changes over time, see M. Gaffney, 1992, "<a href="Gaffney_RIaFPTR.html">Rising
Inequality and
Falling Property Tax Rates</a>," in Wunderlich, Gene (ed.), Ownership,
Tenure and Taxation of Agricultural Land.)</p>
<p>In 1996, Wisconsin succumbed to the Maryland cow madness, and by
2000 had phased in use-value assessment completely. Statewide,
assessed values of farmland dropped to 34% below market value. In
urban Milwaukee County, the drop was 66.5%, and comparably high in
Waukesha, Racine, and Kenosha Counties with their hinterlands of
sprawl. County treasuries adapted in four ways: </p>
<blockquote>1 by raising assessed values of farm improvements; <br>
2 by cutting services; <br>
3 by raising property tax rates (now falling more on improvements); and
  <br>
4 by adopting local sales taxes. (Data: The Wisconsin Taxpayer, 2/03.) </blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus, taxes are shifted off
speculative land values and onto farm
buildings (including farmers' houses), trade, and city real estate. </span>The
way is paved for the "Floridation" of the once vibrant Wisconsin
farm economy and sturdy social strucure. The Latifundia that did in
Italiam and Floridiam are now going to work on Wisconsiniam.</p>
<p>Note that this is the "George-ish" 2-rate system in reverse. Alas,
Georgish losses from such use-value assessment of "farmland,"
covering nearly every state, outweigh Georgish gains from 2-rate
victories in a few cities in one state. We will all thrill if the
demonstration effect of the 2-rate victories in small Pennsylvania
cities should help convert Philadelphia, a highly visible world city,
to our preferred form of 2-rate. The world would much note, and for
a while even remember a dramatic revitalization there, even though
the media would muffle and academicians trivialize it. It would more
than compensate for the downbeat effect of losing Pittsburgh. Meantime,
though, our work must proceed on many fronts, one of which
is combating use-value assessment of so-called "farmland."</p>
<p>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who gain. A large
chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
are like diamonds among coal. </p>
<p>Owners in Walworth County, near Chicago and containing Lake
Geneva, are also big gainers. One enterprising shoreline owner in
Fontana on the Lake divided his land into "dockominiums," each
consisting of only a small lockbox on dry land, giving access to the
lake. Each buyer paid $60,000, and assumed the considerable risk
that the state high court would invalidate the titles (which it did,
without compensation). Had these titles been valid, each $60,000
lockbox could have have been assessed based on its potential corn
crop.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">100 years ago, American Georgists
made a big point that city land
outvalues rural land many times over. One implication is that
taxing city land is taxing the rich, and we can ignore farmland. </span>Some
land-taxers counsel that farmers are easily misled to oppose us,
so leave them alone and convert the cities. But rich city folks also
own choice rural lands.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hearst </span>palace at
San Simeon sits amid
82,000 manorial acres, including miles of prime shoreline, "improved"
with just one home per 82,000 acres. This home, jammed with imported
treasures, had become a white elephant even before Citizen Kane
uttered his final "Rosebud."<span style="font-style: italic;"> The
heirs were glad to fob it off onto
the taxpayers of California, deducting its alleged value from their
taxable incomes, while they kept the 82,000 acres.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Craig McCaw</span>, who made his billions
by amassing spectrum licenses,
turned some of the pile into a spread of many thousands of acres
stretching north from Big Sur -- land he never got around to using.  </li>
  <li>The O'Neill families and Donald Bren of Orange County,  </li>
  <li>the Newhall
family of Ventura County,  </li>
  <li>the Chandler family that owns the Tejon and
Boswell empires that spread over several counties,  </li>
  <li>Ted Turner who
owns over a million acres around the U.S.;  </li>
  <li>the Koch brothers of
Kansas with all their oil wells,  </li>
  <li>the Kleberg tribe with their
million-acre King Ranch in Texas;  </li>
  <li>the Southern Pacific Railroad (now
Catellus Co.),  </li>
  <li>Standard Oil:  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">those are
a few of the struggling family
farmers whom use-value assessment of farmland saves from destitution.</span>
<p>The privilege of use-value assessment stretches even beyond
farmlands, vast as they are. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timberland
</span>in most states gets the
same preferred treatment, only better. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">About 1/3 of
the privately
owned land in the U.S. is in timber. </span>In California, owners
(mostly
huge corporations) may put the land into the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">"TPZ"</span> class. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
standing timber is then exempt, and taxed only at harvest, at 2.9%,
much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
of that land, though, has
alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,
the outliers and pioneers of urban sprawl. There are also mineral
values, hunting, fishing, rifle ranges, grazing, campsites, tourism,
rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
nation's land. <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Those uses are
all declared "compatible" with timber,
hence land values derived therefrom are tax-exempt.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mendocino County, just north of
Sonoma, is a major redwood source. It has no major cities; most of its
people live in the country. Its
timber harvest yields twice as much as all its farming and fishing,
but only 10% of its tax revenues. </span>Its own tax revenues are
supplemented by equal subventions from the State, paid by taxes on
incomes (mostly payrolls) and sales statewide. Meantime, urban
demand is probing up north into southern Mendocino County from the
Bay Area with its towering land prices. Mendocino has a long,
scenic coastline with premium amenity values. A significant fraction
of the TPZ land has a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">speculative
</span>value for resort, retirement and
vacation uses, well above its timber value. None of this is
reflected in tax assessments: TPZ protects against that, even though
owners may convert out of TPZ at will. Land may be classed as TPZ
regardless of past, present, or intended use.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timberland owners around the
country, abetted by Forestry Schools
with their wholesome outdoorsy image, have sold this bill of goods to
legislators.</span> In many states, less than half the private land is
fully taxable, because of such laws. These are not all southern and
western states, either, as one might surmise. In NH, for example,
only 45% of the private land (and none of the Federal land) is fully
taxable. The rest is sheltered by the state's "Current Use" tax law,
their version of California's TPZ law. Assemblyman Richard Noyes,
pushing for a statewide tax on land values, finds the
timberlandowners' lobby spearheads his opposition. </p>
<p>In Alabama, Gov. Bob Riley got around actually to reading The
Bible he'd been thumping and discovered it is anti-Christian to
exempt the corporate owners of vast timberland empires while loading
taxes on the poor. Many churches in that heavily churched region are
supporting him, led by law professor and lay Christian Susan Pace
Hamill, and guess who is fighting him? <span style="font-weight: bold;">No
surprise: it's the devout
big landowners, his one-time contributors and fans.</span></p>
<p>How many battles can a few Georgists fight? Many, because each
battle brings allies, as well as vampires to slay. The citizens of
Mendocino County would love to tax the absentee-owned timberlands
round about them: they are aware. To do so, though, they have to
organize all the other timber counties at once to overcome the rich,
sophisticated opposition in Sacramento. Step one is to clarify the
issues, which is what we seek to do here. Susan Hamill and Bob
Riley, however, may be demonstrating that step one is to mobilize the
Godly to practice what they preach, in which case a whole new world
opens up, so keep tuned to Alabama.</p>
