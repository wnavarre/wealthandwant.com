  <p>      The proverb "There is nothing sure but Death and Taxes," is at
        once a recognition of the tendency to change in all human affairs, and
        a
        triumphant assertion of Conservatism that there remain at least two
        immutable things. <br>
      <br>
      But the tooth of time which respects no mortal institution is boldly at
        work on even this proverb and threatens to remove Taxes from the meagre
        list of things permanent. It is the purpose of this booklet to give
        some
        account of this startling phenomenon. With this in view let us lay down
        and briefly defend the proposition that &#8212; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
      <i>Taxation as a means of meeting the proper expenses of government is
        oppressive, unjust, inexpedient and unnecessary. <br>
      <br>
      </i>This proposition will strike a good many readers as absurd, but all
        must at least recognize the timeliness of the topic and the importance
        of
        any contribution to the discussion of a subject which is agitating the
        whole civilized world, for the methods, subjects and amounts of
        taxation
        are among the pressing problems of every country. <br>
      <br>
      The most obvious question which arises in the mind of anyone who reads
        for the first time the proposition above laid down is this: <br>
      <br>
"If taxation is unnecessary, what is to take its place? Government
        and its functions are increasingly expensive. They require a lot of
        money. Where is it to come from?" The answer may be placed in the
        form of a second proposition: <br>
      <br>
      <i>Every community, whatever its political name and extent &#8212;  village,
        city, state or province or nation &#8212;  has its own normal, unfailing
        income, growing with the growth of the community and always adequate to
      meet necessary governmental expenditure. </i><br>
      <i><br>
      </i>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to
        the
        land on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties
        and advantages of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this
        land in its natural state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted
        and unoccupied, including its waters, its contents and its location,
        every individual in the community (which may consist of any political
        unit selected) has an equal right, while all the individuals together
        have a joint right to the value for use which society has conferred
        upon
        these natural advantages. <br>
      <br>
      This value for use is known as "Land Value," or by the not
        particularly descriptive but generally adopted name of "Economic
        Rent." <br>
      <br>
      Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground
        is
        the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of
        that ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements
        thereon. Every holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now
        pays
        most of it to the wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the
        territory occupied by any political unit is, as has been stated above,
        always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
        for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit.&nbsp; As
        also
        stated above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to
        individual landowners. <br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the result of every utilization or enhancement of
        the
        natural advantages of land (such as farm profits, the rent and selling
        value of buildings and other improvements), when accomplished by an
        individual, belongs wholly to that individual, and should never, and
        need
        never, be taken from him by taxation. <br>
      <br>
      One must be careful not to confuse <i>land-value </i>with the <i>price
        of land. </i>The price of land is the sum demanded for the
        transference
        from one individual to another of the privilege to collect and
        retain land-value and thus to divert public earnings to private
        pockets.

<hr width="40%" style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<br>
Under the normal system which this article advocates, the user of land
would pay substantially the same economic rent as now, for the reason
that economic rent is fixed by the payer and not by the payee; but it
would be paid to the credit of the community instead of for the benefit
of the individual landowner. And the economic rent is <i>all </i>the
land
user would have to pay; no taxes on industry or personal product and no
other forced contribution for governmental purposes. <br>
<br>
It follows that, under the normal system, the holder of unimproved land
would usually contribute more than at present toward the expenses of
government, while the holder of well improved property would
contribute,
in most instances, less than the total of his present taxes. <br>
<br>
To illustrate simply, let us suppose a state which has never parted
with
its natural income but is supported by its own economic rent.&nbsp; A
farmer wishes to take up a tract or <font size="-1"><strong>[editor's note:<em> of</em>]</strong></font> government
land
in
this
state
and
offers an economic rent of fifty cents per year per acre in its raw
condition. The government (i.e., the community) accepts this rent,
subject to re-adjustment every five years. The farmer then gets his
deed
without other cost than that of drawing and recording the instrument, or a nominal
price of, say, one dollar an acre.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
He works his new property vigorously, clears, fences, drains and plants
it, and puts up his buildings and stocks them. He has no taxes to pay,
and at the end of his first five-year period he is making
$10 per acre per year. Will his economic rent for the next five-year
period be raised because he has prospered or because he has invested
money in buildings and improvements? Not a penny. All the results of
his
own capital and labor belong to him and not to the community. If the
neighborhood has not grown much, and fifty cents an acre is still
all that is bid as economic rent for the same kind of raw ground as our
farmer originally took, then his rent for the second five years will be
the same as the first. <br>
<br>
<hr width="40%" style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<br>
But suppose that during the second five years something of a boom has
set
in, and a community is growing up. Land is in demand, and for the
lessening area in the hands of the government two dollars per acre is
freely offered as economic rent.&nbsp; Now our typical farmer must come
up to the market price and pay two dollars an acre for his third five
years, irrespective of whether he is making more or less out of his
place. <br>
<br>
In his third five years the boom continues, and the community grows so
fast that before the close of that period one corner of our friend's
farm
finds itself near the middle of a flourishing town. Five acres of it
are
needed for a public park, and five acres adjoining are wanted to cut up
into building lots. As building lots, this part of the land will
command
a voluntary offer of a hundred dollars per year per acre of economic
rent; and this fact establishes the land-value of the adjoining five
acres needed for park purposes. <br>
<br>
In this situation what shall our farmer do? <br>
<br>
He has two courses open to him. If he doesn't want to relinquish his
land, and can afford to withhold it from further improvement, he can
pay
the hundred dollars per acre per year of economic rent which these ten
acres will now command, and keep his farm intact. If this appears to
him
too costly<i> </i>a luxury, he can signify his willingness to sell to
the
town the five acres wanted for the park, and the other five to
individual
builders.<br>
<br>
Now, what price should he get for it?&nbsp; He did not pay the
government
much for his title deed, but he has worked on this land for fifteen
years, and deserves some compensation when he transfers it. By his
labor
and also, in part, by reason of his clearing, draining and fencing, he
has been able to make twelve dollars an acre from his ground, while his
economic rent had not until now gone above five dollars an acre.
Furthermore, he has built on these parcels a barn and two storehouses.
<br>
<br>
The method of computing the proper selling price under such
circumstances
would have to be the result of experience, but that price would
certainly
include the present value of the improvements and probably some lump
sum
besides, as compensation for loss of farming opportunity. But just as
certainly it would <i>not </i>include, (as it would do under our
present
conditions), the increased location value which the town itself has
created by its own growth and public works, and which in all justice
belongs to the town or community and not to the individual. <br>
<br>
<hr width="40%" style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<br>
This principle of economic rent applies to all the users of land,
including mining, use of waterpower<i>, </i>and rights of way over or
under its surface.&nbsp; Had this principle always been recognized, and
the economic rent always been retained by the community, taxation would
never have been heard of.&nbsp; When the economic rent is reclaimed by
the community, the need of taxation will disappear. <br>
<br>
Let us roughly restate the proposition: All members of the community
having a joint right to the income which the social advantages of
the land will command, they are all partners in this income.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Therefore, when one of their number wishes to take for his private use
a
parcel of this land, he should buy out his partners, i.e., the rest of
the community, by paying regularly into the common treasury the
economic
rent of that parcel, instead of paying, as at present, the purchase
price, i.e., the right to collect the economic rent, in a lump, to some
other individual who has no more original right to it than himself. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: "How
about the law?" he is asking. "Hasn't a man the right to buy a
piece of land as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and
hold on to it till he gets ready to sell?" The answer is that at
present
he certainly has this statutory right, which has been so long and so
universally recognized that most people suppose it to be not only a
legal, but a real or <i>equitable right. </i>A shrewd man, foreseeing
the direction of growth of population in a city, for example, can buy a
well-located block at a moderate figure from some less far-seeing
owner,
can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against all comers and give
it
no further attention except to pay the very small tax usually imposed
upon vacant land. <br>
<br>
Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes,
banks, stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets,
giving police and fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this
block so urgently that the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three
or
ten or fifty times what it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this
enormous advance is the very community which has through its presence
and
the expenditure of its taxes created practically the whole value of the
land in question! <br>
<br>
It was said above that an individual has a statutory <i>right </i>to
pursue this very common course. That was an error. The statement should
have been that he has a statutory <i>wrong; </i>for no
disinterested person can follow the course of land speculation as
almost
universally practiced, without feeling its rank injustice.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<hr width="40%" style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<br>
How did so evident a wrong become so firmly established? For a
tentative
answer to this question we have got to go back to the twilight of
history, and this is the way the story is told. Time was when the
ruler,
either by might or by alleged Divine right, claimed to own not only the
land under his jurisdiction, but the people and property thereon.
<br>
<br>
From this ruler the strong and able men of those days obtained feudal
rights over certain sections of the royal domain. Their next step was
to
bargain with the monarch for the "fee simple" or absolute
ownership of their several lands, in return for the grants of which
they
agreed to pay the expenses of his court and family. Having made this
fine
trade, and secured their individual land titles, it was not&nbsp; long
before the nobles began to cast about for some means of evading their
part of the bargain. <br>
<br>
Being the high financiers of their days and generations, they managed
to
contrive taxes which could be plausibly and gradually imposed upon the
landless, until within a few generations they had succeeded in shifting
most of<i> </i>the cost of government on to the plebeians without
giving
up a foot of land or any considerable part of the income therefrom.
The "common people" were deftly loaded with the heavy end of
the beam, which they have been carrying ever since; while the
arbitrarily
created landlords and their successors, down to the present day, have
kept their tight hold on the community's natural income. <br>
<br>
The landlords, being also the lawmakers, have seen to it that their
tenure of this easy money should not be disturbed, but on the contrary
have so buttressed it with centuries of legislation, precedents,
and judicial decisions, that any proposition to hark back to the terms
of
the original bargain, whereby the owners of the land agreed to pay the
expenses of the government, is now denounced as anarchy and
sacrilege. <br>
<br>
<hr width="40%" style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<br>
Lapse of time, however, never can transform wrong into right, nor can a
buyer acquire any better title than the seller possessed. The economic
rent belongs to the community, which can and will begin to reclaim it
as
soon as the voters thoroughly awake to the facts and the right and
wrong
of the matter, which are not hard to grasp when the subject is
presented
in its simplest form.<br>
<br>
An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm
land.&nbsp; Let us take an example in a large city.&nbsp; Let us
take a corner lot centrally located in New York City, the title to
which
lot is held by, say, Mr. John William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part
of
an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom. It did not cost the present
owner
anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.&nbsp; There is a
little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure ten
times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been
handsomely subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a
period of the city's growth in which the increase in population and the
expenditure of public money in that neighborhood have raised the value
of
this corner location to, say, two hundred times its early value.
<br>
<br>
About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and
can't be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the
pressure of population is sure to increase and that the expenditure of
public money to the benefit of this land must continue, he will not
sell
it. So he gives a twenty-one year lease to the corner for, say, $20,000
a
year net, with a privilege to the lessee of renewals at advancing
figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted
to
Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for?
Not
for the old building &#8212;  the first thing the lessee does is to pull it
down. Not for the land itself &#8212;  it is all rock, which has got to be
blasted out as part of its improvement. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community,
and
the community only, has built up and paid for.&nbsp; In other words,
the
present $20,000<i> </i>rental, and the larger one which that location
will command in later years, is strictly a community product, and as
such
belongs to the community and not to Mr. Rhinelastor. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we
remember that "When one man <i>gets </i>something for nothing
somebody else has got to <i>give </i>something for nothing." Here
are $20,000<i> </i>that some men and women have got to work to earn
every
year to hand over to a man who does not render, and does not feel any
obligation to render, one dollar's worth of public or private service
in
return.&nbsp; Such is the wild travesty of justice which we call law.
It is not
comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
results.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community
product
&#8212;  i.e., the site or location rent of <i> </i>its ground &#8212;  were paid
every year to its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what
would become of taxation, with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion,
Perjury, Inequality, and an all-pervading public sense
of injustice?&nbsp; <br>
<br>
An authority on municipal taxation estimates the present economic rent
of
the land embraced in the City of New York at from $350,000,000 to
$400,000,000<i>. </i>Assuming the lesser of these figures and adding
the
receipts from licenses, fees and fines, New York City should receive,
of
<i>her own income, </i>enough to pay all her own legitimate bills, to
make her proper contributions to county<strong><font size="-1"> [editor's note: that probably should
read
&quot;country&quot;]</font></strong><em> </em>and
state
and
build
a
new
subway
or its equivalent every year. <br>
<br>
<i>And this with nobody paying a dollar of taxes, or, if we except the
fines, a dollar that he was not ready and glad to pay for his own
advantage. <br>
<br>
</i>We repeat, this is not taxation; but for the sake of those who
cannot
grasp the idea of public revenue without taxation, let us state the
matter
in their own language. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
Think of a tax which both assesses itself and collects itself, which
burdens no one, which is paid voluntarily, and only by those who do so
for their own profit or other advantage.&nbsp; Compare this with our
present system of taxes, which everyone despises, which can be
collected
in full only from the very scrupulous and from the helpless, from trust
funds of widows and orphans, or from estates which lie naked before the
tax gatherer on the records of court; a system which drives men of
property from state to state and town to town in flight from<i>
</i>the assessor, and well-nigh forces many worthy citizens to
practices
of evasion which must make it hard for them to look into their own
mirrors during the season for "Correction of<i>
</i>Assessments;" there can be but one verdict upon such
comparison.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But again the voice of the objector is heard, possibly to this effect:
"This plan may be all right for the community, but how about poor
Mr. Rhinelastor?" <br>
<br>
In reality the landowner would not suffer so much from the
restoration of the public revenue as might at first appear. For one
thing, whereas he is now taxed, at least in theory, not only on land,
but
on buildings, cash, bonds, and all other personal property, and perhaps
on his income as well, he would then have no taxes at all to pay.&nbsp;
Furthermore the economic rent is not the full measure of the
possible earning capacity of the land, but will always be less than the
offerer expects to make out of its use. <br>
<br>
Again, while it must be firmly insisted that the economic rent is the
rightful property of the community and not of the landowner, the
community would probably never take it all. Communal ownership of land
is
not desirable, even if it were practicable. Individual ownership and
management are best, and it is not at all improper for the community to
allow the owner something for caring for the land to which he holds
title, and for collecting and transmitting to the treasury the economic
rent.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But &#8212;  and right here is one of the prime advantages of the abolition
of
taxation &#8212;  Mr. Rhinelastor, in order to get satisfactory return from
his
land, must improve it.&nbsp; Unless he is satisfied with a small income
from it, to wit, the proportion of the economic rent which the
community
chooses to leave in his hands, he must put upon his land the best
building the location will warrant.&nbsp; The rents of this building
will
be his in their entirety, not one dollar of them being taken from him
by
taxation.&nbsp; If he is not prepared or not willing to do this he
would
probably find it more profitable, before he leaves the country, to sell
the land to some one of the many persons who are eager to build upon
it.&nbsp; It will always be salable, although&nbsp; not by any means at
present figures. <br>
<br>
Now imagine for a moment the effect upon the appearance of a city and
upon the comfort<i> </i>of its population which would result from the
change of fiscal policy which this article proposes.&nbsp; At present,
a
tempting premium is placed upon keeping land unimproved or inadequately
improved, while a heavy penalty is imposed upon improvement.&nbsp; Most
land appreciates constantly.&nbsp; All buildings depreciate from the
moment of completion.&nbsp; Yet the building is taxed equally with the
land.<br>
<br>
What incentive does such a system offer the speculative landowner to
put
up a commodious, well-lighted modern structure in place of the old ruin
which now pays him so well? The old one cannot depreciate much more,
and
while paying a trifling tax because of its physical worthlessness, he
is
thereby enabled to collect and pocket the economic rent of the ground,
which the community is continually rendering more valuable. The new
building would absorb a large amount of capital, would begin to run
down
even before it could be occupied, and would be taxed to the
limit.&nbsp;
Why then is not the landlord justified in letting well enough alone,
enjoying the growing economic rent, and waiting till he can get a fancy
price for the right to collect it?<br>
<br>
But reverse the conditions. Reclaim for the community its natural
income,
making it expensive either to keep needed land vacant or to withhold it
from the ready and willing to improve it to the full extent of its
possibilities.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Does it require severe intellectual effort to foresee the results?
Better and better houses, apartments, tenements, offices and stores,
more employment for labor in all enterprises now held back by the
shadow
of the tax-gatherer, an end of all tax-lying, tax-evasion and
tax-injustice, and withal, a public revenue adequate to all real public
needs. <br>
<br>
What a contrast to the existing plan of pouring public money into the
laps of individual landowners to their own moral disadvantage and that
of
their children, as well as the economic disadvantage of their
neighbors,
while constantly cudgeling the civic brains, straining the public
credit,
impoverishing widows and orphans, and increasing the exactions from
every
citizen and corporation that can be caught, in the effort to raise more
and more money to bestow upon the same beneficiaries.&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;<br>
  If the reader has followed thus far, he is perhaps ready to inquire
  why,
  if the abolition of taxation is so desirable and so feasible, it should
  not be put into effect without more delay.&nbsp; In partial answer, it
  may be said that the body social has slid so far down from the right
  path
  in this matter that climbing back to it is no short or easy
  process.&nbsp; The way up
  bristles with problems, one of which is of course the opposition of a
  class of land speculators. Another relates itself to the regulation of
  the height and area of buildings in cities. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  Even under our present system of taxed buildings, the desire to create
  the maximum of rentable space upon costly land has resulted in such
  lofty
  and closely packed structures as to endanger safety and health; and
  restrictive legislation has already been found necessary. When the
  landowner can no longer appropriate the larger part
  of economic rent and must rely for his profit mainly upon the rent of
  his
  untaxed buildings, such restrictions may have to be elaborated and
  watchfully enforced for the protection of the people. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  Naturally such restrictions will lower the economic rent, but the
  reduction need never be sufficient to impair the necessary public
  income
  while ample compensation will be seen in the enhanced well-being of the
  community due to increased light, air and space. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  But, whatever difficulties are to be met, it may be set down as an
  encouraging fact that the problem involved in doing things right is
  always less than those resulting from doing the same things wrong; and,
  Heaven knows, our way back to fiscal sanity cannot be through any worse
  jungle than that in which current taxation keeps us and will keep us so
  long as it is permitted to continue. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  In all this no attempt is made to present the subject systematically or
  completely; still less to anticipate and reply to the many objections
  which can be urged against the proposition presented. Suffice it to say
  that there is a cogent answer to every such objection, and that the
  civilized world has already progressed farther in this direction than
  most of its people imagine.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  Henry George gave the first impulse, and his followers of the Single
  Tax
  have continued the good work. There is one objection, however, to the
  statement of their case by the Single Taxers: the nature of this
  objection is indicated by their name. Most persons will infer that,
  under
  their proposal, whatever portion of the economic rent is taken by the
  community is taken as a tax on the land. <br>
  <br>
  This seems to the present writer to show a misconception of the nature
  of
  the transaction, and one which tends to retard the cause which is being
  advocated.&nbsp; The amount of economic rent which is taken by the
  community for public purposes is not a tax paid by the land-holder, but
  whatever amount of such rent is left in his hands is a gift to him by
  the
  community, or else is the compensation which the community allows
  him for acting as its agent and collector in the matter of economic
  rent.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  This is an important distinction which is necessary to make the facts
  and
  the relations clear.&nbsp; It is also highly expedient. Taxation and
  the
  idea behind it are abhorrent to men.&nbsp; As a result of long
  experience
  the very word Taxation connotes to them injustice, oppression, and
  antagonism between the individual and the community. To the mass
"The Single Tax" means simply rolling into one the manifold
  injustices and oppressions of the present complex system. Only slow
  headway can be made by a proposition which at first sight seems to
  promise merely to shift the burden from one shoulder to the other. <br>
  <br>
  But make it plain to the wayfaring man that taxation can be abolished
  and
  will be abolished whenever the voters of any political unit so decree,
  and a force of hope and purpose will be liberated which must bring
  nearer
  the time when the things that are the community's will be rendered to
  it,
  and the things which are the individual's will be left in his
  unmolested
  possession.&nbsp;&nbsp; The watchword of our friends the Georgeites is
"A Single Tax."&nbsp; The true slogan is "Not a Single
  Tax!"; and the triumph of the cause behind that slogan would cut
  more of the taproots of poverty, vice and social unrest than any other
  progressive step which is a legislative possibility. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p align="center">    BOTTOM FACTS </p>
<p align="left">1. Land, being neither portable nor consumable, cannot properly be said
    to have a capital value. <br>
    2. The only value of land is its variable annual value for use. <br>
    3. This value does not reside in the land. It comes with the people,
    goes
    with the people, belongs to the people. The land of a permanently
    abandoned city or farm would have no value. <br>
    4. The community alone creates and owns this value which is periodic,
    continuous and can in no case be reduced to a lump sum. <br>
    5. The collection of this value by the community is not in the nature
    of
    taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    6. The habit of buying and selling the privilege of approaching this
    value by individuals is vicious and anti-social because &#8212;  <br>
    . lst &#8212;  It robs the community of its one just revenue.&nbsp; <br>
    .2nd &#8212;  It destroys equality of individual opportunity.&nbsp; <br>
    7. This vicious habit is the sole cause of taxes. <br>
    8. Abandon this habit and we need have Not a Single Tax. </p>

Firms, 1876-1935</span>, by Scott Meacham, 2004<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unidentified Projects for
Charles T. Root</span><br>
1891, 1896, and 1898, L.&amp;R.<br>
Charles Towner Root (1849/50-1938) was a publisher of trade periodicals
(The Dry Goods Economist, The Dry Goods Reporter) as president of the
Textile Publishing Company until he combined it with other publishers
to create the United Publishers Corporation, of which he was president
until retiring in 1924. His father was George Frederick Root, writer of
Civil War songs. Late in life, Root divided his time between California
and Maine. He appears to have been a friend of the Rich family: Root
lived in Short Hills during the 1890s and was an officer in the Short
Hills Congregational Church, where Rich&#8217;s father was the clerk; Root
and his wife Elizabeth Sayles Root (d. 1922) and their two daughters
attended the 1910 wedding of Rich&#8217;s daughter Margaret in Bellport; and
at the time of his death in 1938, Root would be living in the
Rich-designed Studio Apartment at Central Park West and 67th
(1916-1919) where Rich also lived during the 1920s.<br>
      <br>
      The nature of these three projects is not clear. Root&#8217;s name appear
among firm records in 1891 (&#8220;Root&#8221;), 1896 (&#8220;Root 2d-&#8221;), and 1898 (&#8220;Root
2d.&#8221;). In 1905, Root built a pair of houses on West 92nd Street that
Rich designed. A further commission appeared in 1911 (&#8220;Root 3d). ... <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">House at 309-311 West 92nd
Street for Charles T. Root</span><br>
1905, C.A.R.<br>
The application for building listed firm client Charles Towner Root as
the owner, and Rich listed &#8220;Root 2d&#8221; in 1905. The house apparently
appeared in Building magazine. The brick Georgian rowhouse stood five
levels high above an American basement, occupying a fifty-foot frontage
on the north side of West 92nd Street between West End Avenue and
Riverside Drive. An ionic portico of limestone marked the entrance to
the building. By 1907, directories listed Root as living at 309 West
92nd Street, with his company headquartered at 233 West 39th Street.<br>
