<p style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>I pose three questions. </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> I) <a
 href="#SOCIALISM">What is Socialism?</a> <br>

pseudo-Socialism?</a> <br>

<p><a name="SOCIALISM" id="SOCIALISM"></a><b>I. WHAT IS
SOCIALISM?</b></p>
<p>"Socialism," in common usage, is a Protean word, slippery and
shifting. Many use it without defining it, whether from innocence,
negligence, or cunning. These many include not just the vulgar, but
most economists: semantic care is weak in the traditions of the
profession. "Rigorous" model-builders today are among the offenders:
the premium is on gilding the superstructure, neglecting the
foundation. Indeed, foundations are not even needed for models that
float in outer space, vouching for and communing mainly with each
other. </p>
<p>Those who do define Socialism, explicitly or implicitly, use the
word for different things. A major difference, treated here, is
between <b><i>Managerial Socialism</i></b> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">(who decides)</span>
and
<b><i>Distributive Socialism</i><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> (who gets)</span></b>. These may
overlap,
but are independent of each other and often conflict. For example,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Riverside, CA, owns its own electric
utility </span>(on whose Board I sit,
losing battles). This is Managerial Socialism, municipal style. Its
traditional rate structure includes large elements of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cross-subsidy,
mainly taking from the lower middles for the rich, tempered by crumbs
thrown to the very poor. </span>The same is true of our water system,
and of
most municipally owned and managed utilities around the nation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Water
and sewer service are common examples of Managerial Socialism (from
which the mnemonic "sewer socialism"). They have little in common
with Distributive Socialism.</span> </p>
<p>At higher levels of government, also, Managerial Socialism may
play reverse Robin Hood. In British Columbia the "Socred"
(right-wing) party in the 1960s socialized the ferry service, the
provincial railroad, and the electric utility (now B.C. Hydro), using
them in schemes to enrich land speculators. To boost along B.C. Hydro
they raided the teachers' pension fund, borrowing from it at rates
near zero. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Democratic Party
(NDP)</span> (left-wing), taking power
in 1972, ended the raid on teachers, but not the cross-subsidy. In
California, the State <span style="font-weight: bold;">Department of
Water Resources (DWR)</span> designed,
built, and operates the <span style="font-weight: bold;">California
Water Plan (CWP)</span> for the primary
gain of a handful of giant landowners. They, too, raided education,
taking certain State oil revenues (known as the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">COPHE fund</span>)
previously earmarked for The University of California. Such examples
could, of course, be extended at length. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another form of Managerial
Socialism is direct administration of
public lands.</span> Our National Forests are an example. The track
record
is not good. The Forest Service manages a national asset worth over
$100 billions, from which it generates no positive cash flow. Latent
surpluses die a-borning. At one time this was from an excess of
ideological commitment to slow cutting cycles and "community
stability," as exemplified by Congressman James Weaver's dedication
to Roseburg, OR. More recently it is from internalizing profits and
plowing them into roading submarginal forests for premature cutting.
Either way it soaks in revenues from other sources, yielding nothing
back. Even if one likes the model, it could not be universalized.
</p>
<p>More commonly, public landlords lease lands to private firms,
limiting their managerial input to dirigisme expressed in regulations
and guidelines. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) thus administers
its vast empire as mainly a passive landlord. Its main task is just
collecting rents. To the extent The Bureau does a good job, or
Congress lets it do a good job, this evinces more of Distributive
than Managerial Socialism. To the extent it does a bad job it is
"<b><i>Pseudo-Socialism</i></b>," to be discussed presently. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Distributive Socialism, in contrast
to Managerial, means tapping
surpluses in the private sector and using them for the public good.</span>
The revenues may</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide public services that are available to all,
like schooling and social security; or  </li>
  <li>be used to abate regressive
taxes; or  </li>
  <li>be used to finance social dividends paid in cash, as in
Alaska.  </li>
  <li>Revenues may also be used to finance public works, even
though these benefit only a few specific landowners.  </li>
</ul>
This becomes
Distributive Socialism when the enhanced land rents are tapped to
recoup more than the allocated expenditure. (If only expenditures are
recouped, it is more like a contract between the state and the
landowners.)
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interjurisdictional transfers are
not properly "Socialism," but a
reshuffling of rents among landowners.</span> These transfers are
called
"horizontal balancing" in the lingo of fiscal federalism. They are a
long step removed from the social dividend paid to individuals as
such. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are properly
decried for "taxing poor people in rich
places to help rich people in poor places."</span> These "poor places"
include developmental regions and local districts, poor today but
prospectively rich, where landholdings are large and speculative.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Horizontal balancing devices
thus fall in a class of artful dodges,
seductions, and diversions leading from Distributive Socialism to
Pseudo-Socialism.</span> </p>
<p>Distributive Socialism also means administering public lands
pro-actively, affirmatively, to maximize revenue, in the manner of
private landlords. Not to do so is to let private lessees keep and
privatize the surpluses generated by resources in the public domain.
The NDP in B.C. earned its Socialist stripes by raising rents on
Crown lands owned by the Province ("The Crown Provincial," in
Canadian terms). The Minister of Lands did this directly by
renegotiating timber and other leases, on a site-specific basis.
</p>
<p>The NDP Administration tried to socialize the surpluses in gas
production by joining Managerial and Distributive Socialism in the
B.C. Gas export monopoly, a Crown Corporation. It was to levy a tax
in the form of a monopoly profit on gas transmission and export. Here
they stumbled by failing to recognize the differential, site-specific
nature of rent. They made it too easy, thinking it was just a matter
of buying low and selling high, across the board. They set a uniform
field price. It was, naturally, too low not to stifle high-cost
producers, and yet too high to tap most of the rent taken by low-cost
producers. They failed to rifle in on the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">source </span>of the
surplus. </p>
<p>Thus, to define Distributive Socialism we need to define
"<b><i>surpluses</i></b>." These are primarily rents from lands and
resources given by nature. In an open tax jurisdiction, labor and
capital are mobile and their supply is elastic; only land is fixed.
Land rent is the basic taxable surplus. Where there is no land rent,
an attempt to levy any tax can only abort production and land use,
rather than collect the tax. Where is there no land rent?</p>
<ul>
  <li>First,
there is no rent generated on "marginal" land that is just barely
worth using at all.  </li>
  <li>Second, and more generally, there is no rent
generated by marginal increments of labor and capital applied on any
land, from the best to the worst.  </li>
  <li>Otherwise, all production on land
generates some rent, which is a taxable surplus. </li>
</ul>
<p>The statement above expresses "The Physiocratic Doctrine" of tax
incidence, harking back to Francois Quesnay, and even earlier writers
like John Locke and Jacob Vanderlint. The Doctrine has staying power:
it is used, for example, by Bogart, Bradford, and Williams writing in
the National Tax Journal, December, 1992, on tax incidence in New
Jersey. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital, unlike land, migrates
among taxing jurisdictions.</span> The
return to reproducible, depreciable capital is not, therefore,
generally a surplus. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital differs
from land.</span> Capital has to be
attracted, and, if domestically generated, dissuaded from emigrating.
It is true that in the short run existing capital, if affixed to
land, cannot be exported. Its returns thereby become a temporary
taxable surplus -- hence the name "quasi-rent." Capital can still be
dissaved, however, through neglect of maintenance, and will not be
replaced. The demonstration effect of disappointing old investors'
earlier expectations will have a high cost in repelling future
investing by them and others. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Old
buildings, unmaintained, will shed
blight on their surroundings. Non-replacement, in a dynamic world,
guarantees early obsolescence. </span>Capital finds many subtle ways
of
emigrating, or being disinvested and consumed. Its yields are not
really a taxable surplus when we factor in the consequences of trying
to tax them: withering away of the community. </p>
<p>The Physiocratic rule, which may seem novel and subtle in tax
discourse, stands out nakedly whenever landowners, public or private,
negotiate leases. If a lessee is required to pay a share of his gross
sales (a <span style="font-weight: bold;">royalty</span>), he
compensates by offering that much less on the
"bid variable," (often a "bonus" paid up front). Lessors and lessees
understand this well: it is central to all their negotiations.
Whatever the twists and turns, the rule of compensation applies: take
more here, get less there. The lessee is to supply labor and capital
at full cost; acquiring use of land will yield him a surplus above
costs. That surplus is all he can and will pay for. The maximum of
economic surplus is the rent of land in its highest and best legal
use. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Distributive Socialism, then, means
tapping land and resource
rents for the public.</span> On the public domain, acknowledged to be
public
property, the institutional basis of Distributive Socialism is fully
in place. We need only apply a good leasing system, keeping rent
payments up to current values. On fee simple lands, Distributive
Socialism means and requires modifying tax systems to rifle in on
rents. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rifling in is essential. Recall,
the Physiocratic rule of
compensation says all taxes are shifted to rents anyway; some take
that to mean any tax will do. </span>However, "broad-based" taxes like
VAT
or a general sales tax sterilize lands that would be just marginal
before tax. They also abort all marginal and near-marginal activity
on all lands, for marginal inputs (where marginal cost equals price)
generate no rent. That in turn forces rates to be kept low, to avoid
destroying half the economy. Such taxes socialize all the rent from
lands that are now made marginal after-tax, but leave most rent
untapped on the most rentable lands and resources. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes that rifle
in on rent, on the other hand, inherently exempt marginal activity.
They may be set at very high rates, tapping more of the taxable
surplus, or rent. </span></p>
<p>Analogously, recall the case of the B.C. Gas Corporation cited
earlier. This is a public agency set up to extract rents from gas
resources by monopolizing export, buying low and selling high. Its
fatal initial error was to set a uniform field price. This price must
remain fairly high to avoid stifling the high-cost (marginal)
producers. As a result the price is high above that needed for the
low-cost producers, leaving them enjoying the rent of the resource.
</p>
<p>Let's look at a simple numerical example, to make the point. Say
the uniform field price is set at $1/mcf, while costs of production
range from 20 cents to $2 per mcf. All producers with costs over $1
are wiped out; all those with costs under $1 are left taking a
surplus per unit of $1 less their respective costs. The example is
useful to understand how taxes work, too. The B.C. monopoly cut is
just like a tax levied on each unit of production. </p>
<p>Whether on public domain or fee simple lands, Distributive
Socialism has three compelling attractions. </p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">One is, it requires no
Managerial Socialism; it may work through the free market.</span> It
does not preclude elements of Managerial Socialism, where these are
otherwise desirable; it simply does not require them. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second attraction is that it
lets taxes be progressive without impairing incentives.</span> Taxes
that rifle in on rents are progressive and distributively socialistic
because the ownership and control of rent-bearing lands is highly
concentrated in a few hands. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The third attraction is that
taxes on rent may be heavy without impairing incentives, precisely
because rent is a surplus. </span>The land-tax component of the
existing property tax is a good model. With this tax, there is no
"taxable event" required. Taxes are simply due periodically, based on
an external assessment of the land's market value, which in turn
derives from rent of its highest and best prospective use. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most political leaders live and
orate in a world of dismal choices
and trade-offs. To them, there is no cutting the deficits, either
state or federal. We must cut taxes or lose jobs. We must make taxes
regressive or destroy useful incentives. On the other hand, once we
define, identify, and rifle in on rent as taxable surplus, those hard
choices vanish. We can have higher taxes and more jobs, both at once.
We can tax progressively while simultaneously enhancing incentives to
produce and save.</span> </p>
<p>Likewise, on lands still in the public domain, we can rifle in on
rent by framing and administering a good leasing policy. Leasing does
have some transaction costs, but the private market does it anyway.
There is a reasonable, if less than perfect, track record.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ground
leases are common in downtown real estate, nationwide, even under
imposing structures like the Empire State Building, and Rockefeller
Center. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Irvine Company, holding 20% of Orange County, California,
has long declined to sell land, but only lets it for intermediate
terms.  </li>
  <li>Much of Hawaii is developed on the same terms.  </li>
  <li>Most oil and
gas is developed by lessees on private land, yielding large rents to
the lessors. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why cannot the
U.S. Government as lessor do what private lessors
do, extracting the surplus for the owner? </span>Here we meet the
obstacle
of Pseudo-Socialism, to which we turn. </p>
<p><b>II. WHAT IS
PSEUDO<a name="PSEUDO"></a>-SOCIALISM?</b></p>
<p><b><i>Pseudo-Socialism is what happens when resources in the
public domain are leased below a market rental, giving away part of
the public interest. </i></b>That has the effect of installing the
lessee as though he were the owner. The BLM, leasing grazing
privileges on Federal lands in the west, has fallen into this pattern
conspicuously and notoriously, subject to pressure from western
Senators who have the power of many votes in the U.S. Senate relative
to their state populations. The dollar values are small, but the
object lesson is visible, depressing, and cautionary. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Some other bad examples are <span style="font-weight: bold;">school
section lands</span> in the middle
states. These originated as Federal land grants intended to support
local schools. Some of them are corruptly let to insiders in
"sweetheart deals" for token rents.  </li>
  <li>Another bad example is the County
of Los Angeles, which owns lands in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Marina del Rey district</span>. One
parcel lay idle for 25 years in the control of a politically
well-connected developer who finally went bankrupt and walked away
from it, leaving unpaid even the token rent charged.  </li>
  <li>A third bad
example is ironic: Fairhope, AL, founded and chartered specifically
as a "single-tax colony," to exemplify the principles of Henry
George. The Fairhope Corporation owns the land and collects the
ground rent for public purposes. However, when a new generation arose
"that knew not Joseph" it proved politically impossible to keep
colony ground rents up to market. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another aspect of Pseudo-Socialism,
practised by Interior
Secretary James Watt, is to offer for immediate sale, for spot cash,
much more than the current market can absorb.</span> For example, in
April,
1982, Interior leased out coal reserves in the Powder River Basin of
Wyoming and Montana. The sale comprised 1.6 billion tons, at 3.5
cents/ton. Leases were for 50 years, with few development
requirements. The industry already had a 200 year supply under lease,
with the result that few bid, and they bid low. The winning bidders
were a tiny number of huge corporations, those with slack money to
buy reserves for the far future. </p>
<p>Meantime, on the <b
 style="font-weight: bold;">Outer Continental Shelf (OCS</b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">)</span>, a billion
acres (ten times the area of California) was to be leased before
1984. Before that, major oil firms had about 1/5 of that area under
lease, looking many years or several decades ahead of need. This
helps explain why a recent Alaska sale, an old Naval Petroleum
Reserve (NPR 4), fetched only 14% of the anticipated amount. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who buys to hold these vast
reserves for distant future use? They
are of investment grade only for those with waiting power.</span>
Unripe
lands and resources are probably the most closely held assets there
are. Poor people and small businessmen need busy capital right now.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Only a few of the wealthiest people
have the deep pockets and slack
money to buy far ahead, to maintain high reserve/output ratios. These
markets in far future values are their special preserve.</span> </p>
<p>What is being bought? Are these not "leases," contracts to pay
rent? No, these leases are not that. Here is the heart of
Pseudo-Socialism. The U.S. Government leases mineral-prone lands
under the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Bid System</span>,"
whereby most of the payment is required
up front in spot cash. This makes a "lease" more like a sale, a sale
in which buyers are screened by their banking connections rather than
by their ability to find and produce hydrocarbons. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The bonus system originated on
private uplands. It was a way for
big oil firms to dazzle various rustics, pressed for cash, by
tempting them with front money for their mineral rights.</span> The
companies had the cash, the connections, and intimidating expertise;
they wrote the rules their way. The rules included a cap of 12.5% on
the long-term "royalty," the only means by which lessors participated
over the long pull, and retained a share in gushers and bonanzas that
proved in excess of original estimates - estimates much better known
to the bidders than the lessors. When the companies moved onto public
lands they brought the same system with them. It was by then an
industry standard. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The only "bid variable" in this
system is the bonus.</span> With the
royalty capped, there are large potential surpluses to attract bonus
bids. The Physiocratic rule of compensation applies: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a low royalty
translates into a high leasehold value</span>. The advantage of this to
"the
industry" - meaning the largest firms that are its most visible
spokesmen and exemplars - is that it screens out many bidders, those
pressed for front money. It reserves the field for a much smaller
number of players, increasing their bargaining power. </p>
<p>All that may sound familiar to students of 19th Century American
history, and the privatization of the vast Federal domain. It is a
long story of conflict between cash sales and more democratic means
of placing lands. Those with cash and bank connections naturally
favored cash sales. President Jefferson saw the merit in credit
sales, so from 1801-20, sales were on credit. The system was badly
administered, but so were all other systems of land disposal tried in
that era. Collections became a problem, yet landownership was
democratized. It enabled Andrew Jackson to proclaim on Thanksgiving
Day, 1835, "We thank Thee for the absence of unemployment which in
the King-ridden countries of the world is causing widespread
suffering among the toiling masses and has led to riots ... (and
that) there will be none to freeze, starve, or be beset by the fear
of want this winter or the winters yet to come." </p>
<p>Following the period of credit sales, the return to cash sales
re-introduced front-money bias. Small owners still had ways of
fighting back at the state and local levels. States and counties and
their subdivisions relied mainly on the property tax. They used this
with good effect, often quite deliberately, to induce absentee
speculators to release large holdings for sale and settlement. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
impact of land taxes is analogous to that of credit sales. The
specter of future taxes is capitalized into lower current land
prices. </span>They in turn let one buy cheaper up front, in return
for a
higher level of deferred payments. The net effect is like extending
permanent credit on equal terms to all potential buyers, something
private credit markets never do or could be expected to do. </p>
<p>Thus, the property tax, especially on land, is twice effective as
an instrument of Distributive Socialism. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, it rifles in on the rent surplus and socializes it.</li>
  <li>Second, it democratizes the ownership and operating control of
land. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus it achieves something akin to the "worker control" that is an
ideal avowed by many modern Socialists, melding egalitarian
distribution with egalitarian management and control. To be sure, it
does so in a small-business framework, an ideal that is traditionally
Populist, not Marxist. However, in this new post-Communist age, when
Socialists are seeking new ways to express their yearnings for the
good society, they might want to reconsider the value of this
approach to worker control. Perhaps Marx, like other reformers of his
generation, was oversold on the economies and inevitable triumph of
large scale capital and organization, and the substitution of capital
for labor. Perhaps small is beautiful, after all. </p>
<p>Today's industry is faced less with the property tax than the
income tax. Most state property taxes are applied only at low levels
to mineral-bearing lands. Worse, the most active leasing today is on
the OCS, outside the tax reach of any state or county, and so exempt
from property taxation. </p>
<p>The Federal income tax does reach out to the OCS. Its effect,
however is to redouble the industry's support for the bonus system by
treating bonuses most favorably. The bonus, being a cost of land
acquisition, might normally not be easily deductible or depreciable.
Oil and gas are exhaustible, however, so the bonus might reasonably
be written off slowly on a unit-of- production basis, or by means of
the depletion allowance where that is still used. In the distinctive
conditions of frontier oil exploration, however, much of the bonuses
paid are deducted before production even begins. </p>
<p>It works like this. In the normal course of exploration, some five
leaseholds are taken and explored for every one where post-leasing
drilling will show commercially producible hydrocarbons. The other
four may be "abandoned," which means the lessee formally terminates
the lease. At this time, which the lessee may choose at his tax
convenience, all bonuses previously paid are taken as current
expenses, fully deductible in the year of abandonment. In addition,
all pre-leasing exploration costs that the lessee assigns to the
abandoned leaseholds are expensed also. Thus, before production
begins, the exploring firm may have expensed 80% of its land
acquisition costs. </p>
<p>Expensing on so large a scale is useful, of course, mainly to
large, diversified firms with other income against which to take the
expenses. Partnerships of high-tax-bracket individuals are also
involved. This works in tandem with high front-money requirements to
screen out smaller, leaner firms, leaving easier pickings for the
larger firms and deeper pockets. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The lease not abandoned, whose
value has been acquired and
built-up by costs that are mostly expensed, may now be sold as a
"capital asset," with all the preferential tax treatments appurtenant
thereto. </span>The buyer, in turn, now begins a new set of games for
deducting his acquisition cost. We do not spell these out, but the
overall result is extremely easy tax treatment compared with most
other businesses. </p>
<p>Many economists allege that the bonus system is the best way to
collect rent from the public lands. The lands are public; the
industry pays for them; bidding is modestly competitive; and the
industry is subject to taxation. All those conditions seem favorable
to making it a case of applied Distributive Socialism. However, for
the reasons given, the net result deserves better to be called
"Pseudo-Socialism." </p>
<p><b>III.
ADMINISTERING<a name="ADMINISTERING"></a> PUBLIC LANDS FOR JUSTICE AND EFFICIENCY</b></p>
<p>Here are four corners of an effective policy for socializing rent
from public lands: participate in revenues; control time of lease
sales for the seller's best advantage; participate in exploration;
and participate in marketing. Some detail follows. The writer has
elaborated the points elsewhere.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>A. Participating in
revenues</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 1. Defer payments.</span> Access
to private equity and credit is
extremely uneven, putting most potential bidders at a fatal
disadvantage relative to the wealthy few. Deferring payments
according to any uniform formula has the same effect as extending
long-term credit to all parties on equal terms. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 2. Vary payments according to what
is on the site, as that is
disclosed by exploration and production. </span>This shares risk with
the
lessee, and has somewhat the same effect as providing insurance. It
does somewhat dilute incentives at the margin, but this can be
largely offset by sharing in costs. Arguably, such risk-sharing
actually raises marginal incentives, on balance. Such, at least, is a
standard theorem in the literature of income taxation. </p>
<p> Such variation of payments, as with a royalty, also shares
other kinds of risks, like price. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. Give credits for lessee inputs,
writing these off against
later royalties.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 4. Leave a bid variable to soak up
any advantage of the
leasehold site that the lessor has overlooked in setting the
parameter charges, but sharp or sanguine bidders detect. </span>Thus
exploit
the Physiocratic rule of compensation. </p>
<p> 5. Limit the area leased to any one person or firm, especially
where there is a high royalty rate (lessor participation), and
consequent low cost to lessors of holding land unused. This is the
practise of private landlords, as analyzed and documented in the
works of Stephen Cheung.</p>
<p><b>B. Timing lease
sales</b></p>
<p>Sales need to be deferred until the lands are economically "ripe,"
from the seller's viewpoint. Ripeness, roughly speaking, is a
condition when the growth rate of value over time falls to equal or
less than the interest rate. "Value," in this context, is the
anticipated high bid. The tendency today is to time sales by industry
"nominations," meaning at the convenience of certain powerful members
of the industry. These may well be firms that have a lead in
exploring a certain frontier area, and a competitive edge to exploit
before other firms know as much as they. Even if several firms are
involved, every member of the group would like to get in on the steep
part of the growth curve, meaning growth of value. </p>
<p><b>C. Participating
in exploration</b></p>
<p>Public landlords today generally know less about their own
property than do private firms. The firms have leave to range all
over unleased lands, taking seismic soundings, studying satellite
images, developing sophisticated, top-secret computerized models of
the geology, even doing a bit of exploratory, pre-leasing drilling.
When potential lessees know more than the public's agents, the
latter's bargaining power is deeply eroded. </p>
<p>The public may protect itself in several ways. One is to do some
drilling of its own -- it may hire the same contractors used by
industry. Another is by checkerboarding followed by "drainage sales":
sales of parcels abutting proved producing leaseholds. A third is by
registering all well logs. </p>
<p><b>D. Participating in
marketing</b></p>
<p>Royalties received by lessors are a percentage of wellhead price,
but who sets the price? Transfer pricing scams are all too common in
an industry whose dominant firms are vertically integrated. The
public landlord may well want to take its share of production in
kind, using its own marketing agency, to avoid being exploited. The
mere threat of such a yardstick would have a profound effect on
wellhead pricing. </p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p>Is there any chance that Distributive Socialism will make headway
on the OCS, and other Federal lands? There is always a chance. The
lands, after all, are public, as a matter of history. However
conservative the administration, none would take pride in giving away
its assets. A business oriented administration need not call it any
kind of "Socialism." It prides itself on businesslike management of
public assets. It is our little secret that businesslike management
in this case is the essence of Distributive Socialism. </p>
<p>What about James Watt? He was the most unpopular figure in
Reagan's Cabinet, just as Douglas McKay was in Eisenhower's, and
Albert Fall was in Harding's. The public does not find giveaways and
sweetheart deals attractive. On the other hand the public does not
always recognize giveaways when there is some subtlety involved. The
appearance of open bidding, and substantial bonus payments for
leaseholds, may be enough to appease the public, the moreso when the
appearance of true competition is reinforced by the endorsement of
many respected economists. </p>
<p><b>What must be inculcated in everyone's thinking is the essential
difference between competition with front money, and competition
where payments are deferred. 
</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>The first is limited competition, with
places reserved for an affluent few. 
    </b></li>
  <li><b>The second is evenhanded,
democratic competition on a more level playing field, where
preferential access to credit confers no differential advantage.</b>
This is the condition under which Distributive Socialism can coexist
with, and reinforce, a free market economy. It is achieved on fee
simple lands by subjecting them to heavy land taxes, whereby
newcomers can buy in at low prices in return for paying more over
time. It is achieved on public lands by writing leases with high
lessor participation over time, and low bonuses required up front. </li>
</ul>
