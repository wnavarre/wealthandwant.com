Synthesis</b></p>
<p>Westerners rightly rejoice in the apparent conversion of Soviet
leaders to free market ideas. We take justifiable pride in the
relative success of Western capitalism. Modest pride is sufferable;
smugness and arrogance, however, are not. Let us therefore linger on
the word "relative," and temper pride with self-analysis and
humility. It is a time to reconcile, not strut and gloat. This writer
does not favor trying to remold the economy of the U.S.S.R., or any
of its breakaway nations, exactly in the U.S. image. It is with great
nations as Emerson said of great men, " ... they leave no class. He
who is really of their class will not be called by their name ... "
Great nations do not just imitate, but adapt as they adopt imported
ideas, merging them with their proper native genius.</p>
<p>Each nation has something to learn from the other. Western
capitalism has scored many successes worth emulating, but others may
learn from our failures, too. Recurrently with us are the same old
unsolved problems that alienated Marx in The Gilded Age, and
alienated many Americans who later turned to Populism and The
Progressive Movement, and Britons who turned to Fabianism and The
Labor Party. The same problems later terminated The New Era of the
Roaring Twenties and brought on The New Deal. History repeats:
excesses of the acquisitive, profligate eighties may soon generate
another such reaction.</p>
<p>Some of our unresolved problems today include</p>
<ul>
  <li>rising <span style="font-weight: bold;">homelessness</span>, the
counterpart of low affordability of housing. This problem persists in
spite of massive subsidies and tax breaks for housing that make America
"overhoused" next to, say, Japan.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unemployment </span>persists.</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Income and especially wealth are
distributed with increasing inequality.</li>
  <li>American industry grows obsolescent faced with foreign
competition: replacement is too slow, as in later 19th Century Britain.
Britain then at least saved and exported capital, but America's net
domestic capital formation is dangerously weak, leading to capital
imports and alienation of American wealth.</li>
  <li>Real wage rates are level or falling.</li>
  <li>Crime rates are frightening, with many Americans choosing to live
in an underground economy.</li>
  <li>Anomie and substance abuse are everywhere.</li>
  <li>National security hangs on precarious foreign oil.</li>
  <li>A large piece of our financial system has just collapsed, and the
rest looks shaky.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is much to be humble and concerned about.</p>
Western capitalism has shown the world that "personal interest is
the irreplaceable motive power of production and progress." Let us
trumpet this showing with pride, and preach to the world. Let us also
allow that personal interest can, if badly handled, lead to inhumane
excesses and abuses. <b>A worthy goal is to combine capitalist drive
and efficiency with socialist egalitarianism. How? Synthesis does not
mean some vaguely compromising "middle way," but the best
constructive combination of workable elements from each way. The
specific centerpiece of policy proposed here is social collection of
land rent, coupled with private collection and retention of incomes
drawn from labor and from creating capital.</b><br>

<p><b><a name="II. Reasons to Socialize Land R"></a>II. Reasons to
Socialize Land Rent</b></p>
<p>Few now question that the land of the Soviet Union belongs to the
whole people, through their governments. It is public domain, just
like Federal and state lands in the U.S., and Crown lands (Federal
and Provincial) in Canada. (We do not here address the tortured topic
of which constituent government owns what lands, a matter for
citizens of the lands at issue to decide for themselves.) <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The
question here is why and how to assert the common ownership of land
by having government collect land rents to support its public
functions.</span></p>
<p><a name="A. Financial Reasons to Reserve"></a><b>A. Financial
Reasons to Reserve Rent as a Tax Source</b></p>
<p>A simple, fast method of privatizing public land is selling fee
simple title to the highest bidders, free and clear of reserved
sovereign taxing rights. Selling is not abandoning or giving away the
public equity in land, but exchanging it for cash up front. Why not
sell, get it over with and let the market work its magic from
there?</p>
<p>Many American economists push this policy when advising how best
to privatize or lease public domain lands at home, especially since
1980. Without denying the prior public claim on ground rent, they
sincerely see cash-up-front as the best way to assert the public
claim, and thenceforward free the market from the meddlesome hand and
irrational mind of government.</p>
<p>There are, however, many reasons to reject the policy of cash
sales without credit or other deferred payment.</p>
<blockquote>1. <b>An entire nation cannot be sold off quickly at other
than fire-sale prices. Mass privatization is a way of securing the
worst possible bargain for the public selling the land.</b>
  <blockquote>Selling even a large bloc of land anywhere depresses
prices, unless the proceeds are concurrently reinvested in nearby
lands. A massive nationwide sale could only be a giveaway. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Normal yearly turnover in the U.S. land
market is 3-4 percent of parcels, and much less than 3 percent of value
(because small parcels turn over faster).</span> Most of even that
small turnover is zero-sum, buyers being financed by sales of what they
owned before. Net movement of money in or out of land is a small
percentage of total value turned over, and a minuscule share of total
land value.
    <p>Dumping all land in any short period, when that means finding
new buyers to put new money into land titles, is unthinkable. The first
small share of land sold would soak up all available capital funds,
leaving none to buy the rest, let alone to finance development,
improvement, and working capital.</p>
    <p>Some economists point out there are plenty of hoarded private
rubles to spare. Land sales, they believe, would "soak them up," thus
in one stroke forestalling inflation, rewarding past abstinence,
honoring a species of national debt, and getting a good price for land.
That solution is illusory. Such rubles are just paper, not real wealth.
To soak up the money and honor and retire the debt, the rubles received
would have to be destroyed. Following that operation the seller would
have no lands, no rubles, and no source of tax revenues.</p>
    <p>The state would have reduced its "debt," it is true, if
outstanding rubles be properly regarded as public debt. However, the
conditions of the exchange would be such as to downvalue the lands
given, and revalorize and validate the "debt," much to the disadvantage
of the state and the bulk of citizens it represents. It is hard to see
why the past generation had any right to alienate lands which are the
birthright of present and future generations under any circumstances,
let alone such disastrous ones.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, after the sale, government might spend the paper
rubles, but then it would not be repaying the "debt" they represent.
The net effect on price levels would be much like financing government
with newly printed money. In a nation perched on the edge of major
inflation, that seems unthinkable. In spite of the suffering, it would
not raise the real price fetched for land. Real prices are paid in real
labor and real goods.</p>
    <p>Germany faced the same problem in 1948 as it struggled to emerge
from years of suppressed inflation and reconsitute a workable market
economy. The currency reform of that year simply repudiated the old
marks: Draconian perhaps, not fair in every case, but better than any
alternative and highly effective. It is doubtful if the ensuing
Wirtschafstwunder would otherwise have occurred.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>2. <b>In a massive general land sale, most land would be bid up
by a small number of buyers with surpluses of "patient money," many of
them looking toward use or resale in the distant future. These buyers
are the kind stigmatized as "land speculators," for their traditional
indifference to highest and best current use of land.</b></p>
  <blockquote>To be sure, standard neo-classical microeconomic theory
today hardly allows for such market failure. This theory is based on a
priori deduction from unreal axioms selected to idealize market
performance. Indeed, standard-brand theories hardly allow the existence
of land as a factor of production with distinctive qualities, and are
of limited use in predicting real behavior, and especially in finding
departures from perfection.
    <p>The evidence of land market performance may be found instead by
looking at facts, like the 19th Century history of Federal land
disposal in the U.S. This is documented at length in many works like
those of Professor Paul Gates, Cornell University historian. The lag
between sale and beneficial use of land was often measured in decades.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>3. <b>A government selling land, even at fire-sale prices, would
be swamped with cash flow.</b> Humans being what they are, these flows
would be regarded as current income, and dissipated accordingly. Again,
consider the use of national land sales in the U.S. in the 19th
Century. They were used in lieu of current tax revenues, to meet the
operating expenses of government.</p>
  <p>4. <b>Governments need revenues in perpetuity</b>. If they
abandon land as a source of continuing revenue they must resort to
other sources, typically taxes on sales and consumption (like those
that helped trigger the deposition of Czar Nicholas II in the first
place). Most taxes on tax-bases other than land are of the nature that
"shoot anything that moves," with the familiar effects of depressing
production, misallocating resources, promoting underground and criminal
economies, and lowering capital formation.</p>
  <p>5. <b>Private wealth being scarce in most Soviet republics,
wealthy aliens would prevail in bidding for much of the best land.</b>
It is doubtful that any nation can long keep its sovereignty, or
meaningfully represent its own median citizens, when most of its real
estate is foreign-owned. In pre-commercial times one could own land in
most countries only by swearing personal fealty to the sovereign from
and under whom the land was held: that's why it's called "real" (from
"regal") estate. Kings knew the link between land and power. Alien
ownership was common only in conquered lands: it was the means of
dominating, controlling and exploiting their people.</p>
  <blockquote>Sovereignty supposedly remains with the resident voters,
but only the deaf and blind are unaware that money and property swing
elections, and the state and the law acknowledge and -- some would say
exist to -- uphold the superior rights of property. In 1978 a watershed
constitutional change, "Proposition 13," was made in California.
Although much California property is owned outside California and the
United States, the successful campaign for Proposition 13 was propelled
by the slogan "Property should only pay for services to property, not
to people." That is a current version of the old contract theory of the
state, whereby government is basically an agency contracting to serve
landowners.
    <p>Foreign ownership invites foreign invasion of sovereignty.
Witness the foreign extension of the American "trading-with-the- enemy"
act, applied to U.S. corporations holding property in other nations.
Witness the long-term effects of Zionist land acquisition in Palestine.
Witness the Canadian law, only recently repealed in British Columbia,
whereby real estate as such had so many votes, based on valuation.
Witness the property basis of voting that prevails in most public water
districts in California. Witness the long history of gunboat diplomacy,
and latter-day CIA manipulations like the replacement of Mohammed
Mossadegh by the Shah of Iran. History shrieks: buying land is not just
another commercial transaction, as the abstract theorists would have
it. Landownership is political power.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>6. <b>The land market works better, on an ongoing basis, if land
remains subject to regular taxes or other charges in perpetuity</b>.
Regular taxes, firmly anticipated long into the future, hold down
present market prices by the amount of the capitalized taxes. This is a
specific, visible instance of what it is now the fashion to call the
"Ricardian Equivalence Theorem."</p>
  <blockquote>What avails the trade-off, to buy land cheaper, only to
pay more over time? Median buyers are much better able to pay over time
than up front. The effect is the same as financing all buyers, and so
doing without credit discrimination as to rate of interest or other
terms of lending. It removes all forms of credit rationing as factors
in the land market, at the same time that it automatically meets the
new buyer's greatest credit need, financing for the purchase of land.
It yields all those benefits not just once, but for every succeeding
generation of buyers in perpetuity.
    <p>The same force that helps the median buyer, conversely, inhibits
the "strong-handed" speculative buyer who esteems land more as a store
of value than as a factor of production, who grasps simply to be
grasping, or to place surplus funds where they will keep with minimal
care. A land tax stings the sleeping owner who clings to lands from
inertia and lassitude, and bids him or her release them to youth and
enterprise. It legitimizes and supports property only as a means to
produce wealth, not property for the sake of property. It penalizes
pure possessiveness. It overpowers the ancient vice of self-justifying
acquisition, the auri sacra fames of Virgil, the "proputty, proputty,
proputty" lampooned so mordantly by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the Absentee
Ownership savaged in Thorstein Veblen's final testament, the
landlordism searchingly psychoanalyzed by Leo Tolstoy and Russian
populist novelists of the 19th Century.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>7. <b>Counterproductive rent-seeking behavior, in the most primal
sense, is maximized when land is simply privatized without the state's
reserving substantial servitudes, especially tax power.</b> Private
rent-seeking, the prime cause of legislative corruption and logrolling,
would then dominate the planning, timing, sizing and location of
infrastructure of all kinds.</p>
  <p>8. <b>Local governments, traditionally undernourished and weak in
much of the Soviet Union, also need revenues in perpetuity.</b> It is
possible that strengthening local governments to provide local
micro-infrastructure would fill nearly as great an unmet need as the
development of a private sector itself. Local government only thrives
with its own proper revenues.</p>
  <p>9. <b>A means is needed gently to pry loose surplus land from
state agencies like ministries in charge of production.</b> Forcing
sale of surplus lands would be drastic and unlikely to be broadly
implemented, for the same reasons the death penalty is not widely used.
It would be reserved for extreme, flagrant cases after long review,
appeals and delay. The alternative of ongoing land taxation, without
exempting state agencies, is more workable in practice. Taiwan affords
a precedent.</p>
  <blockquote>The Soviet republics may regard lands as common, but not
as "commons" in the sense of open range. They are not starting from
that kind of clean slate. Land is tenured. It is controlled by existing
agencies that are just as possessive and righteous as the U.S. Forest
Service and the University of California (54,000 acres and more, all
used "for educational purposes"). These agencies have important core
functions. The #1 priority in privatization is to induce them to
identify and sell their surplus lands, while retaining and better using
their essential lands (the University, for example, might focus more on
research and teaching, rather than land speculation).</blockquote>
  <p>10. <b>Public acquisition of lands for such uses as rights-of-way
(r.o.w.), schools, reservoirs, air bases, parks, and watershed
protection becomes much more costly when all land is privatized first. </b></p>
  <blockquote>What about selling movable property, like inventory and
machinery, owned by state enterprises? Here the objections to selling
for a single up-front payment are far lighter. The mean residual
economic life of modern industrial capital is only a few years, and the
selling price is a correspondingly low multiple of cash flow. Thus,
purchases are self-liquidating in a few years or, with many
inventories, just a few months. Financing purchase is, accordingly,
much easier for borrowers, and requires much less money, than financing
land, whose price is a high multiple of cash flow.
    <p>Buyers of durable structures affixed to land generally want
financing; we do not belittle the need. We do stress, however, that
financing structures is easier when buyers need not also finance the
land under them. There are, in fact, many instances of sellers'
broadening their markets by selling houses separately from the land.</p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>1. <b>Taxing land allows us to avoid taxing functional
activities like production, exchange, work, saving, and investment.</b>
Taxing productive activities has counterproductive effects, certified
by expert economic testimony.
  <p>2. <b>Taxing land holds down its purchase price, thus easing and
democratizing entry.</b> The financial problems described above under
heading "A" are thus minimized or eliminated.</p>
  <p>3. <b>Taxing land drains cash from sleeping owners of surplus
land,</b> arousing them in the most compelling way to the otherwise
overlooked opportunity cost of their surpluses. A cash drain has wealth
and liquidity effects that are demonstrably more potent than mere
"opportunity cost" in driving land to its highest and best uses.</p>
  <p>4. <b>Taxing land motivates sellers and moves the otherwise

demands, constantly consumed and replaced, easily divided or assembled,
moved at will from here to there.</p>
  <blockquote>Land does not fit the model. "So much the worse for
land," pedantic theorists seem to say, but our realistic concern is
with life and the facts that the models do not fit. The models' bright
promises of competition working smoothly are not borne out by
experience with land. It takes a strong extra push to make land markets
work: land taxes provide that push.
    <p>As Harold Groves put it, land is not a stream from a fountain,
it is the fountain itself. Land is fixed in place, easily subject to
local monopolization, slow to be divided, arduous and costly to
assemble, and tempting to hold in reserve. Most land lasts forever and
is accordingly bid up by a wealthy few who seek a store of value for
the distant future. This strong competition, usually with speculative
overtones, makes land unaffordable for median buyers seeking to meet
ordinary needs of the present.</p>

  <p>5. <b>Taxing land promotes markets by pushing central urban land
into commercial uses yielding high cash flows</b>. "The market" is not
just an idea or a way of organizing the economy; it is a place, a land
area dedicated to exchange. Taxing land inhibits most non-commercial
uses in all those locations having high potential commercial value. It
by no means destroys non- commercial uses, but relocates them to less
central places.</p>
  <p>6. <b>Taxing land discourages the motives, currently powerful and
dominant, to hold land mainly as a store of value and hedge against
inflation</b>. It also discourages landowners from their current
practice of borrowing money and then joining and leading the
too-powerful pro-inflation lobby.</p>
  <p>7. <b>It is arguable that taxes on bases other than land are
largely shifted to - that is, are drawn from - land rent anyway</b>.
That is the "Physiocratic doctrine" of tax incidence. It presumes an
open economy: labor and capital migrate freely across the borders.
Given the premise, it follows that after-tax wage levels, and rates of
return on capital, are fixed by world market forces. Local taxation can
only affect land rent.</p>
  <blockquote>With closed borders, the Physiocratic rule still applies
in part. In either case a prime reason for singling out rent for direct
taxation is that it is simply a more efficient means to socialize rent.
Tax shifting always implies some friction and loss of taxable surplus:
"excess burden" is the standard term.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This reasoning also gives us a new, expanded insight into the
adequacy of land as a tax base. Under Physiocratic doctrine, land
rent and taxable surplus are nearly coterminous.</p>

<p><a name="C. Ethical Reasons for Taxing L"></a><b>C. Ethical
Reasons for Taxing Land Rent</b></p>
<p>Once land titles are privatized, unearned gains and losses begin
accruing immediately in this dynamic, complex, stochastic world.
Expectations change daily; unforeseen windfalls and wipeouts based on
exogenous, uncontrollable forces soon take over from original
expectations which formed the basis of initial bids and sales prices.
Surprises are inherent in land markets because land is
irreproduceable, permanent and stationary.</p>
<p>Professor Thomas N. Carver has divided all incomes into
"<b>Earning</b>s, <b>Findings</b> and <b>Stealings</b>." Historically
most if not all land rent has been secured by stealing, that is by
force of conquest in the manner of Iraq taking Kuwait, Cromwell
taking parts of Ireland, Spain taking the Philippines, Captain John
Mason massacring the Pequods to take Connecticut, and so on. There is
a lingering presumption of unsanctity about landed property.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if buyers in a truly free market paid
government up front the full present value of land, one could regard
future land rent as an honest "earning" on their early payment to the
general fund. That view prevails among landowners and their
economists, ex parte to be sure, but still arguable. Even from this
perspective, however, there soon arise windfall rents which are
"findings." Such findings are just as non-functional socially as
stealings based on force, covin and fraud.</p>
<p>A major source of such "findings" is new infrastructure which
brings benefits to specific lands, and may remove them from others.
In the Soviet lands, shifting from one political-economic system to a
radically different one will entail massive changes of infrastructure
- for example, providing micro-infrastructure like road and utility
extensions for the many small private farms expected to supplant the
present few giant collectives. Giant landholding units, both farm and
industrial, typically have provided internally for much
infrastructure that must now be provided publicly, no doubt with new
plans and layouts.</p>
<p>The capital to finance this infrastructure now lies sleeping in
the lands to be served, whose rise in value will more than cover the
costs, providing the projects are well planned and executed. To be
just, however, the land gains must be tapped to pay the cost. If they
are not tapped, the result will be the unethical process of someone
else's paying to give the landowners a windfall.</p>
<p>Some lands are occupied by squatters. When these lands are
privatized and tenured, removing the squatters poses hard ethical
choices. Should they be given a prior claim to own the land they
occupy? With a land tax that problem is <i>de minimis</i>: the state
may give them titles but then require regular land tax payments to
keep them. All buyers are more able to pay over time than up front.
Many squatters could pay that way, too: the effect is the same as
extending credit to these poor risks on the same terms as to the
best. The inevitable non-payers can be evicted selectively, leaving
most squatters undisturbed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="D. Political Reasons for Taxing"></a><b>D. Political
Reasons for Taxing Land Rent</b></p>
<p><b>To unify a nation it makes sense for a central government to
tax the rent from richer regions, those with more rent per capita,
and distribute it nationally as some form of social dividend</b>.
Distribution should be on a per capita basis, and/or some surrogate
basis like average daily attendance at school, military service, or
social security entitlement. Nothing else that is purely economic
seems as well calculated to give every citizen a birthright and stake
in the nation.</p>
<p>On balance this policy helps overcome ancient ethnic loyalties and
particularism. One must concede it may be resented by local
landowners in regions of high land value per capita, exemplified by
the Province of Alberta, Canada. However, local distribution of
superior local rents - in money or superior public services - is of
no lasting advantage to the bulk of local people. The gain is quickly
offset by competition from immigrants drawn by the higher social
dividend. Such migration is also socially wasteful.</p>
<p>National distribution of rent, by contrast, has a great efficiency
advantage along with its political advantage. Local distribution
mislocates the population by overattracting immigrants to the favored
local polities, much as footloose people are now drawn to Moscow.
National labor resources are wasted when people work at jobs of low
productivity in order to enjoy the supplement of superior local
public services. The efficiency advantage of national distribution
can be made a political advantage because it raises national output
for the gain of all.</p>
<p><b>The alternative method of distribution, "regional equity," sets
an implied goal of equalizing rents among regions or local polities,
rather than among individual citizens</b>. Regional equity says, in
the extreme, that every cow county deserves its own Grand Central
Station or JFK Airport to compensate for its inherent geographical
handicaps. It is a proven, historically certified recipe for
dissipating rent and impoverishing rich states and nations. It may
also be used as a cloak for costly, irrational imperialism, a way of
clinging to distant, submarginal marches whose maintenance and
demands exceed all possible economic, military or political
gains.</p>
<p>Distribution to local governments is also a formula for aborting
their development as quasi-independent sources of power. Such
quasi-independence within a nation is needed to balance central power
and check despotism. Early U.S. federalism had some praiseworthy
features (I do not refer to modern "revenue-sharing"). Sovereignty
was shared between central and state governments ("territories,"
earlier). States then set up counties, generally on the principle of
<i>nulle terre sans seigneur</i>, that is without leaving much land
unorganized and hence untaxed. The states' power of taxation was
delegated to counties and later to cities as they organized.</p>
<p>A key factor is that little aid (other than military) was passed
from central to local governments as such. Local units had power to
tax property, and they used it. They had little effective power to
tax anything else. In this way, decentralized political power grew,
saving the U.S. from the evils of overcentralization that beset, for
example, its neighbor to the south.</p>

Methods of Collecting Land Rent</b></font></p>
<p><a name="A. Leasing vs. Taxation"></a><b>A. Leasing vs.
Taxation</b></p>
<p><b><i>Leasing and taxing are alternative methods of asserting
public equity in land on an ongoing basis. Most taxes are closely
analogous (and often homologous as well) to corresponding standard
lease provisions.</i></b></p>
<p>Taxation possesses one quality, however, that makes it much
preferable to leasing in general. That is the annual revaluation of
rent and/or land value, based on current information derived from
comparable parcels.</p>
<p>Leasing, on the other hand, binds the lessor to fixed terms
contracted in advance. This practice is inherently biased for
lessees, especially those who are "judgment-proof," who can often
walk away from an unfavorable lease with minimal real penalty. We are
not too far off the mark to view a lease as an option for the lessee
to use land provided its economic rent turns out to exceed the
contract rent, and to abandon it otherwise.</p>
<p>In addition, private lessees, being private, are often more canny
and highly motivated than typical public employees, and are therefore
likely to outnegotiate them. Bribing and corruption are not unknown.
Large and organized lessees, like our western cattlemens'
associations, also have long experience bringing pressure through
elected officials whom they control through contributions.</p>
<p>The history of public leasing, therefore, is generally one of
failing to collect much land rent. Ironically, that rule even holds
for the colony of Fairhope, Alabama, founded by idealistic followers
of Henry George for the express purpose of demonstrating the benefits
of socializing land rent. Their cozy heirs and assigns organize to
hold rents below market levels, much like any other group of people
chosen randomly.</p>
<p>That rule also holds for the colonization of Israel. The Jewish
National Fund and the Jewish Agency acquired lands before nationhood.
The original purpose of these quasi-public agencies was to lease land
to settlers. Unfortunately, they wrote fifty-year leases (the number
taken from Leviticus) on fixed terms, so lessees have become de facto
owners of most of the rent.</p>
<p>Annual revaluation of land for tax purposes might seem to impose
extra uncertainty on landowners, in comparison to the lot of lessees
on fixed terms. However it is only the amount of the tax that is
uncertain; the principle of it is known and certain. Furthermore the
principle is such that the tax only rises when exogenous forces raise
the earning potential of land; thus the added tax is neither
arbitrary nor grievous to bear. When exogenous forces lower earnings,
they also lower the tax burden, so that the fisc shares the risk with
landowners.</p>
<p>Annual revaluation occasionally will penalize a landowner when the
best use of land changes in the midlife of a durable building.
Anticipating that hazard, landowners in some times and places will
avoid long commitments. This is not such a bad effect, however. Life
is uncertain; economic tides are uncertain; optimal land use calls
for frequent adjustments to new forces and data. Therefore the most
fixed, durable improvement should rarely be encouraged. It is too
ponderous and inflexible, too likely to be a monument or white
elephant that will obsolesce before it pays off. Some examples are
the C&amp;O Canal, the Great Wall of China, the Edsel plant, the
Maginot Line, and a dozen buildings we could all pick out in our own
cities. In my own neighborhood, near a growing shopping center, over
half the parcels have been cleared and rebuilt in the last fifteen
years, even without any tax stimulus. In dynamic times and places it
is good for builders to anticipate fairly early demolition and
renewal, and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="B. Fixed Cash Rent vs. Particip"></a><b>B. Fixed Cash
Rent vs. Participation</b></p>
<p>The traditional Georgist position is that the land tax is ideal in
part because it is a fixed cash payment, a function of time and value
rather than land use and cash flow. The Georgist model is the
American general property tax, where the "taxable event" is not
production or use, but simply the passage of time. Georgists would
adopt this tax, but modify it by exempting all capital (movable items
plus fixed improvements like buildings). Such a tax is like debt
service, unaffected by landowner behavior. It exerts maximum
incentive leverage, with no disincentive to use or improve land.</p>
<p>Sometimes this tax is praised as being "neutral," but it is more
than that, much more. By arousing useful enterprise while curbing
sheer possessiveness, it affords a unique and wonderful blend of
benefits. It drains cash from landowners, and lowers their wealth,
thus exerting powerful positive leverage for them to use land fully,
to hire workers and produce goods, to create capital, and to manage
their lands personally and ably.</p>
<p>At the same time it stops them from hogging lands. It spurs them
to disgorge lands they don't need, thus making an active, ongoing
market, a pool of available land where all may draw for future
expansion if and when they actually do need it. It triggers off a
positive feedback loop of better land economy because each speculator
releasing land to the common pool helps thaw the whole market. The
availability of land for sale lowers everyone's compulsion to
withhold land from sale in the fear that there may be no land for
sale when needed later. "Just take what you need and leave the rest"
is the folk-wisdom it imparts in modern, financial terms.</p>
<p>This tax is, arguably, the Western-style feature most lacking in
Soviet economies today. There is a Soviet price system of sorts for
commodities. Natural resources, however, routinely "are treated as
free goods." "The firm does not pay any charges for the resources it
holds and uses; ..." "... a firm or association that is divested of
assets by its ministry is usually not compensated ... and (has) an
incentive to misrepresent the value of resources in their current use
to prevent transfer." There is, in short, nothing analogous to a land
market, and little incentive to economize on land. The need for
improved land allocation must be greater than with commodities and
equipment, and the scope for new national benefits spectacular. An
annual land tax based on the value of land in its best alternative
use is a social performance standard of the most objective and
compelling kind.</p>
<p>Those are powerful, realistic arguments, and on balance they are
probably right. However there is a case, too, for participation.
"Participation" means that the landlord (or Treasury) shares the
costs of land use, and also shares in revenues, usually in the same
proportion. Thus the landlord shares in rent, which is the excess of
revenues over costs. I here present a case for participation, for the
sake of comparison and argument. I also present a few
counter-arguments, to clarify my own position.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Many private lessees
evidently prefer participation to the alternative of paying cash rent
(analogous to the property tax on land).</span> This preference is
evidenced by the existence of <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">share-cropping</span>
(the French metayage), royalties, joint ventures and other such
arrangements. The significance of private arrangements is that they are
chosen voluntarily by (more or less) free agents, who apparently have
reasons for preferring participation to fixed cash payments. (On the
other hand, these free agents do not have the option of anything
resembling a property tax, where annual rent is determined by a third
party who assesses land price based on market evidence. If private
markets offered this choice, lessees might prefer it.)
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. The disincentive effect of
share-cropping may be offset in part by limiting the land allowed each
cropper,</span> as explained in the seminal works of Professor Stephen
Cheung. The analogy to taxation implies is that a national sales tax,
or VAT, should be accompanied by a limit on size of landholding.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Lessors may avoid penalizing
and discouraging capital improvements by letting lessees deduct their
costs from their rental payments in full at the time of negative cash
flow. </span>If costs in any year exceed the rental due (as is likely
at the time of constructing new buildings), the lessors may let the
costs be recouped over time with a specified interest credit.
Alternatively, lessors may share costs in the same proportion as they
take from the gross revenues.</p>
    <p>A Treasury, likewise, may let landowners "expense" capital
outlays, that is deduct them from taxable income at the time money is
spent on them. This policy has the same effect as exempting from
taxation the income added by the new capital outlays. When this is
done, the "income" tax becomes purely a tax on land income (land
purchase not being deductible at all). If the expenses exceed current
taxable income the Treasury, like the private landlord, may let the
expenses be recouped over time with a specified interest credit.
Alternatively the Treasury may let taxpayers sell their surplus tax
credits to others.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. In </span><b
 style="font-weight: bold;"><i>"pioneer" conditions</i></b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> there may not be enough data to appraise
land accurately ex ante. </span>Then rent-collection need perforce be
based on ex post outcomes. Participation entails sharing information,
whereby lessors gain needed data.</p>
    <p>"Pioneer" conditions include minerals' exploration in frontier
areas, where a great deal of rent is expected in the near future in
several Soviet regions. "Pioneer" conditions also include all private
land development in regions where commodity, credit and land markets
are underdeveloped.</p>
    <p>Conditions of extreme uncertainty are like pioneer conditions,
too. The Soviet Union contains vast farm areas where rainfall is highly
variable, much like our high plains region west of the 100th Meridian
(the proposed "Buffalo Commons"). Where "nature's bounty" is
irregularly given and withdrawn, lessors and Treasuries charging
farmers for use of the bounty should correspondingly raise and lower
their claims. To be sure, a property tax based on annual reassessment
makes just that adjustment, but historically has tended to lag after
the facts. Participation has the advantage of being always and
inherently based on current data.</p>
    <p>A grave weakness of participation is that it fails to stimulate
sales of surplus land. Thus, unlike a fixed charge, it fails to help
generate data on land values.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Participation creates a kind
of community of interest between the parties, who thrive or suffer
together.</span> Participation also generates frictions and moral
hazards, it is true, but there is also a history of resentment against
creditors. Tax collectors who take fixed charges are sometimes subject
to the same animus.</p>
    <p>The land tax collector is more participative than the lender,
however, because "fixed" land taxes can and should be lowered
immediately when exogenous conditions worsen (and raised when
conditions improve). Sometimes they have been sticky, historically,
because levied to support local governments which were themselves
heavily in debt. To avoid that outcome, governments taxing land to
cover debts should leave themselves some slack, never mortgaging their
revenues completely.</p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Participation helps generate
information for tax assessments, as taxpayers must disclose information
to Treasury officials.</span> Unfortunately, however, it only generates
data on current realized cash flows, not on values of land titles. That
drawback is a severe one. The selling price of land is normally higher
than one would infer from capitalizing visible cash flows. Some land is
not used at all. Much land is used at far less than its potential.
There are invisible kinds of values, whether imputed, potential,
ancillary, cash, or expected benefits. Only land sales can disclose
those values.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For those various reasons there may be a secondary place for
participation in the form of a tax on land income, supplementing but
certainly not replacing a tax based on the value of land titles. The
great danger of any tax on land income is the ease with which it may
change into a tax on labor income. This is the U.S. history since
1913. The income tax was originally conceived and sold to voters as a
special tax on high property incomes. It has progressively
degenerated into being mainly a payroll tax, with many regressive
features and special exemptions for property, especially land. To
avoid that outcome it would be wise to exclude labor income
explicitly in any legislation adopting a participative tax on land
rent.</p>
<p><a name="C. A Supplemental Tax on Land G"></a><b>C. A Supplemental
Tax on Land Gains?</b></p>
<p><b><i>There would be no land gains if land rent were to be 100
percent socialized, and if the market expected it to remain so.
</i></b>In practice those circumstances are unlikely, and some would
consider them undesirable: the easiest and most accurate way to
appraise rent is by monitoring the market in land titles.</p>
<p>When land and/or minerals are "ripening" over an extended period
of ownership, a property tax during the ripening period can be shown
to collect exactly the proper share of the increment, but only under
ideal conditions. First, the market and the foresight of market
agents must be so perfect that value rises roughly along a curve of
compound interest. Second, tax assessment must follow that perfect
market closely.</p>
<p>In practice even rough perfection is, alas, rare. A gains tax is a
good way of "mopping up" excess rent that escapes the basic rent tax.
It can also be very productive of revenue: in Taiwan the land gains
tax raises four times as much as the basic land tax, partly because
the gains tax is always based strictly on current sales data. The
land tax should be based on current sales data as well, to be sure,
but in Taiwan and many other jurisdictions it often is not.</p>
<p>This writer recommends announcing at time of privatization, and
regularly thereafter, that landowners should expect a high tax rate,
80 percent or more, to be imposed on land gains. It should be
contrary to public policy for land to attain a value based on
expected future resale. Possessory interest with allocation to
highest and best current use, and not land speculation, is the
desired emphasis.</p>
<p>Instead of being made illegal, resale gains should be closely
monitored to audit the system of rent collection. Gains are evidence
that basic rent taxes are too low or that market agents expect them
either to fall or to fail to keep up with rising rent. A rise in
gains is an early warning to view the land tax administration with
alarm and move swiftly to correct it. Experience shows that buyers
quickly acquire a mental vested interest in collecting rent and
avoiding taxes based on what they paid, or others are now paying, for
land titles.</p>
<p>A problem with gains taxes is the "lock-in effect." Holders with
surplus land may refuse to sell to avoid tax. A gains tax may be very
high, however, without a serious lock-in effect, when coupled with a
high ongoing rent tax. The latter compels owners to dispose of
surplus lands. Indeed, the "ripening cost" theorists believe it
forces premature sales for conversion to new uses. If there is any
merit to their rationale we should favor strengthening the lock-in
effect. So should they, as a litmus test of their rational
consistency and constructive purpose.</p>
<p>The greatest cause of the lock-in effect of the capital gains tax
in the U.S., however, is not the tax itself but one of its major
loopholes: the ability to avoid it via the step-up of basis at time
of death. There should of course be no such provision, which is a
kind of negative inheritance tax mainly benefitting heirs who have
done nothing to deserve it. Legacies, devises, gifts and other
transfers without arm's length consideration should trigger valuation
and tax. So should death itself, when property has to be valued
anyway.</p>
<p>Land gain should be defined as the excess of net sales price over
depreciated cost basis. An administrative problem to note and solve
is the manner of recording capital outlays and their depreciation, in
the (presumed) absence of a general income tax.</p>
<p>A supplemental tax on land transfers is desirable as a tool of
disclosure. It should be based on gross value of lands transferred
(not just gain, and not just equity). Many American states have such
taxes, at very low rates, simply to supply data for land assessment.
While rates should be nominal, penalties for perjury should be
severe: the public has a right to know how much others are getting
for its property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="D. Non-standard Resources and T"></a><b>D. Non-standard
Resources and Their Rent</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For most exhaustible resources,
like minerals or overdrafted
ground water, I recommend a combined charge with two components,
fixed and variable.</span> The fixed charge should be a property tax
based
on assessed value of the resource<span style="font-style: italic;"> in
situ.</span> This charge, like the
"delay rental" in a standard mineral lease, keeps the lessee from
hoarding resources of great potential. It has the same bracing effect
as the imperative to service a heavy debt owed to an importunate
banker, with sizeable regular payments due and the land subject to
seizure. Experience shows that many, probably most landowners need
that stimulus to arouse their productive enterprise and curb their
acquisitiveness.</p>
<p>The variable charge should be a tax based on units-of-production,
with deduction of all qualified operating costs, and some capital
costs. This charge is modelled on the "net proceeds tax" found in
several western states. Like other "participative" taxes it taps rent
ex post rather than ex ante, generates information, and shares risk.
Those benefits come at a price: the variable charge dilutes
incentives and creates moral hazards. The case for such participation
is now often considered stronger with exhaustible land resources than
with standard ones, because of the possible deferral effect. This
writer, however, considers that case weak, and recommends, as an
eventual goal, raising more taxes from the fixed than the variable
charge.</p>
<p>The "eventual goal" cited above requires modifying in the short
run. A property tax on the value of mineral reserves only taps rent
effectively if levied over many years before the mineral disappears
down the track or pipeline. If mines have accumulated high values
after long years of silently "ripening" in value, and paid no tax all
that time, then a variable charge on severance is needed to capture
rent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The objection will arise that such
a dual tax system would tax the
same rent twice. Under ideal conditions, however, that is logically
impossible: the anticipated severance tax will lower the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">in situ</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
value that serves as the base for the property tax.</span> Double
taxation
would only occur if owners paid a property tax over many years, and
then were surprised by a newly announced severance tax. In that
unusual event, past property taxes might be allowed as credits
against the new severance tax.</p>
<p>Minerals' taxation needs special study, and the study needs to
have priority: the most aggressive foreign investors penetrating
Soviet nations today are oil companies. The companies are veteran,
sophisticated and cunning, with long histories of beguiling
unsophisticated landowners at the bargaining table.</p>
<p>Other exotic rent-sources have their own technological
idiosyncracies, each requiring distinctive adaptation of basic
principles. Some other of these "exotics" are timber, rights of way,
radio spectrum, aircraft time-slots, fisheries, game, zoning,
development rights, the gene pool, utility hook-up permits, pollution
easements, scenic easements, navigation, surface waters, soils,
franchises to use city streets, geothermal wells and wind power. Each
has its own experts, and warrants its own special study.</p>

<p><a name="IV. Modifying the Credit System"></a><font size="+1"><b>IV.
Modifying the Credit System</b></font></p>
<p><a name="A. Banking without Land as Coll"></a><b>A. Banking
without Land as Collateral</b></p>
<p>Credit follows collateral. In periods of high and rising land
prices, borrowers get used to pledging land to secure loans, and
lenders get used to demanding it. Socializing land rent, as proposed
herein, lowers or eliminates the value of land as loan
collateral.</p>
<p>On the good side, this lack of land collateral would stop lenders'
discriminating in favor of landowners, as they do now. It would
remove a major cause of the concentration of economic power and
control, that is the clustering of credit around original nuclei of
large, superior landholdings. The credit is often used to buy still
more land, to reserve for possible future use and at the same time to
withhold from competitors. Such concentration and market control form
the ugly side of extant Western "capitalism," when enterprise
degenerates into greed and acquisitions supplant innovations.</p>
<p>As Rainer Schikele wrote, "the basis of credit is not marginal
productivity but collateral security." He meant that lenders are
concerned not with the productive use of their loans, but with the
security provided by borrowers' ownership of old wealth.</p>
<p>As Keynes put it in his General Theory, there are two kinds of
risks: investment risk proper, and lender's risk. "Investment risk"
depends on the productivity of new capital; "lenders' risk" depends
on borrowers' old collateral, like land. The social purpose of
investing is to create capital; the individual purpose is to buy
income with security. The second purpose leads lenders to lend to the
rich in preference to the productive. The principles are at odds; the
productivity principle is clearly better from the viewpoint of basic
micro efficiency.</p>
<p>The marginal productivity basis of lending is also better in terms
of macro stability. Flows of credit dominated by cycles in the land
market are highly unstable. The current S&amp;L calamity in the U.S.
exemplifies and should settle the point. It has many precedents,
going back at least to the Dutch Tulip Bubble of 1634 and the
French-English Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles of 1720. The rule
has been that following each collapse the hung-over lenders woke up
penitent. Reacting to the excesses they adopted something like the
English Banking School philosophy of avoiding real estate loans and
sticking with self-liquidating commercial loans, only to fall off the
wagon in the next land boom, repeating the cycle. How easily one
generation forgets the hard lessons life taught the one before. "When
will they ever learn?"</p>
<p>In the absence of land booms, however, bankers would have to stay
on the wagon. On the bad side, low land prices raise new problems of
how to transfer funds to builders. If the free market is to provide
ample flows of investment, the credit system must adjust to life
without land values. Actually, however, it has often done so anyway,
following the periodic collapses of land markets such as those
already cited, plus those of 1798, 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, and
1929, to mention only the extreme cases. In those periods of
atonement credit systems worked quite well without depending on real
estate as collateral. We would be much better off to keep them
working that way permanently.</p>
<p>Many particular lenders practice the arts of lending without land
collateral. Factoring inventories is a thriving business. Building on
leased land is commonplace, with both private lessors like the
Wrigley Company of Catalina Island and the Irvine Company of Orange
County, California; and public lessors like the Crown Provincial of
British Columbia, the County of Los Angeles, The Port of San
Francisco, the State of Alaska, and countless others. Chattel
mortgages are common, secured by movable capital. Even construction
loans are secured mainly by capital, not land, because new buildings
normally outvalue their sites, even on dear land and more so on cheap
land. Some developers borrow on the security of signed leases.</p>
<p>As credit follows collateral, so it flees taxes. The policy
proposed here is not just to tax land, but to untax capital, and
untax profits drawn from skill in management, and untax wages and
salaries generally. That which is less taxed becomes more
creditworthy. The flow of credit will turn away from those with
accumulated wealth and monopoly towards those with skill and daring
to use it better. The result is to make capitalism work as
advertised, not in the decadent way as charged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="B. The Hazards of Public Credit"></a><b>B. The Hazards of
Public Credit</b></p>
<p>When we socialize rent its value as collateral is not lost, it is
transferred to government. A nation with a sound tax system becomes
the most creditworthy borrower. Add a central bank and the public
credit is sound - possibly too sound.</p>
<p>In the best scenario an enlightened, enterprising, progressive
leadership raises capital to provide needed public works, guided by
economists steeped in modern cost/benefit analysis, well-salted with
common sense and local geography. Cynics may deride that as a
fairy-tale, and cite instances of waste, vanity and corruption; but
for all of that, trillions of dollars worth of essential public
infrastructure in place and working do attest to the real existence
of some effective public leadership. It is what has made civilized
life possible.</p>
<p>In the worst scenario, however, a corrupt, stupid, spendthrift
administration borrows heavily, connives to pay excessive rates,
takes its graft, mortgages public revenues and wastes the proceeds.
Subsequently government becomes an oppressive tool of creditors
charging usurious rates to extract rent from citizen-taxpayers, to
enrich lenders many or most of whom may be aliens. Then taxation
becomes totally "onerous" in Alfred Marshall's sense, and in the
ordinary meaning as well. Clearly it is not enough merely to have a
good tax system.</p>
<p>A nation embarking on capitalism needs some precautions to forfend
this perverse outcome. We cannot plead innocence: history gives ample
warning.</p>
<blockquote>1. <b>No debt should be incurred without public vote,
unless such debt is explicitly not secured by land tax revenues</b>.
  <p>2. <b>There should be a constitutional debt limit fixed at less
than half the capitalized value of "free revenues" from land rent.</b>
"Free revenues" should be defined as the excess above entitlement
payments (social dividends and their surrogates). By this device,
social dividends are given the status of "birthrights": they take
priority over debt service and may never be alienated by the government.</p>
  <p><b>The rate of capitalization ("cap rate") should be no lower than
the interest rate on long-term government bonds. By this device, if the
government's credit rating slips, its debt limit falls automatically,
getting attention and demanding correction. </b></p>
  <p>3. <b>Any "emergency" debt in excess of the limit should be
subject to constitutionally mandated taxation, the proceeds of which
should be earmarked to increase the social dividend.</b> Granted, this
"tax" will be passed right back to the borrower in the form of higher
rates; but those higher rates will be the onus of the bureaucracy,
while the tax revenues will pass, in the American expression, "outside
the Beltway."</p>
  <p>It will be pointed out that no such scheme is foolproof because
"money is fungible." I take the point. The idea is simply to make
tampering difficult and visible; nothing can make it impossible. No
system is secure against public indifference. There is no indifference
to entitlements, however.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The central idea is that government become and remain an agency to
pool rents and then channel them faithfully into public goods and
services, social dividends and capital formation. "...whenever any
form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right
of the people to alter or to abolish it..." There is no other
ultimate safeguard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="V. Starting up the Market"></a><b>V. Starting up the
Market</b></p>
<p>Soviet land is mostly already tenured, held by various state
agencies. Starting up a system of property will not be primarily a
matter of surveying and settling wild lands. Still, shifting to a
market economy will entail massive changes in land use and
infrastructure, and therefore in platting and subdividing land, and
transferring and recording titles.</p>
<p>The last, if done correctly, is a ministerial technicality. If
done incorrectly, slowly, or with bureaucratic nightmares of inertia
and delay, recording can become a major obstacle to progress, as in
Peru. An administration that cannot overcome such a totally
unnecessary barrier will never accomplish much. Without belittling
the matter, we here assume it will be handled well, and move on.</p>
<p>The first priority in making a market is pressing state agencies
with surplus lands to disgorge them. The most administrable, humane,
non-catastrophic kind of pressure is an annual tax based on the value
of land. This tax should be levied on state as well as private
landowners.</p>
<p>It will be objected, there is no point in the government taxing
itself, it just stirs money around the same pot. That dissent
misapprehends the motives of bureaucrats, the difficulties in
monitoring their performance, their peculiar motives for hoarding
land, and the limitations of budgeting. Once a state agency acquires
land its social cost never again appears in the budget, because
budgets are in cash, and the land is neither mortgaged nor taxed.
Taxing the land in proportion to its value imposes a visible,
explicit social audit on the bureaucrats in charge: they must budget
the tax money annually. Anyone with time on the cross of bureaucracy,
public or private, can fill in the rest of the story.</p>
<p>Determining value in the absence of pre-existing markets is
pioneering; at the start some trial-and-error groping is to be
expected. It is a problem: let us not fret vainly over the
unavoidable, but solve it. Using the method of taxation, with annual
revision of assessments, limits all errors to one year at a time.
Assessed values for taxation should be adjusted frequently at all
times, and more so under pioneer conditions. That approach is quite
an improvement over the alternative of collecting all the value in a
single sale up front. Under the up- front method, one error is
forever, and the error is made at time zero when data and experience
are minimal.</p>
<p>An excellent method of getting markets started is this. Require
each state agency to designate, say, 5 percent or more of its land
for sale, and set an asking price. The asking price should be the
taxable value of the land until it sells. The asking price should
also be the basis for valuing the agency's other lands, taking
account of differences in quality.</p>
<p>The method is not without flaw: agencies may possibly select their
worst lands to sell, and assessors will lack confidence in their
ability to quantify differences in quality. Administrators should
anticipate those problems, however, and counter by importing some
experienced assessors to help "seed" the system. Neophytes in this
field have no idea how widely values range, and the degree to which
location dominates other influences on value.</p>
<p>Taxing land, and increasing sales to generate assessment data, are
mutually supportive. Get the market started and each boosts the other
in a benign "positive feedback loop." Taxing land motivates sellers
and raises sales; sales provide data to improve and justify tax
assessments.</p>
<p>Conversely, resource markets without motivated sellers are
unworkable, and generate little data to help assess land correctly,
as exemplified in many Third-World nations. Indeed, that is a factor
keeping them in the Third World. Closer to home, however, in
California, water-use licenses also exemplify the point. These
licenses are (with rare exceptions) exempt from the property tax. In
an arid region, densely populated, they are of the highest value.
Over more than a century hardly any major transfers have occurred.
Until recently this viscosity could be attributed to various
institutional obstacles to sales, but five years ago those were
mostly swept away. The Legislature recognized the urgent need for
transfers, accumulated over 150 years or so of rigidity, and paved
the way, so it thought, for a new era of water marketing.</p>
<p>The result, however, has been nil. Water is still not being
transferred, even though its productivity may vary by factors of ten
or more within a few feet across ancient boundaries. Surpluses create
swamps across the street from deserts, yet buyers and sellers are not
coming together. The reason, simply put, is unmotivated sellers.
Those with ancient licenses pay nothing to hold them, but look
forward cozily to higher offers in the future. By not selling we (I
happen to be one) generate no data on which the value of rights might
be assessed. This is the kind of logjam that must be broken to get a
land market working.</p>
<p>I have noted earlier there are cases for tapping rent through a
fixed charge, and through "participation." To unclog a log-jammed
market like that in California water-use licenses, the case for a
fixed charge is overwhelming. Here is a notoriously commercial,
mobile society, where almost everything is for sale, and ordinary
real estate turns over at a good clip. In its midst is one critical
resource, water, that never turns over in spite of crying needs. Why
the difference? Water licenses are exempt from the property tax;
sellers are unmotivated.</p>
<p>Transferring land to private tenure involves several steps:</p>
<p>a. Platting and surveying</p>
<blockquote>Units should be small, to accommodate individual bidders.
Buyers may amass and consolidate small units if they wish; offering
small units simply gives small buyers an equal chance at the start,
cutting out speculative middlemen and providing flexibility.</blockquote>
<p>b. Subdividing</p>
<blockquote>Subdividing land is a key event that controls the layout
and timing of most infrastructure, takes capital, allocates land to
r.o.w., and permanently stamps settlement patterns. Interactive
decision-making is required between (mostly) private on-site and
(mostly) public "inter-site" sectors. "Inter-site" means on the public
r.o.w. among the parcels, while "interactive" implies mutual learning
and accommodation in a swiftly changing scene. Land taxation gives the
public sector a powerful tool to assure early economic response to
public initiatives, for example the development of private sites
accessed by a new transit line or water system.
  <p>Land taxation does not guarantee that only wise public initatives
will prevail, but it gives public planners an objective guide for
laying out routes and sizing and timing improvements thereon. They
should place improvements where they will generate the most new rent
from the served lands, and locate nothing where it will not thus pay
for itself. The familiar marginal rules of economics should apply to
increments, with planners' bearing in mind that the public works in
question are mostly decreasing-cost facilities where the payoff is in
higher rent rather than variable user-charges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>c. Sizing parcels</p>
<blockquote>Parcels should be sized to maximize unit value (per square
foot, square meter, or whatever small unit be used). Unit value should
be maximized after deducting costs of allocating land to r.o.w.;
improving it; and operating, maintaining and replacing the improvements
over time. Such land planning is a developed art, available for import.
  <p>Privatizing land implies drastically revising infrastructure to
accommodate new patterns of use. In rural areas it calls for supplying
publicly the farm roads and utility lines now supplied internally by
collectives. This revision will absorb a large share of national effort
and capital for years to come. It will also keep alive part of the
public sector: free market capitalism never has operated without help
from a large public and publicly regulated sector.</p>
  <p>Successful capitalism depends on fostering its least conspicuous,
most belittled members, the small, independent firms, from the "Mom and
Pop" operations on up. These can only thrive when functions of huge
optimal scale, like supplying water and power, are separated from basic
on-site land uses, and provided impartially to all. Small parcels of
land must have access to transport and utilities on the same terms as
large ones, without discrimination. In this way, and with a fluid land
market, the optimal size of parcel will turn out to be much smaller
than conventional wisdom today imagines.</p>
  <p>Early infrastructure initiatives should be low-cost and as
flexible as possible, with no thought of building for the ages. Private
entrepreneurs often behave in ways planners never expect, the more so
if the planners lack prior experience in the private sector. There is
no surplus capital to waste on durable facilities people will not use
fully over their planned lives. Experience and mutual understanding
must be gained before anyone dreams of stamping eternal patterns on
land use.</p>
  <p>Interactive development planning is a messy, ongoing process one
must experience to understand. The somewhat anarchic American process
may be too alien to Soviet cultural patterns to import whole. Japanese
success importing Western ideas comes to mind: they did not just
import, they Japanized. Each nation will be great in its own way. It
would be surprising if Soviet nations did not improve on imported
American models.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>d. Recording titles and deeds</p>
<blockquote>All deeds and all consideration upon sale should be public
information, and publicized pro-actively. Summary information,
standardized to a unit-area basis, should be mapped, in a form easily
understood by normal literate persons. The maps should be posted and/or
distributed. A Bureau of Land Statistics should be formed and funded to
monitor, analyze and publish these data regularly.
  <p>Payments should be made only in cash, through a public (or audited
private) escrow. Penalty for violation should be severe and mandatory.
No unrecorded contract should be enforceable. This is the occasion to
record public servitudes, announcing and repeating the public claim on
ground rent.</p>
  <p>All debts secured by capital affixed to land should be recorded,
and be unenforceable otherwise. Every recording should explicitly state
that the private debt is subordinate to the public right to ground
rent. Land itself should not be pledged by private parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="VI. Summary and Conclusion"></a><b>VI. Summary and
Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Privatizing property and freeing markets in Soviet nations should
not be imitative but integrative, synthesizing a new economy from the
best of capitalism and socialism. The centerpiece of policy proposed
here is social collection of land rent to finance government. Selling
land quickly without reserving tax power is rejected as being
financially disastrous and politically abject and submissive to alien
buyers. The policy of taxing land in perpetuity is shown to make land
markets work better.</p>
<p>The ethical reason for taxing land rent on an ongoing basis is the
confident expectation of the unexpected, sure to cause future
windfalls and wipeouts. In addition someone must pay for future
infrastructure which raises rent on the lands served. The political
reason for taxing and distributing land rent is to unify the nation
by giving economic substance to citizenship.</p>
<p>Leasing and taxation are compared, and taxation chosen as the
superior way to socialize land rent. Annual revaluation for tax
purposes is the key difference.</p>
<p>Fixed assessment is contrasted with participatory taxation of
rent. The verdict is mixed, but on balance fixed assessment seems
more practical, and socially beneficial. Schemes to offset the
diluted incentives and moral hazards inherent in participation are
too Byzantine to command our conviction. Fixed cash payments based on
assessed land values have the advantage of stirring up the land
market, which otherwise tends toward monopoly and torpidity. A
supplemental tax on land gains is recommended to "mop up" excess rent
that escapes the basic annual tax based on assessed value.</p>
<p>Non-standard resources require attention by specialists to adapt
basic tax principles to their idiosyncracies. For exhaustible
resources there should be a combined charge with two elements, fixed
and variable.</p>
<p>Banking must be modified to extend loans without using land value
as collateral. Ample precedents and experience are available for
lending on other bases. The favorable result will be channeling funds
more on the basis of productivity, and less on the basis of
collateral than is the current practice. The macro-economic flow of
funds will become much more stable, with no more S&amp;L
scandals.</p>
<p>Public credit must be safeguarded to be sure tax revenues are
spent for the benefit of citizens and the local economy, instead of
for foreign creditors. It is suggested that a substantial revenue be
earmarked for social dividends, and given constitutional priority
over debt service. Let debt service always be strictly subordinated
to citizens' rights.</p>
<p>To start up the market, moving holdouts is the key, turning them
into motivated sellers. The case is overwhelming for imposing a fixed
annual charge based on value. Lands held by state enterprises and
agencies should be assessed and taxed. Agencies should be required to
prime the market by offering a portion of their lands for sale, and
be assessed on the asking price. There is a positive feedback loop
between sales and assessments used for setting land taxes; one good
crank starts the motor.</p>
<p>Attention is needed to techniques and principles of dividing land
into small parcels and serving them with utilities. Platting and
surveying, subdividing and sizing parcels are more than specialized
land-use decisions: they determine the viability of a market economy
by fostering small, independent firms on which competition and
dynamism depend.</p>
<p>Recording deeds and titles should be more than perfunctory and
ministerial. Data thus gathered should be analyzed and published to
keep the public aware of and participative in the system.</p>
<p>Advice is easier to give than take. We sympathize with our Soviet
colleagues in their travails, we envy them the adventure of building
a new society or societies, and we admire their courage. We wish them
shining success to inspire us and every nation, as we hope our
achievements may inspire them.</p>
