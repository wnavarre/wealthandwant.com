Neoclassical economics is the idiom of most economic discourse
today. It is the paradigm that bends the twigs of young minds and
confines the florescence of older ones, like mesh wire around a
topiary. It took form a century ago, when Henry George and his reform
proposals were a clear and present political danger and challenge to
the landed and intellectual establishments of the world. Few people
realize to what a degree the founders of Neoclassical economics
changed the discipline for the express purpose of deflecting George,
discomfiting his followers, and frustrating future students seeking
to follow his arguments. The stratagem was semantic: to destroy the
very words in which he expressed himself. Simon Patten expounded it
succinctly. "Nothing pleases a ...
single taxer better than ... to use the well-known economic theories
... [therefore] economic doctrine must be recast" (Patten
1908, p.219; Collier, 1979, p.270).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small>
<p>George believed economists were recasting the discipline to refute
him. He states so, as though in the third person, in his last book,
<b><i>The Science of Political Economy</i></b> (George, 1898,
pp.200-209). George's self-importance was immodest, it is true.
However, immodesty may be objectivity, as many great talents from
Frank Lloyd Wright to Muhammed Ali and Frank Sinatra have displayed.
George had good reasons, which we are to demonstrate. George's view
may even strike some as paranoid. That was this writer's first
impression, many years ago. I have changed my view, however, after
learning more about the period, the literature, and later events.</p>
<p>Having taken shape in the 1880-1890s, <b>Neo-Classical Economics
(henceforth NCE)</b> remained remarkably static. Major texts by
Marshall, Seligman, and Richard T. Ely, written in the 1890s, went
through many reprintings each over a period of 40 years with few if
any changes. "It was for the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle (1884) that I wrote the first edition of my <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Outlines</span>, under
the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction to Political
Economy</span>. In this first edition of
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlines </span>there is to be
found the general philosophy and
principles that have shaped all future editions, including that of
1937" (Ely, 1938, p.81).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small></p>
<p>Not until 1936 was there another major "revolution," and that was
hived off into a separate compartment, macro-economics, and contained
there so as not to disturb basic tenets of NCE. Compartmentalization,
we will see in several instances, is the common NCE defense against
discordant data and reasoning. After that came another 40 years of
Samuelson's "neoclassical synthesis." J.B. Clark's treatment of rent,
dating originally from his obvious efforts to refute Henry George
(see below), "has been followed by an admiring Paul Samuelson in all
of the many editions of his Economics" (Dewey, p.430).</p>
<p>Clark's capital theory "... gives the appearance of being
specially tailored to lead to arguments for use against George"
(Collier, 1979, p.270). "The probable source from which immediate
stimulation came to Clark was the contemporary single tax discussion"
(Fetter, 1927, p.142). "To date, capital theory in the Clark
tradition has provided the basis for virtually all empirical work on
wealth and income" (Dewey, 1987, p.429; cf. Tobin, 1985). Later
writers have added fretworks, curlicues and arabesques beyond
counting, and achieved more isolation from history, and from the
ground under their feet, than in Patten's dreams, but all without
disturbing the basic strategy arrived at by 1899, tailored to lead to
arguments against Henry George.</p>
<p>To most modern readers, probably George seems too minor a figure
to have warranted such an extreme reaction. This impression is a
measure of the neo-classicals' success: it is what they sought to
make of him. It took a generation, but by 1930 they had succeeded in
reducing him in the public mind. In the process of succeeding,
however, they emasculated the discipline, impoverished economic
thought, muddled the minds of countless students, rationalized
free-riding by landowners, took dignity from labor, rationalized
chronic unemployment, hobbled us with today's counterproductive tax
tangle, marginalized the obvious alternative system of public
finance, shattered our sense of community, subverted a rising
economic democracy for the benefit of rent-takers, and led us into
becoming an increasingly nasty and dangerously divided
plutocracy.</p>
<p>The present paper purports to identify the elements of
<b>Neo-Classical Economics (NCE)</b> that were planted there to sap
and confound George, and show how they continue to warp, debase and
vitiate much of the discipline called economics. Once a paradigm is
well-ensconced it becomes a power in itself, a set of reflexes to
sort the true and false. Any exception spoils the web of
interpretation through which art seeks to make human experience
intelligible. Only the young, the brave, the energetic, the sincere
and the skeptical can break off such fetters. This work is addressed
and dedicated to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="I. The Imperative to Put Down H"></a><b>I. The Imperative
to Put Down Henry George</b></p>
<p><b><a name="&nbsp;I-A. The crabbed spirit of neo"></a>&nbsp;I-A. The
crabbed spirit of neo-classical economics</b></p>
<p>Neo-classical economics makes an ideal of "choice." That sounds
good, and liberating, and positive. In practice, however, it has
become a new dismal science, a science of choice where most of the
choices are bad. "TANSTAAFL"
(<a name="There Ain't No Such Thing As A"></a>There Ain't No Such
Thing As A Free Lunch) is the slogan and shibboleth. Whatever you
want, you must give up something good. As an overtone there is even a
hint that what one person gains he must take from another. The theory
of gains from trade has it otherwise, but that is a heritage from the
older classical economists. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Henry George, in contrast, had a genius for
reconciling-by-synthesizing. Reconciling is far better than merely
compromising. He had a way of taking two problems and composing them
into one solution, as we lay out in detail infra. He took two polar
philosophies, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">collectivism </span>and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">individualism</span>, and
synthesized a plan
to combine the better features, and discard the worse features, of
each. He was a problem-solver, who did not suffer incapacitating
dilemmas and standoffs.</p>
<p>As policy-makers, neo-classical economists present us with
"choices" that are too often hard dilemmas. They are in the tradition
of Parson Malthus, who preached to the poor that they must choose
between sex or food. That was getting right down to grim basics, and
is the origin of a well-earned epithet, "the dismal science." Most
modern neo-classicals are more subtle (although the fascist wing of
the otherwise admirable ecology movement gets progressively less so).
Here are some dismal dilemmas that neo-classicals pose for us today.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For efficiency we must sacrifice equity;  </li>
  <li>to attract business we must
lower taxes so much as to shut the libraries and starve the schools;</li>
  <li>to prevent inflation we must keep an army of unfortunates
unemployed;  </li>
  <li>to make jobs we must chew up land and pollute the world;  </li>
  <li>to motivate
workers we must have unequal wealth;  </li>
  <li>to raise productivity we must
fire people; and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neo-classical approach is the "trade-off." A trade-off is a
compromise. That has a ring of reasonableness to it, but it presumes
a zero-sum condition. At the level of public policy, such
"trade-offs" turn into paralyzing stand-offs, where no one gets
nearly what he wants, or could get. It overlooks the possibility of a
<span style="font-style: italic;">reconciliation</span>, or synthesis,
instead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In such a resolution, we are
not limited by trade-offs between fixed A and B: we get more of
both.</span></p>
<p><b>I-B. <a name="Popular responsiveness to probl"></a>Popular
responsiveness to problem-solvers</b></p>
<p>Voters faced with two candidates, each coached by a neo-classical
economist, also face a hard choice. They often appear apathetic and
take a third choice, staying home. However, history denies that
voters are intrinsically apathetic. They have gotten turned on by
candidates who try to lead up and away from dismal trade-offs.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1980 it was Ronald Reagan. Instead of the dismal Phillips Curve
("choose inflation or unemployment") he offered the happy
<a name="Laffer Curve"></a>Laffer Curve: lower tax rates would lead
to higher supplies, higher revenues, and lower deficits, he promised.
Lowering taxes, said Laffer, would eliminate the "wedge effect."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> He
often cited Henry George in support of his position.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> Thus
he would
unleash supply, and collect more taxes while applying lower tax
rates. The voters were sick of 2nd-generation Keynesians who had been
reduced to preaching austerity, so they were game (if not wise) to
buy into Reaganomics as advertised.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Laffer Curve turned out to be wildly
overoptimistic, and Reaganomics partly fraudulent and hypocritical<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5</span></small>
in application. The voters again tuned out and seemed apathetic. They
are not saying, however, they don't care. They are saying "come back
when you have something better, mean what you say, and deliver what
you promise." &nbsp;</p>
<p>From 1936-70 it was Keynes and his apostles, who had a long run
with the voters, in spite of virulent critics. Keynes' winning
political formula was that consumption and capital formation are not
alternatives to be traded off, but complements, reinforcing one
another. Raise wages, he said, raise private and public consumer
spending, and get more capital formation as a happy by-product. "We
can have it all," he said; they called it "the economics of
abundance." Who wouldn't prefer that to long-faced moralizers
preaching we must suffer for the prodigalities of the past, or for
the sake of a remote and uncertain future? Even puritans learned
better as children from Longfellow's "Psalm of Life."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6</span></small> &nbsp;</p>
When the theory of the propensity to consume, and the
multiplier,
lost their charm, and some strong trade unions (like Hoffa's
Teamsters) showed their nastier side, the American voters tuned in to
JFK and "business Keynesianism" in which the emphasis turned to
fostering new investing. Keynes had been shrewd enough to cast his
theories to accommodate either emphasis. Here the formula was to
raise the "marginal efficiency of capital" (today we say the marginal
rate of return) after taxes by giving preferential tax treatment to
new investing, keeping tax rates high on income from old assets like
land. It was a species of Georgism, applied via the Federal income
tax.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7 </span></small>The
key devices were fast write off for new capital, and the
investment tax credit. There was no talk or thought, however, of
enriching capitalists by
impoverishing workers. The promise was to enrich capitalists and
workers together, as higher investing raised aggregate demand for
labor and its products through the "multiplier" effect.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In time that happy glow of mutuality turned to ashes. After
JFK,
with his influential economist Walter Heller, the flame burned low;
later leaders stumbled in the dark. They relied too simple-mindedly
on demand management through fiscal and monetary policy, carrying
them well beyond their power to stimulate supply. Thus they lurched
into Stagflation: double-digit inflation and recession conjoined.
They blamed the war, then the Arabs. They scolded the public, and they
called for sacrifices, as
leaders always do when they lack ideas. "You must mature and face the
facts of life," they lectured. "There is no way to stop inflation
except unemployment. Whichever evil you choose, don't blame us, we
told you so."<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">8</span></small>
Faced with that, the voters exercised a third choice:
they retired the patrons of those new dismal scientists. &nbsp;
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Before Keynes there was another great
reconciler, Henry George. In
1879, George electrified the world by identifying a cause of the
boom/slump cycle, identifying a cause of inadequate demand for labor,
and, best of all, following through with a plausible, practicable
remedy. Like Keynes and Laffer after him, he turned people on by
saying "Forget the bitter trade-offs; we can have it all." &nbsp;</p>
<p>George came out of a raw, naive new colony, California, as a
scrappy marginal journalist. Yet his ideas exploded through the
sophisticated metropolitan world as though into a vacuum. His book
sales were in the millions. Seven short years after publishing
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b> in remote California he nearly
took over as Mayor of New York City, the financial and intellectual
capital of the nation. He thumped also-ran Theodore Roosevelt, and
lost to the Tammany candidate (Abram S. Hewitt) only by being counted
out (Barker, pp.480-81; Myers, pp.356-58; Miller, p.11). Three more
years and he was a major influence in sophisticated Britain. In 1889,
incredibly, he became "adviser and field-general in land reform
strategy" to the Radical wing of the Liberal Party in Britain, where
he was not even a citizen. "It was inevitable that, when (Joseph)
Chamberlain bowed out, George should become the Radical philosopher"
(Lawrence, pp.105-06). It also happened that when Chamberlain bowed
out, the Radical wing became the Liberal Party. It adopted a land-tax
plank after 1891 (The "famous Newcastle Programme"), and came to
carry George's (muted) policies forward under successive Liberal
Governments of Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith, and Lloyd George.</p>
<p>How could a marginal man come out of nowhere and make such an
impact? The economic gurus of the day, even as today, were in a
scolding mode, blaming unemployment on faulty character traits and
genes, and demanding austerity. They were not intellectually armed to
refute him or befuddle his listeners. He had studied the classical
economists, and used their tools to dissect the system. Neo-classical
economics arose in part to fill the void, to squeeze out such radical
notions, and be sure nothing like the Georgist phenomenon could
recur. &nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Again, are we not imputing too
much
weight to a minor figure? We
are told that Georgism withered away quietly with its founder in
1897.</span><small style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">9</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> That, however, is warped history. One of
the great
derelictions of American historians is to have neglected the
single-tax movement, 1901-24. It is also a warped view of "The Single
Tax" as a discrete, millenial change, a quantum leap away from life
as we know it</span> (Gaffney, 1976). Pure Georgism never "took over
whole hog," but no single
philosophy ever does. Modified Georgism, melded into the Progressive
Movement, helped run the U.S.A. for 17 years, 1902-19, working
through <span style="font-style: italic;">both </span>major political
parties.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10</span></small>
At the local level, it
continued on through the early 1920s. Local property taxation was
modified on Georgist lines even as it rose in absolute terms. The
first Federal income tax law was drafted by a Georgist (Congressman
Warren Worth Bailey of Johnstown, Pennsylvania) with Georgist goals
uppermost.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11</span></small>
Real concessions were made: the politicians heard the
voters. Historians of the Populist Party and movement often note that
its ideas succeeded even though the Party failed, because its ideas
were coopted by major parties. Georgism was a strand of American
populism, later wrapped into Progressivism.
<p>Consider, for example, that in 1913 Wm. S. U'Ren, "Father of the
Initiative and Referendum," created this system of direct democracy
for the express purpose of pushing single-tax initiatives in Oregon.
According to U'Ren, another by-product of the single-tax campaigns in
Oregon was the 1910 "adoption of the first Presidential Primary Law,
which was quickly imitated by so many other States that (Woodrow)
Wilson's nomination and election over Taft was made possible" (U'Ren,
p.43). To that we may add that another "Father of the Direct
Primary," George L. Record of New Jersey, was a mentor of Woodrow
Wilson and an earnest Georgist who had gotten railroad lands uptaxed
to the great benefit of public schools in New Jersey, and to the
impoverishment of special interest election funds. "... it was the
passage of these great election reforms in the Wilson Administration
(in New Jersey) that led ... (to) winning the Bryan support and the
Democratic nomination for President" (Blauvelt, p.28). That helps
explain the gratitude of President Wilson, who included single-taxers
in his Cabinet (Newton D. Baker, Louis F. Post, Franklin K. Lane, and
William B. Wilson), and worked with single-tax Congressmen like Henry
George, Jr., and Warren Worth Bailey (Geiger, 1933, p.464;
Brownlee).</p>
<p>Consider that in 1916 a "pure single-tax" initiative, led by <a href="North_SotGA.htm">Luke
North</a>, won 31% of the votes in California (Large Landholdings, 1919;
Miller, p.51; Geiger, 1933, p.433; Young, p.232). Even while
"losing," such campaigns raised consciousness of the issue to a high
degree, such that assessors were focusing more attention on land.
Thus, in California, 1917, tax valuers focused on land value so much
that it constituted 72% of the assessment roll for property taxation
(Troy, 1917b, p.398) -- a much higher fraction than today. <a
 href="Fels.html">Joseph
Fels</a>, an idealistic manufacturer, was throwing millions into such
campaigns in several states (Young; Miller), having earlier thrown
himself and his fortune into the English land tax campaign that
brought on the Parliamentary revolution of 1909 (Fels, 1919,
1940).</p>
<p>Consider that there was a single-tax party, the Commonwealth land
Party. In 1924 its Presidential candidate was
William J. Wallace of New Jersey, with <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Lincoln.html">John C.
Lincoln</a>, brilliant
Cleveland industrialist, for Vice-president (Moley, p.162).&nbsp; In
1919 Georgists began working through the Manufacturers and
Merchants Federal Tax League to sponsor a <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">federal </span>land
tax, the
Ralston-Nolan Bill. Drafted by Judge Jackson H. Ralston, it would
impose a "1% excise tax on the privilege of holding lands, natural
resources and public franchises valued at more than $10,000, after
deducting all improvements" (Jorgensen, pp.8-9).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">12</span></small> In
1924 Congressman
Oscar E. Keller of Minnesota reintroduced it (H.R. 5733). In spite of
Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, Progressivism still lived in Congress.
In 1923, for the first and last time, income tax returns were made
public, giving valuable data-ammunition to land taxers. Progressivism
also lived in Wisconsin, where Professor John R. Commons in 1921
drafted the Grimstad Bill to focus the property tax on bare land
values (Commons, 1922). Commons believed that 95% of "millionaire
fortunes" consisted of land and franchise values (1903, p.253). Young
State Assemblyman (later Professor) Harold Groves was among its
supporters.

<p>Consider that in 1934 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Upton
Sinclair</span>, so-called "socialist,"
almost became Governor of California on a modified Georgist platform.
Two years later, Jackson H. Ralston, by then a Stanford Law
Professor, led another California Initiative campaign to focus the
property tax on land values. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Norman
Thomas</span>, perennial Socialist
candidate for President of the U.S., kept a land tax plank in his
platform. Daniel Hoan, the "socialist" Mayor of America's model city,
Milwaukee, had his tax assessor focus on upvaluing land. Hoan
distributed land value maps to the Milwaukee public, to raise their
consciousness of the issue.</p>
<p>Historian <a href="../themes/About_HG.html">Eric Goldman</a> (1956) found
George to have inspired most of the major reformers of the early 20th
Century. "... no other book came anywhere near comparable influence,
and I would like to add this word of tribute to a volume which
magically catalyzed the best yearnings of our grandfathers and
fathers" (Goldman, 1979). Raymond Moley wrote, " ... George ...
touched almost all of the corrective influences which were the result
of the Progressive movement. The restriction of monopoly, more
democratic political machinery, municipal reform, the elimination of
privilege in railroads, the regulation of public utilities, and the
improvement of labor laws and working conditions -- all were ...
accelerated by George" (1962, p.160).</p>
<p>Consider that most American states and Canadian provinces required
separate valuations of land, for tax purposes. Professional valuers,
responding to the general interest, were routinely valuing land
separately from buildings, and developing workable techniques to
handle the occasional tricky case (Zangerle, Pollock and Scholz,
Purdy, Babcock, Somers, et al.)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">13</span></small>Valuation
anticipates taxation.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span></small>
Lawson Purdy, one of those valuers, was Tax Commissioner of the City
of New York, a founder of and power in the National Tax Association,
a campaigner for George in the 1897 race, and a leader of the
Manhattan Single Tax Club. Under this kind of influence, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">New York
City kept its subway fares down to 5 cents, paying for most of the
cost from taxes on the benefitted lands </span>(Trott, 1956, p.1). It
also
exempted new residential structures from the property tax for ten
years, 1924-34 (Jorgensen, p.159-62).</p>
<p>Consider that Wright Act Irrigation Districts were spreading fast
throughout rural California, using Georgist land taxes to finance
irrigation works. The Wright Act dated from 1887, and sputtered along
fitfully until in 1909 the California Legislature amended the
enabling legislation to limit the assessment in all new districts to
the land value only. It also let old districts do so by local option
(Cal. Stat. 1909, p.461). The old districts soon did: Modesto in
1911, Turlock in 1915 (Troy, 1917a; Mason, 1942, p.393; Mason,
1957-58; Jorgensen, pp. 168-69; Henley 1969, p.141; Gaffney, 1969;
Ralston, pp. 161-63; Geiger, 1933, p.439). This was Georgism getting
its "second wind," so to speak. Beyond much question, the idea was
identified with George. The legislative leader, L.L. Dennett of
Modesto, got the idea from his father, an old neighbor of Henry
George in San Fancisco (Dennett, 1916a,b; Mason, 1957-58, pp.106-08).
In Modesto and Turlock, "The campaign was conducted on pure Single
Tax lines" (Troy, 1917a, p.54).</p>
<p>In 1917, rural Georgism got a third wind: the California
Legislature made it mandatory for all Districts to exempt
improvements (Stat. 1917, p.764, codified Stats. 1943, Ch. 368, Div.
10,11 [California Water Code]; Mason, 1949, pp.2,6; Gaffney,
1969). They then grew to include over four million acres by 1927, and
to dominate American agriculture in their specialty crops. They built
the highest dam in the world at that time (Don Pedro, on the Tuolumne
River in the Sierra Nevada), financing it 100% from local land taxes.
Albert Henley, a lawyer who crafted the modified District that serves
metropolitan San Jose, evaluated them thus:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The discovery of the
legal formula of these organizations was of infinitely greater value
to California than the discovery of gold a generation before. They
are an extraordinarily potent engine for the creation of wealth"
(Henley, 1957, p.665, 667; 1969, p.140).</div>
<p>They catapulted California into being the top-producing farm state
in the Union, using land that was previously desert or range. They
made California a generator of farm jobs and homes, while other
states were destroying them by<a name="latifundiazation"></a> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">latifundiazation</span>.</p>
<p>If this is a "minor"
phenomenon it is because the neglect of historians and economists has
made it so. One searches in vain through academic books and journals
on farm economics for recognition of this, the most spectacularly
successful story of farm economic development in history. What
references there are consist of precautionary cluckings focused on
attendant errors and failures. "Economic development" theorists
neglect it altogether, as though California's commercial farming had
sprung full blown from a corporate office, with no grass roots basis,
and no development period. It is as though the clerisy were in
conspiracy against the <span style="font-style: italic;">demos</span>,
under some Trappist oath against
disclosing what groups of small people achieved through community
action, and through the judicious application of the pro-incentive
power of taxing land values.</p>
<p>There is a common defeatist notion that "<a name="farmers"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">farmers</span>" are implacably
against land taxation. The California experience seems to belie it.
In other states, also, The Grange and the Farmers' Union were pushing
for focusing the property tax on land during the 'teens (Hampton). In
Minnesota, the Dakotas, and the Prairie Provinces the Non-Partisan
League became a major power in state and local politics, electing a
Governor of North Dakota and swaying many elections. North Dakota
exempted farm capital from the county property tax, taxing land
only.@ The spirit of Prairie Populism straddled the 49th parallel
(the international boundary), radicalizing politics in rural
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, all of which
were focusing their property taxes on land in this period. It would
seem that J.B. Clark's allusions to "agrarian socialism" had some
basis in fact - he had spent some years in Northfield, Minnesota, in
the heart of it. Clark just gave it the wrong name. One could go on:
those are just straws in the wind.</p>
<p>George's ideas were carried worldwide by such towering figures as
<span style="font-weight: bold;">David Lloyd George</span> in England, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Leo Tolstoy</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Alexandr Kerensky</span> in
Russia, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sun Yat-sen</span> in China,
hundreds of local and state, and a few
powerful national politicians in both Canada and the U.S.A., <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Billy
Hughes</span> in Australia, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rolland
O'Regan</span> in New Zealand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chaim
Weizmann</span>
in Palestine, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Francisco Madero</span>
in Mexico, and many others in Denmark,
South Africa, and around the world. In England, Lloyd George's budget
speech of 1909 reads in part as though written by Henry George
himself. Some of Winston Churchill's speeches were written by
Georgist ghosts.</p>
<p>Thus, to the rent-taker, the typical college trustee or regent,
George's ideas remained a real and present danger over several
decades: the very decades when neo-classical economics was spreading
through the academic clerisy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small> With
the development of direct
democracy, open primaries, the secret ballot, direct election of U.S.
Senators, the Initiative, Referendum, and Recall, and the like, crude
vote-buying such as prevailed in the late 19th Century would no
longer dominate the electorate. Mind-control became the urgent need;
NCE was the tool. &nbsp;</p>
<p>George's ideas and the allied Progressive Movement fell, not from
failure to deliver, but to the Great Marathon Red Scare that has
dominated much of the world from 1919 to 1989. This panic marshalled
and energized rent-takers everywhere; by confusion, some of it
deliberate, its victims included Georgists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small> It
inhibited them until
their message lost its vigor and excitement and became just a minor
local tax reform. Its leaders have moved to the trivial center,
downplaying George's grand goals for full employment, catering to the
practical but small and prosaic advantages of median homeowners at
the local level. Now, with the fall of the Berlin Wall, Progressive
ideas might very well pick up again where the original Movement was
aborted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>II.<a name="Henry George as reconciler and"></a> Henry
George as reconciler and problem-solver</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;Let us itemize the several constructive reconciliations in
George's reform proposal. This will explain its wide potential
appeal, hence its ongoing threat to embedded rent-takers with a stake
in unearned wealth. It will explain why they had neo-classical
economists working so hard to put this genie back in the bottle.
&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><a name="1. George reconciled common lan"></a><b>1. George
reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free markets, and
modern capitalism.</b> He would compensate those dispossessed and made
landless by the spread and strengthening of what is now called
"European" land tenure, whose benefits he took as given and obvious. He
would also compensate those driven out of business by the triumph of
economies of scale, whose power he acknowledged and even overestimated.
He proposed doing so through the tax system, by focusing taxes on the
economic rent of land. This would compensate the dispossessed in three
ways. &nbsp;
  <blockquote>a. <b>Those who got the upper hand by securing land
tenures would support public services, so wages and commerce and
capital formation could go untaxed</b>.
<p>b. <b>To pay the taxes, landowners would have to use the land
by hiring workers (or selling to owner-operators and owner-residents)</b>.
This would raise demand for labor; labor spending would raise demand
for final products.</p>
    <p>c. <b>To pay the workers, landowners would have to produce and
sell goods, raising supply and precluding inflation</b>. Needed capital
would come to their aid by virtue of its being untaxed.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thus, George would cut the Gordian knot of modern dilemma-bound
economics by raising demand, raising supply, raising incentives,
improving equity, freeing up the market, supporting government,
fostering capital formation, and paying public debts, all in one simple
stroke. It's quite a stroke, enough to leave one breathless.</p>
  <p>In practice, landowners faced with high land taxes often choose
another, even better, course than hiring more workers: they sell the
land to the workers, creating an economy and society of small
entrepreneurs. This writer has documented a strong relationship between
high property tax rates, deconcentration of farmland, and intensity of
land use (Gaffney, 1992).</p>
  <p><a name="2. George's proposal lets us lo"></a><b>2. George's
proposal lets us lower taxes on labor without raising taxes on capital.
  </b>Indeed, it lets us lower taxes on both labor and capital at once,
and without lowering public revenues.</p>
  <p><a name="3. Georgist tax policy reconcil"></a><b>3. Georgist tax
policy reconciles equity and efficiency.</b> Taxing land is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">progressive </span>because the ownership
of land is so highly concentrated among the most wealthy,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">18</span></small> and
because the tax may not be shifted. It is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">efficient</span> because it is neutral
among rival land-use options: the tax is fixed, regardless of land use.
This is one favorable point on which many modern economists actually
agree, although they keep struggling against it, as we will see.</p>
  <p>George showed that a tax can be progressive and pro-incentive at
the same time. Think of it! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">An
army of neo-classicalists preach dourly we must sacrifice equity and
social justice on the altar of "efficiency."</span> They need that
thought to stifle the demand for social justice that runs like a thread
through The Bible, The Koran, and other great religious works. George
cut that Gordian knot, and so he had to be put down. &nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The only shifting of a
land tax is negative. By negative shifting I mean that the supply-side
effects of taxing land will raise supplies of goods and services, and
raise the demand for labor, thus raising the bargaining power of median
people in the marketplace, both as consumers and workers. </span>This
effect makes the tax doubly progressive: it undercuts the holdout power
and bargaining power of landowners vis-a-vis workers, and also vis-a-
vis new investors in real capital. This effect also makes the land tax
doubly efficient.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a name="4. A state, provincial, or loca"></a><b>4. A state,
provincial, or local government can finance generous public services
without driving away business or population</b>. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The formula is simple: tax land,
which cannot migrate, instead of capital and people, which can.</span>
By eliminating the destructive "Wedge Effect," the land tax lets us
support schools and parks and libraries and water purification and
police and fire protection, etc., as generously as you please, without
suppressing or distorting useful work, and without taxing investors in
real capital.</p>
  <p><a name="5. Georgist tax policy contains"></a><b>5. Georgist tax
policy contains urban sprawl, and its heavy associated costs, without
overriding market decisions or consumer preferences, simply by making
the market work better.</b> Land values are the product of demand for
location; they are marked by continuity in space. That shows quite
simply that people demand compact settlement and centrality. A
well-oiled land market will give it to them.</p>
  <p><a name="6. Georgist tax policy makes jo"></a><b>6. Georgist tax
policy makes jobs without inflation, and without deficits.</b> "Fiscal
stimulus," in the shallow modern usage, is a euphemism for running
deficits, often with funny money. George's proposed land tax might be
called, rather, "<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">true fiscal
stimulus</span>." <span style="font-weight: bold;">It stimulates
demand for labor by promoting employment; it precludes inflation as the
labor produces goods to match the new demand. It precludes deficits
because it raises revenue. That is its peculiar reconciliatory genius:
it stimulates private work and investing in the very process of raising
revenue</span>. It is the only tax of any serious revenue potential
that does not bear down on and suppress production and exchange. As I
said, George takes two problems and composes them into one solution.
&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a name="7. George's land tax lets a pol"></a><b>7. George's land
tax lets a polity attract people and capital en masse, without diluting
its resource base.</b> This is by virtue of synergy, the ultimate
rationale for Chamber-of-Commerce boosterism. Urban economists like
William Alonso have illustrated the power of such synergy by showing
that bigger cities have more land value <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">per head </span>than
smaller ones. (<span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Land value is
the resource base of a city.</span>) Urbanists like Jane Jacobs and
Holly Whyte have written on the intimate details of how this works on
the streets. Julian Simon (<span style="font-style: italic;">The
Ultimate Resource</span>) philosophizes on the power of creative
thought generated when people associate freely and closely in large
numbers. Henry George made the same points in 1879.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20 </span></small>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><a name="8. Georgist policies let us con"></a><b>8. Georgist
policies encourage the conservation of ecology and environment while
also making jobs, by abating sprawl. </b>It is a matter of focusing
human activity on the good lands, thus meeting demands there and
relieving pressure to invade lands now wild that are marginal for human
needs. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Urban
sprawl is the kind of sprawl most publicized, but there is analogous
sprawl in agriculture, forestry, mining, recreation, and other land
uses and industries.</span></p>
  <p><a name="9. Georgist policies let us str"></a><b>9. Georgist
policies let us strengthen public revenues while in the same process
promoting economy in government. </b>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>Anti-governmentalists often identify any tax policy with public
extravagance. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Georgist tax
policy, on the contrary, saves public funds in many ways.</span>  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>By making jobs it lowers welfare costs, unemployment
compensation, doles, aid to families with dependent children, and all
that.    </li>
    <li>It lowers jail and police costs, and all the enormous private
expenditures, precautions, and deprivations now taken to guard against
theft and other crime. Idle hands are not just wasted, they steal and
destroy.&nbsp;    </li>
    <li>Ultimately, Georgist policy saves the cost of civil
disturbances and insurrections, and/or the cost of putting them down.
In 1992 large parts of Los Angeles were torched, for the second time in
a generation, pretty much as foreboded by Henry George in <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span></a>, Book X.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small>
Forestalling such colossal waste and barbarism is much more than merely
a "free lunch."</li>
  </ul>
George's program would abort other, less obvious wastes in government.
It obviates much of the huge public cost now incurred to reach,
develop, and safeguard lands that should be left in their natural
submarginal condition. 
  <ul>
    <li>Today, people occupy flood plains and require levees, flood
control dams, and periodic rescue and recovery spending.    </li>
    <li>Others scatter their homes through highly flammable steep
brushlands calling for expensive fire-fighting equipment and personnel,
and raising everyone's fire insurance premiums.    </li>
    <li>Others build on fault lines; still others in the deserts,
calling for expensive water imports.    </li>
    <li>Generically, people now scatter their homes and industries over
hundreds of square miles in the "exurbs," or urban sprawl areas,
imposing huge public costs for linking the scattered pieces with the
center, and with each other. &nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This wasteful, extravagant territorial overexpansion results from
two pressures working togther.  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>One force is that of land speculators.&nbsp; They manipulate
politics by seeking public funds to upgrade their low-grade lands so
they may peddle them at higher prices.    </li>
    <li>The other force is that of landless people, who seek land for
homes and jobs, and public funds for "make-work" projects. &nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Both
these forces wither away when we tax land value and downtax wages and
capital.</span> This moves good land into full use, meeting the demand
for land by using land that is good by Nature, without high development
costs. It also creates legitimate jobs, abating the pressure for
"make-work" spending. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Above all, it
takes the private gain out of upvaluing marginal land at public cost.</span>
Such lands, if upvalued by public spending, will then have to pay for
their own development through higher public revenues.</blockquote>
<p>Those nine compelling features of George's program should be
enough to persuade one that it had the potentiality of becoming very
popular. Its premise, however, was socializing land rents through
taxation. Its very strengths were its undoing, then, for they evoke a
powerful, intransigent, wealthy counterforce.</p>
