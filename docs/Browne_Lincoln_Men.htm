<p align="center"><strong>Abraham Lincoln and the Men of His Time</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Robert Henry Browne, M.D., 1901</strong></p>
<p>This page has extended excerpts from a two-volume book entited <em>Abraham
    Lincoln and the Men of His Time</em>, by Robert Henry Browne, M.D., published
    in 1901. While I approached the books skeptically, I found myself persuaded
    that while Dr.
  Browne was not an academic historian, he did know Lincoln personally, and that
  the relevant quote, which had sent me in search of the source material, could
  be quite reliable. It appears in Volume II, starting on page 89, and seems
  to be set in the early 1850s, quoting Lincoln (pages 89 &amp; 90):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Christ knew better than we that 'No man having put his hand
        to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God;' nor is any
        man doing his duty who shrinks and is faithless to his fellow-men. Now
    a word more about Abolitionists and new ideas in Government, whatever they
        may be: We are all called Abolitionists now who desire any restriction
    of
        slavery or believe that the system is wrong, as I have declared for years.
        We are called so, not to help out a peaceful solution, but in derision,
    to abase us, and enable the defamers to make successful combinations against
        us. I never was much annoyed by these, less now than ever. I favor the
    best
        plan to restrict the extension of slavery peacefully, and fully believe
    that we must reach some plan that will do it, and provide for some method
    of final
        extinction of the evil, before we can have permanent peace on the subject.
        On other questions there is ample room for reform when the time comes;
    but now it would be folly to think that we could undertake more than we have
        on hand.<strong> But when slavery is over with and settled, men should
        never rest content while oppressions, wrongs, and iniquities are in force
        against
    them.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&quot;The land, the earth that God gave to man for his home, his
      sustenance, and support, should never be the possession of any man, corporation,
      society,
        or unfriendly Government, any more than the air or the water, if as much.
        An individual  company or enterprise requiring land should hold
        no more in their own right than is needed for their home and sustenance,
        and never more than they have in actual use in the prudent management
      of their legitimate business, and this much should not be permitted when
      it
        creates an exclusive monopoly. All that is not so used should be held
      for the free use of every family to make homesteads, and to hold them as
      long
        as they are so occupied.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>&quot;A reform like this will be worked out some time in the future.
        The idle talk of foolish men, that is so common now, on 'Abolitionists, agitators,
        and disturbers of the peace,' will find its way against it, with whatever
        force it may possess, and as strongly promoted and carried on as it can be
        by land monopolists, grasping landlords, and the titled and untitled senseless
        enemies of mankind everywhere.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>From Volume II of &quot;Abraham Lincoln and the Men of His Time, by Robert
  H. Browne, M. D. , Copyright 1901, by the Western Methodist Book Concern. Chapter
  XXIX, under the heading in the Table of Contents &quot;His Ideas of Land-ownership
  expressed to Mr. Gridley;&quot; the preceding section was &quot;Lincoln Pre-eminently
  a Reformer&quot; and the following &quot;Some of his Work in saving Farms to
  Settlers.&quot; One can only guess where one ends and the next begins. Starting
  on page 82:</p>
<p>[page 82] &quot;Let every one who really believes, and is resolved that free
  society is not and shall not be a failure, and who can conscientiously declare
  that in the past contest he has done only what he thought best, have charity
  to believe that every one else can say as much. Thus let bygones be bygones:
  let past differences as nothing be: and with steady eye on the real issue,
  let us reinauguate the good old central ideas of the Republic. We can do it.
  The human heart is with us; and, better, God is with us. We shall again be
  able, not to declare that 'all States as States are equal,' nor yet that 'all
  citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better declaration,
  including both these and much more, that 'all men are created free and equal.'&quot;</p>
<p>This was the true Lincoln, in mind, purpose, and character, as he revealed
  himself in his plain and expressive forms of language. He proceeded directly
  to his subject, and, in well-rounded periods, hammered out the groundings of
  his faith, in such forcible and unmistakable speech that no prevarication nor
  misconstruction could fairly becloud or darken it. He was able to contend and
  differ in the consideration of the theories, logic, and polemics of systems
  and the details of government; but this was the higher subject, the rights
  of man, in which every tendency and inclination of his noble nature was wrought
  up to its highest purpose and action.</p>
<p>It was so congenial and all-engaging to him that, with his untiring strength,
  his means of research, and his unflagging devotion to the cause, he became
  the great master of humanity to man and the ablest defender, liberator, and
  prophet of the century. He was a powerful, wise, and discerning man in any
  undertaking, who would have succeeded in many; but it was in behalf of oppressed
  and [p.83] struggling men he exerted himself to his highest capacities, and
  became God's leader among the people.</p>
<p>Whether it was in chopping wood for the widows and helpless about New Salem
  in the severe winters, helping many a hard-working settler save his homestead,
  helping many poor and distressed people in the courts through entanglements
  beyond their means and knowledge, teaching honesty, justice and righteousness
  in his laborious campaigns, or in the use of the resources of our mighty Nation
  in saving the Union and liberating the darker men of our race, he was ever
  and always the same constant and determined friend and defender of the rights
  of his fellow-men. He was so true in this work that those who knew him best
  knew beforehand what would be his relation to any cause or individual in time
  of need.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln could have achieved and won success in many directions, especially
  in fortune-making, and have reached more than ordinary success among so many
  willing and helping friends. However, he steadily declined anything of the
  kind, chiefly because it would have taken his attention from the main purpose
  of his life. His success in his profession, when established, gave him the
  means of comfortable living. He could have won a fortune, as many did about
  him. He was frequently advised by friends to do so, but he always found more
  pressing duty, and declined.</p>
<p>He was a reformer; not one of those who grew angry and filled their minds
  with sharp criticism, severe denunciation, or malice toward those who differed
  with him. He was full of the idea that most men, when properly approached,
  were fair-minded and reasonable. Hence he was of all men the kindest natured,
  most considerate, and respectful with all who were anxious to learn, no matter
  how prejudiced they were. If they were sincere, his patience and good humor
  never failed him. But to the mere captious [page 84] critic or noisy disturber
  he seldom gave attention, unless it provoked him to reply in some withering
  humor that would leave the poor fellow helpless, though generally benefited.</p>
<p>One of these asked him, at the close of an address, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, how
  would you like to have your daughter marry a nigger?&quot; Without apparent
  disturbance, he immediately replied, &quot;My dear sir, it so happens that
  I have not been blessed with a daughter; but under such condition as you state,
  I would expect her to use as much discretion in the matter as yourself, and
  that she would find a great many white men that it would be best to avoid.
  She might, too, if you insisted in pressing your suit, ask you, 'Was your grandfather
  a monkey?'&quot;</p>
<p>On one occasion, some time in 1856, he came into the private room in the rear
  of Mr. Gridley's bank. He laid about one thousand dollars on the table. Taking
  up a part of it, he handed the remainder, about nine hundred and forty dollars,
  to Mr. Gridley, saying &quot;I have collected more than I expected to-day.
  I would take it home with me if I was going there; but I am going to Chicago,
  and will leave it with you for the present.&quot; Mr. Gridley was a true friend
  of Lincoln's, and one of the most anxious that he should be &quot;making more
  money.&quot; So taking the money, very pleasantly he said: &quot;I know of
  a very good quarter section of land in the southwest part of the country. It
  belongs to a non-resident, who is anxious to sell it. It can be had for about
  $1,200, and is worth fully $1,600. It will sell for double that price within
  a year. I will, if you like, invest your sum here mentioned, and take care
  of it for you. I think you will double your money on it in a year, or perhaps
  less. Indeed, I will guarantee that much, if you desire, as you know I have
  several times wished to do as much as this. It will not bother me, and I will
  be glad to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>[page 85] Mr. Lincoln turned uneasily in his chair, and facing Mr. Gridley
  with a pleasant but thoughtful look, replied about as follows: &quot;Mr. Gridley,
  you know that I am deeply grateful for your disposition to favor me, and for
  the many kind and considerate evidences of it, which do not let me forget it,
  were I disposed to do so. I am thankful to you, for I appreciate what you do
  and continue to do for me in so many unselfish ways that no one knows of save
  myself. Nevertheless, I must decline this kind offer of yours that would, no
  doubt, profit me, and harm no one directly, as I view it. I have no maledictions
  or even criticisms of those who honestly buy, sell, and speculate in lands;
  but I do not believe in it, and I feel, for myself, that I should not do it.
  If I made the investment, it would constantly turn my attention to that kind
  of business, and so far disqualify me for what seems to be my calling, and
  success in it, and interfere with the public, or half-public, service, which
  I neither seek nor avoid. So, with a feeling of increased friendship for you,
  I feel that I must be firm in purpose, and not engage in anything that will
  turn my mind from my present and increasing duties in the work I have chosen.</p>
<p>&quot;In my early career I was unfortunate in business, as you know, which
  I now attribute to lack of experience and insufficient needs. I am satisfied
  of that in my own mind, and believe that very men have failed in business in
  our new, developing country because our ambition is so apt to outrun our judgment;
  but, notwithstanding these mishaps, I am confident enough of my own capacity
  to believe that, with the present need and opportunities, especially through
  the help of a man like yourself, whose business sagacity is beyond question,
  I could very well conduct some kinds of business and save money. But for the
  present I am wholly devoted to my work, and do not feel that I could divide
  the time so much needed in it with [page 86] anything else. My work, too, I
  must say, presents itself to me now, which I have no right to avoid.&quot; </p>
<p>Although Mr. Gridley had known Mr. Lincoln well for at least fifteen years,
  and intimately for six or seven, he was completely upset and amazed at Lincoln's
  remarks. He was usually quick-tempered, excitable, and impulsive, and he would
  not have listened contentedly a minute to such statement as Lincoln's from
  any other man; but Lincoln's influence over him was so complete that he sat
  still. He said nothing until Mr. Lincoln finished, when he looked calmly across
  the table at Lincoln's earnest face, and thus addressed him: &quot;Mr. Lincoln,
  you astonish me, indeed you do. I have been keeping along with a great many
  of your advanced ideas and foolish philanthropies, but this surpasses all.
  I don't take your design nor your work as foolish, mind you; it is good, better
  than people deserve. They are all about worshiping some stone or wooden god.
  A great many of them are content with these rich prairie lands of Illinois
  that I've been trying to point out to you are a real Canaan. You'll work and
  strive with the people, and some politician will get the turn on you as Trumbull
  did, and secure the senatorship, and leave you the applause. Really, Mr. Lincoln,
  I believe that you had better be conservative, like me, keep out of politics,
  go into the land business, and make a competency out of corn, cattle, and hogs.
  Let those who will sweat over governorships, senatorships, and judgeships.
  But, besides this, you have more than surprised me about land ownership. Are
  you turning, just at the age when men should be getting wise, to the French
  'Fourierism' &#8212; I believe it is &#8212; or to Emerson's school of air
  and thin soups, a cosmogony or theories attenuated through and beyond the gases
  to a something
  beyond nothing? For neither Frenchman nor Yankee has seen enough of it to give
  it a name or
  tangibility.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not let me annoy or disturb you. I am going to [page 87]  take
  care of that piece of land myself, and some of these days, when we abolish
  slavery, and you are old and worn-out in public service, you shall have that
  identical piece of rich Illinois land to live on, while Emerson and Fourier
  are getting ready to live on unsubstantial things, on an exact, correct theory,
  while we will be living on the fat of these fertile prairies.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln replied: &quot;You are challenging my judgment as to which to
  admire or which to do; whether I must admire your sarcastic humor and unsparing
  analysis, and contend for my side, or forget my own convictions and accept
  your conclusions. You are aware, however, that I cannot avoid my duty, and
  whether I succeed or meet frequent disappointments as I have done, there is
  no man in the State who would require of me a more unflinching devotion to
  that duty than you would. I grant you, that if I should fail to render that
  dutiful service, your friendship is so sincere that you would let it burn in
  your heart and scarcely mention it; but you would know, as few men can, deep
  in your conscience, how Lincoln had failed, while you expected so much better
  of him, and had good reasons for it; and if I accepted this generous offer
  you would not be entirely guiltless.&quot; </p>
<p>Mr. Gridley replied: &quot;You are correct, no doubt, in what seems to be
  a necessity, that no matter what may be the recognition you receive, or what
  remuneration may come to you for all your years of public service, if any;
  nevertheless, I see it just as you say. You can have no divided duty, but must
  diligently pursue the work you have undertaken or give it up altogether. It
  seems strange, after two thousand years of the spread of Christian belief,
  that so little of it is put into practical operation. Men are, as I understand,
  constantly blaming me as greedy and over-reaching in my business, most of which
  is, I think, no more than envy. Some of these who have [page 88] made these
  unfriendly remarks have been in undertakings of such doubtful morality that
  I would not, under any circumstances, engage in them. These are often very
  loud in their profession of the Master's belief; but money divides their duty,
  as it does the rest of us, and Pluto's gods possess them all or a good part
  of the time afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;You have chosen the life of a reformer. You have, as human affairs go,
  a self-denying sacrificing career before you. I, as one who desires your highest
  good, would like to see a more peaceful and comfortable life ahead for you
  than that can be; but knowing that your course has been determined, no one
  will be more sincere in your cause as it needs time or the best means at my
  command.</p>
<p>&quot;I am given to hasty, and sometimes inconsiderate expressions, rash outbreaks,
  or eruptions, as you might call them, which friends have misunderstood and
  taken offense at occasionally; but when men know me as well as you do they
  know it is a harmless idiosyncracy. So do not take any note of what I think
  you should or should not believe. I think that every one who can, should think,
  and be earnest about it, and do all he can. There are many things
  to reform before they are settled right. God put us on the earth to work, and
  to work out improvement and better living. <strong>It seems his plan that man
  should get only what he earns, for either his mind or body</strong>, and hence the struggle
  of centuries will, in some distant future, come to an honest developed manhood,
  in which there will be neither tyranny, oppression, murder, slavery, nor extortion,
  but where men will be brethren as God designed them. How will it be with those
  who will not come to this belief I wot not.&quot; [sic]</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln said: &quot;I have enjoyed your kind interest. Your eruptions
  are not unpleasant. In an ordinary sense I have not sought the relation I hold
  in public affairs. I often come to a point where I feel I have done all the
  going and talking I can consistently attend to for awhile, [page 89] and settle
  down more determined to follow my law business; then I find a condition like
  the present, where I can not decline going into a political campaign without
  disappointing good friends, which no sensible man would do without much better
  reason than I have. Besides all that, and above it, the cause to which I have
  promised my best efforts needs help. It seems more needy of it as the years
  roll by. I feel that I can not abandon it, no matter whether it brings success
  or defeat, as it has so often brought in the past.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Christ knew better than we that 'No man having put his hand
    to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God;' nor is any
    man doing his duty who shrinks and is faithless to his fellow-men. Now a
    word more about Abolitionists and new ideas in Government, whatever they
    may be: We are all called Abolitionists now who desire any restriction of
    slavery or believe that the system is wrong, as I have declared for years.
    We are called so, not to help out a peaceful solution, but in derision, to
    abase us, and enable the defamers to make successful combinations against
    us. I never was much annoyed by these, less now than ever. I favor the best
    plan to restrict the extension of slavery peacefully, and fully believe that
    we must reach some plan that will do it, and provide for some method of final
    extinction of the evil, before we can have permanent peace on the subject.
    On other questions there is ample room for reform when the time comes; but
    now it would be folly to think that we could undertake more than we have
    on hand. But when slavery is over with and settled, men should never rest
    content while oppressions, wrongs, and iniquities are in force against them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;The land, the earth that God gave to man for his home, his sustenance,
    and support, should never be the possession of any man, corporation, society,
    or unfriendly Government, any more than the air or the water, if as much.
    An individual [page 90] company or enterprise requiring land should hold
    no more in their own right than is needed for their home and sustenance,
    and never more than they have in actual use in the prudent management of
    their legitimate business, and this much should not be permitted when it
    creates an exclusive monopoly. All that is not so used should be held for
    the free use of every family to make homesteads, and to hold them as long
    as they are so occupied.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;A reform like this will be worked out some time in the future.
    The idle talk of foolish men, that is so common now, on 'Abolitionists, agitators,
    and disturbers of the peace,' will find its way against it, with whatever
    force it may possess, and as strongly promoted and carried on as it can be
    by land monopolists, grasping landlords, and the titled and untitled senseless
    enemies of mankind everywhere.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>If all that Mr. Lincoln did in his busy twenty years or more, to help people
  get or keep their homesteads or claims, were told, it would throw a clear light
  on the work and real character of the man. As it is, enough is known to establish
  beyond doubt that it took much of his time, and that he never gave up the cause
  of any settler or distressed litigant while there was hope of saving it, and
  that most of this was done for people who had scanty means of payment, quite
  often none. Many were not able to pay anything at the time. None of them paid
  more than very moderate fees. The work was congenial to him, and no earnest
  man ever came that he did not set to work at once, with all his ability, influence,
  and untiring perseverance. He seldom failed, and few doubted his success who
  saw the energy and determination he had about it. </p>
<p>A number of friends talked this over at Bloomington about the time of his
  inauguration. There were several of us there at court, from the seven or eight
  counties where he had been actively employed for years, and a few from more
  distant counties. All of us knew of some cases, some more, some less. Some
  for two or three years, and some as long as ten years. One man had
  knowledge of  a hundred or
  more
  instances.
  Thus
  talking
  and estimating,
  we
  reckoned
  up
  near
  one thousand homes and farms which he had saved or helped to save for our people.
  His work was so complete that no one knew of an entire failure; none that were
  even partly so could be charged to him. Some of the claimants had emigrated
  while he was contending for them. He saved several of these after the parties
  had left, and only a few were were lost to them, and those because of abandonment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>page 359:</p>
<p>Chicago had grown to over two hundred thousand. It was the commercial metropolis
  and great Western town for the accumulation, barter, sale, and disposal of
  farm and manufactured products, with many other attractive advantages. It had
  unsurpassed waterways &#8212; the lakes and canals &#8212; to the seaboard.
  It had railways built or building in every direction, that made it what it
  continues,
  the
  wonder of the Western world. All this the inhabitants mentioned to visitors
  and new settlers, until they, too, could tell the story as well. </p>
<p>It did not have all the place has to-day, and was nothing near so big or so
  bad; but along with its commanding position and highways for hauling products
  to market and returning manufactured supplies in variety, it was the same town
  in miniature. Everybody hurried, and their faces sharpened, like their wits.
  The people generally think more of how to do business and make lots of money
  than of any problem of life or living; and no reputable man, woman or child
  ever strikes anything other than a rapid gait, with sound limbs and understanding.</p>
<p>In the early fifties a well-planned and complete system of railroads was undertaken.
  These were about all built from 1852 to 1856, when they were in successful
  operation. This was the industry that most generally benefited the city in
  fixing it as the grain, cattle, and hog-shipping center, as well as for all
  other exported products. It became also the receiving and distributing port
  for imports and merchandise for the West and Northwest.</p>
<p>The lines in operation of that day were one or two up the west shore of the
  lake to Milwaukee and north and northwestward. The Northwestern extended to
  the Galena lead-mine region and the Mississippi River north and westward. The
  Burlington and Quincy, from which latter point it connected with the Hannibal
  and St. Joseph across the State of Missouri, made connections at its terminus,
  St. Joseph, with the freight and stage routes across the plains. The other
  branch of the same line to Burlington, Iowa, made connection there with the
  first line built aross that State to the Missouri River. The Chicago, Alton
  and St. Louis Line went southwest through the towns of Joliet, Bloomington,
  Springfield, and Alton to East St. Louis. The Wabash began at Meredosia on
  the Illinois River, going east through Jacksonville, Springfield, Decatur and
  Danville to Logansport, Indiana, where it connected with lines east. It was
  very soon extended to Toledo, on Lake Erie. The Ohio and Mississippi went westward
  from Cincinnatti through Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to East St. Louis. This
  line, the Terre Haute and St. Louis, and the Wabash were the only lines of
any importance not making Chicago a terminus.</p>
<p>In addition to these, which made a very complete railway system in its day,
  Judge Douglas, with the help of his co-laborers in Congress and the consent
  of the people, secured a land grant for the building of the Illinois Central
  Railway, which extended, beginning at Galena, south and easterly, through Freeport,
  Dixon, Mendota, Ottawa, Bloomington, Decatur and Centralia, to Cairo, at the
  junction of the Mississippi and the Ohio Rivers, its southern terminus&#8212;  a distance of over four hundred miles. It had also a branch, more important,
  from Chicago almost due south through Kankakee, Champaign, Effingham, then
  fifty miles southwesterly to Centralia, on the main line, about three hundred
  miles south of Chicago and fifty miles east of St. Louis.</p>
<p>This gave the State a north-and-south line of railroad, traversing the State
  in two lines, with an aggregate of over seven hundred miles. The corporation
  that built the lines received a valuable land-grant of several million acres.
  The lands were sold out rapidly to actual settlers during this period of remarkable
  progress referred to.</p>
<p>The proceeds of the sale of these lands would have built two such railways.
  It was among the first of what have been called &quot;land-grant railroads.&quot; The
  question is still one of earnest doubt whether it was wise policy to build
  so many Western roads under the land-grant policy. While we have no intention
  to discuss the wisdom of the plan, it remains true that, as the railroad was
  desirable and it was universally agreed that it should be built, Judge Douglas,
  the State Legislature and the people in approval, made the best terms in building
  this line of any land-grant railroad that has ever been made.</p>
<p>The company, by its charter, was obliged and required in perpetuity to pay
  into the State treasury annually seven per cent of its gross earnings in lieu
  of all taxes for the State, counties, cities and schools. This has proven satisfactory,
  and remains a permanent income that more than supports the State government.
  The road and its owners have prospered under the plan and payment. It would
  have been a wise settlement of the railway and transportation problems if the
  people of the States and Territories had made the same charter requirement
  from all land-grant or aided railroads.</p>
<p>The building of these lines and other like improvements, the rapid influx
  of population and wealth, and the increase in property was one of the most
  remarkable advances and increase in values ever made by any one of our great
  States in the ten years. This rapid advance in the material and [p. 362] industrial
  conditions of the State had built and equipped a system of over five thousand
  miles of railroads that were built when farming and all commercial enterprises
  made like progress. By it Chicago became one of the greatest modern cities,
  mainly through the building of this unequaled extension and grasp of the highways
  of commerce, centering them in the Illinois town on the sands and marshes at
  the mouth of the malodorous little stream, or &quot;Polecat&quot; River, translated
  straight from the plain Indian to the plain Western Yankee dialect. The name
  became that of the town as well as the river.</p>
<p>The wisdom of those &quot;ancient builders&quot; of the city by the lake from
  1830 to 1860 was phenomenal. They were wiser than they knew. Besides building
  a trading town, they made it the termini of the whole Western, Northwestern
  and Southwestern railway systems, and kept their place, developing rapidly
  in all material and intellectual progress. They laid the foundation for an
  industrial and commercial metropolis, and no less of art, literature, and science,
  that has so often doubled and quadrupled its population and its business in
  steady growth, that it remains the marvel of the century.</p>
<p>What has been done there, the immensity of trade, traffic, and commerce that
  can only be counted in billions annually and the enlightened means of trade
  that crosses, recrosses, and girdles the continent, is realized only by a few
  people. What it can be, and what in reason we should expect it to be, in the
  progress of Christian civilization, is perhaps as marvelous as how Joshua's
  knowledge of astronomy helped him to be the successor of Moses and the bravest
  leader in Israel.</p>
<p>In 1860 &#8212; the year of the memorable Convention &#8212; Chicago had
  more than three times the people and business it had in 1850. This of itself
  would
  appear sufficient
  proof of the energy and industry of the people of the city and the State, and
  surrounding States as well. This was done and accomplished through the period
  of the most earnest and impassioned political discussion held by our people
  since the days of the Revolution.</p>
<p>The rapid improvement, advancement, and prospering civilization were not exceptional
  in the State of Illinois or Chicago; for the whole country, from its earliest
  settlement had never made such progress. Manufacturing, shipbuilding, and commerce
  had made rapid strides all over the Atlantic States as far south as New Jersey,
  where the people became interested in such enterprises. The acquisition of
  California and the Pacific domain of over one thousand miles coast-line, with
  a belt as wide of fertile and rich mineral lands running eastward, in a few
  years more than quadrupled our production of the precious metals, and made
  current money in such abundance and general distribution as to inaugurate an
  era of improvement such as we had never expected or thought possible.</p>
<p><strong>Our population increased from over twenty-three millions in 1850 to over thirty-one
  millions in 1860, an increase of eight and a quarter millions of people. During
  the same time the property values, by the best attainable estimates, were from
  seven billion dollars to sixteen billions of dollars &#8212; an increase that
  was two billions above twice as much in ten years. This gave, in the aggregate,
  an average of a little less than eleven hundred dollars for every man, woman,
  and child in 1860.</strong></p>
<p>Slave-labor had been very profitable. The production of cotton had risen from
  2,400,000 bales of 400 pounds each to 5,300,000 bales in 1860, which alone
  amounted to about three hundred millions of dollars. This was the largest single
  crop produced. Slave-labor, however, in the production of corn, tobacco, hemp,
  sugar and rice, amounted to an equal value, reaching an aggregate of more than
  five hundred million dollars annually. Over one-half of this was net [page
  364] increase and profit to not more than four hundred thousand slaveholders
  from the labor of four million slaves.</p>
<p>The enormous profits of slave-labor by all ordinary estimates exceeded this
  sum annually. Most of this vast wealth was monopolised in the hands of a few
  grasping men. This greed and desire for wealth and power and distinction has
  existed in all ages. It has always been the same in intention and purpose.
  It had then, and has never had other restrictions than God's moral laws, enforced
  against wickedness by intelligent, God-fearing men, who, in courage, in success
  or disaster, have fought it in all forms through the centuries, that the rights
  and liberties of men might not perish from the earth. When the brave are not
  fighting and contending against the consumers of men's toil, the lordly Cains
  are in some way dragging men down, usurping their rights, and deceiving or
  robbing them of their labor or its products.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln sincerely believed that in and with slavery the thirst for money
  was a potential danger that stood with uplifted arm, threatening the perpetuity
  of our free institutions. In a speech he made about September, 1858, he said,
  in substance, &quot;I have no wrought-up prejudices against slaveholders, rich
  men, or large owners of property as such. Any one of them may have come into
  use, control, or possession of these innocently enough and without a harmful
  thought or desire in doing so. It is the use men make of wealth, property,
  or power, and their purpose, as it is with those who succeed to official place
  and authority, that determines whether it is rightfully or wrongfully held.</p>
<p>&quot;All property and all that has existence in or upon the earth belongs
  of right to its Maker. You are for the time the custodian of what you have
  or get control over, as you are over your talents or your mental endowment.
  Your purpose, as it is God's in investing you with these &#8212; money, property,
  power, or mind &#8212; should be to make as many men [p. 365] happy and comfortable
  as the means at hand will suffice you to do. You brought nothing into the world
  with you. You will take nothing with you when you go out of it.</p>
<p>&quot;When you enslave or take men's earnings, or oppress them, you are not
  doing what your Maker intended with the means confided to your care for the
  benefit and welfare of your fellow-men, for which purpose he supplied you the
  ways to do so. In that he has done so to you, in like manner you should do
  to all mankind as your brethren. All else is wrong and leads straightway to
  evil, as misuse of God's wealth, property, talents, and blessings, of which
  he has given you much or little, not alone for your own selfish use and enjoyment,
  but that, as he has been bountiful and provident with you, so should you be
  with your fellow-men.</p>
<p>&quot;I am well aware that no man can arrest mankind in the maddened race
  for wealth, position, and power until God's own time to do it; but I am quite
  sure that, if one earnestly undertakes it and honestly and courageously adheres
  to it to the end, he will make some men better and himself what he could not
  have been without it, and more of what God intended men should be, and more
  in the line and make-up of our immortal Declaration of Independence, which
  starts all men out in life or being as equal under law. </p>
<p>&quot;As God never makes men less in right nor worse in life or character,
  but always make them more merciful, more humane, better and stronger in all
  that is good and wise, as they observe and follow him, why should not we do
  all within our limited means that we can to elevate men, and neither sell,
  degrade, oppress, nor filch the products of their toil? The Master never intended
  we should. I do not know or even believe that it is always true; but it is
  true enough to be a rule for the opinion and government of human affairs that,
  whenever you see a man with a million dollars of his own accumulation in his
  possession, he has a lot of other people's money, property, or earnings that
  he [page 366] has in some way extorted from and oppressed or ruined a whole
  lot of people in the getting of it. The men who have millions accumulated otherwise
  are the beneficiaries of some person that did all these, and oppressed perhaps
  a million people for every million dollars so accumulated.</p>
<p>&quot;One million dollars is such a sum that no man can honestly earn it,
  or anything like it in a lifetime. When it is conceded that it is lawful and
  morally right for a few men to control such vast sums, we have in so far parted
  with our liberties, our franchises, and privileges, or by force they have been
  taken from us in measures, such as the recognition of slavery or the slave-trade,
  which should never be granted, because in the operation of this same surrendering
  policy all our rights, franchises, wealth, property, and power will slip away
  from the people and be eventually concentrated in the hands of the few.</p>
<p>&quot;When this comes, and the wealth or power of the land is in the control
  of a few, as it exists now in many of the slave States, or in Europe, our liberties
  will perish, the Republic will die, and, whether in name or not, we will have
  a monarchy in fact. This, should it come, will surely destroy the Republic,
  the best and wisest Government God ever gave to men.&quot;</p>
<p>This was Mr. Lincoln's opinion on the subject of vast accumulations of wealth
  and power in the hands of a few men, as it was suggested and brought to his
  mind by slavery and the iron hold and exercise of power by a few in the slave
  States and the Nation, as far as their clutching grasp went unrestricted.</p>
<p>As Mr. Lincoln held and believed on these subjects, so did Judge Douglas.
  No man of his time, or before it, in our country was more firmly grounded and
  immovably determined in favor of an actual and real democracy than he was;
  and no one before or since ever believed in or carried out his belief of the
  direct responsibility of every officer and [p. 367] representative to the people
  who gave or assented to his official term. In short, he was honest, and believed
  in the rights of the people, and not in assumed or arrogated power as against
  them. He was a democrat who not only held office and represented the people
  who sent him, but lived in public and private life, a democrat; who, when
  he could have amassed a large fortune, was happy and contented in plain, simple
  living; who, like Lincoln, left the lasting example of honorable service, and
  believed that there are better things than wealth or usurped authority that
  always oppresses some one. </p>
<p><strong>I had several talks on occasions with these men &#8212; true-hearted
    patriots, as they were &#8212; on the subject of vast accumulations of wealth
    and property.
  They both held the belief that the vast accumulations of those days and the
  granting of almost unlimited franchises were threatening dangers, and that,
  as soon as the slavery issue was settled, the people should set about the work
  in earnest to restrict them. </strong>All in office or authority should be held to a
  strict accountability to the people. Especially railways and public carriers
  of all kinds should be brought under unqualified obedience to law, and should
  render good service at reasonable rates, and bear a pro rata tax similar to
  that required by the charter of the Central Railroad Company. The plan of this
  tax on the gross earnings of this road was approved by both of them. No plan
  so fair and just to all concerned has been made since. It was made as the result
  of combined wisdom and experience, and approved by all in the State as the
  best plan under which to grant valuable franchises.</p>
<p>In conversation concerning the reckless granting of franchises, lands, and
  public privileges, Judge Douglas said: &quot;The British people, in order to
  relieve themselves of the oppressive rule of the Stuarts, invited William III
  to the throne, that they might give peace, protection, and civil liberty, as
  kings of that day doled out rights and favors to their subjects when they were
  so minded. William came, and with him came a host of Hollanders, Lower Rhinelanders,
  Belgian and Swiss mercenaries. For a time many Britons feared that they had
  chased out a fox with the help of a wolf. Nevertheless William was there, and,
  with the people divided, had brought force enough with him to stay and maintain
  himself. He restored civil order with the grip and strength of a hand of iron,
  where it could be done no other way. Peace soon prevailed throughout the kingdom,
  enforced on the Russian plan by the sturdy burghers of the Lower Rhine wherever
  there was opposition.</p>

<p>The labor of four million slaves whose every day's toil produced vast quantities
  of materials such as corn, sugar, rice, and cotton, were all taken from the
  producers without remuneration, and placed in our own and the world's market
  in direct competition with our own products, making us the competitors of stolen
  and unpaid labor. Citizen and Nation were tied down under the dominion and
  curse of slavery, righteously judged and written, centuries ago, as &quot;the

<p>It will be one of the principal objects of this work to help place Mr. Lincoln
  in his true relation to the human race, commoner or leader of the plain common
  people, as he liked to be known; reformer, fearless leader, that defied every
  power on earth when convinced that he was right; and the counselor, helper,
  and defender of the poor and lowly under all circumstances. There have been
  as many as twenty entertaining books, lives or histories of Mr. Lincoln; hundreds
  of pamphlets, essays, personal recollections, opinions, letters, and valuable
  contributions of various kinds, published and written concerning him. All of
  them are different, many of them widely so; and they differ, as the writers
  themselves, in capacity, knowledge of the man, or want of it and opportunity.
  Some of them have been written with [page 42] the purpose of adjusting him
  to the ideas of the writers, careless, almost regardless of the facts that
  underlie his character and wonderful career. All of these many books and contributions
  are useful and beneficial, mainly because most of the writers about this pure-minded
  man have been, in their leading desires, of one mind in trying to place his
  beliefs, acts, and deeds, his fears and ambitious hopes, before the world in
  the most pleasing and imperishable form. Another thousand may still be added,
  and contribute much of what is necessary to complete the full, rounded-out
  history of this best friend of downtrodden men since Calvary. The work, if
  it is done wisely and well, will further illustrate the life-work and exalt
  the character of one of the keenest, most penetrating, and best balanced intellects,
  and one of the kindest, most sympathetic hearts that ever existed. Narrations
  and contributions about Lincoln, if truthfully given, cannot be overdone, for
  if the story be true and in form to be understood, it will in some way add
  to the knowledge of the delightful, God-imaged man and remembrance of his tireless
  life's work, devotion, and sacrifice for the relief and welfare of all men.</p>

<p>In Danville and Springfield, where these offices were located, he had constant
  employment in helping every settler he could in the struggle which he generally
  had for his homestead, to save it and him from the extortions and the stealing
  of it by the &quot;land-sharks.&quot; Their schemes were so well laid and usually
  so persistently carried and held in collusion with the officers that in the
  early days of our Western settlement these &quot;financiers&quot; laid their
  tribute on and collected it from almost every first settler on our public lands.
  Lincoln, as a lawyer, soon became known as the able and steadfast friend of
  the settler; and it came to be said, to his lasting honor, that &quot;he took
  every settler's case he could attend to, and his work was always the best that
  could be done. He never took a case against one, and scared the land-sharks
  more than all the rest of the lawyers in the State.&quot;</p>
<p>Many a settler and many a family saved their homestead through the determined
  will and work of this powerful man. His terrible invectives and ridicule became
  excruciating torture as he laid open their schemes to defraud and dispossess
  the toiling, honest settlers of their home. &quot;I respect,&quot; said he, &quot;the
  man who properly named these villains land-sharks. They are like the wretched
  ghouls of the sea that follow a ship and fatten on its offal.&quot;</p>
<p>In those days a settler could file a claim, pre-empt the land as his first
  entry, and in a term of twelve to fifteen months, under various acts of Congress,
  complete it. When the settler's claim was filed, the &quot;land-shark&quot; would
  file his counter claim, as there was no limit to the filing, whether he wanted
  the claim or not. When the first entry was to be completed, he would, if possible,
  compel every settler to pay him a fee of ten to a hundred dollars, as he measured
  the poor settler's ability to pay, or bid the land up to a higher price against
  him; for in all cases, so contested, the land was sold to the highest bidder.
  Lincoln did much to break up such work, for which the people thanked and honored
  him.</p>

<p>page 368-9 - an interesting argument about slave labor competing with free
  labor &#8212; including the idea that since men, women and children are in
  the workforce, 80% of them are working, &quot;whereas under ordinary civilization no more
  than 30% should be put at men's labor.&quot;</p>
<p>page 380:</p>
<p>The number of slaves imported from African shores into what became the territory
  of the United States, mainly by British and Dutch slavers, under the most careful
  and accurate enumeration possible, was three hundred thousand in 1776, at the
  time of our Declaration of Independence. In 1790, by the first census, the
  slaves numbered 687,897 in the United States. All the States, except Massachusetts,
  of which Maine was then a part, held some slaves: Vermont only a few, seventeen;
  New Hampshire only a hundred and fifty-eight. At the next census, in 1800,
  the slave population increased to 893,041.</p>
<p>At this time Vermont had abolished slavery, and freed her seventeen, and New
  Hampshire only had eight slaves left. At the next census (1810), there were
  1,191,364. At this time there were no slaves in Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
  or Vermont, of the original Colonies, and Ohio had been admitted without slavery.
  This shows that during the twenty years' time demanded by the slave-leaders
  for the slave-trade, from 1788 to 1808, the number of slaves had [page 381]
  almost doubled &#8212; to be exact, there had been an increase of 503,647,
  representing a value, at the low price of a hundred dollars apiece, of over
  fifty million
  dollars, and as much in the profits of the slave-holders every year.</p>
<p>These statistics are given for the purpose, and should be carefully considered,
  that we may know and understand the power, force, and influence of a system
  so widespread and profitable. There was much more behind slavery to sustain
  and support it than sentiment or patriotic attachment to their section. There
  was the insatiable desire, as rife and dominant now as then, to make a living
  and amass a fortune out of other men's labor. In the fourth census, of 1820,
  there were 1,538,022 slaves; in the fifth, in 1830, 2,009,043; in the sixth,
  in 1840, 2,487,455; in the seventh, in 1850, 3,204,313; and in the eighth,
  in 1860, 3,953,760. The sentiment in all the Colonies was strongly against
  slavery in the beginning, and it would never have been introduced into several
  of them but for the non-resident owners of large land-grants and concessions.
  They introduced Negro labor as the cheapest that could be employed; and from
  this start the planters took up the system, mainly for the cultivation of tobacco
  in Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas, further extending it in the production
  of cotton when the cultivation of that plant became one of the principal industries
  of Southern Virginia and all the Colonies south of it during the eighteenth
  century.</p>
<p>However, slavery received its greatest impulse and remarkable progress as
  a labor system from Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin, which will be
  taken up later. The climate of the Northern States was never so well adapted
  and agreeable to the Negroes as the milder, more genial South. Many of them
  sickened and died in the Northern latitudes from pulmonary complaints, particularly
  those lately stolen from Africa. So, too, it was more expensive to clothe and
  subsist them in the North. Under these difficulties [page 382] the traders,
  dealers, and planters crowded them into the milder climate and healthier region,
  where shelter, clothing, and subsistence were the cheapest, where the climate
  most nearly fitted them, and where vast, uncultivated regions were open for
  the employment of their unskilled labor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>page 404:</p>
<p>In the brutalizing system of slavery the common people of the slave States
  were the poorest of the land. They should have been the hope and foundation
  of any righteous Government, but driven into idleness by false pride and cheap
  slave-labor, were listlessly retrograding, failing, sinking below the horrid
  level of the better-housed and better-fed Negro slaves. The free men and stronger-sustained
  industries of the free States were clipped of hundreds of millions of dollars
  annually in the indirect competition of a system, the entire profit of which
  fatted and prospered a few thousand slaveholders. By precedent and example
  it led the way to other labor-robbing and other degrading systems that are
  with us yet, with their plundering schemes brought upon us by a horde of as
  cheap statesmen as the pro-slavery leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>page 406, Chapter XVIII</p>
<p>This slave system had debased all forms of labor in the slave States. The
  poor whites of the South were more degraded, worse fed, worse clothed, and
  worse housed, as a rule, than the slaves. The spirit of freedom had disappeared,
  and their once intelligent democracy and stalwart, independent men, like Patrick
  Henry, Francis Marion, Sumter, Moultrie, Sevier, Boone, Jackson, and thousands
  of others, had passed. Their successors had shrunk and dwindled to dwarfs and
  pigmies in State and council, and cringed to and served the oligarchy of man-stealing,
  free-labor-destroying slavery, under the relentless rule of Calhoun, Jefferson
  Davis, Judah P. Benjamin, Alexander H. Stephens, and John C. Breckinridge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>page 415 At the time it was generally believed that the plan and purposes
  of the Virginia leaders, which Franklin and Hamilton fully approved as the
  best for the gradual emancipation and restriction of slavery, would prevail.
  Perhaps it [page 415] might have prevailed, but Eli Whitney, a progressive,
  inquisitive Yankee, went South for his health and the betterment of his fortunes.
  There he saw for the first time the production of cotton, with a nutlike boll,
  a heavy, oily seed, and a pure white fiber two or three inches in length. From
  two to five hundred pounds of this excellent fiber, useful for clothing, bedding,
  and other domestic purposes, could be cultivated and gathered from an acre
  of land, according to its fertility and adaptation. An industrious Negro man
  could separate about one pound a day of this valuable fiber, take it out of
  the pod, and carefully strip it from its tenacious, oily seed.</p>
<p>When Whitney got South among friends, his reputation for invention had gone
  with him. They assured him that nothing they could think of would equal in
  value a machine that would separate the cotton fiber from the seed. Whitney
  earnestly set at work with all the perseverance and energy of his nature on
  one of the greatest inventions of his age, and in full view, as he believed,
  of a certain fortune. His hand was unerring; he was right. In a few months
  he invented and worked out a machine, mostly with his own hands, that would
  do the work. One man, with the machine which he made, could, with his unaided
  labor, separate fifty pounds of cotton fiber a day.</p>
<p>This was about October, 1793. He had achieved lasting distinction. He had
  invented and made the machine that would revolutionize labor and the production
  of cotton in the States adapted to its cultivation, and shortly all over the
  world. He made the invention, and reached the distinction which he deserved.
  He was in all equity and justice entitled to something out of the millions
  so many amassed by reason of his valuable invention. But others, and the great
  body of Southern planters in the cotton States, reaped the money reward of
  his genius and labor. The Southern people were noted for many commendable [page
  416] qualities; but this cotton-gin invention reminds us that generosity was
  never one of them. In their day, they suffered and permitted General Jackson
  to pay a fine of one thousand dollars for violation of local laws, when the
  old hero saved New Orleans and the entire State and Territory of Louisiana
  from the British; and they likewise suffered Eli Whitney and his heirs to go
  unrewarded for the invention of the plain-working machine, out of which they
  made individual fortunes by the thousand. His great invention, that created
  such an overwhelming demand for labor, fastened slavery more firmly on our
  country for three-quarters of a century than the most drastic code or persevering
  conduct of the infamous slave-traders could have done. This was not done, in
  whole or in part, by those who urged him on to his undertaking. They were anti-slavery
  people, and remained his friends.</p>
<p>[page 475] The slave population of our country was then about four [p. 476]
  millions, and at the low estimate of $100 each, their value was $400,000,000;
  but as they were bringing profits amounting on an average to $200 a head for
  every working man and woman, it brought in at least $250,000,000 annually above
  the cost of subsistence. With this demonstration it can be seen that if Negroes
  were kept a safe property investment, well protected under law, they were actually
  worth over $1,000 apiece, or an aggregate value of $2,500,000,000. This computation
  is made on the basis of ten per cent, to which could be added the value of
  the increase, which was as much as ten per cent, making a total of three billions
  of money in Negro slavery.</p>
<p>With such enormous values recognized as existing in men and women, the profits
  of which were gathered regularly every year by their few thousand owners, it
  can be well understood and easily shown in detail why it was no small or ordinary
  undertaking to raise up a new party able to contend against a power so great
  and so strongly entrenched, that to human insight and calculation it seemed
  unassailable.</p>
<p>The powers of the slavery system were great, the leaders had reached stronger
  control and influence than they expected, which made them more grasping and
  tyrannical in their exercise of power. They dreaded as one of their chief dangers
  the competition of free labor, and sought by all their means and ingenuity
  to exclude it from their States and to degrade and reduce its influence in
  the Nation. They refused, in every way, social and political, to sustain or
  protect free labor; but schemed and planned, through low tariffs and large
  foreign imported manufactures, their free-trade laws and all kinds of unfriendly
  legislation, to break down and cripple free labor whenever it was possible. </p>
<p>page 496 says that the writer was in college in Chicago in 1854. Some family
  history appears on page 498. On page 500, there is mention of Mr. Asahel Gridley
  with a bit of identification of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Page 499:</p>
<p>This was in the days when Mr. Lincoln was attending the court terms of McLean
  County as regularly as any one of the Bloomington bar, and was often there
  during the intervals. In addition to the good will and oversight of [page 500]
  Judge Davis that the writer began with, he soon made the favorable acquaintance
  of Mr. Asahel Gridley, and became office boy, student and general attache of
  the Gridley-Davis office and bank for several years. This was of incalculable
  benefit to any student, affording, at the same time, the great opportunity
  of a near acquaintance and close friendship with Mr. Lincoln through the years
  of his wonderful rise and development.</p>
<p>Mr. Gridley's introduction of the somewhat backward boy &#8212; the writer
  &#8212; to Mr. Lincoln was characteristic; and in those days it was a noted circumstance
  in any boy's life to be made a near acquaintance and be as favorably introduced
  to prominent lawyers, who were persons of much distinction to country boys.
  Our family had known Mr. Lincoln only a few years before, tolerably well, as
  we have related, but nothing like so intimately as we did Judge Douglas. Hence,
  to meet Mr. Lincoln in such favorable circumstances as Mr. Gridley had arranged
  for was a notable, almost exciting, event.</p>
<p>When the time arrived, Mr. Lincoln walked into the office &#8212; a tall,
  mild-mannered, friendly-looking man, with the most comfortable and easy manner
  about him in
  his address and presence you could well imagine. Mr. Gridley met him, shook
  hands with him cordially, and, after some personal remarks, said, in his rapid,
  clear voice, his words rattling like hailstones on a tin roof: &quot;Mr. Lincoln,
  I am very glad to have you here with us again. I have made some changes. This
  will be your desk, and the tables you can arrange as you like. This young man,
  Robert, will render you any assistance he can. He is here attending school.
  His people live in the country. He has been thinking about things for himself,
  and stirring them up very lively in some quarters, and, as I have advised him,
  he has been more cautious recently; but in spite of it he insists that he
  is an out-and-out Abolitionist, without any evasion or any [page 501] sort
  of
  qualification. I have told him that he was very foolish, and that, if he was
  a little older, it would bring him a lot of trouble. Anyway, with all my care
  and prudence, he is a long way ahead of public sentiment.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln took my hand with a warmth and expression that lightened up the
  soul of any one whom he respected or held to be a friend, saying: &quot;Yes,
  Mr. Gridley, I will get along first rate. This will all suit me very well;&quot; and,
  turning to me: &quot;The young man will do as well as the rest of us; but he
  must not be kept out of school an hour on my account. It seems to me, Robert,
  that I ought to know you; but, then, you never know about boys of your age,
  who change every year, and grow out of your knowledge.&quot; I replied, &quot;Mr.
  Lincoln, I know who you are very well. My father knew you when we lived in
  Springfield, when he helped to finish the south front and the top work of the
  Capitol building.&quot; &quot;Yes, yes, I knew Mr. Browne, the Scotchman. I
  remember him quite well. Of course you are an Abolitionist.&quot; When this
  was done, the friendly relation of a lifetime had begun.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln continued: &quot;I was sorry to learn of your father's death.
  He was a strong, independent man, full of positive ideas, with the capacity
  and education to defend them. He was the best-informed man on the British emancipation
  of slavery whom I ever met. I was always pleased and benefited by the chats
  I had with him. I heard that he contended vigorously with Judge Douglas, who
  was his warm friend, and I never had a doubt that Browne kept up his side of
  the question; for he was a fearless man in the expression of his anti-slavery
  beliefs, so much so that many feared he might get into some personal difficulty.
  So, Robert, we will be good friends; but you are not to remain out of school
  on my account. Are you opposed to slavery from anything you know about it yourself,
  or is it because of your father's opinions?&quot; Here [page 502] Mr. Gridley
  rose to retire, saying &quot;I must go.&quot; As he was retiring, he said: &quot;I
  see, Mr. Lincoln, that you are taking more and more interest in this slavery
  question. Beware, and not go too far. The Whigs from the border slave States
  are going over to Douglas by the thousand. If you should take up the Free Soil
  cause, which is right in the abstract, there will not be Whigs enough left
  in McLean County to make a committee.&quot; ...</p>
