<center style="font-weight: bold;"><small><small>Using
Tax Policy to Promote Urban
Growth</small></small>
</center>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nicolaus Tideman</p>
<p>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes. In a
market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
four factors of production: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the rent of land, </li>
  <li>the wages of labor, </li>
  <li>the interest received from owning capital, and </li>
  <li>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
investments and organizing production). </li>
</ul>
<p>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy must
either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</p>
<p>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does so at
the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
market forces.</p>
<p>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
have the option of moving away. </p>
<p>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the rent
of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
for the costs that their actions impose on others.</p>
<p>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for revenue
to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
collected publicly without discouraging growth.</p>
<p>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are.</p>
<p>There is virtually nothing a city can do to affect the rate of
expected return that is needed to attract capital, because capital is
highly mobile. Investment moves around the world, wherever expected
returns are highest. To attract capital, St. Petersburg must offer
the owners of capital prospects of returns comparable to those
available elsewhere. Taxing the return to capital that foreigners
invest in St. Petersburg is counter-productive. Additions to the
stock of capital available to workers in St. Petersburg can also come
from the savings of the residents of St. Petersburg. Here again, it
is important not to tax returns, so that the residents of St.
Petersburg will be induced to save rather than consume, and to invest
in St. Petersburg rather than send their savings elsewhere. </p>
<p>In a market economy, the owners of capital are the principal
entrepreneurs, the organizers of production whose incomes come from
what is left after all contracted expenses of production have been
paid. The return to entrepreneurship is not a matter of a rate of
profits that is promised to investors by governments, but rather of
how prospects, filled with risk and uncertainty, happen to turn out.
In evaluating investment prospects, entrepreneurs are concerned with
expected returns under existing conditions and with the consequences
of potential future changes that would affect their returns.</p>
<p>Among the most important risks that entrepreneurs face is the risk
that, after their investments have been made, governments will
introduce policies that will ruin the possibility of achieving the
returns that had been expected. Thus a substantial part of attracting
investment is a matter of convincing potential investors that they
need not worry about future government policies. How to do this is a
key question of promoting growth.</p>
<p>A city that seeks foreign investment is like a man trying to
persuade a woman he meets in foreign travel to marry him and go away
to live in his country. The woman can be expected to ask herself,
"Will he always treat me well, or is his current good behavior a ruse
to put me in his power? How do I know he will not abuse me once I
have left my friends and family?" The suitor must find a way to
overcome her fears. In the same way, a city that seeks foreign
investment must find a way to persuade potential investors that they
will not be treated badly once their capital is committed.</p>
<p>Some examples of policies that would harm the interests of
investors if they were implemented are:</p>
<blockquote>1. New currency regulations that prohibit foreign investors
from returning any profits they obtain.
  <p>2. New import restrictions that prevent enterprises from obtaining
the materials they need.</p>
  <p>3. New labor regulations that require enterprises to pay higher
wages than were expected.</p>
  <p>4. New environmental regulations that limit the production of
enterprises. </p>
  <p>5. New taxes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A city that seeks foreign investment should do what it can to
eliminate all such risks, so as not to acquire a reputation for
exploiting the vulnerability of investors. Exploiting the
vulnerability of investors would mean imposing conditions, after
investors were committed, that cities would have been willing to
forego to secure the investments. The effort to attract investment
should begin by putting the finances on the public sector on a sound
footing. This means limiting public expenditures to activities that
are truly worthwhile and providing adequate financing for these
activities. By managing its public budget prudently, a government can
persuade potential investors that there is less need to worry that
future governments will increase their taxes arbitrarily.</p>
<p>The financing of public activities does not necessarily have to be
from current tax revenues -- borrowing is appropriate for investments
in facilities that last many years. But borrowing for current
consumption undermines the confidence of potential investors.</p>
<p>For a city such as St. Petersburg, an implication of the
importance of investor confidence is that much of the city's success
in attracting investment will depend on investors' expectations about
treatment from the national government. To attract investment, it
will be important for St. Petersburg officials to do what they can to
provide assurance that the Russian government will not make life
difficult for those who invest in the city. This will not be easy.
But St. Petersburg officials should at least exercise any influence
they have to promote national policies that are encouraging rather
than discouraging to foreign investors.</p>
<p>Ideally, St. Petersburg officials might negotiate an agreement
with national officials that St. Petersburg would be a "free trade
zone," with its own economic rules. Such an agreement might provide
that taxation in St. Petersburg would be entirely at the discretion
of the people and officials of St. Petersburg, as long as the region
made an adequate payment to the National Treasury for services
provided by the nation and did not impose uncompensated costs on the
rest of the nation from such things as pollution or the migration of
economic refugees. Whether or not permission for an independent tax
policy can be secured, it will be in the interest of the people of
St. Petersburg to avoid excessive spending at the national level, so
that their taxes can be kept low.</p>
<p>Whatever arrangements are made for the financing of the national
government, the people of St. Petersburg also need to finance their
local government. For the activities of local government, the people
of St. Petersburg have the option of reducing or eliminating
activities if they are not worth their cost. Every activity that is
continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
</p>
<p>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
financing for local public expenditures.</p>
<p>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local public
revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.
Part of the rental value of land is the gift of nature--the fertility
of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</p>
<p>A second part of the rental value of land comes from the provision
of public services. The local agencies that provide these services
can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
results from their activities.</p>
<p>A third part of the rental value of any particular site arises
from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
site. Social collection of this part of the rental value of land is
particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
private activities according to how much they increase the rental
value of land.</p>
<p>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of land
has two parts. </p>
<ul>
  <li> First, the rental value of land has the rare quality of being a
source of public revenue that does not discourage productive activity.
If people are taxed according to their labor earnings, they can be
expected to work less, and to tend to move from the places that tax
them. If people are taxed on their investments and savings, they can be
expected to save and invest less, and to find it attractive to put
their savings and investments in other places where they will not be
taxed as much. But when the rental value of land is collected, no one
will reduce the amount of land in existence, and no one will move his
land elsewhere. Thus social collection of the rent of land does not
reduce the productivity of an economy in the way that most other
sources of public revenue do.</li>
  <li>The second part of the efficiency argument is that social
collection of the rent of land tends to make land more available to
those who want to start new enterprises. When the rent of land is not
collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to ignore
the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better use of
it. On the other hand, if those who have rights to land are required to
make annual payments equal to the market value of the rights they hold,
then these continuing payments will induce people to ask themselves
regularly whether they ought to release the land to someone who can
make better use of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from land,
it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
their neighbors are being charged.</p>
<p>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
passing out titles to the current users of land. </p>
<p>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
land.</p>
<p>The efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
revenue as well:</p>
<blockquote>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such as the
exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for radio
and TV broadcasts.
  <p>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such payments
should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible revenue of the
resources, in present value terms.</p>
  <p>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
cost.</p>
  <p>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental value of
surrounding land.</p>
  <p>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in crowded
streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for others.
The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it is not
worth implementing them, but if the administration can be handled
sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent that
they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</p>
  <p>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol, which
impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</p>
  <p>7. Charges for local public services, such as water, electricity,
sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to make every
service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable is that
each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service he
receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
covered by user charges.</p>
  <p>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land, at a
very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed tax,
each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing to
part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
basis. If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</p>
<p>It is important not to tax the profits of corporations. Capital
moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
collected by taxing profits.</p>
<p>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
features. The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
this feature. The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
development. A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
its land.</p>
