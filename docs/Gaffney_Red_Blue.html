      <div style="text-align: center;">Mason Gaffney, December 2004, <br>
      for publication in <a href="http://www.progress.org/cg">Groundswell</a>.</div>
      <br>
      Pundits since November have noted an apparent anomaly:
                        lower-income states voted red, and higher-income states
                        voted blue.&nbsp; Within
                each state, lower-income counties voted red, and higher-income counties
                voted blue.&nbsp; In California, the inland counties went red,
                while coastal counties, plump with wealth and income, went blue.
                Depressed
                upstate New York went red, while rich New York City went blue.<br>
      <br>
      On purely economic grounds, &#8220;it&#8217;s a puzzlement.&#8221; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Why do poor people
            support the party of big corporations and the rich?</span>&nbsp;<ul>
            <li>Pro-reds say
            it&#8217;s traditional good Americanism, character, old time religion,
            morality, family values, horse-sense, freedom from liberal education,
            and patriotism.&nbsp;  </li>
            <li>Pro-blues say it&#8217;s primitivism, gullibility,
            cultural backwardness, and superstition masquerading as religion. </li>
            <li>Marx,
            similarly frustrated in his day, explained it away by dismissing people
            like the red state voters as Lumpenproletariat - dummkopfs. </li>
          </ul>Before regressing into sub-adolescent cultural wars, though, there may
be some economic causation here after all.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We just need better
economic analysis.</span>&nbsp; Wendell Willkie wisely told us in 1940
that &#8220;A
good catchword can set back analysis by fifty years.&#8221; The catchword is
an economic one: INCOME.&nbsp; It may have slipped by you in my opening
sentence.&nbsp; Willkie was too optimistic, though: his fifty years
expired in 1990, with no discernable progress.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To understand the politics of New York
City or San Francisco we need to
begin by noting that they have about the highest residential rents and
home prices in the U.S.A., along with the highest tenancy rates. It
takes a high monetary income even to be poor in such places, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unless you
own land</span>.</span> Federal statisticians who publish the Consumer
Price Index
(CPI) delicately refrain from comparing different cities - they just
compare different times, city by city. This helps them finesse tough
questions about rents, and housing prices. Common observation, however,
and various semi-popular publications, fill the gap.&nbsp; The C.O.L.,
especially its rent and home value elements, is a lot higher in the big
glamorous cities, so real incomes there are a lot lower than they look
- unless you own land.<br>
<br>
The City of Los Angeles in early December, 2004, condemned an apartment
building in &#8220;south central,&#8221; the toughest slum area, to drive out
violent gangs who make it their base and terrorize the
neighborhood.&nbsp; Were the other tenants grateful?&nbsp; No, they
protested.&nbsp; &#8220;Where else can I rent for $600,&#8221; bemoaned one with a
mistress and child, clinging to a one-bedroom place with a &#8220;ratty
carpet, broken tiles, and roaches.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;The People&#8217;s Republic of Santa Monica,&#8221; so-called by wags, has about
the highest land values per square foot in the U.S.A.&nbsp; Its
enviable location is hard to beat. It also has a high rate of tenancy,
and a City Council swayed by organized tenants. Color it blue: the
tenants vote.<br>
<br>
High land prices also raise the credit requirement for owning a
business.&nbsp; That screens out many who otherwise would have enough
capital to enter or remain in business.&nbsp; It forces business owners
to be tenants, and look at life and politics as renters, not owners. <br>
<br>
It is not just average incomes per capita that define the economic
position of most people in a state or city.&nbsp; The distribution of
income and wealth makes a lot of difference.&nbsp; But wait again: IRS
data, and other data derived from IRS sources, vastly misstate the
concentration of real income because they omit the imputed income of
owner-occupied housing.&nbsp; Thus, a salary-earner paying high rent in
the Gold Coast of Chicago has the same reported income as one on the
same salary on the same Gold Coast who owns his own million dollar
house or coop or condo, and pays no rent. More: the renter&#8217;s income is
actually reported as higher, because the owner gets to deduct the costs
of ownership, interest and property taxes.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s the renters who
turn Chicago blue -- along with most big cities.</span><br>
<br>
It&#8217;s not that the Democrats are much like Georgists.&nbsp; Campaigner
John Kerry touted Federal aid for schools in order &#8220;to lower the burden
of property taxes.&#8221; That&#8217;s been part of his Party&#8217;s theme for
decades.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just that in spirit, said Party seems more
sympathetic to the poor and dispossessed, who don&#8217;t have much choice.<br>
<br>
Several modern economists minimize the role of land prices in home
values. Thomas Sowell, now a voguish columnist, was only recently a
Professor of Economics at U.C.L.A.&nbsp; Sowell endorses Professors
Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard and Joseph E. Gyourko of the Wharton
School, whom he quotes as follows: "America is not facing a nationwide
affordable housing crisis. --- In large areas of the country housing
costs are quite close to the cost of new construction." These areas
"represent the bulk of American housing" and they are areas where "land
is quite cheap." I can&#8217;t confirm the quote, but it reads like something
Glaeser and Gyourko might have written: they also claim that the
apparent price of land in Manhattan is only an illusion, the product of
zoning laws.&nbsp; The true or &#8220;hedonic&#8221; price is not much above
farmland.&nbsp; How do they figure that?&nbsp; Don&#8217;t ask!&nbsp; It&#8217;s
exclusionary obscurantism at its worst.<br>
<br>
In a Brookings paper, housing authority Karl Case of Wellesley and
financial prophet Robert Shiller of Yale write on housing. This is a
hasty paper, not of the same quality as their previous work, but there
it is under their names.&nbsp; They write that housing became more
affordable from 1995 to 2003 &#8220;in the vast majority of states.&#8221;&nbsp;
Thus easily they dismiss the minority of states with the majority of
the U.S. population and land values, and the highest ratio of land
prices to building prices.&nbsp; Metropolitan New York, with 10% of the
U.S. population, and a higher percentage of its land value, is a big
chunk of the U.S.A. all by itself.<br>
<br>
3,000 miles west, Deborah Reid of the Public Policy Institute of
California delivers a parallel locution: &#8220;there is no housing shortage
in California outside of Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and San
Diego.&#8221;&nbsp; Yes, and Switzerland is all flat, outside of The
Alps.&nbsp; Is this a new conventional wisdom to help vitriolic
columnists like Sowell ignore land values?<br>
<br>
It worked before, why not try it again?&nbsp; Willford I. King, a
renowned economic statistician, proved that land is equally
distributed, using the following database: "... in a certain village
with which I am familiar there are about a hundred families of somewhat
equal wealth who all own their homes."&nbsp; Full stop.&nbsp; That
sufficed for statistician King and the editors of the Chicago School
house organ, the J. of Political Economy, in 1924. This mythical idyll
was America, to King.<br>
<br>
Professor Alvin Johnson of Cornell chimed in.&nbsp; According to him,
the single tax is "a device for the spoliation of the middle class"
(Atlantic Monthly, 1914, p.30) who own the land in small towns where
real Americans live.&nbsp; Later he added, "The Single Tax philosophy
originated with a city man, ... a sound agriculture is based on ... the
farmer, his ... love of the countryside, the jollity of the country
picnic and dance, the fresh cheeked maidens who eagerly accept the role
of sweethearts of country boys and develop into contented farmers'
wives"&nbsp; (1927, in a book dedicated to John B. Clark, sponsored and
endorsed by the American Economic Association, which republished it as
a &#8220;classic&#8221; in 1967).<br>
<br>
In 1927 the &#8220;city man&#8221; was Al Smith, who had sponsored the New York
City tax exemption of new homes, 1921-31.&nbsp; That was one of the
most striking and successful quasi-Georgist episodes in American
history.&nbsp; Smith was as sympathetic to Georgism as any presidential
candidate who ever ran seriously.&nbsp; Small town America cut him down.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Today, rural land monopoly has cut the
number of American farms down
below one million, about the population of Milwaukee, San Francisco, or
Columbus.&nbsp; </span>Not many votes there.&nbsp; Small farm towns on
the
King idyll have shriveled and turned into camps for migrant laborers,
few of whom vote.&nbsp; Today, the haunts of equal homeowners and
fresh-cheeked maidens are the cookie-cutter subdivisions, whither the
&#8220;reg&#8217;lar fellers&#8221; and girls have fled.&nbsp; Homes are not just equal,
but identical to the last cornice.&nbsp; These make the red states red.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8220;And the people in the boxes, send
their children to the university,<br>
Where they all fit in little boxes, and they all come out the same.&#8221;</div>
<br>
The difference between tenants and owners is stark and obvious.&nbsp;
There are also differences among owners.&nbsp; In poorer cities, the
&#8220;skew&#8221; of home values is much less than in richer cities.&nbsp; &#8220;Skew&#8221;
means inequality, and is measured in many ways.&nbsp; An easy way is
the ratio of the mean home value to the median value: the higher the
ratio, the greater the skew.&nbsp; In southern California, as we move
from the red interior to the blue coast, the skew rises a lot, meaning
the top values rise faster than the other values.&nbsp; Thus, in the
blue counties the homeowners are less equal to each other. Here, too,
there is a greater gap between tenants and homeowners; and there are
more tenants.<br>
<br>
The blue counties report higher incomes per person than the red inland
counties.&nbsp; You might think this would compensate for their higher
home values, but you&#8217;d be wrong.&nbsp; Moving from red to blue, home
values rise faster than incomes.&nbsp; The National Association of
Realtors (NAR) and its state affiliates report &#8220;Affordability Indexes&#8221;
for different cities.&nbsp; These indexes show what fraction of the
residents can afford to buy the median-priced home.&nbsp; The higher
the median income, the lower the Affordability Index.
Counter-intuitive?&nbsp; Again, that is because home values rise faster
than incomes.&nbsp; The blue counties are those with lower
affordability indexes.<br>
<br>
The same pattern prevails nationwide. Median income ranges from a low
of $36.3K in El Paso to a high of $91.5K in Washington, D.C., a ratio
of 2.5/1.&nbsp; Median home values range from a low of $87K in
Buffalo/Niagara Falls to a high of $531K in the San Francisco Bay area,
a ratio of 6.1/1.&nbsp; This is a general pattern: incomes vary a
little among places; home prices vary a lot.&nbsp; Blue states and blue
counties are generally those where land is out of reach of a high
fraction of the people.<br>
<br>
What that means for social psychology and voting patterns I leave to
you. One thing is clear: &#8220;income&#8221; is a catchword that has obscured
analysis for Willkie&#8217;s fifty years, and more.&nbsp; To solve the
red-blue voting puzzle, we must study land values.<br>
