    Center for the
    Study of Economics, <br>

<p><br>
  <strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>It's been an axiom of urban policy for the past half century to lament the
  plight of American cities &#8212; that they have lost their most productive
  populations, that their infrastructure is deteriorated and obsolete, that they
  contain people
  most in need, and that their tax base is limited. This essay argues that none
  of this needs to be so, and that municipal leaders need only to think &quot;outside
  the box&quot; as the hackneyed phrase goes, to find undreamed of revenue that
  will not only provide all the support cities need but enhance the economic
  vitality of their being by its collection.</p>
<p>As conventionally viewed, cities not only have need for more services but
  lack the tax base on which to draw from. The services are greater in cities
  than in suburban and rural communities because that's where streets and other
  general services are the heaviest, where the schools are the greatest challenge,
  where the police and fire departments are most relied upon, where the social
  programs face the greatest pathologies, and where general administration is
  the most complex and requires the greatest control and coordination. It seems
  so obvious that it hardly needs mentioning, and no further discussion is required.</p>
<p>At the same time, so the argument goes, the revenue bases upon which to levy
  taxes are most lacking: the middle class and the wealthier populations have
  largely moved out, and stores have relocated to malls and highway junctions
  taking the sales tax base with them. What's left are deteriorating buildings
  and a complaining citizenry: the footloose commercial and industrial sector
  also threatens to relocate along with a residential population feeling strangled
  by growing municipal and school taxes on real property. A few cities have reached
  beyond taxation of property and sales to impose one more &#8212; an income
  tax &#8212; on top of the others. And greater reliance upon user fees and
  on privatized services shifts the burden increasingly to the poor.</p>
<p>It is difficult to argue with the truth of this picture. The most recent National
  League of Cities Annual Report<font size="-1"><strong><em>[1] </em></strong></font>indicated that most urban officials are very
  pessimistic about the general directions the country is heading, and most expect
  continued decreases in the levels services in years to come. Using almost any
  indicator &#8212; traffic, unemployment, infrastructure, housing, drug and
  alcohol abuse, or economic conditions, the problems have gotten worse. As federal
  and
  state taxes are cut back in the face of growing resentment, local leaders are
  faced with a Hobson's choice &#8212; raise more taxes or further cut services.
  In recent years, the changes in revenue streams between federal, state, and
  local
  governments show a continued decrease of support in all areas.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The revenue choices, political leaders assume, are between taxes on real property,
  retail sales, and personal income. All three are recognized to have strong
  negative impacts. Property taxes, well documented as being the most resented
  of all,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[2]</em></strong></font> are viewed as unevenly
  and even arbitrarily applied, regressive, and destructive of economic vitality.
  Sales taxes are acknowledged also as
  regressive and easily evaded. And income taxes, intended as a means of taxing
  the &quot;rich,&quot; also have downside consequences in their invitation to
  both tax avoidance and enactment of loopholes by compliant legislatures. What
  then to do? The more each tax rate is increased, the greater the tendency to
  institute beggar-thy-neighbor policies that raise the cost of their administration
  and foster more resentment and evasion. Not without reason do tax experts regard
  politics today as essentially a contest over taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>The premises of discourse</strong></p>
<p>What is most called for today is a return to basic analysis. Elementary economics
  starts with the recognition that there are three factors of production in the
  creation of social wealth. Each of those factors are mutually exclusive and,
  taken together, are jointly exhaustive of all sources of market value. The
  first of these is what classical economics from Adam Smith on called land.
  Land meant every aspect of nature to which industry can be applied; it meant
  not just locations of space but air, water, and mineral wealth. Today sunlight,
  radio waves, and even time, on occasion, would be added. The second factor
  of production is labor, referring quite simply to the effort applied by people's
  minds or bodies to land. The third factor is the product of past application
  of land and labor to current production: capital. Each factor in classical
  economics has its price, the product of which is the creation of wealth as
  we commonly understand it. The price of labor is wages; the price of capital
  is interest, and the price of land is rent. Rent, as understood in economics,
  is not payment for the use of property owned by others; it has, rather, a more
  technical meaning, one which will require greater explication below.</p>
<p>We have largely lost sight of these basic premises of economic thought, and
  it has led to our general inability to address the urban challenge of taxation
  with a perspective that offers an easy solution. Returning to these fundamental
  building blocks makes things much simpler and more comprehensible. Labor continues
  to be easily understood; its meaning has not changed in the course of a shift
  from classical to neoclassical economic thought. But capital, which had earlier
  encompassed only those creations that were the result of human enterprise&#8212;  the product of labor and land, has now been redefined to include land. Land
  by itself in contemporary neoclassical economics has dropped out of the equation
  altogether, and so for the most part has the concept of economic rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>Mathematical
  formulas in neoclassical economics are entirely changed.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">4.

        Corruption of Economics London: Shepheard-Walwyn Press, 1994.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is good reason, however, to recover the use of the terms land and rent
  as they were employed in 19th century classical economics: rent is the surplus
  produced by the collective enterprise that can provide the necessary revenue
  to easily support public services, if it were only collected in the form of
  taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> In fact, by shifting taxes off labor and capital and onto land rent,
  the performance of markets would be made fully efficient and would be essentially
  painless to taxpayers. This is the thesis I am arguing here, and which is now
  possible to demonstrate with the advent of computer power and available data.
  It amplifies and validates what has been for a century only a plausible theoretical
  claim. We can now show that collecting economic rent can provide for all the
  services demanded of cities and avail themselves of the proper tax base that
  exceeds all others.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> And unlike other taxes there is no downside impact;
  in fact it's positive. Economic rent is the surplus created by the community,
  and it circulates through the markets until it ultimately comes to settle on
  land sites<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[7] </em></strong></font>The result of its accretion to land sites is to raise their
  market price. Economic rent is sometimes called land rent or ground rent for
  this reason, and comes about not through any titleholder's individual enterprise
  but by the consequence rather of society's collective effort. British political
  economist David Ricardo first conceived of land rent in terms of its relationship
  to agricultural production in the early 1800s, but its applicability today
  is understood far more easily with regard to the site values in cities. Whereas
  ground rent to Ricardo reflected the differential gifts of nature inherent
  in various land sites, it is today better understood as reflective of locational
  differentials in the capacities of communities.</p>

<p>This is relatively easy to understand by considering a vacant expanse of land
  that has imposed upon it a grid of roads like a tic-tac-toe board. Suppose
  each of the squares were privately owned, and development of those sites were
  to ensue, the economic surplus generated by that market activity would raise
  the value of each of those locations. Let's further suppose that every site
  were developed except the center square, that titleholder choosing instead
  to just hold his title vacant. Which land site, discounting the building values,
  would command the greatest market price after a short time? The center square,
  of course &#8212; even though that owner made no effort to earn that increase
  in price. The center square would see the greatest accretion of economic rent
  because of its strategic access. It would be the passive beneficiary of the
  surplus generated by the common enterprise of all the market exchanges resulting
  from the other locations. In just this way rent becomes the social creation
  of the community and not the result of any private individual's enterprise.
  The more the economic activity, the more the surplus generated comes to settle
  on land in the form of rent. Rent accretes to land sites and raises their market
  value, directly reflecting the varying levels of productive economic surplus
  generated over time throughout a community. High economic productivity yields
  high surplus rent.</p>
<p>If one plots the land value per unit area, whether by square foot, acre, hectare,
  or square mile, as is now possible to easily do using modern computer programs,
  the differential land values are easy to approximate. Typically the center
  of a city experiences the peak land value, with a precipitous decline as one
  leaves the center and departs to its outer edge. The highest value locations
  are the commercial cores, falling quickly as one travels out to residential
  locations, and with agricultural and forest lands having only a small fraction
  of the value commanded at the center. In areas of New York City, the market
  price of locations has been shown to be in the vicinity of $500 million per
  acre. Even in smaller cities, there is little realization of the enormous cost
  of sites in core areas: in downtown Des Moines, the price per acre was $31.5
  million. Other illustrations are easily available, particularly in urban areas
  on the east and west coasts of the US. Taking another perspective, the urbanized
  center of Tompkins County, New York (Ithaca) is five percent of the land area
  but contains ninety-five percent of the land value.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8] </em></strong></font>To see where the land
  values are highest, it is easiest to look at a city's skyline.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The tallest
  buildings sit on the most expensive land parcels. Typically the aggregate land
  value of a city is about 40 percent of the combined market value of land and
  improvements. The proportion of overall land value to building value is revealed
  by that profile, known as a landvaluescape<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[10]</em></strong></font> Some buildings will exceed
  that proportion &#8212; a large investment on a small footprint; other sites
  may be vacant or depreciated buildings with a far smaller land to building
  ratio.
  The dynamic at work here is easily understood: the greater a land site's value
  the greater the incentive to take advantage of its location; following the
  same logic, the more intensive the investments in particular neighborhoods
  the greater market value of remaining or underused land sites, making any locations
  that are underutilized good candidates for improvement. So it is that downtowns
  generate land values many times those of farther reaches; each investment development
  fosters others.</p>

<p><strong>The Rent in Cities</strong></p>
<p>The land values are highest in urban cores, one is reminded, because the economic
  rent passes as a surplus through all market transactions and comes to settle
  on land sites. Rent happens, so to speak, and it raises the market price of
  sites accordingly. Were cities to recover the socially produced ground rent
  in the form of tax revenue, it would not be left to collect on sites but could
  be used to provide the financial wherewithal for the services that cities are
  bound to perform. As will be evident below, the amount of economic rent available
  for recovery is thought sufficient to pay for all services and then some. Today
  it simply collects on sites of greatest activity with typical and visible negative
  consequences.</p>
<p>One might suppose that collecting the economic rent would leave locational
  sites with less market price appreciation, stabilizing land prices at levels
  that are more within reach for various developments. To be sure collecting
  economic rent exerts a downward pressure on market prices. But there is a countervailing
  pressure that works to neutralize whatever tendencies are otherwise at work:
  the collection of rent, especially from high-value sites, increases the carrying
  costs in ways that provides a greater inducement for their titleholders to
  improve them. That incentive fosters development in areas that, together in
  combination with other activity generated in neighborhoods, tends to maintain
  the stability of land markets in a roughly constant pattern.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately the positive effect of taxing rent in the typical American city
  is neutralized by the fact that taxes are also imposed upon improvements. Even
  though taxing land sites fosters their more intensive use, taxing buildings
  exerts a penalty on titleholders for doing so that works in the opposite direction.
  The conventional tax on real property in most American cities is like a train
  with an engine at each end. Whatever beneficial effects that might be apparent
  by taxing just land value are taken away again by the tax on improvements.
  This is why so many cities suffer from abandonment and despoliation. It is
  also why titleholders so often revile the conventional property tax. Were the
  tax on improvements gradually phased out and the tax on land values raised
  proportionately in a revenue-neutral manner, underused parcel owners would
  be induced to make improvements and sites would be built upon commensurate
  with their market price.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[12]</em></strong></font> This practice is increasingly employed by municipalities
  both in the US and beyond.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font></p>

<p>Taxing land value only is an incentive with the virtue of reversing the centrifugal
  forces of sprawl development and the tendency for builders to choose suboptimal
  locations.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Some titleholders find it advantageous to hold their valuable
  parcels off the market for speculative gain. But bringing the holding costs
  forward rather than allowing their exploitation for a capital gain upon sale
  increases the market efficiency of transactions and more optimal use of sites.
  The incentive to speculate on others' dime is removed.</p>

<p>Cities, having the huge preponderance of land value, stand most to gain by
  a shift of taxes to land value alone. If they wished they could &quot;cream&quot; the
  tax base in a way that would make outermost locations positively jealous. Contrary
  to the thesis of writers like David Rusk who argue for incorporating the suburbs
  to the cities to expand the tax base,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> it is the urban cores that have the
  greatest tax base in the form of high ground rent. Preliminary studies indicate
  that the amount of economic rent available to be recovered in taxes is equivalent
  to the optimal demand for services that cities require. Nobel prize winning
  economists William Vickrey and Joseph Stiglitz have been among those who explored
  what is known as the Henry George Theorem.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16] </em></strong></font>Given the quality of current
  data it remains a challenge to be more specific in applications of this thesis.
  It remains a subject area begging for further exploration.</p>

<p><strong>The Failure to Tax Rent</strong></p>
<p>The performance of economies freighted by experience with conventional taxes
  is much reduced, as has been widely acknowledged. One Harvard study estimated
  that taxes on income exert a deadweight loss equal to a third of the amount
  that is collected, half if payroll taxes are included.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font> Sales taxes are
  equally as onerous. But taxing land, due to its fixed (inelastic) supply, has
  zero burden; it therefore has no encumbrance or drag on economic activity whatsoever.
  By reducing all the taxes on labor and capital and instead shifting the burden
  to various forms of land as a revenue base, it is possible not only to garner
  sufficient income for government programs but to relieve the market from the
  friction that slows its performance. Cities then get a double dividend by shifting
  to a land tax: downtaxing any form of labor and capital frees up its potential;
  uptaxing land value by the recovery of rent prompts its more intensive use.
  Revenue yield could even be increased in such a tax regime without much additional
  burden on homes. This is because underused landsites in the urban cores would
  feel the greatest increases.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It should be further noted that wherever tax burdens are first incurred they
  are ultimately shifted through the economy until they come out of economic
  rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> By their initial imposition on other factors of production, however,
  they encumber the performance of markets and foster inequities among populations
  that is both inefficient and unjust. This is not difficult to explain: labor
  is responsive to the forces of market location, even if not always in the short
  run. People are always free to locate where burdens are less onerous, thus
  avoiding efforts to collect taxes when their labor is so targeted. Capital
  is even more mobile, especially so in the age of contemporary communication
  and wired transfers. By taxing capital a municipality is insuring that its
  investment base will be reduced. Only locations, and the rent that attaches
  to them, cannot be moved and are beyond escaping the reach of taxation. One
  can't take one's land to Cancun or Bermuda.</p>

<p>One could argue that the failure to tax every bit of economic rent that accretes
  to land sites also has destructive consequences, although this is somewhat
  open to debate. Classical economists agree that rent collection ought to be
  at least the sum of inflation plus interest, otherwise the public is facilitating
  speculation in ways that distorts urban configurations even more than they
  constitute an inequity. But land sites frequently rise in market price far
  more than the rate of inflation, especially in times (as is perhaps true today)
  that a &quot;bubble&quot; in an economic cycle is in full flower. Some municipalities,
  especially on the east and west coasts of US, are today claiming to have increases
  in housing prices of as high as 20 percent per annum, a fever that surely will
  not last and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> Land values
  are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing depreciation
  just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other manufactured (capital)
  item. Recovering the economic rent reduces and perhaps even eliminates the
  speculative bubbles and swings that (some argue) account for economic cycles,
  fostering stability and regularity in economic planning and development that
  make for improved financial health to all.</p>

<p>This reality brings into stark relief the choices which local political leaders
  have. They may suggest increasing taxes on economic rent (i.e., on land value)
  or recognize that most property owners are counting on treating their homes
  and other property not as places to live and work so much as investments and
  then lament the poverty of their cities. Owners expect to reap a gain from
  their property when they sell, and they are often positioned to make any threat
  to that entitlement politically unpalatable. Farmers sometimes regard selling
  their farms as their retirement security. Homeowners sell with the expectation
  that this gain will provide them the means to enter long term end-of-life facilities
  if necessary. Heirs also oppose that recapture just as with a reverse mortgage.
  But for every long-term property owner that walks away with a lifetime's benefit
  of increased rent attached to a land title, there are just as many &#8212; if
  not more &#8212; young households or emerging businesses that are prohibited
  from acquiring
  a property because of the prohibitively expensive costs. In this sense, a title
  to a socially created stream of rental benefits constitutes a monopoly privilege
  to an unearned windfall gain for a lucky few. It is both unjust and is socially
  and economically destructive to the greater good.</p>
<p>  <strong>The Perfect Tax</strong></p>
<p>In the final analysis, a tax should be evaluated according to the tenets of
  sound tax theory that have evolved over the course of recent centuries, and
  much of what has been said above is recaptured by a review of those principles.
  These measures of what is a &quot;good&quot; tax or a &quot;bad&quot; tax are
  often listed differently in textbooks, but they are largely agreed upon. Failure
  to conform to these venerable benchmarks is by itself sufficient cause to explain
  an economy's faltering &#8212; a particularly noteworthy example today is the
  city of Philadelphia which appears to have done everything backward! It taxes
  income,
  sales, building capital and even business privilege, the result being that
  its fisc is destitute.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[20]</em></strong></font> The principles by which to measure tax design are
  enumerated here so as to make quite clear how recapturing economic rent in
  the form of taxes &#8212; in all the several forms where 'land' can be identified
  &#8212; constitutes the best method of financing government services and the
  most advantageous to cities.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[21]</em></strong></font></p>

        and Philadelphia Forward, a tax reform organization focused on that city,
        at http://www.philadelphiaforward.org/.<br>
    </font><font size="-1">21. For a discussion of what students of tax policy regard
        as the principles which should guide their design, see, for example, George
        Break, &quot;Taxation,&quot; Encarta Encyclopedia by Microsoft, 1993; &quot;Principles
        of Taxation, in Light of Modern Developments,&quot; Washington: Federal Tax

        and David Brunori, State Tax Policy: A Political Perspective. Washington:
        Urban Institute Press, 2001, Ch. 2. State studies cited above also typically
        list any or all of these criteria. I have seen accountability, balance, certainty,
        competitiveness, and complementary included as well.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first measure of a good tax is its neutrality. A neutral tax in no way
  alters the behavior of its partners from what would transpire were there no
  tax at all. A simple example illustrates the case: today many consumers will
  travel to alternate jurisdictions to avoid paying a sales tax on particular
  items, be they food, medication, clothing, or whatever. Taxes fully absorbed
  (&quot;capitalized&quot;) in a market price such as land taxes in no way distort
  behavior, the volume of transactions, or gross prices. They are neutral.</p>
<p>A tax should also be efficient. To be sure, efficiency has many meanings even
  in economics. But here, rather than speaking of the administrative efficiency
  of its collection as will be addressed below, the measure is whether and how
  much it constitutes an excess burden on the economy, thereby slowing down performance
  and market vitality. Many taxes, as was mentioned earlier, exert so much drag
  on market transactions that they are destructive, however much revenue is brought
  to government coffers. Because land has a fixed supply there is no excess burden
  at all.</p>
<p>People are frequently most concerned about the fairness of a tax, which is
  typically measured according to both horizontal and vertical equity. Horizontal
  equity means that those in similar circumstances will bear similar burdens.
  Vertical equity prescribes that those with greater resources will pay more.
  Although studies have yet to show this, land taxes are likely the most &quot;progressive&quot; of
  any levy, as tenants bear no passed-through burden at all.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[22]</em></strong></font> Not only does
  no household or office tenant bear any tax burden, locational sites distant
  from the urban core, mostly homeowners and farmers, typically find their burden
  reduced. Vacant or underused lots in high value areas pick up the difference,
  employing a design that employs an alternate criterion of equity: taxing according
  to use. &quot;Paying for what you take and not for what you make&quot; encourages
  efficient consumption of space and resources in an automatic and non-coercive
  manner. The one-third of households that own no land are relieved of all taxes,
  and residential and non-residential property owners split the rest. Farmers,
  whose land is typically of inconsequential value relative to sites in urban
  areas, are likely to pay little if anything even if they are not already protected
  by other save-harmless provisions. By eliminating taxes on building improvements
  they typically enjoy savings just as do other businesses.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">22. Only two empirical studies have ever been done on the
        subject, but both concluded that the real property tax is mildly progressive.
        When land and improvements, the two elements of the property tax, are taken
        separately, it becomes even clearer why this is so. See Peter Mieszkowski,
        AThe Property Tax: An Excise or a Profits Tax,@ Journal of Public Economics
        1 (April 1972): 73-96, cited and discussed extensively by James Heilbrun, &quot;Who

<p>All this makes for a far simpler and more comprehensible system of taxation.
  Land taxes are totally transparent, impossible to evade, and therefore much
  more administrable. This further engenders the legitimacy of taxation and of
  government itself. What it also does is assure stability to the tax system,
  for the reason that land values are not subject to the variations and vacillations
  that other tax bases frequently have. Indeed, the removal of economic rent
  from locational sites discourages speculative bubbles and the related economic
  cycles that are associated with them. This greater stability and reliability
  is to the advantage of every sector of the economy &#8212; private, public,
  and non-profit.</p>
<p>A tax that collects economic rent offers a win-win proposition to every sector
  of the community &#8212; except to those who speculate in land. But who wants
  to favor land speculators? They are not held in high regard anywhere; their
  destructive
  behavior is the bane of cities, recognized everywhere for what it is: parasitic
  and passive. Speculators provide no added value to a community's well-being,
  and taxing rent is a foolproof means by which to eliminate it. Land speculation
  is highest where the most rent can be privately captured, but it forces those
  who choose to develop to look to sub-optimal locations when the primary locations
  they hoped for are held off the market for opportunistic gain. By collecting
  rent, primary choice locations become available for use and to facilitate the
  development of land use configurations ideal for the economic health and efficient
  allocation. Urban ambience is improved, public sector service costs are reduced,
  and sprawl development is stemmed.</p>
<p>In the final analysis cities have no reason to complain other than by being
  hoodwinked by an economics profession that went off track a century ago and
  has seen its own disciples unable to take off the veil.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[23]</em></strong></font> It was then that
  economic theory was altered to treat land as simply another form of capital,
  changed to formulas based on two factors of production rather than three, and
  disposing of the notion of economic rent altogether. Henry George, the last
  passionate defender of the classical economic tradition a century ago, lost
  his fight to preserve three-factor economics. But there are many still who
  appreciate the value, even the truth, of his insight and analysis. Today we
  have the computer power to test these ideas and to demonstrate their validity.
  There is an oft retold story among adherents of the Georgist school referred
  to as &quot;seeing the cat.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">23. Supra, Note 3.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As told by Professor Fred Foldvary,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[24]</em></strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> A man was walking down a shopping street and came to a store window where
    there was a big drawing full of lines and squiggles. A sign by the drawing
    asked, &quot;Can you see the picture?&quot; All the man could see was a chaos
    of lines going every which way. He stared at it and tried to make out some
    kind of design, but it was all a jumble. Then he saw that some of the lines
    formed ears, and whiskers, and a tail. Suddenly he realized that there was
    a cat in the picture. Once he saw the cat, it was unmistakable. When he looked
    away and then looked back at the drawing, the cat was quite evident now.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">24. Fred Foldvary, &quot;<a href="Foldvary_StC.html">Seeing
            the Cat</a>,&quot; http://www.taxreform.com.au/essays/thecat.htm.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is with those who see and appreciate economics in three-factor terms
  and the importance of economic rent. Once it is understood, their world is
  never again the same. By this uniquely Georgist story, the power of the classical
  economic framework is made clear. When it is more widely understood, city fathers
  will come to see that the revenue they dreamed about was there all along. They
  need only to see the cat and collect that economic rent.</p>
