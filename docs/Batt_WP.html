<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Water
and Privatization</span><br>
by H. William Batt, PhD, Albany, NY<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It is often argued that the most
efficient solution to the challenge of providing water to all people is
to employ a paradigm that recognizes water as a good and service to be
priced by market mechanisms. But many conventional economic models fail
to see <span style="text-decoration: underline;">water as the natural
birthright of all people</span>.</span> To reconcile these positions,
one needs to step back to a framework of thinking arising from 19th
century classical economics. Renewed interest in these, especially by
environmentalists, offers a way of resolving distributive justice with
market efficiency. If you search on Google the words "economic
justice," it brings up first the work of the Banneker Center and
associated sites that rely on a social philosophy especially applicable
to questions about the ownership of nature and its services.<br>
<br>
In recent years it has been argued that only the privatized free market
is capable of allocating resources in an efficient manner, regardless
whether these goods and services are the product of individual and
corporate industry or the bounty and heritage of all people. If you
believe that the goods and services of nature - its air, water, land,
mineral wealth,and the spectrum of radio waves are all the birthright
of all people, and ought not to be captured for private gain by any
quarter, you will easily subscribe to this philosophy. Known as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geonomics</span>, or sometimes <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Georgism</span>, it grows out of 19th
century classical economic theory, and its greatest exponent was the
self-taught journalist and economist, Henry George.<br>
<br>
Georgist ideas have tantalized thinkers the worldover for a century &#8212; its
advocates include John Dewey,<a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston Churchill,</a> Sun
Yat Sen,
Theodore Roosevelt, and Robert Hutchins. Today proponents run the gamut
from Molly Ivins and Michael Kinsley on the left to <a href="Buckley_HG.html">William
Buckley</a> and
Stephen Moore on the right<span style="font-weight: bold;">. But only
recently, with the advent of data availability and increased computer
power, is it possible to demonstrate that Henry George was right: i.e.
that taxing what he called "land"&#8212;  really meaning all natural capital
and resources rather than labor or human capital &#8212; constitutes the best
possible tax design we could have.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If these natural resources are a
"commons" worthy of being preserved as the birthright of all humanity,
their use can be rented at rates sufficient to cover the costs of not
only the provision of those services but for all public needs. </span>All
taxes are ultimately shifted through the economy to rest on what
classical economists call land rent in any case, and levying the taxes
directly on rent improves efficiency by eliminating "deadweight loss."
Moreover,<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
taxing or collecting what classical economists call economic rent bears
all the hallmarks of a perfect tax fairness, simplicity, stability,
administrability, neutrality, and efficiency.</span><br>
<br>
Appropriate designs of water pricing should involve ownership by the
public as part of the commons, but use and accessibility should be the
basis of its rental fees. Doing so would ensure that heavy users like
industries and agriculture would likely pay more and households would
pay but little. There are ample practical examples of such designs,
particularly the irrigation works of California in the early 20th
century, and one can look to classical civilizations like Egypt and
China for successful examples as well. Sadly social philosophy has moved
away from recognizing formulas that appreciate the concept of economic
rent, which thinkers from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill made central
to their thinking. Reincorporating rent payments for the services of
nature can insure their continued preservation in conformity with
economic justice as Henry George first envisioned. For more on this
approach, some by this writer, see the search engine <a href="http://www.askhenry.com">www.askhenry.com</a> and
