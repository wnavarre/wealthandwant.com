<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
People's Land</span><br>
Winston S. Churchill<br>
1909<br>
</div>
Winston Churchill published in book form (to be sold in two versions, 1
shilling and 2 shillings) under the title <em><strong>The People's Rights</strong></em> a
distillation of a series of speeches he had delivered in eight or nine towns
in Lancashire in December, 1909, in the runup to the "general election
campaign which followed the rejection of the 1909 Budget by the
Conservative majority in the House of Lords."&nbsp; The book was
divided into six sections:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. The People's Rights<br>
2. The People's Budget<br>
3. The People's Trade<br>
<strong>4. The People's Land</strong><br>
5. The People's Welfare<br>
6. The People's Choice</div>
<p>To further quote the introduction to a 1971 reprint, </p>
<p>"Churchill's aim
        in <span style="font-style: italic;">The People's Rights</span> was to
        provide a comprehensive summary of the Liberal cause for the
        election.&nbsp; But his speeches in 1909 and earlier had inevitably
        touched upon enduring problems and appealed to basic principles.&nbsp; Underlying
        all the arguments in <span style="font-style: italic;">The
        People's Rights</span> was one fundamental political objective: the
        raising of the welfare of the people.&nbsp; As early as 1899, Churchill
        had told his cousin, Ivor Guest: 'The improvement of the British breed
        is my political aim in life.'"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The best way to make private property
secure and respected is to bring
the processes by which it is gained into harmony with the general
interests of the public. </span>We are often
assured by sagacious persons that the civilization of modern States is
largely based upon respect for the rights of private property.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>If
that be true, it is also true to say that respect cannot be secured,
and ought not, indeed, to be respected, unless property is associated
in the minds of the great mass of the people with ideas of justice and
of reason.<br>
<br>
It is, therefore, of the first importance to the country -- to any
country -- that there should be vigilant and persistent efforts 
<ul>
  <li>to prevent abuses,  </li>
  <li>to distribute the public burdens fairly among all classes, and  </li>
  <li>to establish good laws governing the methods by which wealth may
be acquired.  </li>
</ul>
The best way to make private property secure and respected is to bring
the processes by which it is gained into harmony with the general
interests of the public. When and where Property is associated with the
idea of reward for services rendered, with the idea of reward for high
gifts and special aptitudes displayed or for faithful labour done, then
property will be honoured. When it is associated with processes which
are beneficial, or which at the worst are not actually injurious to the
commonwealth, then property will be unmolested; but when it is
associated with ideas of wrong and of unfairness, with processes of
restriction and monopoly, and other forms of injury to the community,
then I think that you will find that property will be assailed and will
be endangered.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="Land_differs_from_all_other_forms_of"></a>Land differs from all
other forms of property.</span>&nbsp; It is quite true that the land
monopoly is not the only monopoly which
exists, but it is by far the greatest of monopolies -- is a perpetual
monopoly, and it is the mother of all other forms of monopoly. It is
quite true that unearned increments in land are not the only form of
unearned or undeserved profit which individuals are able to secure; but
it is the principal form of unearned increment which is derived from
processes which are not merely not beneficial, but which are positively
detrimental to the general public. Land, which is a necessity of human
existence, which is the original source of all wealth, which is
strictly limited in extent, which is fixed in geographical position --
land, I say, differs from all other forms of property in these primary
and fundamental conditions. Nothing is more amusing than to watch the
efforts of our monopolist opponents to prove that other forms of
property and increment are exactly the same and are similar in all
respects to the unearned increment in land. They talk to us of the
increased profits of a doctor or a lawyer from the growth of population
in the towns in which they live. They talk to us of the profits of a
railway through a greater degree of wealth and activity in the
districts through which it runs. They tell us of the profits which are
derived from a rise in stocks and shares, and even of those which are
sometimes derived from the sale of pictures and works of art, and they
ask us, as if it were the only complaint, 'Ought not all these other
forms to be taxed too?'<br>
<br>
<a name="Misleading_analogies."></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Misleading
analogies. </span>But see how misleading and false all these analogies
are. The windfalls
which people with artistic gifts are able from time to time to derive
from the sale of a picture -- from a Vandyke or a Holbein -- may here
and there be very considerable. But Pictures do not get in anybody's
way. They do not lay a toll on anybody's labour; they do not touch
enterprise and production at any point; they do not affect any of the
creative processes upon which the material well-being of millions
depends; and if a rise in stocks and shares confers profits on the
fortunate holders far beyond what they expected, or indeed, deserved,
nevertheless, that profit has not been reaped by withholding from the
community the land which it needs, but, on the contrary, apart from
mere gambling, it has been reaped by supplying industry with the
capital without which it could not be carried on. If the railway makes
greater profits, it is usually because it carries more goods and more
passengers. If a doctor or a lawyer enjoys a better practice, it is
because the doctor attends more patients and more exacting patients,
and because the lawyer pleads more suits in the courts and more
important suits. At every stage the doctor or the lawyer is giving
service in return for his fees, and if the service is too poor or the
fees are too high, other doctors and other lawyers can come freely into
competition. There is constant service, there is constant competition;
there is no monopoly, there is no injury to the public interest, there
is no impediment to the general progress.<br>
<br>
<a name="Unearned_increment"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unearned
increment </span>Fancy comparing these healthy processes with the
enrichment which comes
to the landlord who happens to own a plot of land on the outskirts or
at the centre of one of our great cities, who watches the busy
population around him making the city larger, richer, more convenient,
more famous every day, and all the while sits still and does nothing. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Roads are made, streets are made, railway
services are improved, electric light turns night into day, electric
trams glide swiftly to and fro, water is brought from reservoirs a
hundred miles off in the mountains -- and all the while the landlord
sits still. Every one of those improvements is effected by the labour
and at the cost of other people.</span> Many of the most important are
effected at the cost of the municipality and of the ratepayers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To not one of those improvements does the
land monopolist as a land monopolist contribute, and yet by every one
of them the value of his land is sensibly enhanced.</span> He renders
no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general
welfare; he contributes nothing even to the process from which his own
enrichment is derived. If the land were occupied by shops or by
dwellings, the municipality at least would secure the rates upon them
in aid of the general fund, but the land may be unoccupied,
undeveloped, it may be what is called '<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ripening</span>'
-- ripening at the expense of the whole city, of the whole country, for
the unearned increment of its owner. Roads perhaps may have to be
diverted to avoid this forbidden area. The merchant going to his
office, the artisan going to his work, have to make a detour or pay a
tram fare to avoid it. The citizens are losing their chance of
developing the land, the city is losing its rates, the State is losing
its taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
place; and that share has to be replaced at the expense of the other
ratepayers and taxpayers, and the nation as a whole is losing in the
competition of the world -- the hard and growing competition of the
world -- both in time and money. And all the while the land monopolist
has only to sit still and watch complacently his property multiplying
in value, sometimes manifold, without either effort or contribution on
his part; and that is justice!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="Unearned_increment_reaped_in_exact"></a>Unearned increment
reaped in exact proportion to the disservice done. </span>But let us
follow the process a little further. The population of the
city grows and grows still larger year by year, the congestion in the
poorer quarters becomes acute, rents and rates rise hand in hand, and
thousands of families are crowded into one-roomed tenements. There are
120,000 persons living in one-roomed tenements in Glasgow alone at the
present time. At last the land becomes ripe for sale -- that means that
the price is too tempting to be resisted any longer -- and then, and
not till then, it is sold by the yard or by the inch at ten times, or
twenty times, or even fifty times, its agricultural value, on which
alone hitherto it has been rated for the public service. The greater
the population around the land, the greater the injury which they have
sustained by its protracted denial, the more inconvenience which has
been caused to everybody, the more serious the loss in economic
strength and activity, the larger will be the profit of the landlord
when the sale is finally accomplished. In fact, you may say that the
unearned increment on the land is on all fours with the profit gathered
by one of those American speculators who engineer a corner in corn, or
meat, or cotton, or some other vital commodity, and that the unearned
increment in land is reaped by the land monopolist in exact proportion,
not to the service but to the disservice done.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="The_drag_on_enterprise"></a>The
drag on enterprise&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="font-weight: bold;">monopoly
</span>which is the
keynote, and where monopoly prevails, the greater the injury to society
the greater the reward of the monopolist will be. See how all this evil
process strikes at every form of industrial activity. 
<ul>
  <li>The municipality, wishing for broader streets, better houses,
more healthy, decent, scientifically planned towns, is made to pay, and
is made to pay in exact proportion, or to a very great extent in
proportion, as it has exerted itself in the past to make improvements.
The more it has improved the town, the more it has increased the land
value, and the more it will have to pay for any land it may wish to
acquire.  </li>
  <li>The manufacturer proposing to start a new industry, proposing to
erect a great factory offering employment to thousands of hands, is
made to pay such a price for his land that the purchase price hangs
round the neck of his whole business, hampering his competitive power
in every market, clogging him far more than any foreign tariff in his
export competition, and the land values strike down through the profits
of the manufacturer on to the wages of the workman.  </li>
  <li>The railway company wishing to build a new line finds that the
price of land which yesterday was only rated at agricultural value has
risen to a prohibitive figure the moment it was known that the new line
was projected, and either the railway is not built or, if it is, is
built only on terms which largely transfer to the landowner the profits
which are due to the shareholders and the advantages which should have
accrued to the traveling public.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="Every_form_of_enterprise_only_undertaken"></a>Every form of
enterprise only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the
cream off for himself&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It does not matter where you
look or what examples you select, you will
see that every form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is
only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the cream off for
himself, and everywhere today the man or the public body who wishes to
put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land
values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some
cases to no use at all. All comes back to the land value, and its owner
for the time being is able to levy his toll upon all other forms of
wealth and upon every form of industry. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A portion, in some cases the whole, of
every benefit which is laboriously acquired by the community is
represented in the land value, and finds its way automatically into the
landlord's pocket.</span> If there is a rise in wages, rents are able
to move forward, because the workers can afford to pay a little more.
If the opening of a new railway or a new tramway or the institution of
an improved service of workmen's trains or a lowering of fares or a new
invention or any other public convenience affords a benefit to the
workers in any particular district, it becomes easier for them to live,
and therefore the landlord and the ground landlord, one on top of the
other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living there.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="The_landowner_absorbs_a_share_of_almost"></a>The landowner
absorbs a share of almost every public and private benefit&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
years ago in London there was a tollbar on a bridge across the
Thames, and all the working people who lived on the south side of the
river had to pay a daily toll of one penny for going and returning from
their work. The spectacle of these poor people thus mulcted on so large
a proportion of their earnings appealed to the public conscience, an
agitation was set on foot, municipal authorities were roused, and at
the cost of the ratepayers the bridge was freed and the toll removed.
All those people who used the bridge were saved sixpence a week. Within
a very short period from that time the rents on the south side of the
river were found to have advanced by about sixpence a week, or the
amount of the toll which had been remitted. And a friend of mine was
telling me the other day that in the parish of Southwark about &pound;350 a
year, roughly speaking, was given away in doles of bread by charitable
people in connection with one of the churches, and as a consequence of
this the competition for small houses, but more particularly for
single-roomed tenements, is, we are told, so great that rents are
considerably higher than in the neighbouring district. All goes back to
the land, and the landowner, who in many cases, in most cases, is a
worthy person utterly unconscious of the character of the methods by
which he is enriched, is enabled with resistless strength to absorb to
himself a share of almost every public and every private benefit,
however important or however pitiful those benefits may be.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="The_Manchester_Ship_Canal_and_unearned"></a>The Manchester Ship
Canal and unearned increments </span>Now let the Manchester Ship Canal
tell its tale about the land. It has
a story to tell which is just as simple and just as pregnant as its
story about Free Trade. When it was resolved to build the Canal, the
first thing that had to be done was to buy the land. Before the
resolution to build the Canal was taken, the land on which the Canal
flows -- or perhaps I should say 'stands' -- was, in the main,
agricultural land, paying rates on an assessment from 30s. to &pound;2 an
acre. I am told that 4,495 acres of land purchased fell within that
description out of something under 5,000 purchased altogether.
Immediately after the decision, the 4,495 acres were sold for &pound;777,000
sterling -- or an average of &pound;172 an acre -- that is to say, five or
six times the agricultural value of the land and the value on which it
had been rated for public purposes.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now what had the landowner done for
the community; what enterprise had he shown; what service had he
rendered; what capital had he risked in order that he should gain this
enormous multiplication of the value of his property? I will tell you
in one word what he had done. Can you guess it? Nothing.</span><br>
<br>
But it was not only the owners of the land that was needed for making
the Canal, who were automatically enriched. All the surrounding land
either having a frontage on the Canal or access to it rose and rose
rapidly, and splendidly, in value. By the stroke of a fairy wand,
without toil, without risk, without even a half-hour's thought many
landowners in Salford, Eccles, Stretford, Irlam, Warrington Runcorn,
etc., found themselves in possession of property which had trebled,
quadrupled, quintupled in value.<br>
<br>
Apart from the high prices which were paid, there was a heavy bill for
compensation, severance, disturbance, and injurious affection where no
land was taken -- injurious affection, namely, raising the land not
taken many times in value -- all this was added to the dead-weight cost
of construction. All this was a burden on those whose labour skill, and
capital created this great public work. Much of this land today is
still rated at ordinary agricultural value, and in order to make sure
that no injustice is done, in order to make quite certain that these
landowners are not injured by our system of government, half their
rates are, under the Agricultural Rates Act, paid back to them. The
balance is made up by you. The land is still rising in value, and with
every day's work that every man in this neighbourhood does and with
every addition to the prosperity of Manchester and improvement of this
great city, the land is further enhanced in value.<br>
<br>
<a name="The_shareholders_and_the_ratepayers"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The shareholders and the ratepayers </span>I
have told you what happened to the landowners. Let us see what
happened to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">shareholders </span>and
the ratepayers who found the money. The ordinary shareholders, who
subscribed eight millions, have had no dividend yet. The Corporation
loan of five millions interest on which is borne on the rates each
year, had, until 1907, no return upon its capital. A return has come at
last, and no doubt the future prospects are good; but there was a long
interval -- even for the corporation. These are the men who did the
work. These are the men who put up the money. I want to ask you a
question. Do you think it would be very unfair if the owners of all
this automatically created land value due to the growth of the city, to
the enterprise of the community, and to the sacrifices made by the
shareholders -- do you think it would have been very unfair, if they
had been made to pay a proportion, at any rate, of the unearned
increment which they secured, back to the city and the community?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="The_system_to_be_attacked_not"></a>The
system to be attacked, not individuals. </span>I hope you will
understand that when I speak of the land monopolist I
am dealing more with the process than with the individual landowner. I
have no wish to hold any class up to public disapprobation. I do not
think that the man who makes money by unearned increment in land is
morally a worse man than anyone else who gathers his profit where he
finds it in this hard world under the law and according to common
usage. It is not the individual I attack, it is the system. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It is not the man who is bad, it is the law
which is bad. </span>It is not the man who is blameworthy for doing
what the law allows and what other men do; it is the State which would
be blameworthy were it not to endeavour to reform the law and correct
the practice. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We do not want to
punish the landlord. We want to alter the law.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="We_do_not_go_back_on_the_past."></a>We do not go back on the
past.&nbsp; </span>Look at our actual proposal. We do not go back on
the past. We accept
as our basis the value as it stands today. The tax on the increment of
land begins by recognizing and franking the past increment. We look
only to the future, and for the future we say only this, that the
community shall be the partner in any further increment above the
present value after all the owner's improvements have been deducted. We
say that the State and the municipality should jointly levy a toll upon
the future unearned increment of the land. The toll of what? Of the
whole? No. Of a half? No. Of a quarter! No. Of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a fifth</span> -- that is the proposal of
the Budget, and that is robbery, that is Plunder, that is communism and
spoliation, that is the social revolution at last, that is the overturn
of civilized society, that is the end of the world foretold in the
Apocalypse! Such is the increment tax about which so much chatter and
outcry are raised at the present time, and upon which I will say that
no more fair, considerate, or salutary proposal for taxation has ever
been made in the House of Commons.<br>
<br>
<a name="Tax_on_capital_value_undeveloped_land"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Tax on capital value of undeveloped land</span>&nbsp;
But there is another proposal concerning land values which is not less
important. I mean the tax on the capital value of undeveloped urban or
suburban land. The income derived from land and its rateable value
under the present law depend upon the use to which the land is put,
consequently income and rateable value are not always true or complete
measures of the value of the land. Take the case to which I have
already referred of the man who keeps a large plot in or near a growing
town idle for years while it is ripening -- that is to say, while it is
rising in price through the exertions of the surrounding community and
the need of that community for more room to live. Take that case. I
daresay you have formed your own opinion upon it. Mr Balfour, Lord
Lansdowne, and the Conservative Party generally, think that is an
admirable arrangement. They speak of the profits of the land monopolist
as if they were the fruits of thrift and industry and a pleasing
example for the poorer classes to imitate. We do not take that view of
the process. We think it is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">dog-in-the-manger</span>
game. We see the evil, we see the imposture upon the public, and we see
the consequences in crowded slums, in hampered commerce, in distorted
or restricted development, and in congested centres of population, and
we say here and now to the land monopolist who is holding up his land
-- and the pity is it was not said before -- you shall judge for
yourselves whether it is a fair offer or not. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We say to the land monopolist: 'This
property of yours might be put to immediate use with general advantage.
It is at this minute saleable in the market at ten times the value at
which it is rated. If you choose to keep it idle in the expectation of
still further unearned increment, then at least you shall he taxed at
the true selling value in the meanwhile.' </span>And the Budget
proposes a tax of a halfpenny in the pound on the capital value of all
such land; that is to say, a tax which is a little less in equivalent
than the income tax would be upon the property if the property were
fully developed. That is the second main proposal of the Budget with
regard to the land, and its effects will be, 
<ul>
  <li>first, to raise an expanding revenue for the needs of the State;  </li>
  <li>secondly, half the proceeds of this tax, as well as of the other
land taxes, will go to the municipalities and local authorities
generally to relieve rates;  </li>
  <li>thirdly,<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> the effect
will be, as we believe, to bring land into the market, and thus
somewhat cheapen the price at which land is obtainable for every
object, public and private, and by so doing we shall liberate new
springs of enterprise and industry, we shall stimulate building,
relieve overcrowding, and promote employment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="Nothing_new_in_the_principle_of"></a>Nothing new in the
principle of valuation for taxation&nbsp; </span>These two taxes, both
in themselves financially, economically and
socially sound, carry with them a further notable advantage. We shall
obtain a complete valuation of the whole of the land in the United
Kingdom. We shall procure an up-to-date Domesday Book showing the
capital value, apart from buildings and improvement, of every piece of
land. Now, there is nothing new in the principle of valuation for
taxation purposes. It was established fifteen years ago in Lord
Rosebery's Government by the Finance Act of 1894, and it has been
applied ever since without friction or inconvenience by Conservative
administrations. And if there is nothing new in the principle of
valuation, still less is there anything new or unexpected in the
general principles underlying: the land proposals of the Budget. Why,
Lord Rosebery declared himself in favour of taxation of land values
fifteen years ago. Lord Balfour has said a very great many shrewd and
sensible things on this subject which he is, no doubt, very anxious to
have overlooked at the present time. The House of Commons has
repeatedly affirmed the principle, not only under Liberal Governments,
but -- which is much more remarkable -- under a Conservative
Government. Four times during the last Parliament Sir Trevelyan's Bill
for the taxation of land values was brought before the House of Commons
and fully discussed, and twice it was read a second time during the
last Parliament with its great Conservative majority, the second time
by a majority of no less than ninety votes. The House of Lords, in
adopting Lord Camperdown's amendment to the Scottish Valuation Bill,
has absolutely conceded the principle of rating undeveloped land upon
its selling value, although it took very good care not to apply the
principle; and all the greatest municipal corporations in England and
Scotland -- many of them overwhelmingly Conservative in complexion --
have declared themselves in favour of the taxation of land values, and,
after at least a generation of study, examination, and debate, the time
has come when we should take the first step to put these principles
into practical effect.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="The_exemption_of_agricultural_land_from"></a>The exemption of
agricultural land from taxation&nbsp; </span>It is said that the land
taxes fall too heavily upon the agricultural
landowner and the country gentleman. There could be no grosser
misrepresentation of the Budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Few
greater disservices can be done to the agricultural landowner, whose
property has in the last thirty years in many cases declined in value,
than to confuse him with the ground landlord in a great city, who has
netted enormous sums through the growth and the needs of the population
of the city.</span> None of the new land taxes touch agricultural land,
while it remains agricultural land. No cost of the system of valuation
which we are going to carry into effect will fall at all upon the
individual owner of landed property. He will not be burdened in any way
by these proposals. On the contrary, now that an amendment has been
accepted permitting death duties to be paid in land in certain
circumstances, the owner of a landed estate, instead of encumbering his
estate by raising the money to pay off the death duties, can cut a
portion from his estate; and this in many cases will be a sensible
relief.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="The_concession_to_agricultural"></a>The concession to
agricultural landowners </span>Secondly, we have given to agricultural
landowners a substantial
concession in regard to the deductions which they are permitted to make
from income-tax assessment on account of the money which they spend as
good landlords upon the upkeep of their properties, and we have raised
the limit of deduction from twelve and a half per cent to twenty-five
per cent.<br>
<br>
<a name="The_maligned_Development_Bill"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The maligned Development Bill&nbsp; </span>Thirdly,
there is the Development Act, which will help all the
countryside and all classes of agriculturists, and which will help the
landlord in the country among the rest. So much for that charge.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In no great country in the new world
or the old have the working people
yet secured the double advantage of Free Trade and Free Land together.</span><br>
<br>
Every nation in the world has its own way of doing things, its own
successes and its own failures. All over Europe we see systems of land
tenure which economically, socially, and politically are far superior
to ours; but the benefits that those countries derive from their
improved land systems are largely swept away, or at any rate
neutralized, by grinding tariffs on the necessaries of life and the
materials of manufacture. In this country we have long enjoyed the
blessings of Free Trade and of untaxed bread and meat, but against
these inestimable benefits we have the evils of an unreformed and
vicious land system. In no great country in the new world or the old
have the working people yet secured the double advantage of Free Trade
and Free Land together, by which I mean a commercial system and a land
system from which, so far as possible, all forms of monopoly have been
rigorously excluded. Sixty years ago our system of national taxation
was effectively reformed, and immense and undisputed advantages accrued
therefrom to all classes, the richest as well as the poorest. The
system of local taxation today is just as vicious and wasteful, just as
great an impediment to enterprise and progress, just as harsh a burden
upon the poor, as the thousand taxes and Corn Law sliding scales of the
hungry forties. We are met in an hour of tremendous opportunity. You
who shall liberate the land, said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cobden">Mr.
Cobden</a>, will do more for your
country than we have done in the liberation of its commerce. <br>
