<p align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who
Would Jesus Tax?&nbsp; <br>
The Saga of Susan Pace Hamill's Alabama Tax
Crusade</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Alanna Hartzok</div>
<br>
A University of Alabama School of Law Professor has asked God's
forgiveness for the years she lived in the sin of ignorance about tax
injustice. Susan Pace Hamill, a tax expert, business consultant, and
dedicated United Methodist church goer, thought there was a misprint
when she first read that personal incomes as low as $4,600 for a family
of four were being taxed by the state, while timber owners holding 71%
of the land of Alabama were paying less than $1 per acre in property
taxes. Two hours later she found out there had been no mistake and that
Alabama has the most regressive tax code in the country. Her righteous
rage spawned a tax crusade that has reverberated onto the national
scene.<br>
<br>
"As somebody who knows a lot about taxes, I could not have imagined a
design of a tax structure this bad," she said in a <em>Tuscaloosa News</em>story last February. "The state's tax code is really horribly unjust
and has no moral, ethical leg to stand on. Period."<br>
<br>
Alabamians with incomes under $13,000 pay 10.9 percent of their incomes
in state and local taxes while those who make over $229,000 pay just
4.1 percent. Commercial property owners pay more than 50 percent of
property taxes, with homes approaching one-third. Alabama's sales taxes
are among the highest in the nation, up to 10 percent in some areas,
and do not exempt even the most basic necessities such as food. The
state's 1901 constitution was written primarily by large landholders to
secure their economic interests, consequently property taxes are
extremely light on their holdings.<br>
<br>
At the time of her shocked awakening to tax injustice Alabama style,
Hamill was working towards a master's degree in divinity from Beeson
Divinity School at Samford University in Birmingham. She got the idea
to write her thesis paper to expose the gap between Christian
principles and the Alabama tax code. With the assistance of law school
staff, she spent a year researching and writing <em>"An Argument for Tax
Reform Based on Judeo-Christian Ethics."</em><br>
<br>
The thesis grew into a mission that galvanized the latent movement for
tax reform in Alabama and Hamill rapidly became a leading spokesperson
for tax justice. News stories around the state debated her insights and
conclusions and the movement came to the attention of the nation's
leading newspapers.<br>
<br>
The Washington Post (3/23/03) headlined a story "Law Professor Summons
Jesus as a Witness for Tax Reform" and a New York Times editorial
(6/10/03) queried "What Would Jesus Do?" and answered "Sock It to
Alabama's Corporate Landowners.")<br>
<br>
"Alabama's tax system is most abusive because it taxes items like milk,
yet offers tax breaks for certain farm products," she said in a
Huntsville Times (3/26/03) interview. "It's also unfair to allow
timberland (which Hamill found out accounts for 71 percent of Alabama
land) to generate only two percent of all state property taxes."<br>
<br>
While resoundingly condemning the current system (she uses words like
"horrific" and "monstrous injustice") Hamill clearly articulates a tax
reform approach which shifts taxes off of low wage earners and onto
large land owners. Through a combination of her own reasoning, caring
heart, and inherent sense of justice and a thorough investigation of
Judeo-Christian ethics, Hamill arrived at a tax policy approach which
bears remarkable similarities to the economic justice crusades of 19th
century reformer, Henry George.<br>
<br>
Her appeal is to the 93 percent of Alabama residents who call
themselves Christians. Hamill challenges them to put their faith into
practice. Her message fell on many already listening ears. The state's
two largest denominations, United Methodists and Southern Baptists, had
passed resolutions favoring tax reform in 2000. In 2001 the state's
Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Catholics approved similar calls. The
Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama and the Business Council of
Alabama had long clamored for tax change. In fact, tax reform is now
supported by most of the state's religious organizations, according to
Charles Durham, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Tuscaloosa.<br>
<br>
What makes Hamill's work so compelling is her deep grasp of the Alabama
tax code combined with her thorough documentation of the scriptural
bases for economic justice. She quotes chapters and verses which
proclaim that the poor should not be oppressed and that society should
create conditions for their advance. Among her favorites are Jesus'
words in Matthew 25:45: "Whatever you did not do for one of the least
of these, you did not do for me." Luke 16:19-31 is a parable of a rich
man sent to hell because of his indifference to the disadvantaged and
in Jeremiah 22:15-16, "He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and
so all went well."<br>
<br>
While Hamill suspected she would be opposed by special interest groups
like the Alabama Farmers Federation which represents big timber and
agribusiness interests, she was not prepared for the attacks and
underhanded tactics of the Alabama Christian Coalition under the
leadership of President John Giles. While Giles agrees that tax relief
to the less fortunate "is a noble thing" he says the care of the poor
is the duty of private charity not of government and staunchly opposes
tax increases. He tried to damage the Hamill campaign by smearing her
personal integrity, pointing to her signing of a pro-choice petition as
evidence that she therefore could not be a moral authority on tax
reform. Opposing forces also called her a "Yankee carpetbagger"
detailing her work history at two New York law firms. They said
(wrongly so) that her tax proposals would bring huge property increases
on the average home and business.<br>
<br>
Bob Blalock, editorial page editor for <em>The Birmingham News</em>, says that
the "real question about legitimacy should be aimed at the Christian
Coalition. For whom does it speak when it attacks Hamill? Christians,
many of whom would benefit from a fairer tax system, even one that
raised more money? Or powerful special-interest groups (timber?
agribusiness?) that want to protect their obscene tax breaks?" Blalock
says there is no way to know because the law does not require the
Christian Coalition to disclose what individuals or groups fund it.
"When an organization places itself in the center of the debate over
tax reform, citizens deserve to know who's funding its point of view."
(3/14/03)<br>
<br>
Hamill's conservative theology school responded to the attacks by
firmly backing her stance. Faculty at Beeson Divinity School of Samford
University in Birmingham passed a unanimous resolution endorsing her
efforts. "We think what she has proposed is worthy support from the
Christian community and we think it is in keeping with the evangelical
community," said the school's dean, Timothy George (Anniston Star,
3/11/03).<br>
<br>
Frank Thielman, Presbyterian Professor of Divinity at Beeson had this
to say about their resolution: "Personally, I hope it does encourage
dramatic tax reform that helps to relieve the burden of the poor. The
reason I'm hopeful is because of my commitment as a Christian and my
Christian vision. That is a vision that the poor should be dealt with
equitably and fairly and that is a very biblical vision. It's because
of my Christian commitment and the Bible and the word of God that I
hope tax reform efforts succeed." (Anniston Star, 3/11/03)<br>
<br>
In her own defense Hamill stated, "They (Christian Coalition) don't
have anything to say that even touches the integrity and solidarity of
my work, so they're attacking the person and doing it with lies." (The
Tuscaloosa news, 3/13/03). She is considering legal action for
character defamation.<br>
<br>
Baptist-run Samford also printed and distributed thousands of copies
summarizing Hamill's essay in a three-page brochure the size of a
church bulletin.<br>
<br>
More good news about Hamill's tax reform campaign is the potential for
building a wedge between the religious right and the nation's
neoliberal economic agenda. <em>New York Times</em> editorial observer Adam
Cohen had this to say about Alabama's recently elected Republican
Governor Bob Riley: "If the religious right had called up Central
Casting last year to fill the part of governor, they could hardly have
done better than the teetotaling, Bible-quoting businessman from rural
central Alabama who now heads up the state.... Governor Riley has
stunned many of his conservative supporters, and enraged the state's
powerful farm and timber lobbies, by pushing a tax reform plan through
the Alabama Legislature that shifts a significant amount of the state's
tax burden from the poor to wealthy individuals and corporations. And
he has framed the issue in starkly moral terms, arguing that the
current Alabama tax system violates biblical teachings because
Christians are prohibited from oppressing the poor." (6/10/03)<br>
<br>
Riley's tax plan, inspired in large measure by Hamill's prophetic tax
justice ministry, would bring in an additional $1.2 billion in revenue
while raising the income threshold at which families of four start
paying taxes from the current $4,600 a year to more than $17,000,
scrapping the federal income tax deduction, and increasing exemptions
for dependent children. It would give property tax breaks to small
family farms, while costing millions to the state's 500 or so farms and
timber tracts with more than 2,000 acres each, which includes companies
like Weyerhaeuser and Boise Cascade, which own hundreds of thousands of
acres.<br>
<br>
"I've spent a lot of time studying the New Testament and it has three
philosophies: love God, love each other, and take care of the least
among you," said Riley (New York Times, 6/10/03, "What Would Jesus Do?
Sock It to Alabama's Corporate Landowners")<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Alabama voters overwhelmingly voted against the plan on
September 9, 2003. Some said that the poor did not trust the Republican
tax relief plan and the rich had solidly organized against it.
Opponents made hay out of the proposed sales tax increase on
cigarettes, cars and lawn mowers and services like car repairs in a
state where sales taxes already reach 11% in some areas.<br>
<br>
The political divide for and against the tax proposal made for strange
bedfellows. Labor Commissioner Charles Bishop was one of the two
Cabinet members who resigned after Riley made his tax proposal, saying
Alabama voters thought they were getting a tax-cutting conservative who
would eliminate waste, but instead got the opposite.<br>
<br>
Riley was supported by the state teachers' union, black lawmakers and
the Democratic Party, as well as big business groups like the Campaign
for Alabama. His opponents included a coalition of players who had
until recently been his strongest supporters - bankers, farmers, small
business owners, timber interests and conservative groups like the
Alabama Christian Coalition and Americans for Tax Reform.<br>
<br>
It appears that Governor Riley's fears about what would happen if the
state's voters rejected his plan are coming true. Given the enormous
$675 million government deficit, he had to call a session of the
legislature to slash the budget.<br>
<br>
Adam Cohen, reporting again for the New York Times (10/20/03) said "the
budget ax is swinging in Alabama and the carnage is piling up." After
the vote, Governor Riley was forced to cut most state agencies by 18
percent, and other recipients of state funds by 75 percent. Here is a
list of expected results:
<ul>
  <li>A hundred and fifty fewer low-income AIDS patients will receive
life-saving medicines from the state.</li>
  <li>Fifteen thousand low-income Alabamians may lose their
hypertension drugs.</li>
  <li>High Hopes, a program that offers after-school tutoring to
students who fail the high school graduation exam, is being slashed.</li>
  <li>Up to 1,500 poor children and adults with Down syndrome, autism
and other disabilities will not be able to attend a state-supported
special-needs camp.</li>
  <li>The court system is laying off 500 of 1,600 workers, from clerk's
office employees to probation officers.</li>
  <li>The health department is losing investigators who track
tuberculosis, and sharply reducing restaurant inspections.</li>
</ul>
Cohen reports that the impact of the NO vote for tax reform is being
blunted by a fortuitous one-time injection of federal funds. "Next year
agencies are bracing for a 56 percent hit. If the state cannot find
more revenue - and Governor Riley is searching - it may be nearly
impossible for basic services, including courts, prisons and police, to
operate," he said. "Last month, Alabama voted for fewer social
services, less education, and a shoddier legal system - to become, that
is, more like a third-world nation... Governor Riley's setback last
month is being hailed by national antitax forces as a great victory.
But if Alabama heads into next year without additional revenues,
students may have to learn without textbooks, prisoners may be released
early, and people may start dying of preventable diseases. We should
all pay attention, because if the "starve the beast" (of government
finance) crowd continues to prevail in Washington, as goes Alabama so
may go the nation."<br>
<br>
Despite losing this battle, hopefully the moral and ethical forces for
tax justice that were awakened by Hamill and her momentous campaign
will continue to move forward, refining and developing their strategy.
Hamill is an articulate and impassioned tax reform crusader who is
standing on solid moral and ethical ground. Her voice and the voices of
those responding to her message will continue to sound.<br>
<br>
The Alabama tax shift movement has not yet been fully exposed to the
political, economic and spiritual insights of Henry George, nor have
the ethical dimensions and scriptural imperatives concerning ownership
of land in the Judeo-Christian tradition emerged as keynotes. In the
opinion of this writer, the time is approaching when the full message
of securing human rights to the earth via fundamental tax reform will
be heard by the nation. By that time Alabama's Susan Pace Hamill will
have played a magnificent leading role in the story. Hamill's thesis
and other related materials are posted on the web at<a

masters of divinity thesis, "An Argument for Tax Reform Based on
Judeo-Christian Ethics" which was also published in the Alabama Law
Review. Although Wyn and Bob have been following the Alabama movement
closely and made some contact with Hamill, a strong connection between
Hamill and the Georgist movement has not yet been forged. Such contact
