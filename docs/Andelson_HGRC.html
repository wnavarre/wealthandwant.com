<p>With the fall of the Iron Curtain, people all over the world seem
to be searching for a "Middle Way." Except in North Korea and Cuba,
doctrinaire Marxism has been repudiated virtually everywhere, even by
the Left. Socialism has become pass&eacute;. Its adherents are no
longer riding the crest of the wave of the future. Even the most
energetic apostles of federal meddling, John Kenneth Galbraith, for
example, eschew the Socialist label.</p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, the free market economists of the
classical period would scarcely recognize Capitalism as we know it in
America today. Such luminaries of industry and finance as Lee Iacocca
and Felix Rohatyn advocate a measure of government intervention that
would have seemed entirely insupportable to Cobden or Ricardo. In the
political field, the major candidates differ mainly on matters of
degree. It is not so much a question of "Shall there be federal aid?"
as of "How much federal aid shall there be?" or of "How shall it be
administered?" As long ago as the late 1940s, "Mr. Conservative"
himself, Senator Robert A. Taft, sponsored a bill for federal
housing. Later, another Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, was a
major architect of the food stamp program, which is itself a dole,
not just for the poor, but, above all, for agribusiness. A Republican
president, Richard Nixon, instituted price controls, and cut the
dollar loose from its last tenuous backing with the cynical quip, "We
are all Keynesians now."</p>
<p>But what we are presented with, from Right to Left, is not a
coordinated structure embodying the best elements from both sides,
not even a well-thought-out attempt at syncretism, but rather a
bewildering welter of jerry-built solutions, each one based on
political and emotional considerations and lacking any functional
relationship to a unified system of socio-economic truth &#8212; let alone
any rootage in a grand scheme of teleology or ethics.</p>
<p>A little Socialism here, and a little Capitalism there; a concern
for the public sector here, and a concession to the profit motive
there; a sop to the "underprivileged" here, and a bow to incentive
there &#8212; put them all together, and what have you got? Nothing but a
great big rag-bag, a haphazard pastiche of odds and ends without any
bones and without any guts!</p>
<p><b>Nevertheless, there is a Middle Way. There is a body of
socio-economic truth which incorporates the best insights of both
Capitalism and Socialism. </b>Yet they are not insights that are
artificially woven together to form a deliberate compromise. Instead,
they arise naturally, with a kind of inner logic, from the profound
ethical distinction which is the system's core. They arise
remorselessly from an understanding of the meaning of the
commandment: "<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou shalt not steal.</a>" This Middle Way is the
philosophy associated with the name of Henry George.</p>
<p><b>I like to picture economic theory as a vast jigsaw puzzle
distributed across two tables, one called Capitalism and the other,
Socialism.</b> But mingled with the genuine pieces of the puzzle are
many false pieces, also distributed across both tables. Most of us
are either perceptively limited to one table, or else we are unable
to distinguish the genuine pieces from the false. But Henry George
knew how to find the right pieces, and, therefore, he was able to put
the puzzle together &#8212; at least in its general outlines. I don't
claim that he was infallible, or that there isn't further work to be
done. Yet if I find a little piece of puzzle missing here or there,
it doesn't shake my confidence in the harmony of the overall pattern
he discerned. It doesn't make me want to sweep the puzzle onto the
floor and start all over again from scratch.</p>
<p>Henry George was born in 1839 in Philadelphia, and died in 1897 in
New York City. It was in the San Francisco of the 1870s that he wrote
his masterwork, <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>. For the greater
part of his adult life he had been a working newspaperman, beginning
as an apprentice typesetter and making his way up to the editor's
desk. His was a peculiarly Californian saga. His philosophy was
forged out of his observation of conditions in a burgeoning new
state, where he was able to examine, as in a laboratory, the genesis
and development of social and economic processes. <b><i>Progress and
Poverty</i></b> has been translated into at least 27 languages.</p>
<p><b>Among books of nonfiction, its sale was for many decades
exceeded only by the Bible. At Oxford University, in the English
literature department, it is used as a model of the finest prose.</b>
The rest of Henry George's life was one great crusade for social
justice, at the end of which he literally martyred himself by
campaigning for public office against his doctors' urging. In the
midst of the campaign he died, and was spontaneously accorded the
greatest funeral that New York City had ever witnessed.</p>
<p>His genius has been glowingly acknowledged by such renowned
figures as philosophers <a href="../HG/PP/Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html">John Dewey</a> and Mortimer J. Adler, presidents
Woodrow Wilson and Dwight D. Eisenhower, scientists Alfred Russel
Wallace and Albert Einstein, essayists John Ruskin and Albert Jay
Nock, jurists Louis D. Brandeis and <a href="Seabury_HG100.htm">Samuel Seabury</a>, columnists
  <a href="Buckley_HG.html">William F. Buckley</a> and Michael Kinsley, and statesmen <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
Churchill</a> and Sun Yat-sen. These names cover the entire political
spectrum from Conservative to Liberal, yet all of them saw something
of immense value in George's thought. I'll take time to quote from
only one of these testimonials &#8212; the one by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the
founder and first president of the Republic of China. "I intend," he
declared, "to devote my future to the welfare of the Chinese people.
The teachings of Henry George will be the basis of our program of
reform." I think we may safely say that had Dr. Sun lived to carry
out his promise, the Chinese mainland would not today be Red. But
<b>Taiwan</b>, where it has been carried out, by no means fully but
to a considerable extent, has, as a result, witnessed a spectacular
transformation from abysmal poverty to vibrant prosperity distributed
so as to benefit all levels of the population.</p>
<p>I said that I'd quote from only one testimonial, and I'll keep my
word. But I do consider it apposite to mention that Count Tolstoy,
author of <b><i>War and Peace</i></b>, <b><i>Anna Karenina</i></b>,
and of the explicitly Georgist novel, <b><i>Resurrection</i></b>,
wrote a long letter to Tsar Nicholas II in January, 1902, warning of
mounting public disaffection, and pleading for reform along Georgist
lines as the most immediate measure necessitated both by the demands
of justice and the threat of socialist revolution. It was followed in
May of the same year by a letter to another member of the imperial
family, spelling out the specifics of George's proposal. May one not
reasonably assume that, had Tolstoy's warning and plea been heeded,
Russia would have been spared more than seven decades of Communist
tyranny; its satellite and subject nations, their respective periods
of Marxist domination; and the West, the burden of the Cold War? Or
that, by disregarding that warning and that plea, Nicholas II
forfeited the lives of hapless millions, including, ironically, his
own and those of his cherished wife and children?</p>
<p>For a long time, it was the fashion among academic economists to
ignore or patronize Henry George &#8212; whether for his lack of formal
credentials, for his propensity to mingle moral arguments with
economic ones, or for other perceived intellectual crimes even more
monstrous. Today, this is becoming less and less the case, although,
of course, there were honorable exceptions from the outset. But now
we find economists of every stripe, including at least four Nobel
laureates, united in agreement that George has much to say that is of
vital contemporary importance. The list is far too long to read in
its entirety, but it includes such names as Gary Becker, Kenneth
Boulding, James Buchanan, <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>, <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/auth/Gaffney.html">Mason Gaffney</a>, Lowell
Harriss, Alfred Kahn, Arthur Laffer, <a href="../themes/quotable_nobels.htm">Franco
Modigliani</a>, Warren
Samuels, <a href="../themes/quotable_nobels.htm">Robert Solow</a>, <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/Tobin.html">James Tobin</a>,
and <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_on_Vickrey.html">William Vickrey</a> &#8212; the last
of whom served recently as president of the American Economic
Association.</p>
In the preface to the fourth edition of <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and
Poverty</i></b></a>, Henry George wrote: "What I have done in this
book,
if I have correctly solved the great problem I have sought to
investigate, is to unite the truth perceived by the school of
[Adam] Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the
schools of Proudhon and Lasalle; to show that laissez faire (in its
full true meaning) opens the way to a realization of the noble dreams
of socialism..." <b>Let us return now to our illustration of the
economic jigsaw puzzle, and take a look at the pieces which he
selected from the two tables of Capitalism and Socialism. ... </b>
<p>We will begin with the Capitalist table. George considered himself
a purifier of Capitalism, not its enemy. He built upon the
foundations laid by the classical economists. The skeleton of his
system is essentially Capitalist. In fact, Karl Marx referred to
George's teaching as "Capitalism's last ditch." George believed in
competition, in the free market, in the unrestricted operation of the
laws of supply and demand. He distrusted government and despised
bureaucracy. He was no egalitarian leveler; the only equality he
sought was equal freedom of opportunity. Actually, what he intended
was to make free enterprise truly free, by ridding it of the
monopolistic hobbles which prevent its effective operation.</p>
<p>In his book, <b><i>The Condition of Labor</i></b>, George said:
"We differ from the Socialists in our diagnosis of the evil, and we
differ from them in remedies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We have no fear of capital, regarding
it as the natural handmaiden of labor;  </li>
  <li>we look on interest in itself
as natural and just;  </li>
  <li>we would set no limit to accumulation, nor
impose on the rich any burden that is not equally placed on the poor;  </li>
  <li>we see no evil in competition, but deem unrestricted competition
to
be as necessary to the health of the industrial and social organism
as the free circulation of the blood is to the bodily organism -- to
be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation is to be secured."</li>
</ul>
<b>Why did George take so many pieces from the Capitalist table?
Because, I think, they are all corollaries of one big piece, namely,
the moral justification for private property. </b>You see, George,
who was a devout though non-sectarian Christian, had a stout belief
in the God-given dignity of the individual. This dignity, he held,
demands that we recognize that the individual possesses an absolute
and inalienable right to himself, which is forfeited only when he
refuses to accord the same right to others. The right to one's self
implies the right to one's labor, which is an extension of one's
self, and therefore to the product of one's labor &#8212; to use it, to
enjoy it, to give it away, to destroy it, to bequeath it, or even (if
one so desires) to bury it in the ground.
<p><b>Now, taxation as ordinarily understood, especially when based
upon the "ability to pay" principle, is a denial of this right. It is
a denial of it because it represents a tribute levied on the product
of an individual's labor.</b> It is a denial of it because it rests
upon the assumption that the community at large has a right to assess
individuals disproportionately to the benefits which they receive
from the community at large. And so George rejects as collectivistic
many institutions that most present-day defenders of free enterprise
would never dream of questioning &#8212; income taxes, tariffs, sales
taxes, corporate taxes, personal property taxes, etc. This makes him
in one sense an arch-Conservative, yet prominent Socialists like
Walter Rauschenbusch and George Bernard Shaw have testified that it
was Henry George who first kindled their concern for social justice.
<b>To understand the reason for this, we must direct our attention to
the other table, the table labeled "Socialism."</b></p>
<p>In fitting together the economic jigsaw puzzle, George took only
two pieces from the Socialist table. But what large and what
strategic pieces they were! </p>
<ul>
  <li>The first of these was his insistence that all persons come into
the world with an equal right of access to the goods of nature. </li>
  <li>The second was his contention that the community has a right to
take that which the community produces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, these pieces had landed on the Socialist table only by
default. They had originally been part of the theory of Capitalism,
as outlined by John Locke, the Physiocrats, and Adam Smith. But
Capitalism in practice ignored them, and so became a distorted
caricature. George's notion was to rescue these lost elements, and
restore balance and proportion to the Capitalist table.</p>
<p>Now, if private property derives its moral justification from the
right of a human being to the fruits of his or her own efforts,
clearly the land and the other goods of nature do not belong in the
category of private property because no human efforts created them.
And the value that attaches to them is not the result of anything
their title-holder does to them; it is the result of the presence and
activity of the community around them. Someone can build a skyscraper
in the desert and the ground upon which it stands will not be worth a
penny more because of it, yet a city lot with nothing on it may be
worth a fortune simply because of the number of people who pass by it
daily.</p>
<p><b>Why, asked Henry George in effect, should private individuals
be allowed to fatten upon the unearned increment of land &#8212; upon the
rise in value which the community creates because of population
increase and the growth of public services? </b>Why should certain
people be allowed to levy tribute upon others who desire access to
their common heritage? But, you might object, the present owner may
have paid hard-earned money for his land. Has he not, therefore, a
vested right? To this, George would have answered: If one unwittingly
buys stolen goods, the rectitude of one's intentions establishes no
right against the legitimate owner of those goods.</p>
<p>Henry George was not the first thinker to comprehend the
difference between land and other kinds of property. John Locke said
that "God gave the world in common to all mankind.... When the
'sacredness' of property is talked of, it should be remembered that
any such sacredness does not belong in the same degree to landed
property." William Blackstone wrote: "The earth, and all things
therein, are the general property of all man-kind, from the immediate
gift of the Creator." Thomas Paine stated that "men did not make the
earth... It is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth
itself, that is individual property." According to Thomas Jefferson,
"The earth is given as a common stock for men to labor and live
on."</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill wrote: "The increase in the value of land,
arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community, should
belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
title." Abraham Lincoln said: "The land, the earth God gave to man
for his home, sustenance, and support, should never be the possession
of any man, corporation, society, or unfriendly government, any more
than the air or water, if as much." In the words of Herbert Spencer,
"equity does not permit property in land ... The world is God's
bequest to mankind. All men are joint heirs to it."</p>
<p><b>But it was Henry George who emphasized this distinction and
placed it at the very center of his system.</b> At present we have
the ironic spectacle of the community penalizing the individual for
his industry and initiative, and taking away from him a share of that
which he produces, while at the same time lavishing upon the
nonproducer undeserved windfalls which it &#8212; the community &#8212;
produces. Henry George built his whole program around the principle:
Let the individual keep all of that which he or she produces, and let
the community keep all of that which it produces.</p>
<p><b>Land monopoly is the great monkey-wrench which is caught in the
works of the free enterprise system, and which prevents the proper
meshing of its gears; it is the hidden cancer that is eating out the
heart of Capitalism. </b>Early in this century, a great statesman
described its virulent effects in the following words:</p>
<blockquote><i>While the land is what is called "ripening"for the
unearned increment of its owner, the merchant going to his office and
the artisan going to his work must detour or pay a fare to avoid it.
The people lose their chance of using the land, the city and state lose
the taxes which would have accrued if the natural development had taken
place, and all the while the land monopolist has only to sit still and
watch complacently his property multiplying in value, sometimes many
fold, without either effort or contribution on his part.</i>
  <p><i>This evil process strikes at every form of industrial activity.
The municipality, wishing for broader streets, better houses, more
healthy, decent, scientifically planned towns, is made to pay more to
get them in proportion as it has exerted itself to make past
improvements. The more it has improved the town, the more it will have
to pay for any land it may now wish to acquire for further improvements.</i></p>
  <p><i>The manufacturer proposing to start a new industry, proposing
to erect a great factory offering employment to thousands of hands, is
made to pay such a price for his land that the purchase price hangs
around the neck of his whole business, hampering his competitive power
in every market, clogging him far more than any foreign tariff in his
export competition, and the land price strikes down through the profits
of the manufacturer on to the wages of the workman.</i></p>
  <p><i>No matter where you look or what examples you select, you will
see that every form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is
only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the cream off for
himself, and everywhere today the man or the public body that wishes to
put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land
values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some
cases to no use at all. All comes back to the land value, and its owner
is able to levy toll upon all other forms of wealth and every form of
industry.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="Churchill_TPL.html">Those were the words of Winston Churchill</a>. And <b>if you will
examine the history of the major American depressions, you will find
that virtually every one of them was preceded by a period of intense
land speculation which had an inflationary effect upon the whole
economy. In 1836, in 1857, in 1873, in 1893, and in 1929 &#8212; in every
instance, the big crash was precipitated by the bursting of the land
bubble.</b></p>
<p>The purely economic ramifications of land monopoly are so vast as
to be staggering. Land monopoly does not affect rents alone. It
affects wages, prices, production, the cost of government, and the
distribution of purchasing power. It is the major cause of slums and
blighted areas. It is the greatest single breeder of revolution
around the world.</p>
<p>Had it not been for land monopoly, the Bolsheviks could never have
gained power in Russia. Mao Tse-tung and his so-called "agrarian
reformers" (and I use that term advisedly) could never have wrested
control of China. Fidel Castro would never have arisen in Cuba.
Because of land monopoly, El Salvador has endured decades of
murderous civil war. Because of land monopoly, the Amazon rain forest
is being rapidly destroyed to make room for settlers who have been
denied a foothold elsewhere except on terms that offer little better
than starvation. These are just a few obvious examples, taken almost
at random. Because of land monopoly, Latin America and the Middle
East are veritable tinder boxes, ready to explode at any moment. We
in the U.S. may not yet have reached that state, but we're moving in
that direction. How much longer can we go on propping up a rotten
structure by borrowing against the future?</p>
<p><b>Well, exactly how did Henry George propose to deal with the
problem of land monopoly?</b> Did he advocate that privately held
land should be expropriated and divided up? Quite the contrary. That
remedy is as ultimately ineffective as it is ancient. <b>There is
more truth than fiction in the aphorism that the French Revolution
delivered the peasants from the aristocrats only to hand them over to
the usurers, and what was true of the peasants was equally true of
the soil they tilled.</b> Thus has it ever been with programs of
expropriation and redistribution.</p>
<p><b>Under Henry George's system, private land titles would not be
disturbed one iota.</b> No one would be expropriated. Instead, the
community would simply take something approaching the total annual
economic rent of land for public purposes. This amount would be
determined by the value of each site on the free market, not by any
arbitrary governmental fiat. In other words, the privilege of
monopolizing a site is a benefit received from society and for which
society should be fully compensated; and so, under the Georgist
system, the person who wished to monopolize a site would pay a rent
for it to the community, approaching 100 percent of its annual rental
value, exclusive of improvements.</p>
<p>Let me emphasize that last phrase, <em><strong>"exclusive of improvements</strong></em>."</p>
<ul>
  <li>The apartment house owner would pay the full value of his lot,
and nothing on his building; </li>
  <li>the factory owner would pay the full value of his site, and
nothing on his factory; </li>
  <li>the farmer would pay the full value of his ground, and nothing on
his structures or his crop, his livestock or his machinery; </li>
  <li>the homeowner would pay the full value of his lot, and nothing on
his house. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the land had no market value, the owner would pay nothing; if
it had a value, he would pay regardless of whether he were using it
or deriving income from it.</p>
<p><b>This would, of course, eliminate all speculative profit in
landholding, squeeze the "speculative water" out of land prices, and
in effect bring back the frontier by making cheap land readily
available to everyone &#8212; at least initially. <i>The result would be
to raise the margin of production, increase real wages, and stimulate
building and productivity.</i></b><i> </i>Eventually, the flourishing
economy would cause use value to exceed the former speculative value,
but instead of being engrossed by those who make no contribution to
the economy, land rent would flow into the public coffers in place of
taxes levied upon labor and capital. The land-value charge is really
what <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/auth/Rybeck.html">Walt Rybeck</a> so aptly calls "a
super user's fee." For the
privilege of exclusive access to and disposition of a site and its
natural resources, the owner pays an indemnity to those who are
thereby dispossessed &#8212; an indemnity reflecting precisely the market
value of his privilege, collected through the tax mechanism and
relieving them of the burden of payment for public services. What
could be more fair?</p>
<p>Actually, I daresay that each one of you, probably without
realizing it, frequently pays something that partakes of the
principle of such a "super user's fee" whether you own land or not.
<b>Every time you put money in a parking meter, you are purchasing a
temporary monopoly of the parking space.</b> Don't ever complain
about having to put money in a public parking meter; it's a bargain
for you. You're getting a free gift from the community &#8212; the
difference between what you pay and what a commercial parking lot in
the vicinity would charge!</p>
<p>I have spoken of land monopoly as a cancer, and so it is. Yet land
often cannot be used efficiently unless monopolized. The Georgist
remedy does not provide for the excision of land monopoly but rather
for its transformation from malignant to benign. For the monopoly of
land can be fair and even salutary if the monopolizer pays into the
public treasury a sum that reflects substantially the market value of
his privilege.</p>
<p><b>Perhaps this would be a good place to interject that when
economists speak of "land," they are talking about nature. The term
embraces not only space on the earth's surface but also natural
resources &#8212; oil in the ground, virgin timber, wildlife, the oceans
and other natural bodies of water, the airwaves, airspace, etc. To
capture for the public the value of these natural goods, land-value
charges may in some cases need to be supplanted by or combined with
other methods such as severance taxes and auctioning of leases. But
the principle is the same.</b></p>
<p>If time were not limited, I could talk at length about specific
advantages of the Georgist system. I could go into the "canons of
taxation," and show how it fulfills better than any other method
these ideal criteria whereby economists measure the effectiveness of
a system of public revenue. I could give concrete illustrations of
how it is working right now in Denmark, in Australia, in New Zealand,
in Taiwan, and even in some areas in the U.S.</p>
<p>This is not the idle pipe-dream of an armchair visionary. It has
been tested by experience. Let me just cite the Hutchinson Report, a
survey comparing the various Australian states in terms of the degree
to which they use the Henry George approach. It found that wages,
purchasing power, growth of industry, volume of retail sales, land
under cultivation, value of improvements, and population gain through
immigration from other states were in every case greater in direct
ratio to the proportion of revenues derived from the public
collection of ground rent. To me, this is the most conclusive
argument anyone could ask for!</p>
<p>Of course, Henry George's proposal has nowhere been fully
implemented. Even where it has been implemented substantially, its
beneficial impact has invariably been blunted by countervailing
policies, oftentimes at other levels of government. <b>It is not a
panacea. To be completely effective, it would need to be supplemented
by other reforms, such as measures to assure a stable currency.</b>
But of it this much can be said: All other systems have been found
wanting. This alone has worked whenever and wherever it has been
tried to the extent that it has been tried. I submit that it is now
deserving of actualization on a broader and more thoroughgoing
scale.</p>
<p>Nobody, to my knowledge, advocates that it be instituted whole-hog
overnight. But it could be phased in in easy stages so as to obviate
the risk of shock and dislocation. <b>And it is my considered opinion
that, by the time the system were in full effect, the revenues
produced by collecting land values alone would suffice to meet all
legitimate public needs.</b> This may not have been true during the
Cold War, with its staggering burden of nuclear defense. But with
that burden lifted, and with the need for welfare of all kinds
evaporated because of the full employment and other social benefits
that the system would naturally engender, and for other reasons,
which time precludes my specifying here, I really think that we could
dispense with taxes on incomes, improvements, sales, imports, and all
the rest. If I am unduly optimistic in this belief, and the public
appropriation of land-values were insufficient, this would be no
argument against using it as far as it could go.</p>
<p>There are two things which a government can never do and still be
just: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The first of these is to take for public purposes what rightfully
belongs to private individuals or corporations. </li>
  <li>The second is to give to private individuals or corporations what
rightfully belongs to the public. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>All wealth that is privately produced rightfully belongs to
private individuals or corporations, and for the government to
appropriate it is unjust. But land rent is publicly produced, and for
the government to give it to private individuals or corporations is
equally unjust. </b>He who thinks himself prepared to justify in
principle the private monopolization of land rent, must also be
prepared to justify in principle the jobbery of the Tweed Ring and
the looting of Teapot Dome &#8212; not to mention the escapades of Michael
Milken, Ivan Boesky, and Charles Keating.</p>
<p>In closing, I will summarize with a quotation from the late Dr.
Viggo Starke, for many years a member of the Danish cabinet: "What I
produce is mine. All mine! What you produce is yours. All yours! But
that which none of us produced, but which we all lend value to
together, belongs by right to all of us in common." This, in a
nutshell, is the philosophy of Henry George.</p>
