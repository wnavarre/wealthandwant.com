</div>
<p>From a moral perspective, taxation is dubious or worse. We tell
  our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
  owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
  Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</p>
<p>The dubiousness of taxation increases when we consider its
origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</p>
<p>There is a gentler side of taxation that provides some explanation
of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</p>
<p>The problem of morality in taxation is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do we
retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
of plunder?  </li>
  <li>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
impose on our fellow citizens?  </li>
  <li>And how do we set up a structure of
government that will ensure that these limits are observed?  </li>
</ul>
The
turn-of-the-century Swedish economist, Knut Wicksell, had ideas that
dealt with some of these questions (Wicksell, 1958 [1896]).
Wicksell argued that if a public expenditure is worthwhile, then
there must be some allocation among citizens of the taxes that are
needed to finance the expenditure that would make everyone better
off. If legislatures were required to achieve unanimity to pass
spending programs, then they would have to find allocations of taxes
that were unanimously acceptable before they could pass those
programs. In that case, majorities would have no opportunity to
exploit minorities, and inefficient proposals would be prevented from
passing as well. Wicksell recognized that if complete unanimity were
required, strategic holdouts would be likely to prevent any program
from passing, so he was content to recommend a rule of
"near-unanimity," without being specific about what this meant.
<p>While Wicksell's insights are interesting, they do not fully solve
the problem of moral taxation, because any departure from unanimity
opens the door to exploitation of minorities, and the requirement of
more-than-majority approval means that the costs of
coalition-building will leave some worthwhile activities unapproved.
Still, we would probably have a much more efficient public sector if
every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
bodies.</p>
<p>But to make taxation truly voluntary, the option to leave must be
viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
public services (Tiebout, 1956).</p>
<p>Of course, moving will always have some costs, so the ideal will
not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
lower levels of government.</p>
<p>Consider the economic equilibrium of such a system. What taxes
should one expect to find? If it is very inexpensive to move from one
place to another, then the utility that people achieve in any one
community cannot be significantly lower that what they would achieve
in any other community, and localities will only be able to tax
people to the extent that their presence in the community generates
net costs to the community. And there are some costs of added
population --&nbsp; greater congestion, perhaps higher costs of fire
and police protection, and perhaps other costs as well. But there are
also benefits to a community of greater population, arising from the
opportunity of all other residents to trade with the new residents.
Thus communities would not be able to raise much revenue from income
tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
localities could finance themselves.</p>
<p>Such a conclusion would be unwarranted, because there is a very
significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
taxed in proportion to the land they possess, no land moves to
another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
activities
that ought to be undertaken, and  </li>
  <li>would such a system be fair?</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider first the question of adequacy of revenue. There is a
theorem in economics, known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
Henry George Theorem</span>, that
addresses this question (Arnott and Stiglitz, 1979). One of the
simpler versions of this theorem is: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the following three conditions are met:</p>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Public expenditures provide
benefits only over a limited area, <br>
2. People can move costlessly, and <br>
3. The number of persons who value a public service as highly as anyone
does exceeds the number of persons who can live in the area where the
service provides benefits,</blockquote>
then for any public service that is worth at least as much as it costs
to those who receive it, the increase in the rental value of land that
results from providing the service exceeds the net cost of the service.</div>
<p>The Henry George Theorem is true because people who can move
  costlessly will bid up the rental value of land to reflect the value
  of public services that are not available elsewhere. The assumption
  that the number of bidders exceeds the number of people who can
  benefit from the public service guarantees that the upward movement
  of rents will not end until all the benefits of the public service
  are reflected in these rents. If some people who receive a public
  service value it more highly than others, then they will receive a
  surplus in addition to the rent they pay for land, and some
  worthwhile increments of public services will not add quite enough to
  rent to pay for themselves (Tideman 1993). But rent increments will
  go a very long way toward paying for worthwhile local public
  services.</p>
<p>With some local public services, such as weather reports that are
broadcasted by radio at a specified wattage, there is no social cost
of having another person within the reception area use the service.
With others, such as distribution of water, the extra cost of one
additional user will be noticeable, but still a relatively small
fraction of the average cost of the service. For public services to
provide the greatest possible net value, users must be charged the
costs of additional use (what economists call marginal cost). If they
are charged less than marginal cost, self-interest will motivate them
to use the service wastefully. And if they are charged more than
marginal cost, self-interest will motivate them to economize
inefficiently on the service. </p>
<p><b>Thus local public services are financed efficiently when users
are required to pay marginal costs, and the component of total cost
that is not covered by marginal cost charges is financed by levies on
land that collect the increases in rental value of land that result
from provision of the service.</b> If all citizens in a locality
valued the service equally, then every increment in the level of the
service that was worthwhile would have a cost that was less than or
equal to the sum of the revenue that could be raised from charges for
use equal to marginal cost and the increase in the rental value of
land in the community that resulted from the availability of the
service. When people value the service differently, the increase in
the rental value of land that results from the provision of a service
will be less than the value of the service to those who receive it.
By a criterion of maximizing the real incomes of residents, the best
outcome that covers the full cost of a service will involve a level
of service somewhat lower than that for which marginal cost is equal
to the sum of marginal benefits, along with charges that exceed
somewhat the marginal cost of providing the service to additional
persons. Still, in general, the combination of user fees
approximately equal to marginal cost and taxes on land to finance the
remainder of costs is capable of providing financing for local public
services that is adequate and reasonably efficient.</p>
<p><b>Next consider fairness.</b> The fairness of such financing is
the fairness of incremental decisions in an environment in which the
initial allocation is fair. (It does not provide special
opportunities for disadvantaged persons. They would need to be
provided for by insurance that operated independently of the
provision of public goods.) A person who is treated fairly in the
absence of public goods cannot reasonably complain about being
required to pay for a service according to its marginal cost, or
about have to pay the value that is added to his land by the
availability of a public service.</p>
<p>In the latter case, there is an argument that must be answered. A
person may say, "It is true that the provision of this public service
adds as much to the rental value of my land as I am being taxed, but
that is what the service is worth to someone else who might use my
land. It's not worth that to me. In fact, the 'service' reduces my
well-being." </p>
<p>Here we have a difficulty. We have no way of identifying the value
of a service that is provided to a person without his request. If we
express a willingness to respond to such statements, people will have
a motive for faking a lack of interest in the service in order to
reduce their tax bills. If a person can point to some characteristic
of his circumstances that would tend to support the claim that he
does not value the service (for example, if the service is concerts
in the park and the person is deaf, or if the services is a sewer
line and the person just put in a new septic system), then we may
have an obligation to compensate the person for raising his taxes to
pay for something that he does not value. But when the person can
point to no such special circumstances, he should bear the cost.
People should understand that one of the risks of moving into a
community is that their fellow citizens may decide to provide a local
public service that most people value but they do not. At worst, the
aggrieved person will have to bear the costs of moving (including the
psychological costs). Thus if any compensation is offered to people
who have characteristics that suggest that they do not value a public
service that raises the value of their land, the compensation that
they receive should have an upper limit of the loss in the value of
things attached to the land (the septic system) plus the financial
and psychological costs of moving. While we need to watch out for
fakers, these are real costs, and a public service is only worthwhile
if its benefits exceed its full costs, including losses in the value
of capital and in the human satisfaction of those who did not want
change. </p>
<p>The fairness of such a tax system might also be questioned from
another perspective. If people are required to pay the costs of the
public services that they use, then who will pay for schools?</p>
<p>There are two possible answers. </p>
<ul>
  <li>One possibility is that people will agree on the value of living
in a community where children are well educated, whether they have
children or not, and they will find the presence of another child in
the community to be a benefit for which the cost of educating the child
is not too high a price to pay. In this case, educational expenditures
add to the value of land throughout the community, and education can be
financed efficiently by land taxes, without requiring students or their
parents to pay. Those who pay will be receiving benefits that are equal
to what they pay. </li>
  <li>The second possibility is that there will be a consensus that,
whether anyone wants to pay or not, education is a birthright of all
children. In this case, the birthright can be financed efficiently by a
tax on land, since land does not leave town or work less hard when it
is taxed.</li>
</ul>
<p>But is such a tax fair? Consider first a case in which everyone
has the same number of children. Then the taxation of land value to
finance education is equivalent to the assertion of an equal claim of
everybody to land. And there is a good basis for such a claim. No one
made the land. The titles to land that we recognize today generally
originated in conquest. Our affection for the words of the
Declaration of Independence, that "All men are created equal," in
conjunction with the recognition that titles to land are privileges
that are created by government, should lead us to the implication
that we have an obligation to share the benefits of land equally. As
Henry George pointed out (1960 [1879], 403-407), the sensible
way to assert equal rights to land is not to divide the land equally,
but rather to collect the rent of land and use it for public
purposes. A tax on land takes for public purposes only what nature,
public services, and the growth of communities produce, unlike taxes
on labor and capital, which take what people produce and which people
may properly resent having taken from them. Thus, at least when
everyone has the same number of children, it is fair to finance
education by taxing land.</p>
<p>Now consider how the situation changes when people have different
numbers of children. Consider two possibilities. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, it is possible that additional children provide a benefit
to everyone in society, because the number of persons with whom
everyone can interact will be greater. If this benefit is as large as
the cost of education, then there is no unfairness in paying for the
education of all children from public funds. </li>
  <li>On the other hand if the birth of an additional child does not
provide general benefits as large as the cost of educating the child,
or if it generates crowding costs, then people who have more children
than average can rightfully be required to pay those costs. </li>
</ul>
<p>"But wait!" you may say. "Many people will not be able to afford
to pay the cost of educating their children. How can you expect them
to do so?" </p>
<p>I would like to turn the question around. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If people cannot be
expected to pay for educating the children that they ought to be able
to have, doesn't that mean that there is some fundamental unfairness
in the starting conditions? Is it not the combination of past
injustice and current unequal access to natural opportunities that
makes us reluctant to require people to pay the full costs of having
children?</span> In my conception of justice, we have not adequately
compensated for past injustice until we have put people in a position
where we are content to oblige them to pay the full costs of their
choices. </p>
<p>But there is another potential inequality that needs to be
addressed.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> What if different
communities have different amounts of
land value per person?</span> Here a distinction in sources of land
value
must be made. If a community has higher land value because it has
built itself into a wonderful place, then it should be allowed to
keep that value for itself. On the other hand, if a community has a
higher-than-average natural endowment per citizen, then it owes
something to communities with lower-than-average natural endowment
per citizen. A program of payments among communities to equalize
natural endowments per citizen will be both efficient and fair. It
will be efficient because in the absence of such a program, people
would gravitate to the communities with higher-than-average natural
endowments (like Alaska) even when it was socially uneconomic for
them to go there. It is fair because it accords with an equal right
of all to natural opportunities.</p>
<p>Thus just and efficient local taxation is achieved by the
combination of public collection of rent, marginal cost charges for
public services, and a program of transfers among communities to
equalize natural endowment per citizen.</p>
<p>If time were not limited I would develop the argument that higher
levels of government can also be financed by the combination of
public collection of rent, marginal cost charges, and transfers to
equalize per citizen natural endowments (composed of the
pre-development rental value of land, royalties for extracted
minerals and renewable resources such as fish, the rental value of
exclusive use of the frequency spectrum, and other opportunities
provided by nature). But that is an equally intricate argument, so I
leave it for another day.</p>
<p>I hope to leave you with a hunger for answers to such questions as
how the natural opportunities of different communities might be
assessed, how much revenue could actually be collected from rent, and
what we would need to do to create a society where everyone forswore
the pursuit of opportunities to be the roving bandit, who grabs
through taxes what others produce.</p>
