<center><b>Rent Seeking and Global Conflict</b>
<p>by Prof. Mason Gaffney</p>
</center>
<p>National governments originate historically to acquire, hold and
police land. Other functions are assumed later, but sovereignty over
land is always the first business. Private parties hold land from the
sovereign: every chain of title goes back to a grantor who originally
seized the land.</p>
<p>When economists today speak of "rent-seeking" they usually are
thinking not of basic land rent, but in subtle and sophisticated
terms, looking at dribs and drabs of transfer rent derived from
contracting advantages. They develop abstract models for gaming
optimally with imperfect information, and so on. By emphasizing the
arcane while ignoring the basic they are in danger of matching the
proverbial expert who fine-tunes all the details and elaborations as
he forges on to the grand disaster.</p>
<p>Indeed, we have had one such disaster. Viet Nam was viewed by many
as an economists' war, rationally planned and led by the best and the
brightest systems' analysts, exemplified by the brilliant, energetic
Secretary of Defense. One should not be surprised at the post-Viet
Nam decline of interest in applying modern economic theory to
questions of global conflict.</p>
<p><b>We would be more useful to statesmen if we looked first at
rent-seeking in the grosser sense of &#8220;land-grabbing,&#8221; where the whole
bundle is at stake. </b>When William of Normandy conquered England
the prize was land rent, all of it. He and his retainers dispossessed
the local rent-collectors. It was simple, gross, and basic, and much
more consequential than the trivial rent-seeking we model today.
<b>The bulk of the natives may have been affected only marginally:
they just paid Lord B instead of Lord A. But it made all the
difference to Lords B and A, the ones who made basic decisions about
global conflict and cooperation.</b></p>
<p>Again, from the 17th century Europeans invaded North America,
dispossessed the natives and each other, until today we meet here,
overlooking beach and ocean, paying our daily rent for a little slice
of land which has been won and kept by a long chain of wars.</p>
<p><b>The roof over our heads is different, it is the product of
capital formation.</b> Someone saved from income, and paid workers to
construct the building. Its present value is that less the obvious
depreciation and obsolescence, so it is rentable today mainly for its
appreciated site, to which therefore an economist or an appraiser
must impute most of the market value here.</p>
<p><b>But the site never was nor could be the product of capital
formation.</b> It pre-existed man, who could only acquire it by
taking. It is fair to say that<span style="font-weight: bold;">
throughout most of history that is
what warfare was about, seizing and holding and policing land. </span>This
is not to deny ancillary causes and issues of war, such as disputing
the pathway to Heaven, ethnic pride, paranoia, acquisitive genes, and
a leader's need to divert people from domestic problems. Economists
should certainly make it their business to address the last, a major
source of global conflict. Neither is this to deny that territorial
expansion is often self-defeating, economically. Many empires,
probably most, cost more than they return, a discovery that accounts
for the well-being of small nations like Sweden, Austria, Denmark and
The Netherlands, which gained by abandoning destiny and empire. But
we would miss the point to bury particulars in aggregates. By
disaggregating benefits and costs we gain the key to understanding.
The whole nation loses, but certain parties gain, and it is they who
promote and sustain aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>Economists conventionally bury this point when they submit that
"national defense is a public good".</p>
<ul>
  <li>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">Defense</span>" is a loaded
word which rationalizes as it describes. "Military spending" is more
neutral, and will be used here. It is worth remembering that the German
Schutz (as in Schutz-Staffel) and Wehr (as in Wehrmacht) both translate
as "defense". Lebensraum is a more forthright term, and explains much
more about Nazi aggressions.</li>
  <li>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">Public good</span>" says that
all gain equally. But that is not true even of pure defense proper.
What is defended behind the defense wall is land previously seized. The
Lords and Barons have much at stake; the serfs and vagrants very
little. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is what is being
defended, along with, no doubt, traditional feelings of machismo and
some local folkways and mores.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Wages, as well as the return for capital formation, ultimately
need little defense because they are economically functional. They
are paid for real service and sacrifices, and will command a return
in almost any viable system. Labor is also more migratory. "Fixed"
capital also migrates economically as capital recovery funds are
reinvested elsewhere. Land, in contrast, does not migrate among
nations. Nations are defined as areas of land.</p>
<p><b>But it is outside the defense wall of the nation proper that
rent-seeking is most dynamic and destabilizing.</b> Military force
(often in tandem with finance) is used to project sovereignty into
foreign nations, and over no-man's-lands like the oceans, polar
regions, radio spectrum, and outer space.</p>
<p>Offshore rent-seekers are of two general kinds. </p>
<blockquote><b>1. "Caciques."</b> Cacique is a generic term for <b><i>local
cooperating rulers</i></b> from the native population. It is more
neutral than Quisling, and most caciques are more independent than he
was. Imperial metropolitan powers normally work through caciques.
Turnover among individual caciques is sometimes high, but they are
drawn from the matrix of the local landholding oligarchy which is quite
stable, often thanks to our support.
  <p>We relieve the caciques of collecting and/or paying taxes for
their own military, which often double as domestic police as well. The
life of some caciques is risky, but the rewards to caciques and local
landholders are often very high. The Sultan of Brunei is the richest
man in the world; the extravagance of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos is
legendary.</p>
  <p>Unit land values in Tokyo have, in mid-boom. exceeded those in New
York and Chicago by a factor of about 10. One reason (of several) for
the difference is that New York and Chicago pay taxes to defend Tokyo,
plus what the Japanese once called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity
Sphere. Roosevelt in 1941 stopped Japan at Viet Nam, precipitating
Pearl Harbor. But Eisenhower said in 1959 we must defend Viet Nam to
protect the Japanese resource base.</p>
  <p><b>2. Rent-seekers of the second kind are U.S. or allied
multinational interests, mostly corporations. </b>The cacique is
expected to assign to them, or be complaisant in their taking
concessions and resources like minerals, transportation routes,
communications, bank charters, plantations, etc.</p>
  <p><b>Natives normally control more of the traditional resources like
farmland. Foreigners specialize more in less visible, more novel and
sophisticated resources like 
  </b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>undiscovered minerals (exploration rights), 
      </b></li>
    <li><b>navigation rights, 
      </b></li>
    <li><b>radio spectrum, 
      </b></li>
    <li><b>overflights, 
      </b></li>
    <li><b>bank charters, etc.</b></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Both these groups have the acutest incentive to influence U.S.
policies, and large discretionary funds at hand. Therefore they tend
to dominate U.S. statecraft. The U.S. government is probably more
vulnerable to such foreign influence than most, because of our size
and weakly developed sense of honorable dedication to the national
interest. The English once terminated a dynasty, the Stuarts, which
was caught taking support from France; but Americans hardly notice
when retired Congressmen take work lobbying for foreign sugar
producers etc.</p>
<p>Self-evidently, rivalry to appropriate limited rent-yielding
resources must lead to conflict. It has to, because land is not
produced, nor stored up like capital by saving. Modern economics
glosses over this by stressing that land, like other resources, is
allocated by the market. That may be, but distribution is something
else. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Every land title in the world
goes back to a taking by
force.</span></p>
<p>It will be objected that one can buy in peacefully once a tenure
is firmly established, with alienable titles. There is certainly no
intent to deny this. The problem is that a successor-in-interest
stands on no firmer footing than the original. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">There is no
laundering: every landholder can consult his chain of title and see
how it originated.. Indeed, it has been said that those who buy
stolen property are the chief cause of crime. Fencing itself is a
crime.</span></p>
<p>However one may side on that question, it helps account for the
extreme alarm with which US statecraft startles at any foreign
country, however weak and innocuous, which expropriates any such
successor-in-interest. Demonstration effects are contagious and
threatening. The defensiveness of the insecure is a major cause of
global conflict.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">More destabilizing yet is the ambitious
rent-seeker offshore, who
finds his biggest gains in the riskiest ways, ways that unfortunately
impose high risks on the U.S. The biggest gains to rent-seekers come
from buying in on the ground floor, cheap, when tenures are
precarious or uncertain.</p>
<p>Then one invokes the U.S. armed forces and the sanctions of
ancillary statecraft to raise the value of one's acquisition. The
three main concerns are</p>
<ul>
  <li>to firm up precarious tenures (as by
supporting the government that granted them);  </li>
  <li>to hold down taxes (as
by lending the U..S. armed forces); and  </li>
  <li>to avoid pure competition (as
by giving preferential access to the U.S. market, or Pentagon
procurers).</li>
</ul>
There have been spectacular success stories. <b>Aramco</b> is one.
It originated in 1933 with a capital of $100,000. By 1970 it was
valued at well over $5 billion. Of course that increase might
represent accumulated capital flows from the US owners; but such was
not the fact.
<p>There are four sources of value of foreign holdings: </p>
<ul>
  <li>capital flows, </li>
  <li>plowbacks, </li>
  <li>appropriations, and </li>
  <li>appreciation. </li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases like Aramco the last two far outweigh the first. But
they are products of statecraft and force, not of capital inputs
proper.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tenure granted by unstable
governments is not worth much, and is
therefore cheap to acquire.</span> In 1960, for example, Patrice
Lumumba
pledged a substantial share of the Congo in return for a relatively
modest loan from a Wall Street financier.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Of course there are also failures and
losses, and someone might
even try to show that aggregate losses exceed aggregate gains. But
Adam Smith observed long ago that when an occupation offers a small
number of extremely high rewards, its attractiveness is enhanced out
of all proportion to their aggregate value. It is not just the
successes, but all the attempts that provoke global conflict.</p>
<p>We are trained and conditioned to think of land tenure as
something stable and inherited, with secure roots in history. In
fact, that which was inherited can never be taken as given unless the
origins bear examination. Past appropriation invites future
expropriation. One result of that is a legal system even in
"capitalist" America which tolerates rather extreme invasions of land
value through zoning, rent control, taxation, and field price
controls, without there being a legal "taking" such as might be
prohibited by the 5th and 14th Amendments.</p>
<p>But in addition, tenure is constantly being created at the
interfaces among sovereignties. Each is a potential flashpoint. Title
to land is also contested within many sovereignties, like Mexico
1910-40, and Cuba 1962. Current examples are also nearby in
Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Every such internal contest
makes an international incident or crisis.</p>
<p><b>Tenure is created at <br>
</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>the margins of settlement and/or
exploration, as on Alaska's Outer Continental Shelf; 
    </b></li>
  <li><b>the margins of
political stability; and 
    </b></li>
  <li><b>the margins of research and technology.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, tenure is constantly being tightened and refined at
higher levels of intensity and demand for the services of scarce
land. In recent decades the unprecedented voracious resource demands
of the United States have been a major dynamic.</p>
<p>The views above have been characterized by some as "Marxist",
because of the explicit recognition of special class interests. If
this be Marxism make the most of it; the point if any is ad hominem.
But the views here differ from Marx's.</p>
<ul>
  <li>For one, Marx was an
underconsumptionist who attributed imperialism to a search for
overseas markets, not rent-seeking.  </li>
  <li>For another, Marx made no sharp
consistent distinction between land and capital.</li>
</ul>
<p>The present views point toward specific policy changes. <b>To
minimize global conflict, a nation should use its tax system to
recoup rents from beneficiaries of its statecraft.</b></p>
<p> This would
deflate the rent-seeking incentive to provocative behavior, as well
as the discretionary funds used to gain political support. There is
little gain to the nation as a whole, and high cost, in creating
rents for a few individuals or corporations. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A surtax on income from
foreign sources, for example, rather than the present preferential
treatment, is indicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">An analogous
movement is already underway in municipal affairs.</span>
Robert Freilich, a lawyer sometimes called the "father of growth
control", has worked out systems of urban growth whereby newly
annexed lands must pay the full costs of their own development,
instead of leeching on central cities as has been the custom. This
has, where applied, drastically cooled down the passion for leapfrog
annexations. I trust the analogy between municipal and national
imperialism is evident.</p>
<p>To strengthen the nation and move toward justifying labelling
defense a "public good", a wider sharing of rents is indicated. This
is a simple matter of readjusting tax systems.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Many oil-rich
jurisdictions already provide models, albeit modest in degree (like
Alaska's social dividend from oil royalties).  </li>
  <li>Canada has a
partially-developed system of interprovincial equalization of
resource revenues.  </li>
</ul>
The result there, as one might expect, has been to
heighten the sense of national unity and patriotism in the
constructive sense, increasing the numbers of citizens honourably
devoted to the nation as such.
