  <p><span
 style="font-style: italic;">This paper makes a case for a new form of
  democracy <br>
  based on human rights to the earth as a birthright, linking this to <br>
  the Judeo-Christian Jubilee Justice tradition and <br>
  </span><span

    teachings.

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The United Nations Millennium
Declaration</span> was adopted by the world's leaders at the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Millennium Summit of the United Nations in
2000</span>. Secretary General Kofi Annan has said that the Declaration
"captured the aspirations of the international community for the new
century" and spoke of a "world united by common values and striving
with renewed determination to achieve peace and decent standards of
living for every man, woman and child."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[1]</span></small><br>
<br>
All UN Member States pledged to achieve several Millennium Development
Goals by the year 2015, including <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) reduce by half the proportion of
people living on less than a dollar a day; <br>
(2) reduce by half the proportion of people who suffer from hunger; and
<br>
(3) by 2020, achieve significant improvement in lives of at least 100
million slum dwellers.</div>
<br>
The basic framework for these goals was set forth in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948.</span> Article
I states that "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">All
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."</span>
Article 25 says that <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Everyone
has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and
well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing,
housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right
to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability,
widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond
his control."</span></div>
<br>
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was
adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by the
General Assembly on December 16, 1966 and entered into force on January
3, 1976. The Covenant proclaims these economic human rights, among
others: 
<ul>
  <li>the right to wages sufficient to support a minimum standard of
living,  </li>
  <li>to equal pay for equal work, and  </li>
  <li>equal opportunity for advancement.  </li>
  <li>In addition, the Covenant forbids exploitation of children, and  </li>
  <li>requires all nations to cooperate to end world hunger.</li>
</ul>
Nearly every UN member state has signed and ratified this important
Covenant. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
United States, Cambodia and Liberia have signed but not ratified it.</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Our
government, founded upon clearly articulated political human rights, is
floundering in the field of <span style="font-style: italic;">economic
</span>human rights.</span><br>
<br>
The US Census Bureau reports that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
number of Americans living below the poverty line</span> jumped by 1.3
million to 35.9 million or 12.5 percent of the population last year.
The latest U.S. Conference of Mayors "<span style="font-style: italic;">Sodexho
Hunger and Homelessness Survey</span>" reports that hunger and
homelessness continue to rise in major American cities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[2]</span></small> More
than 3.5 million people, or 1.25 percent of the US population, are
living in city streets or homeless shelters. The number of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">homeless </span>grew by around 19 percent
in 2003 and 13 percent in 2002. Twenty-three of the 25 surveyed cities
reported that l<span style="font-weight: bold;">ack of affordable
housing</span> was the leading cause of homelessness. Twenty
participating cities reported that <span style="font-weight: bold;">unemployment
</span>and various <span style="font-weight: bold;">employment related
problems</span> were the leading causes of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">hunger</span>.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a significant lack of decent
affordable housing in the United States.</span> The growing gap between
wage earnings and the cost of housing leaves millions of families and
individuals unable to make ends meet. According to the National Low
Income Housing Coalition, families across the country would need to
earn a "housing wage" of $15.21 an hour, nearly three times the current
minimum wage, to afford a two-bedroom apartment at the average fair
market rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[3]</span></small>
In states with median housing costs, a minimum wage worker would have
to work 89 hours each week to afford a two-bedroom apartment at 30% of
his or her income, which is the federal definition of affordable
housing.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[4]</span></small>
Currently, five million rental households have "worst case housing
needs," which means that they pay more than half their incomes for
rent, live in severely substandard housing, or both<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.[5]</span></small><br>
<br>
Economic Research Service of the United States Department of
Agriculture released its annual report on <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">household food security</span> for 2002. It
was no surprise given the recent increases in poverty that hunger and
food insecurity rose for the third year in a row. A food insecure
household is defined as a household which faces limited or uncertain
availability of food. In 2002, 34.9 million people lived in households
that were food insecure, 1.26 million more people than in 2001. This
number includes 13.1 million children. The number of people living in
households where someone was hungry also increased by 300,000 to 9.3
million. About 567,000 kids lived in homes where children were hungry,
100,000 more than the year before. The prevalence of food insecurity
rose from 10.7 percent in 2001 to 11.1 percent in 2002, and the
prevalence of food insecurity with hunger rose from 3.3 percent to 3.5
percent.[6]<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The wealth gap is increasing in the
US. According to the latest Federal Reserve data, the top 1% of the
population has $2 trillion more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.</span><br>
<br>
Perceptions of the causal factors of these statistics and the suffering
of so many who lack basic necessities in this wealthy country are most
often simplistic explanations - these people lack money and they lack
money because they lack jobs or their wages are too low, or housing
costs are too high. For those concerned about the growing wealth gap in
America and worldwide, and the resultant poverty, homelessness, hunger
and food insecurity, the dilemma usually bogs down into supply or
demand side efforts to find solutions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But the root cause is a
deeper injustice.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The primary cause of the enormous and
growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
Problem.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The Land
Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and concentrated
land ownership.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
amounts of a worker's wages. In classical economics, this dilemma is
called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
economists. The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land values
will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover story informs us
that there are big gains and huge risks in housing speculation in about
30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass 100 million people.
Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington, and Boston have surged
56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los Angeles and 76% in San
Diego where the median home price county-wide is $582,000. The gap
between home prices and fundamentals like job growth and incomes is
greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The second form of the Land Problem is the
fact that in most countries, including the United States, a small
minority of people own and control a disproportionately large amount of
land and natural resources.</span> Data suggests that about 3% of the
population owns 95% of the privately held land in the US. Less than 600
companies control 22% of our private land, a land mass the size of
Spain. Those same companies land interests worldwide comprise a total
area larger than that of Europe - almost 2 billion acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]</span></small>  </li>
</ul>
In order to show that there was NO NEED for land reform in Central
America because our land in the US is even more concentrated in
ownership than Central America, Senator Jesse Helms read these facts
into the Congressional Record in 1981: 
<ul>
  <li>In Florida, 1% owns 77% of the land.  </li>
  <li>Other states where the top 1% own over two-thirds of the land are
Maine, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oregon.</li>
</ul>
A United Nations study of 83 countries showed that less than 5% of
rural landowners control three-quarters of the land. Other studies on
land ownership report these facts: 
<ul>
  <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brazil</span>, 2% of
landowners hold 60% of the arable land while close to 70% of rural
households have little or none. Just 342 farm properties in Brazil
cover 183,397 square miles - an area larger than California.  </li>
  <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Venezuela</span>, 77% of the
farmland is owned by 3% of the people. In Spain, 70 per cent of the
land is owned by 0.2 per cent of the people.  </li>
  <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">Britain</span>, 69 per cent
of the land is owned by 0.6 per cent of the population. Just 158,000
families own 41 million acres of land while 24 million families live on
four million acres.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[9]</span></small></li>
</ul>
The basic human need for food and shelter requires access of labor to
land. With access to land people can produce the basic requirements of
life. Access to land provides an enabling environment for life itself
and thus meets the minimum requirement of love, meaning fairness in
human relations based on the fundamental equal right to exist. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The Land Problem in its two forms - the
inequitable ownership and control of land and natural resources and the
treatment of land as a market commodity - is the root cause of the
great amount of human deprivation and suffering from lack of the basic
necessities of life.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">And yet the
human right to the earth is missing from the Bill of Rights, the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Human Rights.</span><br>
<br>
Democratic governance has not yet concerned itself with a "first
principle" question. This question concerns property rights in land -
property rights in the earth itself. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
question is, "Who Should Own the Earth?"</span> The question of "Who
Should Own the Earth?" is a fundamental question. In venues when this
question is asked, the answer is always the same.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The answer is, "everyone should own the
earth and on an equal basis as a birthright."</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The right to the earth has yet to be pronounced in human rights
covenants. Democracy is unclear, ethically weak, and on shaky ground
when it comes to the question of the right to the land and resources of
the earth. Democracy as presently constituted lacks this most
fundamental and basic human right - the equal right to earth. The right
to the earth is the great undiscovered revolution in both American and
global politics.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Early Christian teachings on the Land
Problem, however, were clear and precise. The question of "Who Should
Own the Earth?" was unequivocally answered. </span>The land ethic of
the early Christian communities was that of "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">koinonia</span>" meaning essentially that
God was the sole owner of the earth which was given as a gift to all
for the "<span style="font-style: italic;">autarkeia</span>," the
self-reliant livelihood, of all. In the words of John Chrysostom,
Bishop of Constantinople at the close of the fourth century, "The very
air, earth, matter, are the Creator's; and so are you yourself...; and
all other things also."<br>
<br>
When Christianity became the state religion of the Roman empire, the
early Christian teachings on land were overtaken by the Roman land laws
of "<span style="font-style: italic;">dominium</span>" - a legalization
of property in land originally obtained by conquest and plunder. A
largely corrupted Christianity, uprooted from its early teachings on
land ownership, too often went hand in hand with the exploitation and
degradation of centuries of colonial conquests. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A statement by the great South African
Archbishop Desmond Tutu addressed this point in a succinct and profound
manner. He said, "When the missionaries came to Africa they had the
Bible and we had the land. They said 'Let us pray.' We closed our eyes.
When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic;">[10]</span></small></span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Charles Avila</span>, in his
profoundly important book entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Ownership:
Early Christian Teachings</span>, explored the early church fathers'
view of property rights in land. He contrasted these teachings to Roman
property rights law. In his chapter on "The Concept of Ownership" Avila
states:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
concentration of property in private hands began very early in Rome and
was indeed based on the foundational and legitimizing idea of absolute
and exclusive individual ownership in land. This was the same idea
which would come to form the basis of the slave-owning, the feudal, and
the capitalist (including the pseudo-socialist, or state-capitalist)
economic systems successively. Modern civilization has not yet
discarded this antiquated ownership concept, which was originally
derived from ancient Rome. In fact, it seems to us, this is one of the
main roots of the present global crisis, in which the rich become
richer because the poor become poorer.</span><small
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small><br>
</div>
<br>
Avila further noted that "the distinction in legal terminology between
"real" and "personal" property is the survival in words of an ancient
real distinction between property held in both theory and practice as
common by its very nature and property which was the fruit of one's
labor."<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small>
Avila said that modern social thinkers<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">advocate
the promotion of social justice without stopping to think that
individual ownership of nature's bounty might be socially unjust in
itself. And yet patristic thought insisted long ago that there can be
no real justice, or abolition of poverty, if the koina, the common
natural elements of production, are appropriated in ownership by
individuals.</span><small style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">[13]</span></small><br>
<br>
</div>
Here are a few <span style="font-weight: bold;">Patristic period
quotes on land ownership</span> that Avila compiled in his book:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ambrose</span>: How far, O ye rich, do
you push your mad desires? Shall ye alone dwell upon the earth? Why do
you cast out all the fellow sharers of nature and claim it all for
yourselves? The earth was made in common for all. Why do you arrogate
to yourselves, exclusive right to the soil?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">St. George the Great</span> (Pope 590
- 604) rebuked the Romans when he said: They wrongfully think they are
innocent who claim for themselves the common gift of God.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clement of Alexandria:</span> (The
functions of property) -"to be shared," "to minister to" and serve "the
welfare of all"; "not for personal advantage as being entirely one's
own" but "for those in need"; "to achieve autarkeia" and "to foster <span
 style="font-style: italic;">koinonia</span>" - constitute the very
essence of Clement's view of property.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">St. John Chrystostom</span>: God in
the beginning did not make one man rich and another poor; nor did he
afterwards take and show to anyone treasures of gold, and deny to the
others the right of searching for it; rather he left the earth free to
all alike. Why then, if it is common, have you so many acres of land,
while your neighbor has not a portion of it?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Augustine</span>: He (according to
Avila's research) saw that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the
poor are poor because they have been deprived by the propertied few of
the wealth that should belong to all.</span> He laid the blame for this
unjust situation squarely on the doorstep of an absolutist and
exclusivist legal right of private ownership. He reminded his audience
that they were all "made from one mud" and sustained "on one earth"
under the same natural conditions, having the same essence and called
to the same destiny. He rejected the legalized status quo as
inappropriate for human living. Holding that legal arrangements of
property rights were of human origin, he asserted that they should be
changed, in theory and in practice, in function of a faith-informed
ethic based on the true meaning of ownership.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Basil the Great:</span> He saw that <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">a privileged few were exceedingly
rich, ostentatious, and powerful, inasmuch as wealth, particularly the
wealth-producing resource, land, was concentrated in the hands of the
few.</span> He taught a philosophy of ownership based on the view that
God was Father and giver and Provider for all, and that therefore a few
must cease stealing the food-producing resources that God had destined
for the use of all.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Basil admits a certain right
of laborers to the product of their labor but asks the landlords by
what right they exercise ownership over their vast estates: "Which
things, tell me, are yours? Whence have you brought them into being?"</span>
Whatever you have produced, or brought into being, may justly be yours.
However, it is land that has made the landlords rich, and land is not
something they have brought into being." Speaking to the rich Basil
said:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">You
are like one occupying a place in a theatre, who should prohibit others
from entering, treating that as one's own which was designed for the
common use of all.... If each one would take that which is sufficient
for one's needs, leaving what is in excess to those in distress, no one
would be rich, no one poor. Did you not come naked from the womb? Will
you not return naked into the earth?<small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">[14]</span></small></span></div>
<br>
Jesus pointed to Old Testament teachings regarding land ethics.
According to some contemporary theologians, one of the tasks of the
mission of Jesus was to restore the original intent of the Jubilee. In
Luke 4:18 (by way of Isaiah 61:1-3): He has anointed me to preach good
news to the poor.. to proclaim release of captives.. To set at liberty
those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.<br>
<br>
As theologian <span style="font-weight: bold;">Walter Brueggeman</span>
explains in "<span style="font-style: italic;">Land: The Foundation of
Humanness</span>"<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[15]</span></small>,
the "acceptable year" is the year of the Jubilee when the land was to
be returned to the original holders. The "release of captives" is the
release of debt slaves who had lost their land because they could not
pay the mortgage. A crucial aspect of Jesus' mission was the
reassertion of the land rights of the poor and displaced.<br>
<br>
The early Christian land ethic echoed Old Testament teachings
concerning land rights. Hear these voices anew:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The land must not be sold beyond
reclaim, for the land is Mine; you are but strangers resident with me.
- Lev. 25:23<br>
<br>
The profit of the earth is for all. - Eccles. 5:9<br>
<br>
Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till
there be no place. - Isaiah 5:8<br>
<br>
Restore, I pray you, to them even this day, their lands, their
vineyards, their olive yards, and their houses. - Nehemiah 5:11<br>
</div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">During the 15th century and several
centuries thereafter, the "commons" (land that had always been
available for free use by the community) were enclosed by the wealthy
or powerful for private use only.</span> This accelerated the rise of
the market economy, for without land, peasants had to survive by their
wits and their abilities to manufacture. The emerging economy which
used money as a primary medium of exchange opened up an opportunity for
the landless to acquire land - they could now buy it. But working to
accumulate enough wealth to buy land, instead of asserting an inherent
human birthright to the earth, is akin to a slave's saving enough
money, by cleverness, skill and extra hard effort, to buy him or
herself into freedom.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We must not forget that mainstream
institutionalized Christianity once promulgated the doctrine that the
right of some humans to hold other humans as slaves was encoded in the
Bible.</span> After much struggle and centuries of suffering, it
gradually dawned on the majority of people that slavery was unjust and
it was abolished. A similar awakening regarding the land problem lies
in our future, hopefully the near future. The vision for a just land
ethic was held by several great sages of our own recent history. Their
statements could be useful to us today.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thomas Jefferson</span> - The earth is
given as a common stock for men to labor and live on.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abraham Lincoln</span> - The land, the
earth God gave to man for his home, sustenance, and support, should
never be the possession of any man, corporation, society, or unfriendly
government, any more than the air or water, if as much. An individual,
company, or enterprise should hold no more than is required for their
home and sustenance. All that is not used should be held for the free
use of every family to make homesteads, and to hold them as long as
they are so occupied.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George</span> - Our primary
social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one man to own
the land on which and from which other men must live, we have made them
his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on.
This is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do not realize is
extracting from the masses in every civilized country the fruits of
their weary toil; that is instituting a harder and more hopeless
slavery in place of that which has been destroyed; that is bringing
political despotism out of political freedom, and must soon transmute
democratic institutions into anarchy.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">On first reading Henry George (<a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and
Poverty</a>) almost twenty years ago when doing research for this
volume, I was particularly struck by the similarity of his arguments,
and even analogies, to those of the fourth century Christian
philosophers on the topic of land ownership.[16]</div>
<br>
Henry George, the great American political economist and land rights
philosopher (1839-1897), eloquently confronted the enigma of the wealth
gap in his masterwork <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty </span></a>and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">set forth both an ethical and practical
method for holding and sharing the land as a sacred trust for all. </span><br>
<ul>
  <li>He made <span style="font-weight: bold;">a clear distinction
between property in land and property in wealth produced by labor on
land</span>. <br>
  </li>
  <li>He said that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> private property in
human made wealth belonged to the producer and that the state should
not tax wealth produced by human labor.</span>  </li>
</ul>
George said:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">To abolish these taxes would be to lift
the whole enormous weight of taxation from productive industry. The
needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory; the cart-horse and
the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship; the farmer's plow
and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would be free to
make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, un-annoyed by the
tax-gatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, "The
more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!" the
state would say to the producer,</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">"Be as industrious, as thrifty, as
enterprising as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall
not be fined for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before;
you shall not be taxed for adding to the aggregate wealth.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[17]</span></small></div>
<br>
In an economic system such as ours which uses money as a medium of
exchange, land and resources come to have monetary value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In asserting that the gifts of nature are
common property and should be equitably shared by all, George saw that
in a just society the ownership of land and natural resources would be
conditional upon the cash payment to all of a fairly assessed tax, or
land rent, for the exclusive right to God's gifts. Thus the collection
of land rent for the community as a whole would replace the taxation of
productive endeavors. Those with more and/or better located land would
pay more into the common fund, while those with little or no land would
pay much less or nothing at all.</span><br>
<br>
As George explained it:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">...the value of land is at the
beginning of society nothing, but as society develops by the increase
of population and the advance of the arts, it becomes greater and
greater. In every civilized country, even the newest, the value of the
land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear the entire expenses of
government. In the better developed countries it is much more than
sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place all taxes upon
the value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds the present
governmental revenues, commensurately to increase the amount demanded
in taxation, and to continue this increase as society progresses and
rent advances.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[18]</span></small><br>
</div>
The author of <span style="font-style: italic;">Common Sense</span>
was onto the same idea when he said:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Men did not make the earth...It is the
value of the improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is
individual property...Every proprietor owes to the community a ground
rent for the land which he holds. - Tom Paine</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Enormous sums are currently accruing
as unearned income to a relatively few individuals, families and
corporations who are holding large amounts of land, very valuable and
well-located land, and natural resources as their own exclusive private
property.</span> These enormous land values and resource rents are also
accruing as unearned income to banks holding mortgages based on
exploitative compound interest rates. It may be of interest to note
that the word "mortgage" means "dead hand." Truly, when one must work
so many years of one's life to pay off a mortgage, one productive hand
is as if dead in terms of producing for oneself, as the labor of that
hand pays the mortgage. For the 33% of citizens (40 million people) in
the United States who are renters, there is not even equity ownership
to look forward to after a life of labor. For the more than three
million homeless people in American and the multi-millions who are
homeless around the world, what Henry George said in 1879 holds true
today:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Our primary social adjustment is a
denial of justice. In allowing one man to own the land on which and
from which other men must live, we have made them his bondsmen in a
degree which increases as material progress goes on.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[19]</span></small><br>
</div>
Not only is the land ethic of Old and New Testament prophets and Henry
George virtually the same, the policy approach of "resource rent for
revenue" also known as "land or site value taxation" has its corollary
in the approach called for by the ancient rabbis in their discussions
about the finer and little known details of Jubilee.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Talmudic rabbinical discussions
considered how fairly to partition the land of Canaan among the tribes
under Joshua. Those with poorer land were to be given more acreage and
those with more fertile land would be given less. As for land
disadvantageously situated, the adjustment was to be made by money;
that is to say, those holding land nearer the city (Jerusalem) should
pay into the common treasury the estimated excess of value pertaining
to it by reason of its superior situation, while those holding land of
less value, by reason of its distance from the city, would receive from
the treasury a money compensation.</span> Upon the more valuable
holdings was to be imposed a tax, or lease fee, the measure of which
was the excess of their respective values over a given standard, and
the fund thus created was to be paid out in due proportions to those
whose holdings were in less favorable locations. In this, then we see
affirmed the doctrine that natural advantages are common property, and
may not be diverted to private gain.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[20]</span></small><br>
<br>
The early Christians were attacked and persecuted and the Christian
land justice teachings were undermined by Roman law. Similarly, there
was a great movement to discredit the teachings of Henry George. Pope
Leo XIII issued the <span style="font-style: italic;">Rerum Novarum</span>
Encyclical in 1891 which propounded an exclusivist right to private
property in land, exhorting those without land to work harder, longer
and smarter to save money from which to buy land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[21]</span></small>&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Money from vested interests poured
into the University of Chicago, Columbia University and other emerging
schools of economics to thwart and obscure the understanding and the
solution to the land problem and the wealth divide. Academics were paid
to undermine Georgist economics which had followed in the classical
tradition and to instead develop an approach to economics which
minimized the contribution of nature's gifts to the production process.
</span>Land, the term in classical economics which denotes all gifts of
nature, was made a secondary factor, a mere subset of capital. The two
major factors became Labor and Capital. The intellectual crime of the
century -- the neoliberal economics paradigm -- has predominated in the
field of economics ever since.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[22]</span></small><br>
<br>
Yet the truth of George's <span style="font-style: italic;">koinonia-</span>based
economics endured through the work of several schools, publishers and
research organizations established during the first half of the 20th
century, both in the US and worldwide. In 1949 this movement issued <span
 style="font-style: italic;">An International Declaration on Individual
and Common Rights to Land</span>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[23] </span></small>The
policy approach urged by Henry George and Thomas Paine as a way to
assure human rights to the earth's resources was successfully
implemented in part and to varying degrees in several places throughout
the world.<br>
<br>
As a result of decades of steady education and promulgation, there are
now 18 municipalities in Pennsylvania which have adopted a so-called
split-rate property tax which shifts taxes away from buildings and onto
land according to site value. This approach is based on the
understanding that the property tax is actually two types of taxes --
one upon building values, and the other upon land values. This
distinction is an important one, as these two types of taxes have
significantly different impacts on incentive motives and development
results. 
<ul>
  <li>Decreasing the tax on buildings gives property owners the
incentive to build and to maintain and improve their properties.  </li>
  <li>As the levy on land values is increased, land speculation and
poor land utilization, an example being slum buildings and boarded up
buildings, are discouraged. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
signal thus sent to property holders is to either improve their
properties or sell them to someone who can do so. </span>  </li>
</ul>
Either way, labor and capital gain access to land to improve and
augment the building stock. The tax incentives are harnessed correctly
to encourage effort directed to the provisioning of housing and other
basic human needs.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[24]</span></small><br>
<br>
Shifting the tax burden in this way 
<ul>
  <li>discourages land hoarding and encourages good land utilization.  </li>
  <li>It promotes a more efficient use of urban infrastructure (such as
roads and sewers),  </li>
  <li>decreases the pressure towards urban sprawl (as there is
significant infill development), and  </li>
  <li>assures a broader spread of the benefits of development to the
community as a whole.</li>
</ul>
Researchers have carefully recorded the number of building permits
issued in the three year period before and after the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">split-rate</span> was put in place. In
every instance, the number of building permits increased significantly
after the implementation of this reform. As the city improves, without
the need for subsidies, the land values gradually increase, thus
providing the city with an increasing source of revenue for public
services. With this system, land values maintain a natural correlation
to the overall health of the city. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
values do not peak and spike as they do under conditions which promote
land speculation and profiteering. As development stabilizes, land
values also stabilize.</span> Thus it is possible to have a
self-financing city with citizens reaping the full rewards of their
labor and creativity.<br>
<br>
The experience with this form of taxation in the 18 municipalities of
Pennsylvania point towards the possibilities of a self-renewing city.
But until we greatly reduce or eliminate the burden of federal income
and payroll taxes and the billions of dollars of wasteful and
inequitable corporate subsidies, we will only have a partial
realization of the promise. Nonetheless, there is much we can learn
from the split-rate tax cities in Pennsylvania, upon several of which
we shall now focus.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Harrisburg</span>, the capital of
Pennsylvania, provides one of the best examples of the benefits of
shifting taxes away from labor and productive capital and onto land
according to site values.<br>
<br>
In 1981 Harrisburg was listed as the second-most distressed city in the
nation under criteria used by the federal government. A review of the
gains made in effective economic development activities since then has
produced significant results, and the sharp reversal of nearly three
decades of previous serious decline. Beginning with the implementation
of the split-rate property tax and gradually increasing the tax on land
while decreasing the tax on buildings, Harrisburg has sustained an
economic resurgence that has garnered national acclaim. It twice won
the top United States community honor as All-American City, along with
the top state recognition from the state Chamber of Business and
Industry as Outstanding Community in Pennsylvania, all because of
Harrisburg's development initiatives and progress.<br>
<br>
As of 2001, the value of taxable real estate was over $2.2 Billion,
versus $212 Million in 1982. Over 26,000 building permits were issued
from 1982 representing over $2.65 Billion in new investment. Even
adjusted for inflation, this is more than for any period since
Harrisburg became a municipality in the year 1791, with most of this
investment undertaken since 1990. There are over 5,500 businesses on
the city tax rolls in 2001 compared to 1,908 in 1981. The number of
vacant structures, over 5,500 in 1982, have been reduced by 85% to less
than 400. The crime rate has dropped 53% and fire rate has been cut by
72%.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[25]</span></small><br>
<br>
Harrisburg Mayor Stephen Reed has written several letters to officials
of other cities telling them that the split-rate tax has been a key to
the remarkable renewal of his city.<br>
<br>
The citizens of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allentown</span>, the
third largest city in Pennsylvania with a population of 105,000, voted
for the land value tax system in 1994 and it was instituted in 1996.
The difference between the land and building rates was expanded in each
of the following four years. Michael Rosenfeld, the executive director
of that city's Redevelopment Authority, says that the benefits of this
tax approach are evident. The value of both new commercial construction
and of new residential construction increased substantially after the
shift to land value taxation. Nearly three out of every four properties
in Allentown saw some sort of tax cut. Today, many of those properties
have new or better buildings on them, stabilizing the tax base to the
point where there has been no need for a tax increase in five years.
The number of building permits in Allentown has increased by 32%
compared to the three-year period before the land value tax reform.<br>
<br>
Allentown and Bethlehem are both in eastern Pennsylvania and are
roughly comparable as to size and economy. In that Allentown adopted
this tax approach and Bethlehem did not, there was an opportunity to
compare the two. Allentown's new construction and renovation grew by
82% in dollar value in the three years after it adopted two-rate LVT as
compared to the prior three years. Its new construction and renovation
grew 54% faster than Bethlehem's new construction and renovation
despite the infusion of much federal grant money into Bethlehem (but
not into Allentown) during 1997-99.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[26]</span></small><br>
<br>
The small cities of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Washington </span>and
Monessen, both in southwestern Pennsylvania, are roughly comparable as
to size and economy. Monessen has the common form of property tax which
taxes building value significantly more than land value. After
Washington adopted the split-rate tax in 1985, it saw its new
construction and renovation increase by 33% in dollar value following
this tax reform as compared to the prior three years. During the same
time period, Monessen's new construction and renovation decreased by
26%.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[27]</span></small><br>
<br>
Studies comparing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oil City</span>,
Pennsylvania, which shifted its tax base starting in January 1989, with
Franklin, a comparable neighbor municipality, found that Oil City
experienced a 58.2% increase in new construction and renovation in the
three years after it adopted a two-rate property tax as compared to the
three years before, whereas Franklin experienced a 12.2% decline during
the same time periods.[28]<br>
<br>
In 1995, <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Tideman.html">Professor Nicholas Tideman</a>, the
Chairman of the Economics Dept. at Virginia Tech University and his
then-graduate student, Florenz Plassman, now a professor at the
University of Binghamton, N.Y. completed a highly technical, peer
reviewed study of land value taxation in Pennsylvania. To quote from
the conclusion of their study: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"The results say that for all four
categories of construction, an increase in the effective tax
differential is associated with an increase in the average value per
permit. In the case of residential housing, a 1% increase in the
effective tax differential is associated with a 12% increase in the
average value per unit. From the perspective of economic theory, it is
not at all surprising that when taxes are taken off of buildings,
people build more valuable buildings. But it is nice to see the
numbers."<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[29]</span></small></div>
<br>
<a href="../auth/Cord.html">Dr. Steven B. Cord</a> has done an exhaustive
review of 237 studies of land value taxation from all over the world.
In every instance there was an increase in construction and renovation
after the policy was enacted, indicating that there were previously
unmet needs for housing and other living and working space.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[30]</span></small><br>
<br>
A meticulous study conducted by Dr. Mason Gaffney entitled "<a
 href="Gaffney_RIaFPTR.html">Rising Inequality and Falling Property Tax
Rates</a>"<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[31]</span></small>
refutes the common belief that property tax relief would be good for
farmers. His research showed that property tax relief for agricultural
land increases the likelihood that it will attract those looking
primarily for tax shelters and speculative investments. Such
nonproductive incentives ultimately inflate land values overall, making
it increasingly difficult for working farmers to access and maintain
acreage for viable agricultural enterprise.<br>
<br>
The high price of land means that the modern food and agriculture
system provides no options for those who cannot find a paying job other
than subsistence on charity or government supports. Those with minimum
wage incomes are finding it increasingly difficult to afford decent
housing. These social problems and pressures are bound to increase with
the cut-off of welfare and other government subsidies to the poor.<br>
<br>
Intensively managed small farms and well-designed ecological villages
could produce a diverse range of food, fiber, livestock, and energy
products for local markets. Bio-intensive farming methods depending on
renewable energy sources can yield both social and environmental
stability. The establishment of labor and bio-intensive small farming
operations can be greatly furthered by land value tax policies which
remove taxes on labor and productive capital while promoting affordable
land access.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A shift to land value taxation will
likely have the following benefits in the rural area:</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp; 1. Discourage speculation in land<br>
&nbsp; 2. Reduce the price of land to equate with its value for
production<br>
&nbsp; 3. Enable new entrants to more easily obtain land<br>
&nbsp; 4. Limit farm sizes to those of the most productive units<br>
&nbsp; 5. Enable the reduction of taxation on earnings and capital<br>
&nbsp; 6. Reduce interest rates as land became more affordable<br>
&nbsp; 7. Prevent rural depopulation<br>
&nbsp; 8. Encourage owner-occupation rather than absentee ownership<br>
&nbsp; 9. Promote more responsible use of land<br>
&nbsp;10. Promote a rural renaissance.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[32]</span></small></div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The success of the Wright Act is an
example of how properly implemented land based taxes can promote a
rural renaissance. </span>This legislation, passed by California in
1887, allowed communities to vote to create irrigation districts for
the building of dams and canals and to pay for them by taxing the
increase in land value. Once irrigated, land was too valuable for
grazing and too costly for hoarding. So cattlemen sold fields to
farmers at prices the farmers could afford. In ten years the Central
Valley was transformed into over 7,000 independent farms. Over the next
few decades, vast tracts of treeless, semi-arid plains became the
"bread basket of America" and one of the most productive areas on
earth. It is a prime example of how land value taxation can promote and
enhance the viability of both an efficient and equitable agricultural
base - without government subsidy.<br>
<br>
This equitable and successful public finance approach was eventually
undermined by private banking institutions. Now taxpayers nationwide
subsidize the irrigation needs of agribusiness. Self-financing
development projects reduce the necessity for debt finance, so do not
contribute to the profits of rent-seeking institutions. These
exploitative institutions which concentrate wealth in the hands of the
few will continue to sabotage this policy approach until sufficient
numbers of people have a better understanding of the land ethic of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">koinonia </span>and this fundamental
approach to securing the human right to the earth.<br>
<br>
One of the best examples of the beneficial results of an ethic of
koinonia in natural resources is to be found in the state of <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/Alaska.html">Alaska</a> where an "earth rights"
constitution gives ownership of the oil and other natural resources of
the state to the citizens of Alaska on an equal basis. The Alaska
Permanent Fund invests the state's oil resource rents, the interest
from which funds cash dividend payments directly to all adults and
children resident in the state at least one year.<br>
<br>
The Permanent Fund ended fiscal year 2004 on June 30 with a 14.1
percent return and a total value of more than $27.4 billion, according
to currently available Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation figures. More
than $24,000 per person have been distributed to citizens of Alaska
since 1982. Note that Alaska is the only state in the US wherein the
wealth gap has decreased during recent decades.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[33]</span></small><br>
<br>
The Alaska Permanent Fund is an innovative and important model of
resource rents for citizen dividends, but with worldwide oil production
nearing peak, it is the opinion of this writer that oil resource rents
had best be directed to the development of renewable energy
technologies. The electromagnetic spectrum, geo-orbital zones, and
surface land values would be a more appropriate source of rent
distribution as citizen dividend payments.<br>
<br>
Had the land problem been addressed in the south after the Civil War, a
more equitable distribution of wealth and overall prosperity would have
been the likely result. It can be instructive to review this earlier
effort to secure land rights in America.<br>
<br>
On March 3, 1865, just weeks before the end of the Civil War and almost
a year prior to the ratification of the 13th Amendment, the Freedmen's
Bureau was created by Congress. According to Section 4 of the First
Freedmen's Bureau Act, this agency<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">shall have authority to set apart for
use of loyal refugees and freedmen such tracts of land within the
insurrectionary states as shall have been abandoned or to which the
United States shall have acquired title by confiscation or sale, or
otherwise; and to every male citizen, whether refugee or freedman, as
aforesaid there shall be assigned not more than <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">forty acres of such land</span>.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
<br>
Introduced into Congress by Thaddeus Stevens this portion of the
Freedmen's Bureau Act was defeated by Congress on February 5, 1866 "by
a vote of 126 to 36."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[34]</span></small> <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"></div>
Lands which had been distributed to freedmen were reclaimed and
returned to the previous owners. There was to be no land reform for the
South. Northern industrialists feared that giving land to freedmen and
poor whites in the South could have led to similar demands for land by
the people in the North, which, if implemented, would assuredly have
greatly limited the supply of cheap labor available for factory work in
the industrial North.<br>
<br>
Abraham Lincoln sounded a warning when he said in 1865:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Corporations have been enthroned.... An
era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power will
endeavor to prolong its reign by working on the prejudices of the
people...until wealth is aggregated in a few hands...and the Republic
is destroyed.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We live in yet another age of rapid
privatization of the remaining commons. The airwaves, also known as the
electromagnetic or radio-frequency spectrum, the most valuable resource
of the information economy, is being given away to huge media
corporations.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economists
estimate that in the United States alone the commercial value of access
to it could be more than $750 billion.</span> There is a rush to patent
plant material around the world. The attempt to patent sections of the
DNA code itself is but a modern expression of previous centuries of
enclosures.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The band-aid safety nets of the 1940s
and 50s are unravelling and a new Gilded Age is upon us. The wealth gap
is growing. </span>Wages for nearly everyone have stagnated or are
declining. Ever escalating land values push housing prices beyond the
capacity of millions to secure adequate shelter. Worldwide, a billion
people live in degrading destitution lacking basic needs. Local
conflicts and global wars are waged for control of land and natural
resources. Tax funds that could build a world that works for everyone
instead are being directed to biochemical weapons research, building
space laser weaponry, and neo-colonial warfare.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It has been said that the only two
certainties in life are death and taxes and that the power to tax is
the power to create or destroy. </span>The story of the birth of Jesus
is on one level the story of a family on a long and onerous journey to
pay taxes imposed by the Romans upon the people of the land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We urgently need to establish land tenure
and tax policies based on the deepest wisdom of the Judeo-Christian
tradition - a truth based on the perception of the unity of life, that
all is created by God, and on the realization of the brotherhood and
sisterhood of the one humanity. The privilege of holding large amounts
of land or highly valuable land as individual private property needs to
be a conditional, not an absolute right. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For justice to prevail, the right
to exclusive access to land must be granted only upon payment of full
and fairly assessed land value taxes and resource rents.</span></span><br>
<br>
We have at hand a powerful solution and a way to secure a world of
peace and plenty. We need to constitute democratic governance on the
firm foundation of equal rights to the land and resources of the earth,
an "earth rights democracy" which removes the burden of taxes from the
backs of those who labor and instead directs government to collect the
value of our common wealth for the benefit of all. A morally correct
form of taxation may not lead to everlasting life, but it WILL promote
and sustain the conditions for lives worth living on planet earth.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ADDENDUM</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Episcopalian</span>:
<br>
People without land or without any control over the value of land lack
security in a major dimension of their lives. - National Bishops,
General Convention, Action Proposal for Economic Justice, 2/22/88<br>
<br>
A great deal of what is amiss alike in rural and in urban areas could
be remedied by the taxation of the value of sites as distinct from the
buildings erected upon them. - William Temple, a former Archbishop of
Canterbury, in Christianity and Social Order<br>
<br>
Equity insists that we cease levying taxes on the fruits of human toil,
and make the monopoly value of land be the exclusive basis of taxation.
- Episcopal Bishop C.D. Williams<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Methodist:</span><br>
All creation is the Lord's and we are responsible for the ways in which
we use and abuse it. We believe that Christian faith denies to any
person or group of persons exclusive and arbitrary control of any other
part of the created universe.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Catholic</span>:<br>
The land is a gift of the Creator to all men and therefore its richness
cannot be distributed among a limited number of people while others are
excluded from its benefits. - Pope John Paul II, Bahia Blanca, Brazil,
1986<br>
<br>
God intended the earth and all things in it for the use of all peoples,
in such a way that the goods of creation should abound equitably in the
hands of all, according to the dictate of justice, which is inseparable
from charity. - Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern
World, Vatican II<br>
<br>
The right of land ownership and of free bargaining in land are
subordinated to the fundamental right of man to obtain the necessities
of life. In the force of the fundamental claim of the Commonwealth
there is no unconditional right of land ownership. - Pope Paul VI,
Populorum Progressio, 1967<br>
<br>
Every man, as a living being gifted with reason, has in fact from
nature the fundamental right to make use of the material goods of the
earth. - Pope Pius XII<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Relevant Quotes:</span><br>
The problems that exist in the world today cannot be solved by the
level of thinking that created them. <br>
<div style="text-align: right;">- Albert Einstein<br>
</div>
The minority, the ruling class at present, has the schools and press,
usually the Church as well, under its thumb. This enables it to
organize and sway the emotions of the masses, and make its tool of
them. <br>
<div style="text-align: right;">- Albert Einstein<br>
</div>
"What the public wants is called 'politically unrealistic.' Translated
into English, that means power and privilege are opposed to it." <br>
<div style="text-align: right;">- Noam Chomsky<br>
</div>
"The greatest triumphs of propaganda have been accomplished, not by
doing something, but by refraining from doing. Great is truth, but
still greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth."
<br>
<div style="text-align: right;">- <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous Huxley</a><br>
</div>
True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it
understands that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.
A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring
contrast of poverty and wealth. <br>
<div style="text-align: right;">- Martin Luther King<br>
</div>
<br>
An intelligent approach to the problems of poverty and racism will
cause us to see the words of the Psalmist - "The earth is the Lord's
and the fullness thereof" - are still a judgment upon our use and abuse
of the wealth and resources with which we have been endowed. <br>
<div style="text-align: right;">- Martin Luther King<br>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">AN
INTERNATIONAL DECLARATION ON <br>
INDIVIDUAL AND COMMON RIGHTS TO LAND</span>
</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hereby declare that the earth is the common
heritage of all and that all people have natural and equal rights to
the land of the planet. By the term "land" is meant all natural
resources.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject always to these natural and equal rights in
land and to this common ownership, individuals can and should enjoy
certain subsidiary rights in land. These rights properly enjoyed by
individuals are:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; 1. The right to secure exclusive occupation of land<br>
&nbsp; 2. The right to exclusive use of land occupied.<br>
&nbsp; 3. The right to the free transfer of land according to the laws
of the country.<br>
&nbsp; 4. The right to transmit land by inheritance.These individual
rights do not include:<br>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp; 1. The right
to use land in a manner contrary to the common good of all, e.g., in
such a manner as to destroy or impair the common heritage.<br>
&nbsp; 2. The right to appropriate what economists call the Economic
Rent of land.<br>
The Economic Rent is the annual value attaching to the land alone apart
from any improvements thereon created by labor. This value is created
by the existence of and the functioning of the whole community wherein
the individual lives and is in justice the property of the community.
To allow this value to be appropriated by individuals enables land to
be used not only for the production of wealth but as an instrument of
oppression of human by human leading to severe social consequences
which are everywhere evident.All humans have natural and equal rights
in land. Those rights may be exercised in two ways:</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp; 1. By holding land as
individuals and/or<br>
&nbsp; 2. Sharing in the common use of the Economic Rent of land.The
Economic Rent of land can be collected for the use of the community by
methods similar to those by which real estate taxes are now collected.
That is what is meant by the policy of Land Value Taxation. Were this
community created land value collected, the many taxes which impede the
production of wealth and limit purchasing power could be abolished.</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exercise of both common and individual rights in
land is essential to a society based on justice. But the rights of
individuals in natural resources are limited by the just rights of the
community. Denying the existence of common rights in land creates a
condition of society wherein the exercise of individual rights becomes
impossible for the great mass of the people.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WE THEREFORE DECLARE THAT THE EARTH IS THE
BIRTHRIGHT OF ALL PEOPLE.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally composed and declared at a meeting of the
International Union for Land Value Taxation held in 1949.<br>
