&nbsp;<b>Bottling the Air </b>
<p>Mason Gaffney, <br>Economics Professor, University of California,
  Riverside</p>
</center>
<blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"Don&#8217;t you know that if
people could bottle the air, they would? ... there would be an American
Air-Bottling Association... they would let millions die for want of
breath, if they could not pay for the air." </span>-- Robert G.
Ingersoll, Republican Attorney General of Illinois, 1867-69, <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Ingersoll_Lay_Sermon.html">A Lay Sermon</a> (1886)</blockquote>
<p>Times have caught up with Ingersoll. Ronald Coase, prominent
Chicago economist, says polluters (whom he calls emitters, to avoid
bias) have as much right to emit as victims (he says receptors) have
to breathe clean air. It doesn&#8217;t matter, says Coase, how we
assign property rights originally: as long as property is firm, the
market will sort it all out. However, since emitters have invested in
costly facilities, and property is sacred... you see whither this
unbiased science is tending.</p>
<p>Was he laughed to scorn? <span style="font-style: italic;">Au
contraire</span>, he was raised on the
shoulders of his adulatory peers and anointed a demi-god (which tells
you something about his peers). Having risen on wings of theory the
idea found its way into practice, and today The South Coast Air
Quality Management District awards "offset rights" to those with
worthy track records of emitting. New emitters must buy "property
rights" from old ones.</p>
<p>In effect, we don&#8217;t fine people for emitting, we reward them
with a right to continue. Then we can pay them to stop, by buying
back the right we just gave away. This is putting the free market to
work, they say. If you have not been emitting before, too bad. I have
offered not to emit millions of tons of nitrates, and sulfates too.
My price is modest, and highly competitive. I underbid the big
refineries by 50%, but Air District officials just hang up on me, if
you can believe it. They say I must have earned my offset right by
suffocating the neighbors in the unregulated past.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Coase we should no doubt award the Ukraine a perpetual
right to have melt-downs at Chernobyl, rights they could then sell to
Uganda or Paraguay or other LDC wanting to modernize with a melt-down
or two. Nicotine fiends with proven records of smoking in crowded
rooms regularly over at least the last four years will receive
official charm bracelets they can flash whenever asked to butt out.
These, of course, will be modern "bearer bracelets," transferable to
the highest bidder. Anyone caught leaving a room filled with such
legally sanctioned smoke might well be fined, and charged with
violating the bracelet-bearer&#8217;s 5th Amendment rights.</p>
<p>And those who want to breathe? Coase says they should pay for the
privilege, as they pay for indulging any personal taste. After all,
they already pay those who supply them with land to live on. Only
welfare bums would expect property owners to dip into their
hard-earned savings and supply them with free air, when the market
has a solution at hand. All they need do is buy offset rights from
Ancient and Honorable Emitters. When they want to breathe, they just
retire the rights upwind of them. This is a marvel of efficiency,
too. They retire only what it takes to clean the air they need: no
waste.</p>
<p>If they can&#8217;t afford to buy outright, they could rent --
markets have ingenious solutions for all problems, like any good
panacea. Gas masks are another free-market solution: much better than
socialistic policies that would impose uniform clean air on everyone,
whether they want it or not.</p>
<p>What about the new-born, with no prior history of either emitting
or breathing? They come innocently into the world with no basis for
being grandfathered in, and little money. Sometimes real men must put
aside maudlin whining, grit their teeth, and just pull up the ladder,
lest the lifeboat be swamped. It&#8217;s the free market way of
population control, a modified kind of natural selection. As for the
alleged innocence of the little brats, remember Original Sin, and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The
Lord of the Flies</span>.</p>
<p>There is, to be sure, a noisy crowd who want
clean
air to be generally available, and prate emotionally of natural
beauty and rights. They are only "environmental activists," an odd
elitist lot whom objective scientists may disregard.</p>
<p>For that they gave Coase a Nobel Prize. You see, old Ingersoll was
on the mark. Nothing is too absurd once we accept invading, usurping,
and leeching as the bases of property</p>
