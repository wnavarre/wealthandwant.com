<p>I would prefer here to address matters that may not otherwise receive much
  attention by others testifying. They can be labeled concerns about the environment,
  about economic development, and about equity as they are affected by the property
  tax. Normally matters such as equity and development will take care of themselves
  if a tax is designed with all the textbook principles of sound tax theory in
  mind.<em><strong>2</strong></em> But few taxes have been so assiduously conceived;
  in most cases taxes are designed not by academics; rather like sausage, they
  grind through the
  political process. I see no reason to believe the process will be different
  here. Still, I think it is worthwhile for a politically disinterested but irrepressible
  reformer to add his input to the process.<em><strong>3</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Economics of the Property Tax</strong></p>
<p>In any discussion of the real property tax, the starting point is to recognize
        that it is really two taxes from the perspective of economics: a tax
  on land value and a tax on improvements. Each has its own dynamic, and if
        this is
        fully understood lots of other implications become readily apparent.
  A tax on improvements is really quite harmful, as it penalizes the titleholder
        of property for maintaining and improving his site. A tax on land value
        fosters
        development of sites to the extent that rents are recaptured. The higher
        the tax on locations, the greater incentive to build on them. When ground
        rent, also called economic rent, is not recaptured, it is an invitation
        for speculators to seek windfall gains by riding on the productive efforts
        of
        others. Buying land and just holding it for the gain then makes economic
        sense, but it is destructive to the community. Morally speaking, so-called &quot;ground
        rent&quot; arises not from what a titleholder does but rather from the economic
        vitality of a locality or region. The property tax as it presently exists
        is like a train with an engine at each end &#8212; it actually stymies
        action. So the first step in improving our property tax is to phase out
        the improvement
        portion on a revenue neutral schedule. Ample evidence of its success
        is available for those interested.<em><strong>4</strong></em></p>

    Supplement. </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Present day economics, at least the neoclassical paradigm that is taught in
    universities today, trivializes economic rent, and the result is to ignore
    and distort the treatment of land as a factor of production, as well as the
    property tax reliant upon it. Careful attention to rent shows that it is
  about a third of our GDP,<strong><em>5</em></strong> but textbooks usually
  put the figure at about 1 percent. There is a reason why most land economists
  are partial
    to the earlier classical
    school, which reflects the thinking of political economists from Adam Smith
    through Henry George.<em><strong>6</strong></em> But rent cannot be ignored; it either flows through
    parcel locations to influence their market price or is collected in the form
    of taxes. One way or another rent flows, and if left to pass through sites
    it increases their market value. As houses and other buildings get older
  they depreciate in value, typically from 0.5 to 1.5 percent annually,<em><strong>7</strong></em> so
    the increase in land value ultimately accounts for the price of a parcel.
  Assessments should reflect this proportional shift and need to be carried out
  frequently.
    Fortunately, new technology makes land assessment almost costless, something
    I have talked about elsewhere.<em><strong>8</strong></em></p>

      as it does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
      and not to the individual who might hold title.&quot; (<em>Principles of Political

<p>A second contrast to keep in mind with regard to the two taxes on real property
    is the inelasticity (fixed supply) of land and the elasticity (variable supply)
    of improvements. This is why taxing buildings discourages development; taxing
    land value facilitates development. Moreover, the more land is taxed the more
    the high-value parcels in urban cores are encouraged to develop to the full
    extent that their value warrants. If not recaptured in tax collections, the
    rent is reflected in capitalized form in the market price of sites. Land parcels
    must be paid for one way or another: either in the periodic payment of rent
    or when they are sold to a new owner. Given the fact that improvements depreciate
    and land appreciates, the gain that is reflected in any sales usually constitutes
    a windfall to the seller. Present property taxes recapture far less than the
    full amount of rent flow, leaving appreciation of sites the inevitable result.
    Reducing or eliminating the tax recapture of rent simply enhances the windfall
    gain that titleholders get when property sells. </p>
<p><strong>Economic Development and Property Taxes</strong></p>
<p>  Because the tax on land is capitalized totally in the market price, what
  economists call deadweight loss or excess burden is non-existent. This is significant.
    One study calculates that a shift to taxes solely on land value increases
    economic efficiency by about 10 percent.<em><strong>9</strong></em> This
    contrasts with another study concluding that the deadweight loss from the
    income tax is about a thirty
    percent, fifty percent if Social Security taxes are included.<em><strong>10</strong></em> It
    is borne out in practice when the record of cities using land value taxation
    is examined.
    In Harrisburg, PA, for example, which has been phasing in a tax solely on
    land value since 1982, the number of businesses on the city's tax rolls went
    from 1,908 to 5,900 in two decades.<em><strong>11</strong></em> Other statistics
    were just as dramatic. One study calculated that &#8220;on average, a one
    percentage point increase in the tax differential between land and buildings
    will yield an increase
    in the total value of construction of 17.8 percent.&#8221;<strong><em>12</em></strong> With the
    number of cities worldwide employing such a method, it is a wonder that Americans
    have been so slow to catch on. Hong Kong provides the most impressive instance
of all. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>So upstate New York cities that have been in the doldrums for decades should
  shift to a tax that incurs no deadweight loss, which removes the penalty for
  development and maintenance of improvements, which removes the reward for speculative
  gain by holding landsites out of use, and which thereby fosters revitalization
  of urban cores. I will deal below with concerns about the household threatened
  with losing the home for inability to pay taxes &#8211; what is commonly known
  as the &#8220;poor widow argument.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Property Tax and the Environment</strong></p>
<p>I have written elsewhere<em><strong>13</strong></em> on how tax policy affects
    sprawl development, and how correcting its proclivity can easily be reversed.
    Sprawl development
      is exacerbated by public policies earlier conceived without regard to their
      consequences. Locations have value due to the economic rent flowing through
      them; the higher the productivity of locations, the more the rent. This can
      be demonstrated by mapping land values, much like USGS topographical maps
      showing the isobars of elevation. Sites vary enormously by location: a one-acre
      site in mid-town Manhattan has just gone on sale for $1 Billion.<em><strong>14</strong></em> Formulas
      for location values were worked out by Heinrich von Thunen two centuries
      ago, but only about a century ago was it possible to plug in the numbers.<em><strong>15</strong></em>  Earlier
      in the 20th century the Bureau of Census recorded data on land values, but
      it abandoned the program when assessments proved to be so inaccurate
      as to not make the task worthwhile.<em><strong>16</strong></em> As has been
      noted elsewhere, this is due to the failure of assessors to properly attend
      to the valuation of
      land, especially to under-assess it in downtown areas. Buildings, one must
      recall, depreciate in value while land appreciates, so distortions in valuations
      quickly result. Real estate bubbles are explained by land speculation cycles,
      something taxing land ameliorates. I have addressed the problem of bias in
  assessments elsewhere.<em><strong>17</strong></em></p>

      by the increases in land prices, not structures. In fact there was a time in
      the 1980s when the land under the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were so high that
      its total values were more than the whole state of California. Some sites were

      recognition of land values are Lent D. Upson, <em>Practice of Municipal Administration</em>  (New York: The Century Co., 1926), pp Chapter V; and Roderick D. McKenzie,
      <em>The Metropolitan Community</em> (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1933), Chapter
      XVII, &#8220;The Economic Topography of the City: Urban Land Values.&#8221; Land

</blockquote>
<p>Because land values in urban cores tend to be under-assessed and owners play
    the game of holding out (and often for governments to intervene), developers
    looking for affordable spots are often forced to settle for a second-best,
    suboptimal sites. They are usually further out at the edge of a city than they
    might wish. Although the difference is in good part picked up by transportation
    costs (about 90 percent of which is picked up by the society and not the driver-commuter)
    these are not perceived as a component of the opportunity costs.<em><strong>18</strong></em> The
    centrifugal forces of sprawl prevail. This is not an insignificant consideration:
    a 1993
    Natural Resources Defense Council study calculated that the total costs of
    motor vehicle transportation to our society equal approximately a fourth of
    our GDP.<em><strong>19</strong></em> We can effectuate policy, constitutionally speaking, by either
    police powers or tax powers; those are the only two instruments government
    has. Police powers are frequently expensive, and a blunt instrument by which
    to address matters. Tax powers, in contrast, can be designed such that incentives
    foster the very policies that benefit the public. Land value taxation is a
    gentle means of stemming and even reversing the centrifugal forces of sprawl
    development. </p>

       about 17 percent of gross national product (converting to GDP would make it

<p><strong>Property Taxes and Economic Justice</strong></p>
<p>The last concern worthy of address is the fairness of the property tax. In
    passing I will address the equity of the property tax as it exists now, even
    though I have noted that it can be much improved. Keep in mind that the two
    criteria of fairness are ability to pay and payment for use. In fact a property
    tax, since it is based very much on location, serves as an excellent user
    charge.<em><strong>20</strong></em> But people have come to judge it based
    on their income. Only two studies have been done, both years ago, concerning
    the incidence on homeowners
    of the property tax. Both concluded that it was marginally progressive.<em><strong>21</strong></em>  Several
    more recent studies that make different claims are flawed; most ignore renters
    and non-residential properties.<em><strong>22</strong></em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>When one recognizes the virtues of a shift to land value taxation, the inelastic
    nature of land as a base means that only households who own land pay any
  tax at all. This relieves some 35 percent of all households, usually tenants,
  and
    more often poor. Moreover, non-residential titleholders typically pay about
    half of all property taxes. (Farmers&#8217; land is so remotely located that
    it pays little at all if it isn&#8217;t already held harmless by other provisions.)
    The land tax recognizes the importance of location, and homeowners pay less
    than under the conventional property tax because their burden is assumed
    by high value underused parcels in urban cores. Since land values explain
    regional
    differences in housing, a land value tax makes home purchase more affordable.
    Reducing, and eventually eliminating, the tax on the structures more than
    compensates for whatever rises might obtain in the land tax for about two-thirds
    of homeowners.
    This has been borne out in many simulations as well as for localities that
    have adopted a phased in land value tax.<em><strong>23</strong></em></p>

<p>In passing, I should mention that most assessors pay little attention to the
    land vs improvement distinction, because it makes no difference as long as
    parcels are taxed at the same rate. As is now clear, this can be an important
    consideration not only considering depreciation and as values change over time,
    but also if taxes on each element are at different rates. Whenever revaluations
    are done, residential parcels usually end up paying less. This reflects a failing
    in property tax administration, however, not in the design of the tax itself.
    A distinction needs to be made between the merits of the property tax from
    the standpoint of economic theory, as opposed to the quality of its administration
    in present circumstances. Secondly, governments have done a dismal job in explaining
    the property tax to the public, and this accounts for much of the animus toward
    it. How to improve its administration is a discussion for another day.</p>
<p><strong>Options for Property Tax Relief</strong></p>
<p>  If households were required to pay the mortgage interest on their homes in
    its entirety once a year, they would likely feel burdened. Faced with a similar
    obligation for taxes understandably draws complaints. Yet, as explained earlier,
    the less the tax collected out of the economic rent of land in the course
    of a homeowner&#8217;s lifetime use of a location, the greater the capital
    gain will be when that parcel is eventually sold. This is because the rent
    from the land component is capitalized in the market price of the parcel,
    even as the house depreciates as a proportion of the total value. Already,
    capital gains from home sales are mostly exempt from taxation at the federal
    (and by extension state) level. Relieving further the modest periodic taxation
    of home values during the period of ownership provides a windfall gain to
    titleholders beyond any precedent in American history. Doing so would favor
    the real estate industry as an investment vehicle and a venue for speculation
    over any other opportunity. Fairness argues against such a policy.</p>
<p>This is not to deny that many homeowners are unduly burdened by their property
  taxes. The answer to this concern is to offer to households the option of deferring
  their tax payments until they cash out, and then able to pay their obligation
  in full with any interest due. This choice becomes particularly attractive
  and feasible when coupled with a phased-in shift to a land value tax. There
  are four major mechanisms of relief employed by states in attempts to address
  this issue: tax caps of various sorts, differential rates on homesteads and
  non-homestead properties, circuit-breaker mechanisms, and deferral of tax payments.
  Attempts to achieve equity by credits, deductions, and exemptions may offer
  burden relief, but they are almost random in their distributional impact because
  no blanket law can equitably cover all regions and cases. Even simulating the
  impact is essentially impossible. I have dealt with these options in another
  monograph (see note supra). </p>
<p>As the National Conference of State Legislators has concluded, the Deferral
  option, now employed in 24 states to some extent, is by far the best solution.
  It is equitable in so far as it maintains the obligation on homeowners and
  generally accords with both the ability to pay and user fee criteria. It is
  non-distorting in both land use configurations and for intergenerational equity.
  It is easily administrable and understandable to both the public and to parties
  involved. And it is economically efficient from the standpoint of economic
  development. No other option among those available satisfies all the criteria
  of the textbook principles of sound tax theory. No other option is so politically
  and administratively feasible to the leaders of New York State. </p>
