 name="I._Taxing_Land_as_Ethics_and_Efficiency"></a>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxing
Land as Ethics
and Efficiency<br>
<br>
</span>
There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.<br>
<br>
This monograph will first address the<span style="font-weight: bold;">
efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts.&nbsp; The first and more
traditional part is that taxing land permits the reduction of other
taxes.&nbsp; This improves efficiency because it reduces the economic
distortions that cause people to work less and save less.&nbsp; Because
land is fixed in supply, there is no reduction in economic efficiency
from taxing it.<br>
<br>
The second and less customary part of the efficiency argument for
taxing land is that, apart from the opportunity it offers to reduce
harmful taxes, taxing land actually improves economic efficiency, in at
least three ways.&nbsp;<ul>
  <li>First, compensation for local externalities
associated with land use can be incorporated into a tax on land.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Second, when lending markets are imperfect, taxing land improves
the
relative bidding power of persons who face high interest rates.&nbsp;
This shifts land into the hands of persons who get greater returns from
it.  </li>
  <li>Third, taxing land reduces the profit from land speculation,
there&shy;by reducing the amount of land speculation, which increases
the effective supply of land.</li>
</ul>
To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that addspeculationitional taxes on
land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a>.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for taxing
land is based on two ethical premises: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1)
every person has a right to himself or herself, and <br>
2) all persons have
equal rights to the natural opportunities that are not embodied in
persons. <br>
</div>
The first premise leads to the conclusion that taxing
people according to the products of their efforts or the products of
their saving can only be just if people voluntarily agree,
individually, to be subject to such taxes.&nbsp; Taxing land, on the
other hand, does not involve such an intrusion on individual
rights.&nbsp; In fact, taxing land is a way equalizing the advantages
of access to land, as required by the second premise.<br>
<br>
The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.<br>
<br>
After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp; The answer to this argument is that collecting a large
percentage of the rental value of land through taxes will require new
assessment methods based on observing the rental price of land rather
than the selling price.&nbsp; I describe how such methods can be
devised.<br>
<br>
Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp; It is true that many
properties have mortgages that would exceed the value of the property
if land taxes were increased significantly.&nbsp; This makes it
necessary to think carefully about who should absorb the decline in
aggregate asset value that would accompany a significant shift toward
taxing land.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is possible to plan for a
restructured financial system that would have shed its dependence on
land as collateral.<br>
<br>
Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; The answer to this
argument is that the use of land as collateral encourages banks to lend
mindlessly to anyone who has collateral, rather than work to find good
lending opportunities.&nbsp; Thus the disappear&shy;ance of land as
collateral would actually improve the efficiency with which financial
resources are invested.<br>
<br>
Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; This argument represents a refusal to make a distinction
that begs to be made.&nbsp; The first principle of economic justice is
that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; While some scholars have
asserted that people have rights to them&shy;selves but not to their
talents, this is nonsensical.&nbsp; Without talents, there is no
self.&nbsp; Talents are fundamentally different from land.&nbsp; The
equal rights of all to land can consistently be asserted while still
asserting that every person has right to the use of his or her talents.<br>
<br>
But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss what land
is.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<a name="II._What_is_Land"></a>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</span><br>
<br>
David Ricardo defined land, memorably, as &#8216;the original and
indestructible powers of the soil.&#8217;&nbsp; This definition is overly
narrow.&nbsp; It would exclude from land such valuable and
destruc&shy;tible things as minerals and topsoil. Ricardo&#8217;s definition
even suggests that the value of land arising from urban locations might
not be included in &#8216;land,&#8217; since it would not necessarily qualify as a
&#8216;power of the soil.&#8217;<br>
<br>
The definition of land that is most useful in economic theory is that
land is all scarce factors of production other than people and the
products of human effort. Land is the gifts of nature.&nbsp; Thus land
includes both rural and urban territory, mineral resources, water, fish
in oceans and rivers, virgin forests, geosynchronous orbits and the
frequency spectrum.<br>
<br>
While there is some tendency to think of measuring land in &#8216;stock&#8217;
terms (&#8216;What is the value of that piece of land?&#8217;), the flow of
services from land is more fundamental.&nbsp; While capital goods have
selling prices related to their costs of production, such a calculation
does not apply to land since, by definition, land is not
produced.&nbsp; The selling price of land is conceived in economic
theory as the present value of the net return after taxes to the future
flow of land services, when the land is used in the way that maximizes
that present value.&nbsp; Following David Ricardo, the value of the
flow of services from land is sometimes described as the residual after
paying other factors their opportunity costs, when land is used
efficiently.&nbsp; But in equilibrium, a similar statement can be made
about any other factor.<br>
<br>
With some components of land, such as river water flowing into an
ocean, the extent to which the land is used in one period has no
influence on the extent to which it can be used in other periods.&nbsp;
In other cases, such as mineral deposits, use in one period comes at
the expense of use in other periods.&nbsp; Agricultural land has a
capacity to be &#8216;mined&#8217; of the nutrients that make it productive,
making it somewhat similar to mineral deposits.<br>
<br>
With urban land there is a different type of interdependency between
use at one time and the potential flow of services at another.&nbsp; To
be used most productively, urban land must be combined with durable,
immobile capital.&nbsp; Therefore an increase in the intensity of urban
land use often requires the destruction of previous capital
investments.&nbsp; This intertemporal dependence means that, in
principle, a forecast of all future economic conditions is needed to
know what use of land is best today.&nbsp; Since people make different
forecasts, they reach different conclusions about what use of land is
best today.&nbsp; Only with the passage of time, if at all, is it
possi&shy;ble to know what use of land would have been best.<br>
<br>
The fact that structures are durable and immobile also means that care
must be taken in defining the value of the flow of land services.&nbsp;
There is a tendency to think of &#8220;the rent of land&#8221; as the amount of
money that land yields to those who have exclusive use of it.&nbsp;
How&shy;ever, this formulation is not always useful for defining the
rent of land over a particular interval of time.&nbsp; If an investor
spends a year and &pound;20 million erecting a building that is
expected to last for 30 years, what was the rent of the land under the
building during the year of construction?&nbsp; It is not sensible to
say that, if the best possible use of the land produces a negative cash
flow over a given interval of time, then land has no rental value over
that interval.&nbsp; If markets were perfect and the decision to
construct the structure was optimal, the finished building would have a
value that was greater than its cost of construction by the rent of the
land it occupied and the accumulated interest on construction costs and
land rent.&nbsp; But if a non-optimal construction decision is made,
that does not reduce the rent of land.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
To give a meaning to &#8216;the rent of land&#8217; that does not depend on when
construction hap&shy;pens to occur, it is useful to define &#8216;the rent of
land&#8217; as the opportunity cost of leaving vacant land vacant.&nbsp; Thus
in the case of the year of construction discussed above, one would ask,
&#8216;Suppose that the construction had been postponed for a year.&nbsp;
Perhaps by that time it would be appropriate to invest in a &pound;21
million building rather than a &pound;20 million building.&nbsp; If one
developed the most profitable possible plan for the land, subject to
the constraint that the land be left vacant for the first year, how
much lower would the present value of net returns be?&#8217;&nbsp; The answer
to this question, the loss of the present value of net returns from
postponing use of land for a year, would be the rent of the land for
the year.&nbsp; This is the amount of money that one would need to get
in net returns from some pre-existing use to justify postponing
redevelopment for a year.&nbsp; Thus the rent of land for any developed
site, for any year, is defined to be the answer to the question, &#8216;If
this site were undevel&shy;oped, what would be the cost of leaving
undeveloped and unused for a year?&#8217;<br>
<br>
Land also differs from labor and capital in the origin of claims to own
it.&nbsp;<ul>
  <li>Labor can be defined as the factors of production that own
themselves.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Ownership of capital is derived originally from
organizing its production and paying the various factors that are
employed to produce it.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Ownership of land, by contrast, derives
from rights of exclusive use and access that are granted by governments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ownership of land is thus a form of privilege.&nbsp; The word
&#8216;privilege&#8217; comes from the Latin prive + legis, meaning &#8216;private
  law&#8217;.&nbsp; A private law is a law that has someone&#8217;s name it, that is,
  a law that authorizes one person to do what others are not permitted to
  do.&nbsp; In a just world, there would be no privilege.&nbsp; (Thus no
  one is underprivileged.)&nbsp; In a just world, land would not be
&#8216;owned&#8217;, but rather &#8216;held&#8217; or &#8216;possessed&#8217;,
subject to a payment that reflected the value given up by others in allowing
one person to have
  exclusive use of a site.<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
  <a name="III._The_simple_efficiency_argument_for"></a>III.&nbsp; The
  simple efficiency
  argument for taxing land</span><br>
  <br>
  A tax creates a difference, a &#8216;wedge&#8217;, between the price that a buyer
  pays and the price that the seller receives.&nbsp; Sometimes the wedge
  generated by a tax is enough to inhibit a trans&shy;action that would
  otherwise occur.&nbsp; If the tax that must be paid on a transaction is
  greater than the gains from trade that would accrue in the absence of a
  tax, then the tax precludes any mutually advantageous trade.&nbsp; Thus
  taxes often reduce economic efficiency.<br>
  <br>
  Economists use supply and demand schedules to analyze the magnitude of
  the losses of efficiency that are caused by taxes.&nbsp; In Figure 1, S
  is the supply schedule for a taxed com&shy;modity and D is the demand
  schedule for the commodity.&nbsp; In the initial equilibrium, the
  quantity bought and sold per period is Q0 and the price is P0.&nbsp;
  When a tax of T per unit is levied on the good, the price to sellers
  falls to P1 and the price that buyers pay rises to P1 + T, while the
  quantity sold per period falls to Q1.&nbsp; The sales that are lost
  with the tax in place (the difference between Q0 and Q1) represent
  units for which the difference between the value to the buyer and the
  value to the seller is less than the tax.&nbsp; The loss of economic
  value entailed in the reduction in the quantity sold is the difference
  between the
  value that the lost sales would have had to the buyers (the area under
  the demand curve for the lost sales) and the cost of these units to
  suppliers (the area under the supply curve for the lost sales).&nbsp;
  The difference between these two areas in Figure 1 is the shaded
  triangle.&nbsp; The area of this triangle is the excess burden of the
  tax.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  When there is more than one tax in an economy, one must take account of
  the fact that the second tax will generally reduce the excess burden of
  the first tax.&nbsp; This is because when you tax a good, say apples,
  people buy other things instead, say bananas.&nbsp; If you then tax
  bananas, some of the expenditure that no longer goes to bananas will go
  back to apples, thereby reducing the magnitude of the tax-induced
  shrinkage of the market for apples.&nbsp; If it were possible to tax
&#8216;everything&#8217; at the same rate, then people would pay the same total
  amount in taxes no matter what they did, and there would be no excess
  burden of taxes.<br>
  <br>
  What makes it impossible to tax everything at the same rate is that one
  of the things that would need to be taxed is leisure.&nbsp; Taxing
  authorities have not yet devised ways to maintain people&#8217;s tax
  obligations when they decide to earn and spend less money.&nbsp; Thus
  all systems that tax people according to what they receive (from
  working or saving), or spend, generate excess burdens.&nbsp; They do
  this by making the incentive to work less than the value of what people
  produce and the incentive to save less than the productivity of
  investments financed by saving.&nbsp; Still, systems of &#8216;broad-based&#8217;
  taxes (e.g., sales taxes, income taxes and value added taxes) generally
  have lower excess burdens than tax systems in which a variety of
  individual goods and services are taxed at different rates.&nbsp;
  Actual broad-based taxes generally have exceptions and
  non-uniformities, and these generally increase the excess burdens that
  the taxes cause.&nbsp; Still, one way in which a departure from
  uniformity in taxation can promote efficiency is that, if there are
  some goods and services that are particularly likely to be purchased in
  greater quantity when people consume more leisure, then a somewhat
  higher tax on these can serve as a partial substitute for taxing
  leisure.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to discouraging work, most tax systems discourage saving by
  taxing the proceeds of people&#8217;s savings.&nbsp; This results in less
  saving and investment.&nbsp; With the passage of time, this can cause a
  very large reduction in the amount of capital in an economy.&nbsp; And
  a reduced stock of capital generally means that labor will be less
  productive and wages will be lower.&nbsp; A tax system that taxed only
  consumption and not saving would not have this com&shy;ponent of excess
  burden. However, raising a given amount of revenue in a tax system that
  did not tax saving would require a greater distor&shy;tion of the
  labor/leisure decision than in a tax system that did tax saving<br>
  .<br>
  Consider how the above analysis of excess burden changes when land is
  taxed.&nbsp; Elemen&shy;tary economics texts often offer the analysis
  shown in Figure 2.&nbsp; The supply of land is said to be perfectly
  inelastic, vertical.&nbsp; Thus when a tax introduces a wedge between
  the price paid by buyers of land services and the price received by
  seller, the quantity remains unchanged.&nbsp; The triangle
  disappears.&nbsp; Thus there is no excess burden of a tax on
  land.&nbsp; A tax on land is &#8216;neutral&#8217;.<br>
  </p>
<p><br>
  There are several limitations of this analysis.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, the tax
must not be more than the rental value of land, or no one will be
willing to hold title to land and pay the tax.&nbsp; Since the most
productive uses of land often require capital that is durable and
immobile, it is also necessary for people to be confident when they
contemplate investment that the tax will not exceed the rental value of
the land over the life of the investment.</li>
  <li>Second, the tax must be administered in such a way that the tax
will
not increase if the land is used more productively.&nbsp; That would
discourage productive use of the land.  </li>
  <li>Finally, the analysis as
presented applies only to the indestructible components of land.&nbsp;
If there are ways that people might want to use land that would reduce
its value compared to what nature provided (as with mining or fishing),
then a tax on land in proportion to its value will give people an
inefficient incentive to reduce its value.  </li>
</ul>
There is a way to eliminate this inefficient incentive.&nbsp; One can
apply to mineable land a &#8216;severance tax&#8217; for reductions in value.&nbsp;
To exactly offset the incentive effects of a land value tax, the amount
of the severance tax should be the present value of the reductions in
the land value tax that occur because of the reduction in the value of
the
land.&nbsp; Then the present value of the sum of the land value tax
payments and the severance tax payments will be independent of how
the land is used.<br>
<br>
To summarize: If land is subject to a tax or combination of taxes with
a present value that is independent of how the land is used, and if
potential investors are confident that the magnitude of the tax will
not exceed the value of using the land over the life of potential
invest&shy;ments, then a tax on land has no excess burden; it is
neutral.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<a name="IV._Taxing_Land_is_Better_Than_Neutral"></a>IV.&nbsp; Taxing
Land is Better Than
Neutral</span><br>
<br>
The analysis above explained how a tax on land can be &#8216;neutral&#8217;, that
is, how such a tax can have no excess burden.&nbsp; In fact, taxing
land is better than neutral; it improves economic efficiency compared
to the no-tax situation.&nbsp; This section explains how.<br>
<br>
First, a land tax can be used to take account of positive and negative
externalities associa&shy;ted with land use.&nbsp; The typical example
of a negative externality is pollution.&nbsp; If labor and capital were
perfectly mobile, then the effect of pollution on near-by locations
would be reflected entirely in land values.&nbsp; Thus one might say
that a polluter &#8216;uses&#8217; surrounding land and should pay for that use in
the form of a &#8216;land tax&#8217; equal to the reduction in the rental value of
land that results from his activities.&nbsp; Such a land tax would not
only raise government revenue, but would also improve efficiency
by ensuring that people would engage in activities that pro&shy;duced
pollution only when the benefits of those activities exceeded the costs.<br>
<br>
Because labor and capital are not perfectly mobile, pollution affects
not only land values, but also the value of structures and the net
well-being that people experience from the opportunity to continue to
live in accustomed places.&nbsp; Efficient management of pollution
would charge polluters for these costs as well.<br>
<br>
When there is traffic congestion on city streets or on highways,
bridges, or tunnels, one might say that there is a problem caused by
people not being charged adequately for the use of particu&shy;larly
valuable space.&nbsp; If there is a congestion charge (land tax) that
reflects the extent to which any one user of streets and highways
imposes costs on others users in the form of increased travel times,
then that congestion charge improves efficiency while also raising
government revenue.<br>
<br>
What applies to negative externalities applies also to positive
externalities, although now some extra steps in the analysis are
needed.&nbsp; If there are private activities that raise the rental
value of surrounding land, such as the provision of a car park in a
city centre, then to motivate private users of land to undertake these
activities at efficient levels, one must compensate them for the
value of the positive externalities they generate.&nbsp; Again, if
labour and capital were perfectly mobile, these externalities would be
reflected entirely in changes (this time, positive changes) in land
values.<br>
<br>
With compensation for the externalities now generat&shy;ing an outflow
from the public treasury rather than an inflow, it is not immediately
clear that the government can afford to provide efficient
incentives.&nbsp; However, if the tax regime is one in which the
government collects all of the rental value of land in taxes, then
efficient incentives for activities with positive externalities that
are reflected in land values will be self-financing.&nbsp; What is
spent in rewarding activities with positive externalities will be
recap&shy;tured from taxes on the land that rises in value.&nbsp; In
fact, there is bound to be a net surplus, because the improved
coordination of land uses that would be induced by the rebates for
positive externalities would make land worth more in the aggregate with
the rebates than without them.<br>
<br>
If the government collects only a fraction of the rental value of land,
then rewards for positive externalities would not be self-financing,
and one would need to ask whether this particular use of scarce
government funds was more important than other potential uses.&nbsp;
Still, it would be possible to have &#8216;betterment districts&#8217; that would
levy special-purpose taxes on the land that benefited from activities
like private parking garages.&nbsp; With such special-purpose taxes
there is no competition for scarce public funds.&nbsp; And while the
system of rewards for positive externalities would not generate a net
surplus for the Treasury as it would under a system of full taxation of
the rental value of land, it would generate a net improve&shy;ment in
the efficiency of the economy.<br>
<br>
As with negative externalities, the fact that labor and capital are not
perfectly mobile means that not all of the effects of activities with
positive externalities are reflected in land values.&nbsp; And to the
extent that labor and capital are affected, negative effects are likely
to be more prominent than positive effects.&nbsp; Consider
structures.&nbsp; If an existing structure is efficient for the current
pattern of surrounding land uses, and if new use of surrounding land
raises the value of the land under the structure, then the structure
can be expected to thereby become suboptimal.&nbsp; The pre-existing
structure is generally not as intensive a use of land as would have
been chosen with knowledge of the new activity.&nbsp; Therefore the
economic life of the pre-existing structure (the time until it is
efficient to demolish it) is shortened by the new activity that
increases land value.&nbsp; Even though rent per square foot of built
space rises, the rise is not enough to offset the increase in land
value, which presumes the newly efficient size for a structure, thereby
reducing the amount of the current return that is attributable to the
existing structure and pushing the structure toward obsolescence.<br>
<br>
A similar phenomenon occurs with respect to the personal value that
people attach to locations, what might be called &#8216;location-specific
human capital&#8217;.&nbsp; If all persons had equal demands for all
locations, there would be no location-specific human capital.&nbsp; But
incomes, tastes and personal histories differ, leading to differing
personal values for locations.&nbsp; Familiarity with a location
tends to lead people to attach a special value to it, a value that
tends to be lost if the characteristics of the location change.&nbsp;
Thus a change in land use that raises surrounding land values will
generally reduce the location-specific human capital of the residents
of that area.&nbsp; One example of this phenomenon occurs when a
neighborhood is &#8216;gentrified&#8217;, and the prior residents of modest means
can no longer afford to live there and must seek other housing options
that are less attractive to them than the opportunities they
lost.&nbsp; This represents a reduction in their location-specific
human capital.<br>
<br>
Because increases in land value generally cause reductions in both the
value of location-specific human capital and the value of pre-existing
structures, an efficient system of incentives for activities that
increase land values would offer incentives reflecting only the net
benefits, after the value of the negative consequences for physical and
human capital had been subtracted from the increase in land
values.&nbsp; An ideal system would collect all of the extra increase
in land value and use it to provide compensation for the negative
consequences for physical and human capital.<br>
<br>
Compensation for private activities that increase land values is more
like a rebate of a land tax than a tax itself, but it nicely
complements a system of taxes for activities that reduce land
values.&nbsp; They belong together in a discussion of how a land tax
can be better than neutral.<br>
<br>
Another way in which a tax on land can be better than neutral is that
it can ameliorate imperfections in lending markets.&nbsp; Because
capital markets are not perfect, people vary with respect to the
discount rate that they apply to future taxes.&nbsp; The lower the
discount rate, the higher will be the present value that a person
assigns to future land tax payments.&nbsp; This means that an increase
in taxes on land will lower the bid prices of those with low discount
rates by more than it lowers the bid prices of those with high discount
rates.&nbsp; Thus an increase in taxes on land will tend to shift land
from people with low discount rates to people with high discount
rates.&nbsp; Since people with high discount rates get greater returns
from their assets, this increases economic output.<br>
<br>
The last way in which a tax on land can be better than neutral is that
it can reduce ineffi&shy;ciency associated with land speculation.&nbsp;
If everyone had the same view as to what the future held, then there
would be no possibility of making speculative gains.&nbsp; But people
differ in their views about the future, creating opportunities for
people to engage in speculations that they believe will be
profitable.&nbsp; For speculations in widely traded standar&shy;dized
commodities, it is not necessary to own the commodity to speculate; one
can speculate through futures contracts.&nbsp; With land however, while
there are some rudimentary futures contracts, these are available in
only a few places and do not reflect the individual variations in land
values that arise because of land&#8217;s locational fixity.&nbsp; Therefore
most of the speculations that people might wish to make with respect to
land require that the speculators own land for the duration of the
speculation.<br>
<br>
In theory, land speculation can either improve or worsen economic
efficiency.&nbsp; The way that land speculation can improve efficiency
is by preventing the premature development of land at suboptimal
intensity.&nbsp; If land in a particular region is destined to rise in
value at a rapid rate and few people realize this, then in the absence
of speculation in land, people would tend to build structures that
would turn out not to have been worth building once the higher value of
land became known.&nbsp; In retrospect it would be seen to have been
more efficient to leave land undeveloped until its value rose, and then
develop it at a higher intensity.&nbsp; The possibility of profitable
speculation in land would induce those who could foresee the future
higher value of land to buy land and hold it unused until its high
value became generally known.&nbsp; In the process, the inefficient
premature development of land at a sub-optimal intensity would be
prevented.<br>
<br>
The way that land speculation can worsen economic efficiency is by
giving land the greatest value to those who make the most foolish
overestimates of the rate at which it will rise in value.&nbsp; The
result is that much land is owned by people who have paid more for it
than can ever be recovered from its use.&nbsp; This is an example of a
phenomenon that economists call &#8216;the winner&#8217;s curse&#8217;.&nbsp; The general
description of the winner&#8217;s curse is that when a thing of uncertain
value is sold to the highest bidder (or a contract is let to the lowest
bidder), the person who wins the thing by bidding highest (or lowest)
will suffer the curse of having paid too much for it (or bid too
low).&nbsp; The winner&#8217;s curse arises commonly in such arenas as
bidding for oil leases and construction contracts.<br>
<br>
The effect of the winner&#8217;s curse in the land market is that those who
attach the greatest value to land are persons who believe that it would
be unprofitable to invest in improvements to the land, because it will
soon rise rapidly in value, and any improvements con&shy;structed now
would be sacrificed when the higher value of land was realized.&nbsp;
Thus, in land speculation, the winner&#8217;s curse produces the social cost
of an artificial scarcity of land for current use.<br>
<br>
A rise in the rate of taxation of land reduces the potential profit
from speculating in land because it reduces the selling price of
land.&nbsp; Thus a rise in land taxes reduces the speculative demand
for land (the number of pounds per month that a speculator is willing
to pay in interest in taxes to hold a parcel of land with given
prospects in his mind), but a rise in land taxes does not reduce the
number of pounds per month that a current user of land is willing to
pay in interest in taxes for current use of land.&nbsp; Thus a tax on
land shifts land from speculators to current users, thereby reducing
the tendency toward an artificial scarcity of land from
speculation.&nbsp; This is shown diagrammatically in Figure 3.<br>
<br>
The width of Figure 3 represents the fixed quantity of land that is
available for current or speculative use.&nbsp; The demand curve that
goes down from the left, Du, represents the demand for land for current
use.&nbsp; Speculative demand for land is measured from right to left
and is represented by the demand curve Ds.&nbsp; The intersection of
these two curves specifies the price, P0, at which the demands for land
for use and for speculation sum to the available quantity of
land.&nbsp; The amount of land that is devoted to current use is
Q0.&nbsp; An increase in the tax on land leaves the demand schedule for
land for current use unchanged, but lowers the demand schedule for land
for speculation to D&cent;s.&nbsp; With the new demand schedule for
land for speculation, the price for land for current use falls to P1
and the
quantity of land devoted to current use rises to Q1.<br>
<br>
Since land speculation can, in theory, either improve or worsen the
efficiency with which land is used, it is an empirical question as to
which effect predominates.&nbsp; While no conclusive evidence is
available, there are reasons for believing that the winner&#8217;s curse is
more powerful than the beneficial speculative withholding of
land.&nbsp; The first reason is casual empiricism.&nbsp; As one looks
around cities, it is easy to find places where vast amounts of barely
improved land surround islands of intense development.&nbsp; It
commonly happens that land near very tall buildings has been occupied
for many decades by one- or two-storey buildings, or even by nothing
more than a paved car park.&nbsp; This cannot be efficient.&nbsp; There
would have been time to fully depreciate substantial buildings while
owners have been waiting for the right time to develop land.&nbsp; The
inefficiency of leaving such land underused is the social cost of the
winner&#8217;s curse.<br>
<br>
There is little evidence of inefficiency from premature land
development.&nbsp; If there were such evidence, it would take the form
of recently constructed buildings being demolished for more extensive
development, or possibly, in less extreme and less obvious cases, new
development surrounded by recent, substantially less extensive
development that could have been just as extensive as the new
development if only the developers had waited a little longer.&nbsp;
Examples of the first type of evidence are quite rare.&nbsp; Examples
of the second type would be easy to miss, but still there seems to be
no reason to suppose that they represent a problem of efficiency as
widespread as the problem of indefinitely deferred development induced
by the winner&#8217;s curse.<br>
<br>
The second reason for believing that deferred development induced by
the winner&#8217;s curse is more of a problem than premature development
induced by a lack of foresight is that the latter problem can more
easily be resolved by new markets.&nbsp; If land should come to be
taxed so heavily that people stopped speculating in land, and if it
then transpired that people often lost money on their investments in
developing land because they underestimated the rate at which land
values would rise, then there would be a potential private market for
good predictions of the rates at which land values would rise.&nbsp; A
person who could foresee future rises in land values (a good speculator
in today&#8217;s markets) would have a comparative advantage in selling
insurance against a rise in land values, and hence in land taxes, that
would make current development unprofitable.&nbsp; Thus, in making land
speculation unprofitable, land taxation would redirect the energies of
those who believed they could predict rises in land values, away from
buying and holding land that they believed would rise in value, and
toward selling insurance against rises in land values where they
believed that there would be none.&nbsp; People would be discouraged
from building where land values were foreseen to rise rapidly, by the
unavailability of reasonably priced insurance against rises in land
taxes.&nbsp; Thus the potential development of a market for insurance
against rises in land values makes it unnecessary to maintain land
speculation as a mechanism to secure efficient deferral of
development.&nbsp; The benefits of eliminating the inefficient deferral
of development that is caused by the winner&#8217;s curse can be secured
without foregoing the benefits of redirecting development, based on
private knowledge of where land values will rise rapidly.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="V._Measuring_the_Economic_Gains_from"></a>V.&nbsp; Measuring the
Economic Gains
from Shifting Taxes to Land</span><br>
<br>
There are three principal sources of economic gains from shifting taxes
away from capital and labor and onto land:&nbsp; <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) The removal of
taxes from labor motivates people to make more efficient decisions
about how much to work; <br>
2) The removal of taxes from capital motivates
people to make more efficient decisions about how much to save; and <br>
3)
increasing taxes on land motivates people to speculate less in land,
increasing the amount of land available for current use.&nbsp; <br>
</div>
In this
section I report estimates of the magnitudes of these effects, derived
from a general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy.<br>
<br>
A model of an economy is necessarily oversimplified compared to a real
economy.&nbsp; Nevertheless, model builders hope that their models will
have enough resemblance to actual economies that results derived from
models will be relevant to actual economies.&nbsp; Whether this is true
of any particular model must be a matter of conjecture until the model
is tested against reality.&nbsp; The model presented here has many
features in common with models that economists have found useful, but
its novel features are untested.<br>
<br>
In the model, the total output in year is a function of the quantities
of three inputs used, land, labor and capital.&nbsp; The output that
can be attained from given inputs increases each year as a result of
technological advance. The relatively novel element in the production
function is the distinction between land and capital as two separate
factors of production; many economists include land with capital,
making no distinction between the two.<br>
<br>
Economists give the name &#8216;elasticity of substitution&#8217; to the ratio of a
percentage change in factor proportions to the percentage change in
relative factor prices that induced it.&nbsp; If a 1% change in the
ratio of the price of land to the price of labor induces a 2% change in
the ratio of the quantity of labor used to the quantity of land used,
then the corresponding production function is said to have an
elasticity of substitution of 2 between land and labor.&nbsp; The
greater the elasticity of substitution of a production function, the
more an economy benefits from increases in the availability of
individual factors of production.<br>
<br>
Many economists have studied the elasticity of substitution between
labor and capital.&nbsp; After considering such studies, I decided that
0.8 is a plausible figure for the elasticity of substitution between
labor and capital, and I assumed that the elasticity of substitution
between any two of land, labor and capital is 0.8.<br>
<br>
Like many other economists, I employ a model with a very limited range
of goods: There is one private consumption good in the model, one
public consumption good and one capital good.&nbsp; Consumers are also
concerned with leisure, which they consume whenever they are not
sleeping (8 hours per day) or working.<br>
<br>
I assume that the resources that are capable of producing a unit of the
private good are also capable of producing a unit of the public
good.&nbsp; Capital goods are treated somewhat differently, in being
subject to rising costs.&nbsp; For the level of output where average
cost is minimized, a unit of capital goods has the same cost as a unit
of consumption goods.&nbsp; For other levels of output, the average
cost of capital goods is a quadratic function of quantity.&nbsp; The
level of output of capital goods at which average cost is minimized in
any given year is a weighted average of the level at which average cost
would have been minimized the previous year and the actual level of
output of capital goods the previous year.<br>
<br>
The quantity of land that is employed in any year reflects the response
of land speculation to taxes on land. The idea that the quantity of
land employed in production might vary posi&shy;tively with the level
of taxes on land is an innovation in the model.<br>
<br>
Households choose the quantity of labor that is employed in production,
taking account of the wage after taxes, their total resources, and
their preferences.&nbsp; (The wage before taxes is the marginal product
of labor.)&nbsp; The quantity of capital that is employed in production
is the quantity that households have chosen to accumulate, taking
account of the return to saving after taxes, their total resources and
their preferences.&nbsp; (The return to capital before taxes is the
marginal product of capital.)<br>
<br>
The statements about labor and capital in the previous paragraph
incorporate an assumption that the economy that is being modeled
is &#8216;closed&#8217;.&nbsp; That is, capital and labor cannot go elsewhere or
come from elsewhere.&nbsp; That is a reasonable approximation for
labor, but it is increasingly implausible for capital.&nbsp; Therefore,
in exploring the consequences of changes in taxes, I investigate the
implications of both the assumption that the economy is closed with
respect to capital and the assumption that it is open with respect to
capital and small with respect to the world, so that it can import as
much capital at it wishes without affecting the interest rate.&nbsp; It
is not plausible to suppose that the U.S. economy is small enough
compared to the rest of the world that its actions would have no effect
on interest rates.&nbsp; Therefore one should regard the results for
open and closed economies as bounds on what is plausible with respect
to saving and investing.<br>
<br>
The model treats an economy as composed of a large number of households
with identical tastes and incomes.&nbsp; The members of these
households are assumed to make spending and saving decisions under an
assumption that they will live forever.&nbsp; They are assumed to
derive utility from consumption of three goods: a private good, a
public good, and leisure.<br>
<br>
Just as with elasticity of substitution in the production function, the
propensity of people to change their consumption patterns in response
to changing relative prices can be described by elasticities of
substitution.&nbsp; If people increase the ratio of private goods to
leisure that they consume by 2% when the relative price of goods
compared to leisure falls by 1%, then they are said to have an
elasticity of substitution between goods and leisure of 2.&nbsp; Based
on studies by others, I assume that the elasticity of substitution
between goods and leisure in any period of time is 0.8.<br>
<br>
The decisions people make about saving depend, among other things, on
the elasticity of substitution between consumption in different
periods.&nbsp; Based again on a review of the work of others, I assume
that the &#8216;intertemporal elasticity of substitution&#8217; is 0.375.&nbsp;
This means that if the price of consumption in one period relative to
another falls by 1%, consumers will want to increase their consumption
in that period relative to the other by 0.375%.<br>

The National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) for the U.S. economy
list ten sources of public revenue, as shown in Table I.&nbsp; The
first eight of these sources are taxes; the last two are treated in the
model as payments for privately produced goods.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Based on data published by the Internal Revenue Service, the revenue
from the individual income tax was divided into revenue from asset
income and revenue from labor income, and marginal and average tax
rates were estimated for both tax bases.&nbsp; Based on social security
legislation, social insurance payments were divided equally between
taxes on employers and taxes on employees.&nbsp; Based on figures
devel&shy;oped by Martin Feldstein, social insurance payments were also
divided into a fraction that is taxes (h) and a fraction that is
individual savings.<br>
<br>
Taking account of the upper limit on Social Security contributions, I
estimated average and marginal social insurance tax rates.&nbsp; I
assumed that excise taxes internalise externalities, so that they
generate no excess burden.&nbsp; On this basis, they were assigned a
marginal tax rate of zero, since the marginal rate of a tax reflects
the excess burden that it generates.&nbsp; (Average tax rates determine
the revenue that they generate.)&nbsp; Tax rates for other taxes were
computed as the ratio of tax revenue to the tax base.&nbsp; This
produced the tax rates shown below:<br>

&nbsp; <br>
For the first year of the model, the economic facts are determined by
history.&nbsp; (2000 is taken as the initial year of the model because
that is the most recent year for which it might reason&shy;ably be
supposed that people would make economic decisions based on an
assumption that tax rates in the current year would prevail in future
years.&nbsp; In subsequent years, proposals for tax rate changes have
continually been under public discussion.)&nbsp; These facts permit one
to identify the parameters of the production function and the utility
function.<br>
<br>
Once the parameters of the production function and the utility function
have been identified, one can &#8220;grow&#8221; the model over time, based on the
assumption that the decisions made in the initial year were part of a
rational long-term plan.&nbsp; People make work and saving decisions
based on the maximization of their utility function, given the prices
of goods and leisure, now and in the future.&nbsp; Output is a function
of inputs.&nbsp; Tax revenues are functions of tax rates and the
magnitudes of tax bases.&nbsp; The addition to the capital stock is
determined by how much people save.&nbsp; The discount that people
attach to future goods must be such that following their long-term plan
neither bankrupts them nor leaves them eventually saving all their
income.<br>
<br>
If one assumes that at some subsequent time tax rates will change, then
this produces new prices of consumption and leisure.&nbsp; As soon as
people are able to take account of the new tax rates, they change their
behavior, embarking on a new plan that maximizes their utility, given
the new prices of goods and leisure, now and in the future, that are
implied by the new tax rates.&nbsp; One can thus evaluate the
alternative futures implied by alternative tax regimes.<br>
<br>
Figures 1 through 10 show the effects over 25 years of shifting as much
tax as possible to land in the U.S., treating the U.S. economy as a
closed and as an open economy with respect to capital.&nbsp; I
interpret &#8216;shifting as much tax as possible to land&#8217; as collecting 90%
of the rental value of land.&nbsp; This permits elimination of the
corporation income tax, all sales taxes, all tariffs, and all property
taxes (rates) that fall on structures.&nbsp; The rate of the income tax
is varied from year to year to insure that the same revenue is
collected under the new tax system as under the old system.&nbsp; For
the U.S. as a closed economy, the income tax rate starts at 8.21% and
falls to 6.190% after 25 years.&nbsp; For the U.S. as an open economy,
it starts at 5.37%, falls to 4.16% after 18 years, and then rises to
4.38% after 25 years.<br>
<br>
The reason that the tax rates needed to match the revenues of the
existing system are so much lower for an open economy is that, with an
open economy, interest rates do not fall when people decide to save
more, and this induces them to save so much more, and to work so much
more so that they can save without cutting back too much on their
consumption, so that the tax base is much larger in the open economy.<br>
<br>
Figure 1 shows the relative prices of current and future goods in the
three scenarios.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1: Relative Prices of Present
and Future Goods, Under Current
Taxes and after Shifting as Much Tax as Possible to Land, in Closed and
Open
Economies</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In both the closed economy and the open economy, the prices of future
goods are generally lower after shifting taxes to land.&nbsp; The
primary cause of this is the removal of taxes from savings, which
increases the interest rate for savers.&nbsp; In the closed economy
this is offset to some extent by the fact that as people save more, the
rate of return to capital declines.&nbsp; (In the open economy, the
interest rate is determined by the global market for capital.)&nbsp;
For the first few years, there is an additional factor that reduces the
net interest rate in the closed econo&shy;my, and causes the price of
future goods to be higher after the tax shift than before.&nbsp; This
is the continu&shy;ing fall in the price of capital (producing
&#8216;negative capital gains&#8217;), as the economy becomes adapted to producing
capital at the higher rate that is induced by the tax shift.<br>
<br>
Figure 2 shows the impact of the tax shift on the relative price of
leisure, immediately and over time.&nbsp; The price of leisure rises in
the short run, because of the reduction in taxes on labor income.&nbsp;
There is also an increase in the rate at which the price of leisure
falls over time, because of the higher returns to saving that result
from the removal of taxes from saving.&nbsp; For the closed economy,
the price falls slowly initially, because of the impact of the falling
price of capital on the return to savings.&nbsp; In the long run, the
price of leisure falls most rapidly in the open economy, because added
saving does not reduce the interest rate in this economy.<br>
<br>

and Future Leisure, Under Current
Taxes and after Shifting as Much Tax as Possible to Land, in Closed and
Open
Economies</span><br>
<br>
Figure 3 shows the impacts of the tax shift on wages.&nbsp; In the
short run, after-tax wages rise by about 20% in the closed econo&shy;my
and about 18% in the open economy.&nbsp; The smaller rise in the open
economy arises from the fact that the greater savings opportunities of
the open economy induce people to want to work more, causing wages to
be lower.&nbsp; After 25 years, wages are about 36% greater in both the
closed economy and the open economy.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Figure 3: Percent Change in Real Wage After Tax from Shifting as Much
Tax as Possible to Land, in Closed and Open Economies<br>
<br>
</span>Figure 4 shows that work effort in the closed economy rises
initially
by about 12%, moving up to an increase of about 17% after nine years,
sliding back to an increase of about 14% after 25 years.&nbsp; For the
open economy, work effort increases initially by about 27%, rises to an
increase of about 27% after 10 years, and then falls back to an
increase of about 22% after 25 years.&nbsp; The reason that the
increase in work effort is so much greater for the open economy than
the closed economy is that the open economy provides an opportunity to
expand saving without causing interest rates to fall.&nbsp; People
respond to this opportunity by working more, so that they can save more
without cutting back significantly on their current consumption.<br>

Worker from Shifting as Much Tax as Possible to Land, in Closed and
Open Economies</span><br>
<br>
<br>
Figure 5 shows the impact on the return to saving.&nbsp; For the closed
economy, there is an initial fall in the return to saving of about
34%.&nbsp; This is caused by the fact that the price of capital falls
steadily, after an initial increase of 22% in response to the strong
increase in the demand for capital.&nbsp; But the return to capital
then increases for ten years, when it is 22% higher than with current
taxes.&nbsp; After that it falls steadily, reaching a rate that is up
only about 6% after 25 years.&nbsp; In the open economy, people will
save abroad rather than accept lower rates of return.&nbsp; But the
open economy is able to absorb more capital without a reduction in
returns, because the opportunity to save abroad generates such a great
increase in the supply of labor.&nbsp; In the open economy, the
increase in the return to saving is determined by the fall in
taxes.&nbsp; The return to saving is up 19% initially, rising to an
increase of 23% after 21 years, and falling only fractionally by 25
years.<br>

Return to Capital from Shifting as Much Tax as Possible to Land, in

<br>
Figure 6 shows increases in saving and investment.&nbsp; In the closed
economy, saving and investment rise initially by about 86%.&nbsp; They
continue to rise for ten years, reaching an increase of 182%, then fall
back gradually to an increase of 139% after 25 years.&nbsp; In the open
economy, saving can differ from investment.&nbsp; Investment rises
initially by 74%, increases for nine years to an increase 189%, then
falls to an increase of 43% after 25 years.&nbsp; This fall in
investment comes from the fact that people in the open economy are
becoming so rich that they are much less interested in working, so less
capital is needed.&nbsp; Saving in the open economy is astounding,
rising by 287% initially and then continuing to grow, reaching an
increase of 739% after 25 years.&nbsp; What is happening is that the
untaxed citizens of this economy have a comparative advantage in
saving, and are moving in the direction of doing all of the world&#8217;s
saving.&nbsp; The idea that this economy has no effect of world
interest rates will eventually become untenable.&nbsp; Some economists
have suggested that such great increases in saving are evidence against
the hypothesis that people choose saving to maximize the kind of
utility function that is used in the model.&nbsp; The suggested
alternative hypothesis is that saving is undertaken to deal with
uncertainty.&nbsp; This leads to significantly lower increases in
savings in response to tax changes.<br>

Figure 7 shows the increase in the stock of capital that results from
shifting as much tax as possible to land.&nbsp; In the closed economy,
the increase in the stock of capital increases steadily for the full 25
years that are shown, reaching an increase of 57% after 25 years.&nbsp;
In the open economy, the capital stock initially rises at the same
rate, but then it levels off, reaching an increase of 48% after 25
years, as people become so rich that they want to work less, and
therefore have less need for capital in the domestic economy.<br>

<br>
Figure 8 shows the change in the consumption of private goods that
results from shifting as much tax as possible to land.&nbsp; In the
closed economy, there is an initial increase in private goods per
worker of about 23%.&nbsp; This slows down fractionally for two years
as the production of capital gears up, then rise to an increase of 35%
after 25 years.&nbsp; In the open economy, the initial increase in
private goods per worker is smaller, only 14%, because people are
devoting so much of their income to foreign investment.&nbsp; But the
increase is steady after that, reaching 30% after 25 years.

Figure 9 shows the increase in the consumption index that results from
shifting as much tax as possible to land.&nbsp; The consumption index
combines changes in goods and changes in leisure, along with an
unchanging quantity of public goods.&nbsp; In the closed economy, there
is an increase in the consumption index that starts at 4% then declines
over four years to about 3% as work effort expands and consumption of
goods falls, to accommodate the growing productivity of capital
investments.&nbsp; After 25 years, the increase in the consumption
index is just under 8%.&nbsp; In the open economy, people work so hard
to take advantage of the opportunity for foreign investment that the
consumption index falls initially by about 2%.&nbsp; It then rises
gradually, reaching the current level after 11 years and an increase of
4% after 25 years.<br>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<br>
The index of consumption is not an index of well-being, because it does
not take account of the additional saving that people do.&nbsp; To
obtain a measure of the annual improvement in the well-being of
citizens that comes from shifting as much tax as possible to land, I
take the increase in saving and add or subtract the amount necessary to
compensate for the change in the consumption index.&nbsp; The result is
a concept known in economics as the &#8220;Hicks equivalent variation.&#8221;&nbsp;
It reveals the amount of money that people would need to be given to
make them as well off as under a contemplated change.&nbsp; This is
shown if Figure 10.&nbsp; In the closed economy, the net gain per
worker from shifting as much tax as possible to land starts out at
about $10,200 per year and rises to about $19,000 per year after 25
years.&nbsp; In the open economy it starts out at about $12,500 per
year and rises to $40,400 per year after 25 years.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="The_Ethical_Case_for_Taxing_Land"></a>VI.
The Ethical Case for Taxing Land<br>
<br>
</span>
The ethical case for taxing land is based on two premises.&nbsp; The
first is that people have rights to themselves.&nbsp; This has not been
controversial since the end of slavery, so I will simply assume that
this is agreed.&nbsp; The second premise is that all people have equal
rights to natural opportunities.&nbsp; This is not so widely agreed.<br>
<br>
Natural opportunities include not only land, but also water, fish in
oceans and rivers, the frequency spectrum, minerals, virgin forests,
and geosynchronous orbits.&nbsp; Some natural opportunities, such as
the opportunity to use the oceans for transport, are most valuable to
people when all are allowed to use them as they wish.&nbsp; (This does
not imply that their value is greatest when all can pollute as they
wish.)&nbsp; Other natural opportunities, such as most plots of land,
are most valuable when one person has exclusive use of them.<br>
<br>
The processes that humans employ to determine who shall have exclusive
use of natural opportunities are complex.&nbsp; To some extent,
opportunities are assigned to those who first make use of them.&nbsp;
However, another important component of the
natural-opportunity-assignment process is the ability and willingness
to use deadly force to exclude others.&nbsp; Americans from Europe
undertook some negotiations with the native American Indians, but
primarily they threatened to kill the Indians if they did not agree to
move into smaller territories.&nbsp; All over the world, nations
emerged when war-minded leaders imposed their rule where they
could.&nbsp; We have built a relatively humane world on this violent
foundation, but the origins of the assignment of natural opportunities
cannot be characterized as just.<br>
<br>
Nor would have been just (or efficient) to adhere to a rule of initial
assignment based on first use.&nbsp; It would not be just because a
person who arrives later than another is not inher&shy;ently less
deserving.&nbsp; (It would not be efficient because a rule of
assignment based on first use promotes inefficient, excessive
investment in being first.&nbsp; Still, to motivate efficient
discov&shy;ery, it pays to provide some reward for discoverers.) <br>
<br>
Justice requires that we acknowledge the equal rights of all persons to
the gifts of nature.&nbsp; At the level of relations among nations,
this requires every nation to determine whether it is using more than
its share of natural opportunities, and if it is using more than its
share, to compensate other nations that therefore have less than their
shares.<br>
<br>
Within a nation, the requirements of justice are not so rigorous, as
long as anyone who wishes can migrate to another nation and take with
him a claim to an equal share of natural opportunities.&nbsp; But the
competitive equilibrium among nations, in a world that recognized an
obligation to share natural opportunities among nations in proportion
to population would be for each nation to grant each citizen an equal
share of natural opportunities.&nbsp; Any nation that declined to do so
could expect to lose citizens to nations that made such offers.&nbsp;
One way of providing for the equal sharing of the value of natural
opportunities within a nation is to collect the rental value of natural
opportunities from each person who is granted exclusive access to them,
and use the proceeds to provide a guaranteed income for everyone.<br>
<br>
An additional ethical reason for recognizing equal rights to natural
opportunities is that it may be necessary to secure world peace.&nbsp;
Nations have arisen through violence.&nbsp; While the world condemns
violence among nations, it has persistently acquiesced to regimes
established by violence.&nbsp; The greater the natural resources of a
nation, the greater is the attraction to potential tyrants of the
possibility of taking over the nation.&nbsp; If the world is able to
establish an understanding, backed up by the threat of economic
boycotts, that nations have an obligation to share the value of natural
opportunities in proportion to population, and that people are free to
leave nations that they find unacceptable, then the return to violent
appropriation of power will be removed.&nbsp; As long as we accept the
continued exercise of disproportionate power over natural opportunities
by those who acquired that power through violence, we will have
difficulty persuading potential usurpers of power that we will not
accept their conquests.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="Answer_to_Arguments_against_Taxing_Land"></a>VII. Answer to
Arguments against Taxing Land</span><br>
<br>
One argument that is sometimes made against high taxes on land is that
as land taxes rise, the selling price of land falls, eliminating the
base of the tax, so that only modest taxes on land are feasible.&nbsp;
As a theoretical matter, this argument is completely false.&nbsp; This
is easier to see if you recognize that a tax on land incorporates a
time dimension that is arbitrary.&nbsp; The tax is prescribed as some
percentage of the value of land per year, but it could just as well be
described as a percentage of the value per month, per day or per
hour.&nbsp; For land that is not rising in value, the percentage of the
rental value of the land that is taken by an accurately assessed tax of
t % per unit of time is t/(t + i), where i is the interest rate per
unit of time.&nbsp; As the unit of time approaches zero, the interest
rate per unit of time approaches zero, so that a tax of t % of value
per shrinking unit of time approaches a tax that collects all the rent
of land, in the limit as the unit of time approaches 0.<br>
<br>
While it is theoretically possible to capture fractions of rent
approaching 100% by taxes on the value of land, there are practical
difficulties in doing so.&nbsp; The selling price of unimproved land
will be the present value of the part of rent that buyers and sellers
expect to be left after taxes.&nbsp; Therefore, if taxes collect
fractions of rent that approach 100%, the selling price of land will be
dominated by the errors that are expected in the assessment
process.&nbsp; Therefore a tax system that seeks to collect almost all
of the rental value of land must use some assessment system other than
observing market prices of land.&nbsp; There are several techniques
that may be useful.<br>
<br>
First, if nearly all of the rental value of land is collected in taxes,
the selling price of land will be nearly zero.&nbsp; Assessors can
purchase parcels of land with obsolescent improvements, demolish the
improvements, and offer the land for sale at auction, under a rule that
the bid will be the tax per year for, say, the first three years, and
after that the tax will be determined by the assessor&#8217;s estimate of the
rental value of the land, as determined by similar auctions and other
processes.<br>
<br>
If assessors were conducting such auctions regularly, they could hold
assessment contests in which the contestants competed by offering land
value functions that would be evaluated by the accuracy with which they
predicted auction results.&nbsp; The contestant who provided the
function with the smallest average error would be given a prize, and
the winning function would be used to assess the value of land that had
not been auctioned.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Another thing that assessors can do is to develop options markets in
land.&nbsp; That is, they can enter into contracts with potential users
of land to supply land with specified characteristics for specified tax
rates.&nbsp; For example, someone who was interested in opening a
restaurant might offer &pound;3,000 per month for a parcel of 2,000
square feet within a quarter of a mile of the center of town.&nbsp;
Such offers would set lower limits on the rental value of land.&nbsp;
With such devices, land can be assessed for tax purposes even if the
selling price of land is close to zero.<br>
<br>
It is sometimes suggested that collecting all of the rental value of
land is not feasible because it would bankrupt the financial system,
which uses land as collateral for loans.&nbsp; The use of land as
collateral for loans is a fact that would need to be weighed carefully
in working out a feasible transition to a system of collecting nearly
all rent publicly, but it does not make public collection of rent
impossible.&nbsp; Public collection of the rental value of land, and
the consequent elimination of other taxes, would represent
redistribution from the old to the young and unborn.&nbsp; It is
equivalent to saying that each person enters the world with a more
complete right to himself or herself (to the extent the income and
value added taxes are reduced) and with a right to an equal share of
the gifts of nature.&nbsp; If we are to acknowledge that every newborn
person does have such rights, we must reduce the wealth of previously
born persons, corresponding to the expectation of collecting the shares
of rent of the newborns.&nbsp; The question that then arises is, Who
should pay?<br>
<br>
This can be interpreted as a question of who should pay the cost of an
accident.&nbsp; We have had a moral accident.&nbsp; We have been living
under the delusion that it is possible for a person to have a
respectable claim to a disproportionate share of the gifts of
nature.&nbsp; This is akin to the delusion under which humanity long
lived, that it was possible for one human being to own another.&nbsp;
In recovering from such a delusion, we need to disappoint some
people.&nbsp; If not the slave owners, then the people who compensate
the slave owners.&nbsp; If not the land owners, then the people who
compensate the land owners.&nbsp; I propose that the cost be divided
among land owners, shareholders in financial institutions that made
loans with land as collateral, and owners of wealth in general.<br>
<br>
As a first approximation, people would continue to hold title to the
land to which they now hold title, and would continue to owe whatever
money they now owe.&nbsp; But compensation could be sought on a
case-by-case basis, by individuals who stood to bear the costs of the
moral accident disproportionately and did not have substantial
assets.&nbsp; Any financial institutional whose continued existence was
threatened by the transition would be bailed out in exchange for a
significant fraction of its equity.&nbsp; The costs of the compensation
would be paid by a capital levy.<br>
<br>
Morality requires that we acknowledge the equal rights of all to the
gifts of nature.&nbsp; Doing so is feasible and promotes efficiency as
well.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Qt = c (t &#8211; 2000) (a1T ta + a2Lta +
a3Kta)(1/a).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1)<br>
</div>
<p>The factor c (t &#8211; 2000) represents the impact of technological
  change.&nbsp; It is 1.0 in the year 2000 and increases by the factor c
  each year after 2000.&nbsp; Based on studies by other scholars, I chose
  a value of 1.01 for c in this model, implying that technological
  innovation increases the output that can be obtained from given inputs
  by 1% per year.&nbsp; The relatively novel element in this production
  function is the distinction between land and capital as two separate
  factors of production.<br>
  <br>
  In this symmetric three-factor production function, the &#8216;elasticity of
  substitution&#8217; between any two factors of production (the ratio of a
  change in factor proportions to the change in relative factor prices
  that caused it) is given by 1/(1 &#8211; a).&nbsp; For two-factor production
  functions that combine land and capital into a single factor, the
  elasticity of substitution in production between this combined factor
  and labor has been estimated by a number of scholars.&nbsp; Based on
  these estimates, I chose 0.8 as the elasticity of substitution in
  production in this model.&nbsp; This implies that a = &#8211;0.25.<br>
  <br>
  Output is measured in units of private consumption goods.&nbsp; A unit
  of public consumption goods can be produced from the same inputs as a
  unit of private goods.&nbsp; Capital goods are treated somewhat
  differently, in being subject to rising costs.&nbsp; For the level of
  output where average cost is minimized, a unit of capital goods has the
  same cost as a unit of consumption goods.&nbsp; For other levels of
  output, the average cost of capital goods is a quadratic function of
  quantity.&nbsp; The level of output of capital goods at which average
  cost is minimized this year is a weighted average of the level at which
  average cost was minimized last year and the level of output of capital
  goods last year.&nbsp; Having little basis for estimating the relative
  weights, I chose equal weights for last year&#8217;s minimum and last year&#8217;s
  output.&nbsp; I assumed that the short-run elasticity of the supply of
  capital at the minimum average cost of capital is 1.25.<br>
  <br>
  The quantity of land that is employed in any year reflects the response
  of land speculation to taxes on land.&nbsp; The percentage of available
  land that is used is given by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2)<br>
  where n is the percentage of land rent that is collected by the
  property tax and f is chosen to yield an estimate of current land
  efficiency under current taxes.&nbsp; In the absence of any studies
  directed to estimating the efficiency with which land is used, I chose
  a figure of 50% for the current efficiency of land.&nbsp; The idea that
  the quantity of land employed in production might vary positively with
  the level of taxes on land is an innovation in economic modeling.<br>
  <br>
  The quantity of labor that is employed in production is the quantity
  that households choose to supply when taking account of the wage after
  taxes, their total resources, and their preferences.&nbsp; (The wage
  before taxes is the marginal product of labor.)&nbsp; The quantity of
  capital that is employed in production is the quantity that households
  have chosen to accumulate, taking account of the return to saving after
  taxes, their total resources and their preferences.&nbsp; (The return
to capital before taxes is the marginal product of capital.)</p>
<p> The statements about labor and capital in the previous paragraph
  incorporate an assump&shy;tion that the economy that is being modeled
  is &#8216;closed&#8217;.&nbsp; That is, capital and labor cannot go elsewhere or
  come from elsewhere.&nbsp; That is a reasonable approximation for
  labor, but it is increasingly implausible for capital.&nbsp; Therefore,
  in exploring the consequences of changes in taxes, I investigate the
  implications of both the assumption that the economy is closed with
  respect to capital and the assumption that it is open with respect to
  capital and small with respect to the world, so that it can import as
  much capital at it wishes without affecting the interest rate.<br>
  <br>
  The model treats an economy as composed of a large number of households
  with identical tastes and incomes.&nbsp; The members of these
  households are assumed to live forever.&nbsp; They are assumed to
  derive utility from consumption of three goods:&nbsp; a private good,
  V, a public good, B, and leisure, Z.&nbsp; The utility that a
  representative individual receives from the consumption of these three
  goods in a single period of time, Ut, is described by a CES utility
  function:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ut = (b1Vt&nbsp; b+ b2Bt b + b3Zt
  b)(1/b),&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3)<br>
  where the subscript t on the goods denotes the quantity consumed in
  time t.<br>
  <br>
  In this utility function, the elasticity of substitution between any
  two goods (the ratio of a change in proportions in which goods are
  consumed to the change in relative prices that caused it) is given by
  1/(1 &#8211; b). Based on estimates by other scholars of the elasticity of
  substitution between goods and leisure, I chose 0.8 as the elasticity
  of substitution between any pair of goods in this model. This implies
  that b = &#8211;0.25.<br>
  <br>
  Measuring consumer leisure requires an assumption about how much work
  is theoreti&shy;cally possible.&nbsp; I assume that 16 hours per day,
  seven days per week is theoretically possible and measure the quantity
  of leisure by the fraction of the theoretical limit that is not spent
  working.<br>
  <br>
  The representative individual&#8217;s utility as a function of all goods
  consumed in all time periods, which is what is actually maximized, is a
  CES function in which the inputs are the quantities described by
  equation (1):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;U =&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(4)<br>
The parameter d is a discount factor.&nbsp; Raising d to the power t &#8211; 2000
  means that the utility from goods consumed in the year 2000 is not discounted
  at all, and 1 is added to the power to which the discount
  factor is raised for each year after 2000.<br>
  <br>
  The intertemporal elasticity of substitution (the ratio of a change in
  Ut /Ut + 1 to the change in the relative prices of Ut&nbsp; and Ut + 1
  that caused it) is given by 1/(1 &#8211; g). Based on estimates by other
  scholars of the elasticity of substitution between goods and leisure, I
  chose 0.375 as the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in this
  model.&nbsp; This implies that g = &#8211;5/3.<br>
  <br>
  If consumption were the same in all years the interest rate, r, would
  be related to the discount factor by the equation d&nbsp; =&nbsp; 1/(1
  + r).&nbsp; Because the quantity of goods that is consumed rises each
  year, the interest rate (determining the rate of exchange between goods
  in different years) is greater than is suggested by the above
  relationship, and it falls each year.<br>
  <br>
  In this model, I use d as a parameter to be estimated by the model,
  after all other neces&shy;sary information has been supplied.&nbsp;
  Typically, d is about 0.99, implying a&nbsp; &#8216;pure rate of time
  preference&#8217; (what the interest rate would be if the level of
  consumption were the same in all periods) of about 1% per year.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
These nine taxes are combined into three &#8216;standardized taxes&#8217;, a tax on
asset income (&nbsp;j), a tax on labor income (l ) and a tax on
consumption (&nbsp; p), using the following equations:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;j = 1 &#8211; (1 &#8211; n)(1 &#8211; f )(1 &#8211; w)(1 &#8211; m)&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;(5)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;l = 1 &#8211; (1 &#8211; (g + r +&nbsp; y)/(1 + r/h)(1 &#8211;
m)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(6)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;p = (1 + s)(1 +&nbsp; x) &#8211; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(7)<br>
These equations reflect the ways in which payments of some taxes are
deducted from the bases of other taxes.&nbsp; The consistency of the
equations is established by the fact that total tax revenue is the same
for the combination of the standardized taxes as for the combination of
the actual taxes.<br>
<br>
For the first year of the model, economic facts are determined by
history.&nbsp; (2000 is taken as the initial year of the model because
that is the most recent year for which it might reason&shy;ably be
supposed that people would make economic decisions based on an
assumption that tax rates in the current year would prevail in future
years.&nbsp; In subsequent years, proposals for tax rate changes have
continually been under public discussion.)&nbsp; These facts permit one
to identify the coefficients of the production function and the utility
function.<br>
<br>
An additional parameter that emerges from the first-year data is l, the
ratio of marginal utility to price for private goods and for
leisure.&nbsp; Utility maximization requires that, for a
utility-maximizing individual&#8217;s planned consumption and leisure in the
current period and in all future periods, this ratio will be
constant.&nbsp; This permits one to grow the model over time.&nbsp;
People make work and saving decisions based on the maximization of
their utility function.&nbsp; Output is a function of inputs.&nbsp; Tax
revenues are functions of tax rates and the magnitudes of tax
bases.&nbsp; The addition to the capital stock is determined by how
much people save.&nbsp; If the discount factor, d, is chosen properly,
the saving rate as a function of time will be asymptotically
horizontal.&nbsp; (With too high a discount factor, the saving rate
will rise over time to 100%, while with too low a discount factor, the
saving rate will become negative, and the capital stock will vanish.)<br>
<br>
If one assumes that at some time after the initial time tax rates will
change, then this produces new prices of consumption and leisure.&nbsp;
As soon as people are able to take account of the new tax rates, they
change their behavior.&nbsp; It would be improper to restore
equilibrium by changing d.&nbsp; This parameter of the utility function
should remain fixed once it is estimated.&nbsp; Instead,
equilibrium is restored by identifying l&cent;, a revised value of l,
the ratio of marginal utility to price for consumption goods and
leisure in all periods.&nbsp; For the correct value of l&cent;, the
savings rate will again be asymptotically horizontal.<br>
