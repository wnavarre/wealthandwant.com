<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>An Open Letter to Wayne Swan, Federal Labor
  Spokesman, on Family and Community Services</strong><br>
by Maurie Fabrikant<br>
<small>Proz Oz Prez<br>
[Prosper Australia President]</small></div>
<br>
Dear Mr. Swan,<br>
<br>
I write to you concerning the article published under your name in
today's issue of "<span style="font-style: italic;">The Age</span>". It
deals with the difference in wealth possessed by Australians and the
reluctance of intelligent, well-to-do Australians to address - even
publicly speak about - this matter. Even when somebody does raise it,
only the problem is described. I've yet to see a solution proposed
other than to resort to charity; that is, give something to those in
dire need. I believe I can do somewhat better than that! Please read
on:- <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The "Great Australian Dream" now - as
in preceding years - has been to own your own home. </span>From their
earliest years of adulthood, most citizens have attempted to purchase
"a roof over their head." It used to be - no more than two human
generations ago - "a three-bedroom weatherboard - or brick veneer, if
you could afford it! - on a quarter-acre block in the suburbs." Most
citizens - then - succeeded in realising that dream; at least they
started repaying a loan that was large compared with their earnings.
Nowadays, it's quite impossible for most. Why? Simply because
land-price has escalated out of the reach of most. Allow me to give you
a specific instance:-<br>
<br>
In 1962, my wife-to-be and I signed a contract to purchase a block of
land in Noble Park, a suburb 27 km south east from Melbourne's CBD. It
was a bit less than a quarter acre, quite large even by the standards
of the time. (Nowadays, it's considered enormous!) It cost us 1,200
pounds; that is, $2,400. At that time, I was employed as a Class 1
Engineer; the lowest level of engineer having a tertiary-level
qualification. My wife was a full-time housewife and mother earning a
little from some hairdressing work at home. My wife and I still occupy
the home that was built on that block in 1965 then extended in 1974 and
again in 1980. There are almost no vacant blocks left in Noble Park now
but I have been informed - by local real-estate agents - that our block
would bring at least $160,000 if unimproved because it is large enough
for four
single-level home-units! A comparison in $ terms conveys very little
information due to inflation and changes in taxation but the following
should overcome that difficulty:- <br>
<br>
The price we paid for the block back in 1962 was exactly equal to my
gross pay during that year; in other words, the block of land cost the
same as the services of a Class 1 Engineer for one year. (The income
tax I paid that year - I still have a copy of the income tax return! -
was almost exactly 150 pounds; that is, 12.5% of my gross pay. It's
interesting to note that the highest rate of income tax that applied
then was 13/4 - thirteen shillings and fourpence - in the pound; that
is, 66.67% of gross pay.) Nowadays, a Class 1 Engineer receives a
starting salary of about $40,000 per year. Given that the same block of
land would now cost $160,000 - that is, four years' gross pay! - it's
not surprising that most couples are finding it increasingly difficult
to own their own residence.&nbsp; Even the cheapest blocks in "suburbs"
like Pakenham - about 60 km south east of Melbourne's CBD - cost around
$60,000. (Please note that the income tax payable nowadays on $40,000
is about $9,460; that is, 23.65% of gross pay yet the maximum rate at
which income tax is now levied is only 48.5%. Additionally, way back in
1962, sales tax was applied to a very narrow range of goods and to no
services. Nowadays, GST applies to a very wide range of both goods and
services. Clearly, citizens are far more taxed now than they were.)<br>
<br>
As you can very clearly see, it now costs couples - or singles - a
great deal more to own a residence. Naturally, if they don't own their
own residence, they must 
<ul>
  <li>pay rent to somebody else ... or  </li>
  <li>live in a caravan park or  </li>
  <li>share a home with relatives or friends or  </li>
  <li>have no place to call "home".&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">None of these alternatives lead to a
high quality lifestyle and undoubtedly are potent factors in separation
and divorce and reliance on drug abuse which, itself, leads to
anti-social - even criminal - behaviour. </span>We also know to our
great regret that these aberrations are becoming increasingly
prevalent. So is there a solution? And if so, what is it? <br>
<br>
In my opinion, there certainly is a solution ... but, seemingly, very
few want to know it. Judging by your article, I think you do. Here it
is:-<br>
<br>
As I've shown, land prices - in Australia's cities - have escalated
enormously because there are more people competing to secure access to
the land there. Here's why:-<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1) As
mechanisation has eliminated most of the need for labour in primary
production, there has been a mass migration of people into Australia's
cities from rural areas.</span> Further, all recent governments have
encouraged considerable migration from overseas and most of these
migrants want to live in cities so that they can be near large groups
of their fellow-countrymen ... and get work. (A friend of mine recently
purchased a liveable, weatherboard house on a quarter-acre block in St
Arnaud - a small town with a population of about 2,500 in the middle
1980s about 300 km north west of Melbourne - for less than $14,000! How
so? Not many people want to remain there because most of the businesses
there are owner-operated so there are very limited employment
opportunities. <span style="font-weight: bold;">More residence sellers
than buyers guarantees that residence prices collapse.</span>)<big><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></big><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2) It
costs very little to hold vacant land in Australia.</span> Even in
those municipalities where rates are based on unimproved value, annual
rates are relatively small compared with unimproved value so,
therefore, don't force the owner to put the land to good use. The
effect of this is to increase the scarcity of land still further
causing potential buyers to bid up prices. Land taxes in most states
are relatively low and become onerous only when land of extremely high
value is owned by an individual.<br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
conventional wisdom is that increasing land price signifies a healthy
economy. Exactly the reverse is true!</span> Increasing land price
demonstrates that much money is being invested in real estate and that
necessarily means that less money is being invested in productive
ventures. Increasing land price causes increasing rents ... because the
land owner must derive sufficient income to pay the interest charged on
the loan needed to buy the land and its improvements. This makes it
increasingly difficult for businesses to trade profitably ...
especially when there is a plethora of complicated taxes that cause
extremely high compliance costs. It's no wonder that more and more
goods are now imported as local manufacturers choose to close their
operations. In many places in Australia, land lies relatively idle. For
example, in Melbourne's CBD, several large blocks have been idle for
years and in the suburbs, shops remain empty for months, even years.
Yet government-released figures on unemployment - the reality may well
be much worse! - admit that unemployment exceeds 6%. The old adage,
"Idle lands cause idle hands" is clearly demonstrated in Australia ...
and elsewhere.<br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The only possible "winners" in this
"game" are those who presently own land; the more they own, the more
they have the potential to "win". Land owners enjoy enormous increase
in the price of land they own simply because they were able to purchase
it when its price was comparatively low. They do not - in their role as
owners - contribute in any way to the prosperity of the nation. Indeed,
because they grow wealthier without producing, they are, in fact,
parasites! That sounds incredible but it is true nonetheless. How so?
Simply because those owners receive part of the wealth earned by all
citizens; at least some of that wealth is used to push up land prices
but only owners enjoy those increased prices. Tenants certainly do not!
All who labour - and this includes land owners who perform labour! -
are thereby effectively robbed of some of their earnings. (Please note
that I do not blame landowners personally; most would - I'm certain -
be horrified to think that they are <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">parasites</span>. The fault lies
in the
parliamentary enactments that permit such a situation to prevail.)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficult as the situation is now, it
will be worse still in another </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">two
human generations' time.</span> How so? Because the same forces that
have been exerted in the past continue unabated. In fact, these forces
appear to be intensifying! Taxation is continuing to escalate as
pressure groups clamour ever louder for financial assistance. The
average rate at which personal income tax is levied is increasing -
even though the maximum rate levied is falling - and sales taxes and
the like are being applied to a widening range of goods and services.
The wealthy continue to derive benefit from the tax-minimisation
experts they employ - because they save more tax than they pay to those
experts - leaving the relatively poorly-paid employees to carry most of
the burden. Unless, of course,
steps are taken to change these tendencies, Australia will become an
increasingly unpleasant country in which to live. That's definitely not
the future I want for my 3 children and
7 grandchildren. And I'm sure you don't, either!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution to this conundrum is,
perhaps amazingly, incredibly simple; namely, require all owners of
land - in fact, all natural resources, including intangibles such as
broadcast bands, to pay to all Australians, via the government, an
annual rental in exchange for exclusive ownership rights to those
natural resources. What could be </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fairer?</span> If a citizen has exclusive
ownership rights to a natural resource, that obviously means that all
others have no rights to it whatsoever. Therefore, that citizen must
pay compensation - in the form of a periodic rent - to all others. Now
that's a perfect manifestation of "user pays." How big is this periodic
rent? That's simply answered, too. It's what the citizens, generally,
think that natural resource is worth! And that's easily - and
accurately - determined by valuers, individuals who have great
experience because they simply note the prices at which similar natural
resources in the vicinity - both in space and in time - are sold then
use those prices to predict that of a similar resource.<br>
<br>
This would constitute real tax reform and - when implemented - would
obviate the need for income taxes and sales taxes. How is this? When a
continuing rent is charged for ownership rights to a natural resource,
that natural resource will have little or no purchase price. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Setting up a
business or residence will be much cheaper first up as only the
improvements must be paid for initially. </span>Money that presently
must be borrowed to pay for access to natural resources will become
available for productive purposes. Because rents will be payable on all
natural resources that are privately owned - whether or not they are in
use - those natural resources will become used or will return to the
nation as public land. Speculation in natural resources will be
immediately terminated thus eliminating a major factor in escalating
price. The converse of the old adage quoted earlier is apposite:- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Far less idle land will translate into far
fewer idle hands! That </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">will
translate into a reduced need </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">for
social security expenditure. </span>Additionally, lower levels of
unemployment will cause reduced anti-social and criminal activity with
consequent savings in law enforcement, punishment and rehabilitation.
And elimination of most of our taxation regulations will cause
compliance costs to all but disappear. The brakes that presently retard
Australia's productivity will not merely be released; they will be
discarded!<br>
<br>
I regret that this has become a far lengthier message than I initially
intended. My apologies. Should you want any matter explained, you have
only to ask. Thank you for reading this.<br>
<br>
