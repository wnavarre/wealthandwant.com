<p><a name="A" id="A"></a><b>A. George&#8217;s
core ideas, free of travesties </b></p>
<p>The Convenor has asked me to present a Henry-Georgist view of our
subject, so I begin by outlining George&#8217;s core ideas as they
bear on it. All writers are misrepresented by some of their critics,
and even by some of their well-meaning friends. George suffered this
fate even more than did other radical reformers, because of the
&#8220;clear and present danger&#8221; his views pose to the economic,
political, philosophical and academic bases of the rich and powerful
and their retainers. Hence I append &#8220;Free of travesties&#8221; to
the heading above, because there are so many travesties circulating.
</p>
<p>Note that in Section A, here, I give George&#8217;s ideas, as he
stated them. I add some modern illustrations and reinforcements, but
my own reservations, amendments and additions are in Sections B and
C. </p>
<p><a name="1, Adequacy of land base."></a><b>1. Adequacy of land
base. </b>There is enough land, if only we use it well. Poverty and
unemployment result from owners&#8217; withholding better lands from
full or any use, creating an artificial and specious scarcity of land
relative to population.</p>
<blockquote>Definition: <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;land&#8221; means
all natural resources</span> (Gaffney,
1998).
  <p>Lemma:. Factor proportions are highly variable (Gaffney, 1976); <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">labor-stinting use of land (same as
land-lavishing use) is a form of
withholding land from full use.</span></p>
  <p>Lemma 2: Growth of jobs and output are not coupled in lockstep
with resource extraction, or with preemption of more Lebensraum. Jobs
and output can and should grow by using given lands better. Processes
and products can and should be modified in more labor-intensive,
land-conserving ways.</p>
  <p>Lemma 3: Tyrants, and tyrannical landowning classes, circulate the
&#8220;overpopulation&#8221; concept to conceal their own roles in famines and
other extremes of deprivation. In this, George anticipated Amartya Sen.

<p><a name="2, Effect of artificial scarcit"></a><b>2. Effect of
artificial scarcity on marginal returns to labor and capital.</b>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Underuse of better lands
forces labor and capital (which is mobile,
like labor) to resort to worse or &#8220;marginal&#8221; lands, thus
scattering and spreading out settlement, raising aggregate demands on
land, and wasting capital </span>(George, 1879). This lowering of the
&#8220;margin of production&#8221; lowers the marginal productivity of
labor and capital, and hence their economic rewards, tilting the
distribution of income in favor of landowners, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">creating an illusion
of overpopulation</span> (Malthus), and lack of investment outlets
(Marx,
Keynes, Hobson et al.). </p>
<p>That pattern was first recognized in farming, but it is universal.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The underuse of central city lands
(large parts of which are
derelict) drives demand outwards to less accessible urban sites. From
there, the same force drives demand outwards to the inner suburbs;
from there, to further suburbs, and so on. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;Urban sprawl&#8221;
is the generic name, but &#8220;scatter&#8221; and
&#8220;disintegration&#8221; express the point better.</span> Farm and
wilderness defenders perceive the problem mainly at the edge of
cities, noting the loss of open land, but that is a lesser social and
economic loss than the destruction of urban values inside the edge.
</p>
<p>One way of denying the basic problem is to call it
&#8220;unbalanced growth,&#8221; as in Orange County, where people
recognize it as too many jobs relative to the housing supply. It is
not the &#8220;unbalance&#8221; that is the problem, though: how can
there be too many jobs? It is too little housing that is the problem,
driving demand eastwards up through Sta. Ana Canyon, with its awful
traffic bottleneck, to central Riverside County, where it meets
demand fleeing north from San Diego. </p>
<p>Now weave this pattern of scattered settlement into the whole
system. It forces <span style="font-weight: bold;">auto-dependency and
truck-dependency</span>, multiplying
the need for fuels, pushing up their prices, and lowering the real
wages of those who have to consume them in larger quantities at
higher prices.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Much of what looks like
self-indulgent consumption of
U.S. motorists is not joy-riding, but the forced consumption of
commutation, forced by scattered urban sprawl, the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">product </span>of land
speculation. </span>Auto-apologists get this backwards, of course,
making
joy-riding the cause and sprawl the effect. </p>
<p>In forestry, the places to grow commercial timber are lands that
are &#8220;flat, wet, and warm,&#8221; as John Baden summarizes it. (He
might have added, &#8220;accessible.&#8221;) Failure to restock such
lands economically pushes demand onto lands that are steep, dry and
cold, creating the &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">forestry sprawl</span>&#8221;
from which we suffer.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Failure to put indigenous waters of
southern California to full
economical use creates the appearance of scarcity where there is
actually enough water.</span> It drives demand northwards to the Owens
Valley and the Feather River, and eastward to the Colorado River, at
enormous social cost, much of it for energy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Those who issue doomsday
dessication scenarios, and deplore the loss of water to farming, also
seem to have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no idea of how
a handful of giant landowners waste most
of our water on low-valued uses like pasture, hay, small grains and
rice, using primitive wasteful methods like flooding, or furrow
irrigation.</span></span> Only 2-3% of our irrigated lands use basic
conservation
techniques like drip emitters. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Those
who waste water in this way are
basically substituting water, a limited natural resource, for the
labor and capital others use to conserve water while growing
higher-valued crops</span> (Gaffney, 1997; Kahrl). </p>
<p>One could go on through a long list of natural resources, but once
one gets the idea, those with understanding and imagination can fill
in hundreds of details. </p>
<blockquote>Lemma: the same phenomenon forces mobile factors to invade
wilderness areas, wetlands, etc., when their demands go unmet on the
lands more suitable for human use. Writing in 1879, George did not
stress this point, but the relationship should be obvious to us today. </blockquote>
<p><a name="3, Detailed causes of artificia"></a><b>3. Detailed
causes of artificial scarcity of land. </b>Major forces holding labor
off better lands are the following (George, 1879):</p>
<blockquote>a. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Speculation</span>,&#8221;
conceived as holding land primarily
for its anticipated rise in value. Hasty readers and simplifiers of
George see only this point, overlooking items b-f, following.
  <p>b. <span style="font-weight: bold;">High demands of the rich for
land as a totem</span>, for pleasure and
prestige. This demand rises with income, in greater proportion than
income.</p>
  <p>c. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advance of labor-stinting,
land-lavishing technology</span>, roughly
associated with economies of scale.</p>
  <p>d. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax bias. Taxes based on
work, production, exchange, coupled
with preferential tax treatment of landholding, land income, land
gains, etc., create a powerful bias in favor of wasting land and
downsizing labor forces</span> (Gaffney, 1999).</p>
  <p>e. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lack of basic infrastructure
and public services</span>, due to
constraints on the tax base</p>
  <p>f. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Overpricing and poor service
from natural monopolies.</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="4, Overcoming artificial scarci"></a><b>4. Overcoming
artificial scarcity of land.</b> To overcome those problems, we must
make land common property. That is a general philosophical statement,
which looks and sounds much more upsettingly revolutionary than it is
in practise, as we will see. </p>
<p><a name="5, Using free markets"></a><b>5. Using free markets</b>.
The market is a form of social cooperation. Markets other than the
land market are a very good way, better than known alternatives, of
organizing complex economic life. Markets reach their highest forms
in cities.</p>
<p>Markets have many faults. The worst is that the demands of
&#8220;sovereign consumers&#8221; accurately reflect the unjust initial
distribution of landownership. <span style="font-weight: bold;">First-time
home-buyers, for example,
are handicapped in competition with trade-up buyers, who constitute
the great majority of buyers. Georgist tax reforms would correct that
fault.</span> </p>
<p>Markets also accurately reflect what philosophers, with some
hubris, call human folly, but that is the price of freedom and
flexibility. Institutions other than markets tend to be obsolete and
rigid. They respond to signals of earlier times, frozen in
ideologies, bureaucracies, clerisies and vested interests. Currently,
and for many years past, they have frozen us into following
&#8220;hard paths&#8221; of economic development, in tandem with
territorially-expansive paths. California farming, for example, has
its restrictive marketing orders applied to old producing areas,
while it subsidizes water supply projects for new ones, thus wasting
both capital and water and land all at once. </p>
<p><b><a name="6, Reconciling common land with"></a>6. Reconciling
common land with private markets.</b> Use the tax system. Levy heavy
taxes based on the market value of land, thus socializing most or all
of the ground rent, while prompting landowners to put land to its
best uses, as defined by market forces. At the same time, untax labor
and its products, untax exchange, freeing up labor and markets to
perform at their best, and encouraging labor-using uses of land. </p>
<p><a name="7, Value of urbanism."></a><b>7. Value of urbanism.
</b>Cities are the cores of specialization and exchange, which in
turn are the mainsprings of productivity and technical progress.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Urban land is therefore highly
productive, so that most land values
are found in cities. So are most of the best jobs, and investment
outlets.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cities are the site of most
&#8220;downstream&#8221; production,
which uses more labor per unit of natural resources than the primary
production outside cities.</span> Modern &#8220;ecological footprint&#8221;
thinking seems to deny or overlook this important fact. Cities earn
their keep by providing the rest of the world with manufactures,
medical care, education, research, and many other urban products and
services that enhance rural output and welfare. (Even the Sierra Club
and Audubon Society have downtown urban headquarters.) </p>
<p><a name="8, Open space."></a><b>8. Open space.</b> Lands with open
access (e.g. parks, and public rights-of-way) are already common
property, and should not be taxed. Land taxes are needed only to
compensate the landless for tenure &#8211; the right to exclude others
&#8211; that society grants to the landed in preference to the
landless. Common carriers, with rates regulated to reasonable levels,
would seem to be a form of open access. In practise, the last point
means that public utilities should be rate-regulated, instead of
being taxed and then allowed to shift the taxes forward to customers.
</p>
<p><a name="9, Natural monopolies."></a><b>9. Natural monopolies.</b>
Natural monopolies (a term going back to George&#8217;s harbinger,
J.S. Mill) should be publicly owned, or regulated. Georgism as a
political movement was closely allied with movements to lower urban
mass transit fares and improve service, using if necessary the
property tax base to cover deficits. </p>
<p><a name="10, Cities and conservation."></a><b>10. Cities and
conservation. </b>Cities, if compact and with good circulation, are
resource-conserving (Gaffney, 1978, 1980). Free land markets, absent
institutional biases and land speculation, would work to make cities
compact. Land speculation is the worm in the apple of land markets,
however, resulting in urban sprawl. Taxing land on the basis of its
market value overcomes such speculation and lets the market make
cities compact (Gaffney, 2001). </p>
<p><a name="11, The servitude of intellectu"></a><b>11. The servitude
of intellectual leaders.</b> Academic economists are mostly kept by
landowners, or their bankers, or other special interests, obediently
to rationalize the system of which they are the high priests.
(Gaffney, 1997). (Today we would include thinktank intellectuals,
media pundits, and hate-radio commentators and talk-show hosts among
the high priests.) </p>
<p><a name="12, George and religion."></a><b>12. George and
religion.</b> Georgist value judgements come from the world&#8217;s
great religions. George&#8217;s overt religiosity contrasts sharply
with the militant atheism of Marx. This did not stop the Vatican
under Pope Leo XIII from putting George&#8217;s works on the Index of
Forbidden Books, where they evidently still remain. Leo
excommunicated George&#8217;s ally, Fr. Edward McGlynn, and let
Archbishop Michael Corrigan of New York order his flock to vote
against George for mayor, 1886. George was not anti-Catholic &#8211;
he married one. It was Pope Leo who was anti-Georgist. (Gaffney,
2000, and works there cited). At the same time, George&#8217;s icons
included Enlightenment Deists like the French Physiocrats, Paine, and
Jefferson, and Radical Republican land reformers like Lincoln, and
Sen. George Julian of Indiana. </p>
<p><a name="13, George and practical democr"></a><b>13. George and
practical democracy.</b> Radical reform is to be achieved
democratically and legally, under existing forms, without violent
revolution. This approach, too, sharply distinguishes George from
Marx. George organized politically, ran for public office, and saw
many allies become mayors and congressmen, at least two governors
(J.P. Altgeld and Al Smith), and several cabinet officers, especially
in the Wilson administration. He and his allies were leaders or
supporters of most of the major electoral reforms of the Progressive
era. </p>
<p><a name="14. Dignity of labor."></a><b>14. Dignity of labor.</b>
Labor is dignified. Today it is common to nod to this idea, at least
for public display. In George&#8217;s time it was more novel: many
socialites equated labor, especially manual labor, with shame, and
union labor with dangerous revolution. They excluded laborers from
their clubs. George&#8217;s allies led in proclaiming the first Labor
Day. George was a union member, and ran for public office with union
support. </p>
<p>George did not give equal dignity to saving, in his theory and
oratory. In his policy prescriptions he did, however &#8211; an
anomaly I discuss next. </p>

<p><a name="1, Capital and labor."></a><b>1. Capital and labor.
</b>George went overboard identifying capital with labor, because
labor produces capital. He saw labor, rather than saving and
investing, as the source of capital.</p>
<p><a name="2, Capital formation."></a><b>2. Capital formation.</b>
George as a theorist was insouciant about the need for market
incentives to create capital. In this respect he slightly and
superficially resembled Marx and Keynes, but only in theory. In
practise, he saw the role of taxation in weakening such incentives,
and so he advocated untaxing capital. His policy proposals do
recognize the need for incentives for capital. It is his rationale
that is rather twisted &#8211; he thought that by untaxing capital he
was untaxing labor. This left a blind spot among some of his modern
like-thinkers, who are not alert to the bias and distortions involved
in untaxing capital while taxing labor (Gaffney, 1995).</p>
<p><a name="3, Income-creating spending"></a><b>3. Income-creating
spending</b>. George needlessly belittled the role of income-creating
investing in creating jobs. Again, his policy proposal, to untax
capital, would foster such job creation, but he went out of his way
to deny the relationship, which he regarded as patronizing to labor
as such.</p>
<p><a name="4, Role of interest rates."></a><b>4. Role of interest
rates.</b> George had little concept of the role of interest rates
and rates of return in allocating or rationing capital. He had almost
no concept at all of the role of interest rates in conserving working
capital from being sequestered and wasted in
&#8220;pyramid-building&#8221; kinds of projects (whether
developmental, premature, or just megalomaniac). He dismissed his
contemporary Austrian economists for what he took as merely
scientistic obscurity, pomp and pretense, while he missed the valid
analysis underlying them (Gaffney, 1976). In a word, they taught that
the function of interest rates is to direct capital away from
&#8220;hard path&#8221; technology, reserving it for the
&#8220;soft-path.&#8221; Those were not their exact terms or concepts.
The way they saw it, higher interest rates discourage what we now
call &#8220;upstream&#8221; production (mining, primary products) in
favor of more downstream production (processing, storing, packaging,
distributing, recycling, etc.), nearer the ultimate consumer.
(&#8220;Near&#8221; may mean in space or in time, or some combination.)
They called them &#8220;higher&#8221; and &#8220;lower&#8221; stages of
production, but a rose by any other name &#8230; . </p>
<p>Thus, high interest rates are friendly to the environment, and
today&#8217;s panacea, lower rates, lead us from soft to hard
technology. (Curiously, George&#8217;s first book, <strong><em>Our Land and Land
Policy</em></strong> (1871), contains a cogent criticism of the waste of capital in
premature railroad building &#8211; this is missing from later works.)<br>
</p>
<p><a name="C, Needed modern adaptations"></a><b>C. Needed modern
adaptations </b></p>
<p>Like any great writer&#8217;s ideas, some of George&#8217;s are
timeless. Others need modifying in view of later insights, perceived
problems, technologies, and social organizations. </p>
<p><a name="1, Green economics."></a><b>1. Green economics.</b>
George&#8217;s paeans to compact settlement, both rural and urban, are
highly compatible with the modern need to discourage invasion of
wilderness areas, wetlands, etc. George would satisfy the demand for
land on the lands best suited for human use, leaving most of the
earth undisturbed by man. (Gaffney, 1976). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If anything, he
understated the high capacity of good lands to meet all human needs</span>
(Gaffney, 1999). As a son of the frontier, he overstated its virtues
in some oratorical passages, anticipating Frederick J. Turner. His
pioneering work on the marginal productivity theory of wage
determination puts too much emphasis on the frontierish &#8220;margin
of cultivation,&#8221; borrowing from Ricardo. In practise, however,
George was a devoted urbanist (like Ricardo himself). </p>
<p>In other respects, to &#8220;green up&#8221; Georgism we need to
free it from its exclusive focus on the virtues of a land tax levied
in the form of a property tax (Gaffney, 1998). George himself stated
his central thesis in another form: &#8220;We must make land common
property.&#8221; To him, the property tax was simply the most
convenient and practical tool to that end, one directly at hand.</p>
<p>Now, we need at least two modifications. </p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">One is to recognize the
occasional virtues of taxes on the
extraction or withdrawal of natural resources from the earth</span>.
(Gaffney,
1967, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1998). This has become the common meaning
of &#8220;green taxes.&#8221; An obvious modern case is the withdrawal of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">water </span>from rivers and wells
(Gaffney, 1992). Another obvious case
is levying <span style="font-weight: bold;">effluent charges </span>on
polluters, where that is feasible (Gaffney, 1965).
This proposal harks back at least to A.C. Pigou (1928), and often bears
his name.
    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Obvious
as may be the virtues of such green taxes, polluters
have successfully rallied behind an alternative, the tradable pollution
permit. </span>This idea entered academia through J.H. Dales and
Ronald Coase,
who challenged the &#8220;polluter pays&#8221; principle. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It entails a massive
validation of pollution, making it a kind of property right, based on
&#8220;ancient and honorable histories&#8221; of pollution. </span>This is not the
place
to skewer it as it deserves, but obviously Georgists should help put it
down. </p>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> A less obvious, but more
challenging case is dealing with
&#8220;non-point&#8221; pollution.</span> Here, simple market-oriented policies are
hard
if not impossible to apply. I have to agree with a Marxist like Burkett
that some problems call for systemic changes that make us think outside
the box of the market and its logic. I have offered up a package of
such changes elsewhere (Gaffney, 1987). </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="2. Taxing &#8220;preemptive&#8221; capital."></a><b>2. Taxing
&#8220;preemptive&#8221; capital.</b> Some capital serves its owner to
preempt common lands. An example is a large, fast, noisy, dangerous,
polluting motorboat on a small lake. Thousands of small lakes would
in effect be made larger, in terms of satisfying human wants, by
taxing or banning such craft. </p>
<p>A more common example is <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
preemption of space on streets and
highways by vehicles</span>. Many modern Georgists have a blind spot
here.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They recognize the wisdom of parking meters, and see them as an
example of applied Georgism. <br>
  </li>
  <li>They have more trouble seeing that
moving vehicles also occupy scarce, valuable public space, and should
pay for it. The Georgist tradition is to see things that move as
productive, and to avoid hindering them. It is a good reflex, a
needed antidote to the more general bias of our tax systems and other
institutions to &#8220;shoot anything that moves.&#8221;  </li>
</ul>
In this case,
though, the moving vehicle actually preempts even more space than the
parked one, and needs to be constrained.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The problems are formidable of
designing optimal taxes on and
controls over moving vehicles</span>; and even moreso when we see them
in
holistic terms, as part of recasting our whole approach to mass
transportation, and integrating it with massive reforms of land
settlement patterns. Those are, however, the modern problems we
should address. In doing so, we can do no better than think of
ourselves as applying George&#8217;s principle that land &#8211; space
on the surface of the earth &#8211; is common property. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offroad vehicles are another
obvious example. </span>Part of our great
secular superstition about property is <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the notion that a piece of
capital equipment is as sacred as, or more sacred than persons
themselves: that the vehicle endows its owner with more rights to
public space than the simple possession of two legs. </span>This may
hark
back to centuries of deference to mounted warriors, but is also
encouraged today by merchants who see motorists as bearing more cash
than pedestrians. Above all, those who foster this attitude are the
makers and sellers of vehicles, fuels, and paving materials. </p>
<p>Surfboards make another example, but once one gets the basic idea,
one can furnish scores of additional examples of preemptive capital.
To tax such capital is, in effect, to tax the grabbing of common
lands by the owners of the capital. Sometimes regulation or banning
is the better choice, depending on particulars, but the principle is
Georgist: recognize land as common property, and take measures to
assert that common ownership. </p>
<p><a name="3. The rural landed gentry."></a><b>3. The rural landed
gentry. </b></p>
<p>Georgists have focused on urban land, stressing its stupendous
value p.s.f., and also its high value per capita. Some have favored
ignoring rural areas completely, to placate the rural vote, and the
putative empathy of urban Americans with their rural roots, and the
supposed rural preservation of old cultural values. If those notions
ever had merit, they do not today. George himself did not think they
had merit in his day, either: his first book, <b><i>Our Land and Land
Policy</i></b> (1871) went into great detail about the villainies
(his word) involved in monopolizing rural land from the public
domain. He demolished economist Francis A. Walker while exposing how
Walker&#8217;s direction of the U.S. Census concealed the concentrated
ownership of rural land &#8211; an early example of &#8220;How to Lie
with Statistics.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the process,
George invented what today is
called the Lorenz Curve, and influenced the U.S. Census to begin
arranging data in a template geared to that curve, and to report on
land separate from buildings (which it did until 1940).</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Today, more than ever, persons of
great wealth have fled the
cities and bought up (or retained) vast and valuable lands in rustic
retreats. </span>To name but a few, there are San Juan County,
Washington;
Aspen, CO; Vilas and Walworth Counties, Wisconsin; Napa and Sonoma
Counties, CA; the Sta. Ynez Valley north of Sta. Barbara; Kenedy
County, TX; Barrington, IL; the Hudson Valley; Berkshire County, MA;
Nantucket Island, MA; Manchester/Dorset and Woodstock, VT; Fauquier
County, VA; Bourbon County, KY; and much of the whole State of NM. In
addition there are individual spreads so vast they constitute regions
in themselves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>San Simeon,  </li>
  <li>the Newhall empire,  </li>
  <li>the Bosworth and
Chandler and Tenneco ranches,  </li>
  <li>the King Ranch,  </li>
  <li>Sta. Catalina Island,  </li>
  <li>the Irvine Company and the O&#8221;Neill holdings in Orange County,
CA,  </li>
  <li>the McIlhenny lands in Louisiana,  </li>
  <li>Gardiner&#8217;s Island, New
York,</li>
  <li>&nbsp;the Georgia-Pacific and Weyerhaeuser timber holdings,  </li>
  <li>the
Scully farms in Illinois,  </li>
  <li>the timber empires of northern Maine, and
so on. </li>
</ul>
Once known mainly for blood sports, owners in these areas wrap
themselves now in the mantle of environmentalism &#8211; a major
challenge for those seeking to reconcile fair taxation with
ecological values.
<p>Where land is valued less for amenities, and more for cash crops,
absentee ownership runs high in much of Iowa and central Illinois,
with rents going to Chicago lawyers and European investors. Likewise
the oven-like Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys of California, whose
absentee owners are more likely to live in coastal California, but
also have addresses all over the world &#8211; some real, and some in
tax havens (Gaffney, 1982). </p>
<p>In such regions, land values per capita run high. Vilas County,
for example, an abandoned old &#8220;cutover&#8221; county centered on
Eagle River, now has the highest land value per capita in Wisconsin,
thanks to its many little lakes, and the high social status of
summering there. </p>
<p>There is no reason, in equity or efficiency, to exempt all this
personal wealth from taxation. The challenge is to implement policies
to sift out the legitimate contributions to the environment from the
country club and boating and beachy and &#8220;trophy&#8221; and
&#8220;privacy&#8221; and &#8220;hunt club&#8221; and &#8220;fin and
feather&#8221; and &#8220;snow-bunny&#8221; qualities that give these
lands most of their market value. </p>
<p>Those rustic retreats are only the leading edge of manorial
suburbanization. Inside them we find low-density, high-valued suburbs
like Atherton, Belvedere, Rolling Hills, CA; Sag Harbor, Scarsdale,
NY; Lake Forest, IL; River Hills, WI; North Vancouver and Point Gray,
B.C.; West Palm Beach, FL; and so on. These are communities that fuel
today&#8217;s booming demand for landscape architects, and turn so
many retired golf professionals into country club designers and real
estate developers. </p>
<p>Here we find many activist Georgists suffering from another blind
spot. A major modern Georgist thrust is to push for a local municipal
shift from the ordinary property tax to a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Two-rate&#8221;
system, with a higher rate on land than on buildings. </span>In doing
so,
they make a campaign issue and a litmus test of how the tax burden on
&#8220;homeowners&#8221; will fall. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Carried to an
oversimplified
extreme, this ignores all differences among &#8220;homeowners,&#8221;
melding the landed gentry on huge lots or vast acreages with the poor
in modest hovels on tiny crowded lots, or parts of lots.</span> It
ignores
the tax rate on rental apartment units, which almost everywhere is,
de facto, higher than on owned units. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We must be prepared for cases
where taxing those vast acreages will make the taxes of homeowners
rise &#8211; and explain why that is a good thing. </span></p>
<p>The &#8220;homeowner&#8221; orientation of many modern Georgist
campaigners plays into the hands of those who favor income taxation
and sales taxation over property taxation.&nbsp; If the goal is indeed
to
favor &#8220;homeowners&#8221; per se, then we should abandon the
property tax altogether in favor of income and sales taxes, in their
present biased forms. The imputed income of owner-occupied lands,
including lands held for sport and recreation, is entirely exempt
from income taxes, whose base exempts non-cash income. The imputed
consumption of these lands is also exempt from sales taxes. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alternatively, if we accept the
income and sales taxes as
&#8220;givens,&#8221; we must allow that they are both outrageously
favorable to owner-occupants</span>, so there is no overall merit in
jiggering the local property tax the same way. On the contrary,
owner-occupied housing is an unpreempted tax base that localities
should seize, to redress the balance. </p>
<p>By focusing on gains to &#8220;homeowners,&#8221; Georgist
campaigners are misstating the revolutionary implications of their
own reform, and confusing their audiences. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">George spoke for the
landless, the tenants, the young, the upwardly mobile, orphans with
nothing to inherit (as opposed to the mythical orphans who own all
the property in the country), the students and trainees, the
exploited workers, the innovators and entrepreneurs and adventurers
who turn their capital and turn the wheels of capitalism &#8211; not
so much for stolid settled burghers and retirees who own land.</span>
Their
buildings, yes, he would exempt. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But if those buildings rest on
land
of high social utility, they are playing the role of land
speculators.</span> Call them Type #3 speculators: the
&#8220;passive-aggressive&#8221; type. (For Types #1 and #2, see <a
 href="#9.%20Territorial%20expansion:">item
9</a>, below.) </p>
<p>It is not that George or his allies are against homeownership.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist tax reform makes it easier
for first-time buyers to enter
the market, and tends to raise the number of owner-occupants.</span>
However
that sometimes entails inducing Type #3 speculators, melded in among
existing homeowners, to let go of excess land they do not need. That
basic point gets lost when campaigners pitch their message solely to
existing homeowners, lumping them all as a class. </p>
<p>Folklore and commercial drama make sympathetic figures of Type #3
speculators. Environmentalists cozy up to landed gentry as soon as
these set aside some land for wildlife, and abate the bloodlust of
their foxhunting. The challenge for educators and economists is to
explain that their role in the land market can be just as anti-social
as those who are more transparently aggressive and greedy. It is a
mighty challenge, I allow; but it is what&#8217;s out there, and we
must face it, or settle for tokenism that absorbs our lives and
resources while papering over the major issues. </p>
<p><a name="4. Substituting capital for lab"></a><b>4. Substituting
capital for labor.</b> Georgists have a blind spot about the problem
of certain biases in taxation, and other institutions: the ones that
induce the uneconomical substitution of capital for labor. The
blindness follows from George&#8217;s virtual identification of
capital with labor. It leads many modern Georgists to focus mainly on
getting capital exempted from local property taxes, ignoring the
strong biases in income taxation that favor capital over labor, with
malign consequences, both allocative and distributive. </p>
<p>An irony (or inconsistency) about this is that George had included
in <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b> one lurid passage that might
have inspired Karel Capek to pen his memorable play about
Rossum&#8217;s Universal Robots. George had raised the specter of the
complete elimination of jobs, as labor-saving technology progressed,
and landowners substituted machinery for labor. His specter was
premature, as market forces tend to foster &#8220;appropriate
technology,&#8221; meaning that as land becomes dear, and labor cheap,
technology bends in the direction of using more labor and less land.
However, modern tax biases have brought the specter back in full
force, because the tax code is now loaded with biases that favor the
use of capital and penalize the use of labor, thus trumping market
forces that would do the opposite (Gaffney, 1984). </p>
<p><a name="5. Adapting to the changing nat"></a><b>5. Adapting to
the changing nature of inter-urban and inter-regional competition.
</b>Georgist policies had a good run at the local level in the days
when cities sought to grow by attracting population. New York City,
Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Houston, San Diego,
San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, and many
smaller cities all had their periods of rapid population growth with
Georgist-leaning leadership (Gaffney, 2001). Federal income tax
policies have stifled that. <span style="font-weight: bold;">By
loading the Federal tax burden on
labor, while sparing capital, Congress creates a universal bias for
cities and counties to see purely proletarian labor as a &#8220;fiscal
deficit generator,&#8221; a parasite to repel, while capital and
housing for the rich generate local fiscal surpluses. </span>The
resulting
local biases toward selective growth policies are well known, but
most advocates of housing for the poor are merely hacking at the
branches of evil, ignoring the roots in Federal tax policies. </p>
<p><a name="6. Energy-wasting biases."></a><b>6. Energy-wasting
biases.</b> Identifying and eliminating tax biases to both extracting
and consuming energy, and other primary products. Whether on balance
these biases raise or lower prices to consumers is not known, but
neither is it relevant here: the point is that the combination raises
the total volume of extracting the primary products, and of course of
consequent combustion and pollution.</p>
<p>The writer has identified many of these biases elsewhere (Gaffney,
1978). Suffice it here to observe the following. It is not just that
a commodity like gasoline is subsidized; it is worse than that.
Within the stream of production, subsidies go to those activities
involved in extraction, while taxes fall on activities downstream
that conserve and economize on the primary product (Gaffney, 1982).
</p>
<p><a name="7. Net domestic capital formati"></a><b>7. Net domestic
capital formation.</b> We need to get away from the disregard many
radical reformers show for the incentives for capital formation,
conservation, and maintenance. George was less insouciant than Marx
or Keynes, and he did see the merit of untaxing capital, but he had
no concern about the aggregate supply: by inference, importing
capital was as good as forming it locally, or domestically. </p>
<p>Incentives are needed, not just to import capital, but to form
capital. Besides simply forming newcapital, we need incentives NOT to
squander existing capital, in the manner of the notorious Prince of
Brunei who indulges himself with his traveling harem, retinue, yachts
and racehorses; or worse, in the manner of Osama bin Laden who
indulges his passions with the jihad that not only consumes his own
capital, but destroys that of his enemies. Marxists and early
Keynesians seem to see the rich as automatically creating more
capital than can be used. They underrate the capacity of the rich for
self-indulgence, and the tendency of social standards of consumption
to rise with wealth. </p>
<p>Marxists and Keynesians also overrate the automaticity of domestic
American capital formation. They, and many others, still see the
U.S.A. as the overflowing fount of loans for the world. Yet, the
U.S.A. is now the world&#8217;s leading debtor nation. Those who see
the forgiveness of international debts as a means of transferring
wealth FROM the U.S.A. should give that fact some prayerful thought.
</p>
<p>Modern conservative champions of incentives for capital formation
err also in failing to note that it is important to use any given
aggregate of capital efficiently &#8211; as important as to create
more capital. When we speak of &#8220;any given aggregate of
capital&#8221; we are constructing a temporary mental model in which
capital is like land, i.e. fixed in supply. Here, the function of
price and the market is to get that fixed supply allocated optimally,
i.e. put to the best use. &#8220;Price,&#8221; in this case, means the
rate of interest. </p>
<p>They err even more egregiously, and tendentiously, in making their
favorite cause the exemption of &#8220;capital gains&#8221; from
taxation. I put &#8220;capital gains&#8221; in quotes because most
capital gains are land value gains (Gaffney, 1990). &#8220;Capital
gains&#8221; is one of those slippery euphemisms that P.R. people came
up with, and the media circulate, to camouflage unearned increments
as functional incentives and rewards for creating capital, and
investing it in income-creating ways. It&#8217;s a way of controlling
us by corrupting the language. A tragedy of modern Georgism is how
easily its Philadelphia convention, during the first Bush
Administration, was stampeded into memorializing Congress to repeal
the capital gains tax. A convention of land speculators could have
done no worse. Most modern Georgists simply did not understand, or
seem to care to understand, how the income tax works. There has been
some progress since then; but still, they need to wake up and smell
the coffee. </p>
<p><a name="8. Corporations."></a><b>8. Corporations. </b>George
wrote little about the corporate form of organization. His modern
allies are aware that <span style="font-weight: bold;">corporations
are our major landholders. That is
a most important truth, one neglected by most other economists and
reformers. However, the Georgists are mostly content to let it go at
that. They do not see the corporate form itself as a menacing kind of
special privilege.</span> In this they are somewhat behind other reform
groups, and have, alas, little to contribute to the current debate on
this matter. They are unaware of the seminal old work by inveterate
Georgist lecturer John Z. White on the meaning of the Dartmouth
College Case decision of 1819. </p>
<p><a name="9. Territorial expansion:"></a><b>9. Territorial
expansion:</b> Regional cross-subsidy, with subeconomic extension of
public works and services. George&#8217;s critique of land speculation
came to be focused on
&#8220;<a name="Speculator Type #1"></a><b>Speculator Type
#1</b>,&#8221; who withholds good lands from timely use. Georgists
have neglected to condemn the counterpart
&#8220;<a name="Speculator Type #2"></a><b>Speculator Type
#2</b>,&#8221; who acquires marginal lands cheaply, and then lobbies
public agencies to extend roads, utilities, military and police
protection, and other public services to them, below cost. </p>
<p>Some Georgists may even see this as a legitimate way, and an
easier way, to combat the artificial scarcity of land that Speculator
Type #1 causes &#8211; a way of perpetuating the &#8220;frontier
safety-valve.&#8221; However, it unbalances development severely: too
much roading, et al., too little use of the land thus &#8220;opened
up.&#8221; Some taxpayer must pay for the roading et al. If the taxes
are activity-based or improvement-based (i.e. anything but land
taxes) they will sterilize marginal land, and lower the intensity of
use of all land. </p>
<p>This is a pervasive, immanent bias in most of our institutions,
from city departments of public works up through state and provincial
public utilities commissions and highway departments, clear to the
Pentagon, World Bank, and CIA. Types #1 and #2, in tandem, create our
form of Imperialism, that perpetual quest for Lebensraum that is our
curse. </p>
<p>In my political experiences, one collects more cuts and bruises
combating Speculators Type #2 than Type #1. I was, for example, able
to lead the local countywide campaign against Howard Jarvis&#8217;
&#8220;Proposition 13&#8221; without being seriously punished, but a
few years later when I led the campaign against southern
California&#8217;s favorite public water-works boondoggle, the
&#8220;Peripheral Canal,&#8221; my academic and professional world
collapsed about me. Earlier, when I joined the furor against American
imperialism (Gaffney, 1971) and the myth of infinite natural
resources (Gaffney, 1972), I became persona non grata at Resources
for the Future, Inc., where I then worked. In British Columbia, 1975,
I learned that the self-styled &#8220;socialist&#8221; government under
Premier David Barrett was unwilling even to consider withdrawing any
of its expensive cross-subsidies to speculators Type #2, and resented
me for raising the issue. The moose-pastures of northern B.C.
&#8220;are a mighty empire,&#8221; they told me, and the rich retirees
on the Gulf Islands are important constituents who should have both
their subsidized ferry service and their exclusionary zoning to keep
hoi polloi from sharing it. I have war stories, but the objective
point is that the socio-political bias for territorial expansion is
even stronger than the bias against cultivating, intensifying and
renewing our internal frontiers. The Georgist dream of taxing central
rents to finance public services becomes a nightmare when the public
money is dissipated in enriching Speculators Type #2. This kind of
spending not only dissipates rents, and wastes capital, at the same
time it despoils the environment. Worst of all, as the subeconomic
land development proceeds, each new settlement makes a platform for
the next, so there is no end to it short of the limits of capital and
of Earth. It is perhaps fortunate for Earth that, historically, the
limits of capital have been reached first, at the ends of bursts of
territorial overexpansion. </p>
<p><a name="10. Renewal as intensification."></a><b>10. Renewal as
intensification.</b> George observed land speculation in California
when it was young and raw. Today, an equally or more baneful aspect
of underusing land is found in older blighted <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">slums</span>, where underuse
takes the form of non-renewal. Thus, land of high capacity is
providing only minimal service and employment. Why do we not get
timely renewal? The most obvious reason is that the sites under old
buildings bear low tax valuations, because assessors mistake the
building for the site and overlook its reuse value, or opportunity
cost. Let the owner renew the site, and taxes shoot up: not only on
the new building, but often on the site as well. Result: nonrenewal.
So capital that should go to renew these sites of high potential
migrates outward instead, to where tax rates are lower and subsidies
are higher, wasting capital in duplicating the infrastructure, and of
course also wasting land. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many Georgists fail to see that a
major part of the problem is
underassessment of the land. Land is underassessed when tax-valuers
lapse into using the &#8220;building-first, land-residual&#8221; method
of separating land from building values. This results in land
valuations so absurdly low that one observes, in many cities and
neighborhoods, most of the joint value of land/building being
allocated to the building in the very year that the owner chooses to
demolish the building, i.e. when the building really no longer has
any value at all. </span>Then the assessor raises the land valuation
under
the new, or replacement building &#8211; making the land tax in effect
an additional tax on the new building. The correct method is the
&#8220;land-first, building-residual&#8221; method: value the land as
though vacant, and give the old building the excess, if any, of the
joint value over the land value. Then the land value remains fixed
when a new building arises, and the land tax serves, as it should, as
a stimulus to rebuilding (Gaffney, 2001). </p>
<p><a name="11. Weight of excess burden of"></a><b>11. Weight of
excess burden of most taxes.</b> Many modern Georgists tend, oddly,
to trivialize the power of tax bias to keep land from its best use.
They have seized upon a conventional micro-economic device, now
generally called the &#8220;Harberger Triangle,&#8221; in recognition
of one Chicago-School expositor. It is based on supply and demand
curves, with no reference to land markets at all. Perhaps these
Georgists are hoping this will help them get through to ordinary
economists; but this device has the effect, by accident or design, of
minimizing estimates of the economic losses, or &#8220;excess
burdens,&#8221; that bad taxes cause. </p>
<p>The power of tax bias to keep land from its best use is starkly
obvious by analyzing the economics of using marginal land. Any tax at
all will sterilize such land completely, unless the taxes are so
universal that the mobile factors, labor and capital, cannot escape
them by moving. </p>
<p>&#8220;Who cares about marginal land?&#8221;, some may say. The
distorting power of taxes has been demonstrated inadvertently by
Chicago-School economists Gale Johnson and Stephen Cheung. They have
shown that <span style="font-weight: bold;">sharecropping</span>, as a
private arrangement, creates a bias on
the part of tenants to substitute land for labor and equipment,
almost without limit. This is because extra land costs the cropper
nothing, unless it adds to output, so the cropper&#8217;s interest is
to substitute land, which is free to him, for his labor and capital,
which he pays for. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes based on gross output affect
all landowners the same way the
cropshare lease affects croppers.</span> They make every landowner a
cropper
of the state, giving every landowner a motive to substitute land for
labor and capital indefinitely. Private landlords overcome this by
limiting how much land to allow each cropper; but the state has no
such offsetting control. Thus, each landowner&#8217;s motive to
acquire excess land runs wild. </p>
<p>In conjunction, consider that taxes (other than property taxes)
are based solely on cash flows, thus entirely exempting all the
imputed income from and imputed consumption of the service flows of
land &#8211; the &#8220;amenities.&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Government
tells the landed
gentry, &#8220;Hold land as a totem, an heirloom, a private hunting
and riding park, a dream of future retirement, a speculation, a hedge
against inflation, an entry into high society, a beach access, a
protection against future neighbors, a shooting range, a golf course,
a ski hideaway, a drinking club, a private landing strip &#8230;
anything private and narcissistic or exclusionary or snobbish &#8230;
and your pleasures are tax exempt. Produce goods and services for
others, though, and we will treat you like a sharecropper &#8211; and
tax your employees, too.&#8221;</span> </p>
<p>Now hark back to George&#8217;s second force holding labor off the
better lands (Item A,3,b): <span style="font-weight: bold;">holding
land as a totem</span>. He noted that
tendency in an age before we even had an income tax, or state sales
taxes. Our present tax system magnifies the tendency beyond all
reason, resulting in the relegation of much of our best land to the
indulgences of the landed gentry, old and new. </p>
<p><a name="12. Small is beautiful."></a><b>12. Small is
beautiful.</b> George was impressed by economies of scale. His
attitude was &#8220;Let them happen, but let them pay taxes for it on
the vast lands they require.&#8221; George perhaps underestimated the
power of his own reform. Today we have abundant evidence that land
taxation opens up lands to small producers by fostering subdivision.
The settlement of the east side of the San Joaquin Valley of
California, 1900-30, is a graphic, irrefutable case study (Rhodes).
American Graffiti and errant Congressman Gary Condit may have done
little for the reputation of Modesto, CA, but without Georgism there
would be nothing there but a few <span style="font-style: italic;">vaqueros
</span>working minimum wage for
absentee cattle barons. In more subtle and complex ways, the urban
development of the &#8220;Jane Jacobs economy&#8221; of lower Manhattan
(before the Rockefellers and their PONYA ruined it) makes another
example. </p>
<p><a name="13. City and country."></a><b>13. City and country.</b>
Few studies ever hit such a sensitive nerve as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Walter
Goldschmidt&#8217;s (1947) demonstration of the greater sociological
health and wholesomeness of Dinuba, CA, compared with nearby Arvin,
CA.</span> Dinuba is surrounded by small farms in the Alta Irrigation
District, which taxes land values. The District also taxes land
values inside the city itself. Arvin is surrounded by giant
industrial-type farms, &#8220;factories in the fields,&#8221; without
such taxes. </p>
<p>Goldschmidt&#8217;s prose was tedious, melding acadamese and
bureaucratese &#8211; anything but rabble-rousing. The values he
celebrated were square and middle-class &#8211; nothing of Greenwich
Village. Yet the substance resonated radically.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The big owners sensed
a vital threat. They roared and threatened and reared up with their
political power, and &#8220;terminated with extreme prejudice&#8221;
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the agency that sponsored the
study.</span> That tells us something about its deep significance and
its
threat to the landed establishment. Goldschmidt identified a viable,
market-oriented, indigenous American alternative to gigantic,
absentee-owned industrial agriculture exploiting cheap migrant labor.
</p>
<p>No Georgist to my knowledge has yet drawn the Georgist morals from
this great study. Goldschmidt himself was only dimly aware of the
role of land taxation in his story. The facts are there, the
documents are there &#8230; only the scholars, so far, are missing.
</p>
<p><a name="14, Owner-occupancy and operati"></a><b>14.
Owner-occupancy and operation.</b> There is considerable evidence
that the result of heavy land-value taxation is to discourage
absentee owners, and induce sales to residents, and operators. Rural
Denmark is one case in point. Urban New Westminster, B.C., is another
&#8211; it long boasted the highest rate of resident-ownership in
Canada, at a time when it was the only city in B.C. exempting
buildings 100% (and before a boom in apartments, which I suspect
changed the data). On the east side of the San Joaquin Valley, small
farms and small businesses are related to resident-ownership and
owner-operation, both urban and rural. Another Goldschmidt-type study
or two are needed to establish the relationship definitely, for
skeptical scholars. </p>
<p><a name="Summary"></a><b>Summary </b></p>
<p>George&#8217;s core ideas include a formula for achieving full
employment and relieving the poverty of the landless without any need
to extend the bounds of settlement nearly as far as has already
occurred. It is a matter of substituting labor for land, in many
respects and dimensions, as sketched above. It is not a matter of
going against the market, primarily, for well-oiled markets contain
their own price incentives to foster approprate technology. It is a
matter, rather, of removing tax biases that presently warp the market
the wrong ways. </p>
<p>There are some crudities, errors and omissions in George&#8217;s
writings, but none of them is central or powerful enough to annul the
relevant core of truth.&nbsp; </p>
