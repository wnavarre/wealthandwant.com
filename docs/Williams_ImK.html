We're going to continue to move in a spiral, rather than on a
narrow-focused reductionist path. That is, to keep you with a vision of
this big picture, we'll carry on moving around and around this great
body of Geonomics, observing a number of its many aspects. With the
wider perspective in view, we'll then start to grapple with the
details. This Intermediate Kit revisits some of the topics covered in
the <a href="Williams_IdK.html">Introductory Kit</a>, but it also introduces some new subjects.<br>
<br>
In a sense, there'll always be new aspects to discover with Geonomics.
Economics is unfortunately a dirty word these days in many circles,
which is a tragedy because it's really an awesome and endless source of
insights. Some of the many fields related to economics which we'll
visit are:<br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="0" cellpadding="2"

<br>
But - incredibly - who bothers to study economics today besides
professionals? Yet is there anything more important to understand than
economics - the great attempt to find out what makes our world go
around - except the great Journey to understand our very selves?<br>
<br>
All the facets you gaze upon are not of equal size or luminosity, and
there's one area that clearly outshines all the rest. If this is the
only facet upon which you gaze and understand, then the energy you've
spent on Geonomics will have been amply rewarded. This facet is, in
many ways, the keystone of the arch of economics. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We refer to the
mystery - some would say the madness - of unemployment.</span><br>
<br>
The existence of unemployment should strike one as being quite absurd. 
<ul>
  <li>On the one hand there are millions of people - many
highly-skilled - wanting to work, some desperately so.  </li>
  <li>And on the other hand there is work aplenty to do - to care for
the elderly, to clean up the environment, to build better housing, to
improve our teacher-student ratio, to expand our infrastructure etc.
etc.  </li>
</ul>
And yet, these two things can't presently come together to satisfy each
other.<br>
<br>
So we're spiraling around, looking at all sorts of interesting aspects,
but not haphazardly. For we're deliberately preparing ourselves to
reach the top of the spiral, to find the great economic key which will
impact on just about every other aspect. For if you solve unemployment
then you unlock one of the mighty doors to prosperity, and if you
abolish the great curse of poverty then you'll find that there are
powerful and positive impacts on all the other problems concerning the
environment, social problems, war, education and more.<br>
<br>
Sounds mad, doesn't it? That we should claim to have an answer to
something on which politicians can never deliver, over which think
tanks continue to scratch their heads, that highly-educated academics
cannot answer. Now just visualise all these important people striding
back and forth, heads down and deep in thought over the Riddle of
Unemployment. The wonderful irony is that they're looking at the
solution! In fact, they're standing on it - it's the Earth itself! The
Earth Belongs to Everyone! And, factoring into our economic theories
the distinguishing features between land and capital, the laws of
economics are turned the right way up and now stand out by themselves!<br>
<br>
So, with that tantalising clue as to where we're ultimately headed in
the <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Williams_Advanced_Kit_1.html">Advanced Kit</a>, let's do
a bit of spiraling.<br>

Pursuit of Wilderness</span> (1971)<br>
</div>
<br>
Henry George laid down the principles of sane environmental policies
half a century before the world's attention began to focus on the
natural environment. To paraphrase his deep and far-reaching
environmental philosophy: "The use of Earth's scarce natural resources
should be strictly and equitably rationed by a system of resource
rentals."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMICS VS. GEONOMICS</span><br>
<br>
Due to the current dominance of neoclassical economics, the environment
has been so recklessly plundered largely because of the blurred
distinction between private property and that of our natural
environment, the Global Commons. Put simply, private property is that
which is created by labour, whereas the Global Commons is that which is
provided by nature. They require totally different economic treatments.
We assert that the gifts of Nature should not be treated as mere
commodities, to be bought, sold, speculated upon and abused for
profiteering!<br>
<br>
Geonomics removes taxes from wages and other private property and
increases taxes and user fees on common property. Reducing taxes on
labour increases purchasing capacity, and reducing taxes on capital
encourages efficiency. Shifting taxes on to land and natural resources
curbs speculation and private profiteering in our common property, and
clearly is a practical way of conserving and fairly sharing the Global
Commons.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">GREEN TAXES AREN'T GREEN ENOUGH!</span><br>
<br>
We applaud wholeheartedly green tax reforms which have started to
increase taxes and fees on:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Emissions into the air, water and soil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Oils and minerals<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Lands used for timber and grazing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Oceans and freshwater resources<br>
<br>
However, to be consistent and environmentally responsible, we argue
that green tax reforms should also increase taxes and fees in 3 other
areas:
<ol>
  <li>Satellite orbital zones and aircraft flight paths</li>
  <li>The electromagnetic spectrum &#8230;.. these are scarce resources that
have been enormously undervalued up until now. Almost everywhere they
have been sold off to the highest cash bidder (usually to plutocrats
with political influence) instead of governments having implemented a
scheme of regularly-reviewed resource rentals. This looting of the
Global Commons by the Kerry Packers of this world forces governments to
burden us with taxes on: &middot; honestly-earned wages and salaries
&middot; productive and sustainable capital and investments &middot;
sales, especially of basic necessities But the third outstanding green
tax reform is the great current blind spot of environmental lobbyists,
being a tax on none other than:</li>
  <li>Land sites according to land value</li>
</ol>
In the <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Williams_Intro_Kit.html">Introductory Kit</a>, we
touched on a number of the environmental impacts of land value taxation
(LVT). The following is a brief outline only - these kits can only hope
to outline the enormous implications of Geonomics.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT - AND UNSEEN - GREEN TAX</span><br>
<br>
LVT, as we've seen, strongly encourages land to be put to its optimum
use as an occupant must pay the full LVT whether the land is being
fully utilised or not. Land speculation, whereby a speculator or
"developer" can simply sit on a large parcel of land and wait for
population and infrastructure to build up its value, would become
unprofitable. Parks and well-used public spaces would certainly remain,
but not underused tracts of land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
other words, LVT is a recipe for the reining in of urban sprawl.</span><br>
<br>
The resultant compact, less wasteful urban landscape will have a
multitude of environmental mega-benefits. Extensive public transport
will become feasible in a smaller area, as will cycling and walking.
And we have already seen how public investment in fields such as public
transport will become affordable when increased land values are
"recycled" or recovered through LVT. Furthermore, a compact Geonomic
cityscape won't require the enormous consumption of resources as when
roads, pipelines and other infrastructure have to bypass kilometres of
unused and underused land to reach the outer limits of the suburban
sprawl. Remember, too, the environmental costs of long and wasteful
commuting journeys from distant suburbs.<br>
<br>
Cities won't sprawl over valuable farmland, and marginal farmland won't
sprawl over what should be national parks or wilderness. With
agricultural land, there's a technical adjustment of LVT whereby the
basis of assessment is on the maximum sustainable yield, strongly
encouraging organic farming practices. In some circumstances, there's
also a good case for the requirement of what's called an Ecology
Security Deposit and/or restoration insurance from farmers.<br>
<br>
Geonomics is firmly in agreement with those environmental groups which
call for the elimination of subsidies in areas which are
environmentally or socially harmful, unnecessary, or inequitable in
such areas as:
<ul>
  <li>resource extraction</li>
  <li>non-sustainable energy production</li>
  <li>commerce and industry</li>
  <li>forestry and non-sustainable agriculture</li>
</ul>
Subsidies are, essentially, negative taxes - and in these instances
(above) they are having the opposite effect to green taxes!<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MONITOR THE PLANET, NOT THE PEOPLE!</span><br>
<br>
Remember too that LVT eliminates the government surveillance over
people, their activities and their assets. What LVT and other
conventional eco-taxes does do is to monitor Our One Earth as any
responsible form of stewardship should, ensuring our scarce natural
resources are not polluted, wasted, undersold or privately
misappropriated.<br>
<br>
The bottom line of our present economic system is that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not everything which counts (our Earth) can
be counted (in $ terms), and not everything that can be counted
("progress") counts.</span> Presently, it's the market which determines
the "worth" of, say, our water resources, our genetic integrity or the
last remaining habitat of an endangered species. The only moderating
factor to this is the blunt instrument of occasional government
intervention, when public outcry forces it to save what's left of our
(and future generations') Global Commons.<br>
<br>
But there is a means of determining the worth of all of these
intangible benefits - patches of the Global Commons which confer
aesthetic, recreational, life-enhancing, spiritual, climate-preserving,
biodiversity-saving benefits.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">VALUING THE INVALUABLE</span><br>
<br>
To summarise an intricate but elegant principle and process, the LVT
assessment process used to determine the rent payable on residential,
industrial and agricultural land can - and must - be adapted to
relatively-untouched areas of the Global Commons facing commercial
exploitation. The assessors attempt to factor in all these less
tangible benefits of a natural resource into their valuation of its
worth to the community and to posterity. As always, these assessments
are open for public scrutiny and comment. In the end, only if a
prospective developer is prepared to pay the full cost of utilising
this resource will such extraction or development go ahead, taking into
account the proposed environmental restoration. So a beautiful patch of
rainforest might well be lost, but only if its commercial value is
extremely high (e.g. because it's sitting on top of a huge lode of
platinum).<br>
<br>
But will local residents will lose out? Not really, because the loss of
this local amenity will, of course, be taken into account in the next
LVT assessment. And the huge resource rentals payable for this
commercial extraction will go into their rightful place - the community
coffers.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHERE A GUESS IS BETTER THAN NONE AT
ALL!</span><br>
<br>
But how does anybody - professional assessor or not - possibly put a
value on something so hard-to-value as water quality or biodiversity or
recreational use? The answer is that the valuation can't be an
accounting-style series of clear calculations, but a series of value
judgments that are, in the end, quantified. It's a guess, but the best
possible guess. And the best possible guess is better than a wild
guess. And a wild guess is better than no guess at all. And no guess at
all is pretty much what we have at the moment, as the outcome of our
present neoclassical system is that such natural benefits are often
rated as next-to-worthless, and almost given away!<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Chief Seattle of the Pacific Northwest
indigenous tribe, the Dwamish, tried to resist peacefully the loss of
their land to white settlers. In 1855 he is said to have written a
letter (although various versions of this letter exist) to President
Franklin Pierce saying,<span style="font-style: italic;"> "How can you
buy or sell the sky - the warmth of the land? The idea is strange to
us&#8230;. Every part of this earth is sacred to us."</span><br>

well to produce 'Housing of Working Class' bills. They will never be

Lloyd George, (1863 - 1945), British Prime Minister (1917 - 1922)<br>
</div>
<br>
Want another classic example of the madness of our current neoclassical
economic system? Melbourne's Dockland Project is such, in the sense
that it took so long to happen. Look at what we had - a vast expanse of
idle land and derelict buildings sitting right next to the central
business district for decades. The Docklands area was a waste of
enormously-valuable real estate because of our failure to collect the
LVT, which would have otherwise financially obliged the owners to put
the land to its full potential or to have passed on the land titles to
those who would do so.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW TO ENCOURAGE SLUMS</span><br>
<br>
But examples abound of needless urban decay - poorly maintained
housing, fields in urban areas with nothing on them except thistles,
outdated infrastructure, old and unused warehouses with rusted roofs
and broken windows etc. Once again, we lack LVT to get things (and
unemployed people) moving. And at present, even if you do put land to
use, you're going to be hit with taxes if you make an income or profit,
even though you're employing people and are of benefit to society by
offering your goods and services. <br>
<br>
What we should be doing is 
<ul>
  <li>taxing bads, not goods. Bads here is the array of wasted
resources that leads to decay, and goods are the honest endeavours of
people working in a free and a fair market.  </li>
  <li>Or put it this way: tax waste, not work.  </li>
  <li>Or pay for what you take, not what you make.</li>
</ul>
Some may object that we do have some sort of state land tax as well as
the property taxes of local governments!" However, "property" is a
woolly word which, in our current understanding, can mean land and/or
capital - two very different things. Where property taxes are actually
LVT (often termed site value rating at local government level) they are
equitable and beneficial, but the problem is they are minuscule and
misapplied in a number of ways. But where property taxes are (more
commonly) a tax on land and improvements (such as buildings), the
effect is entirely different. When the owner does, for example, build a
house or renovate a derelict building, up will go his/her property
taxes!<br>
<br>
What society needs is a tax system which encourages land to be put to
its optimum use, and for productive labour to be free of punitive
taxation. Instead we have a system in which it is profitable for
landowners to sit and wait for their land value to appreciate, while
honest enterprise is treated as a cash cow by our tax system.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MONEY MOTIVATES!</span><br>
<br>
Our conditioning has somehow led us to accept this economic and social
madness. <span style="font-style: italic;">We might travel to work and
glance at an empty block of land worth millions of dollars, yet not
think twice about it. Once we arrive at work, however, our mind-set is
- curiously - very different. Hey! - the new printing press or forklift
truck has arrived, worth a hundred thousand dollars! How long do you
think management will let this valuable piece of machinery lie idle on
the factory floor?</span><br>
<br>
The same profit motive that compels someone to tear off the shrink-wrap
at once and get their new equipment working can also be applied to the
occupancy of land. To drive the point home so that your
all-taxes-are-the-same programming is forever deleted, take an everyday
example of a valuable block of land a person might occupy. The land's
value has been built up by the community as a result of the surrounding
amenities, so the occupier is rightly subject to a certain amount of
LVT. Knowing the assessed LVT, the land will put people to work rather
than weeds. Or, if the land is really valuable, it might have a modern,
efficient multi-story building on it rather than an old single-story
building or a car park.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
burden of taxation should be so shifted as to put the weight upon the
unearned rise in the value of land itself, rather than upon the
improvements."</span> - Theodore Roosevelt, (1858 - 1919), US president

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Invest

1935), American humorist-philosopher<br>
</div>
<br>
This is the place to further examine the three economic factors of
production. An understanding of these economic concepts will not only
give a grounding in economic theory but will enable you to realise how
completely the so-called science of economics has been hijacked and
corrupted by neoclassical economics.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. LAND</span>
We are putting aside, for the moment, the philosophical thoughts about
owning land to instead look at how land behaves in purely economic
terms. For economic purposes, land has a wider meaning than that which
is usually assigned to it by lay persons. It can be defined as the
available natural resources and forces of nature. Hence land here
includes flora &amp; fauna, rivers &amp; oceans, air, the
electromagnetic spectra and mineral wealth. But "ordinary" land -
loosely regarded as the surface of the earth - has distinctive
features, particularly urban land with its locational value (as opposed
to rural land with a largely agricultural value).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. LABOUR</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. CAPITAL</span> This can be a
confusing term. Capital is defined as the product of the application of
labour to land, or else can be simply understood to be stored-up wealth
or, in a sense, stored-up labour. Capital equipment refers to the
physical articles of material wealth which have been produced, not to
be immediately consumed, but to be used to physically aid in the
production of more material wealth. This excludes pseudo-wealth: those
things described as agreements or contractual securities and
obligations.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE NEOCLASSICAL DISAPPEARING TRICK</span><br>
<br>
These 3 factors of production are commonly cited in chapter 1 of
mainstream economic texts, although their definition of land is often
vague. And then - hey, presto! - in chapter 2, land has somehow
disappeared off the radar screen, and we have slipped into labour and
capital as being the only factors of production. The merging of land
into capital is the characteristic sleight of hand of neoclassical
economics. We'll return to this folly later in our critique of
capitalism and socialism.<br>
<br>
There are three major differences between land and capital. Again,
we're not talking about ethics, but about concrete, measurable economic
features. If you ever want a litmus test to determine whether an
economist really knows what he's talking about, just ask him, "What are
the differences in the economic behaviour of land and capital?" If he
seems to be bamboozling you with esoteric jargon, then you can take it
that the guy's a fake, for the differences are clear and quite
distinct, as you will here see.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">AS SIMPLE AS 1 - 2 - 3!</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Land is limited in supply. Capital
is not.</span> Reread Will Rogers' quote above - they ain't making land
any more. Very important in economic terms, and there are few examples
of other things that are limited in supply. Great works of art by dead
painters is one illustration and, just as art collectors may bid up the
price for a Monet or a van Gogh to ridiculous extremes, so too may land
prices skyrocket. Why did central Tokyo land in the late 1980's hit
US$4 billion per acre? Because those requiring it couldn't make their
own. Such behaviour can never occur with capital, because capital can
be created.<br>
<br>
This unbreakable bargaining power of land-holders within our current
economic system is one reason why Geonomists frequently attach the word
"monopolist" to land-holders. To be pedantic but also strictly correct,
we have said that land is "limited" rather than "fixed" in supply
because of the effect of the possibility of land reclamation and
multi-story buildings (not that those possibilities gave much relief in
central Tokyo or elsewhere).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. There will always be an
irreplaceable human demand for land &#8230;.. while the Law of Gravity
exists, anyway.</span> You're going to need at least enough land on
which to stand, and a bit more if you can't sleep on your feet. Capital
is different because if the seller of capital asks too high a price
from me, then I'll settle for a different supplier, or a substitute or
- failing these options - simply do without. But I can't do without
land (until the dawn of The Age of the Jetsons). I think I can handle
living without an original Monet or van Gogh in my lounge room.<br>
<br>
Combine the limited supply of land with a never-ending human demand,
and the monopolistic screws are turned tighter. Furthermore, take into
account that the limited supply of land is being demanded by an
ever-increasing number of planetary inhabitants, and you'll grasp why
ordinary folk are being squeezed into devoting more and more working
years to saving for their increasingly-expensive block of land. In
fact, you now know more about the factors of production - the very
basics of economics - than many of our esteemed professors of
neoclassical economics!<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. The value of land is built up by
the community whereas the value of capital is created by its makers.</span>
Land generally appreciates over time whereas capital nearly always
depreciates over its useful economic life.<br>
<br>
The type of land we are examining here is the all-important (because so
expensive and necessary) urban land, and the value that is appreciating
is its locational (not agricultural) value. We say that the value of
land is not generally due to any effort of the owner for two main
reasons - population and infrastructure. The growing population will
make the limited supply of land relatively more scarce and will bid up
its price. Also, a growing population accessible to your site is
generally desirable - more skills and services available,
companionship, economies of scale etc. Infrastructure, by its very
nature, provides all sorts of land-value-enhancing amenities, such as
roads, schools, power, water, hospitals, libraries etc. To return to
our point, in no way is the value of capital enhanced by others. That
of land is.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE MONOPOLISTIC HAND AROUND THE THROAT</span><br>
<br>
Let's examine further why we insist these distinctions between land and
capital are so important. Now the price of monopolised things is
unrelated to their costs of production - that of land dramatically so,
for land is not produced and its cost of production is zero. Rather,
the price extorted depends on what the buyer can afford to pay over and
above the wherewithal to survive- hence, the origin of the term
"rack-renting". Non-corrupt governments everywhere intervene to prevent
monopolistic practices, but why not do so with land, which is an
essential need for all?<br>
<br>
We've heard the philosophical justification for sharing the Earth
equitably through LVT, but now you know the basic economic reasons. LVT
takes the annually-assessed rental value of land, created by the
community, and returns it to the community, thereby preventing
extortionate monopolistic price-gouging. And remember: collecting the
LVT enables us to slash and ultimately eliminate all taxes on labour
and capital.<br>

</div>
<br>
We've just seen how returns from land are, by nature, monopolistic and,
by rights, should be returned to the community. But how do we calculate
this amount?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHO GETS THE COCONUTS?</span><br>
<br>
It's perhaps best illustrated by the Robinson Crusoe scenario, where he
finds himself alone on a desert island. Rob naturally settles on the
best available land which, for argument's sake, can produce 20 coconuts
per acre per month. Along comes Man Friday, who gets the second-best
land producing 18 coconuts per acre. This best, freely-available land
of Friday is called the marginal land and, as we'll see, determines
both the level of wages and that of rent.<br>
<br>
For how much could Rob rent out his land - 2 coconuts or 20 coconuts
per acre? Friday would only be prepared to pay 2, because he can
already get 18 from his. So here's our first definition, that of the
Law of Rent: The application of labour and capital equipment being
equal, the rent of land is determined by the difference between the
value of its produce and that of the least productive land in use. So
if Man Saturday comes along (the next day?!) and finds that the best
available land can only produce 15 coconuts per acre, Rob could rent
his land out to Saturday for 5 coconuts per acre, and Friday for 2.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What then determines the level of
wages?</span> When Friday came along and could work land yielding 18
coconuts per acre in a month, then he wouldn't accept wages offered by
Rob for less than 18 coconuts. But when Saturday arrived, suddenly
Friday could only command 15 per month, because Rob knows that the
going rate (that applicable to Saturday at the margin) is only 15. So
here we have the Law of Wages, which is the corollary of the law of
rent: Wages are the reward that labour can obtain on marginal land,
i.e. the most productive land available to it without paying rent.<br>
<br>
Of course it all gets more complicated by technology, trade unions,
immigration, the existence of a pool of unemployed, personal
preferences, levels of education etc., but these strong underlying laws
always hold. But let's now tie up the factors of production. Rent is
the return to land, wages are the return to labour, and interest is the
return to capital. The law of interest can be stated thus: Interest is
the return that the use of capital equipment can obtain on marginal
land, i.e. the most productive land available to it without paying rent.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PROGRESS AND POVERTY, SIDE BY SIDE</span><br>
<br>
So here's the alarming paradox of progress marching side by side with
poverty. Those who have grabbed the best land get richer and richer
(from increasing rent) while the tenants and wage-earners get poorer
and poorer for having to accept lower and lower wages as the margin is
pushed out to less productive land). Henry George, in his classic <a
 href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a> drove home this
point, but took about 600 pages to deal with all the complications and
fine details not examined here. It's no wonder that the unmasking of
this great paradox - the title of his book - hit the 19th century world
like a great revelation. And it's no wonder that vested interests,
through the neoclassical economics that they fostered, knew they had to
shut him up. And, by successfully silencing him, it's no wonder that,
despite all efforts, increasing and ever more alarming disparities of
wealth are the norm world-wide.<br>
<br>
But, anyway, how many coconut-basketsful of LVT should we collect?
Chuck away all those calculators, guys, for the answer is simple: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Collect the rent, the whole rent, and
nothing but the rent.</span> Assuming that everyone has to do the same
amount of work to produce their differing yields of coconuts, when
Friday came along then we'd collect 2 coconuts per acre from Rob. This
would leave 18 coconuts in each of their hands, and 2 coconuts of rent
or LVT collected. When Saturday arrived we'd collect 5 from Rob and 3
from Friday, which would leave 15 coconuts in everyone's hands and 8
coconuts of rent collected. Result: everybody effectively shares
equally in the bounty of Our One Earth, and we have a natural,
non-punitive form of revenue raising with which to fund infrastructure.<br>
<br>
We've already seen how speculators can presently hold on to idle
parcels of land, waiting for unearned increases in their value to
accrue to them. But here's another curse of land speculation: by
locking up productive land, it forces newcomers out to less productive
land. By "pushing back the margin", the evil of speculation
simultaneously raises rents and lowers wages. LVT makes it impossible
for speculators to enjoy unearned income.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT JUST COCONUTS</span><br>
<br>
Let's broaden our understanding of rent by looking at some current
real-world examples. 
<ul>
  <li>To tackle traffic congestion, governments often limit the number
of taxis by issuing licences.  </li>
  <li>Because transmission bandwidths are limited (and sometimes
because of political influence), a limited number of TV operating
licences is issued.  </li>
  <li>To prevent overfishing, fishing licences are issued. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">History shows us that, because of
relative scarcity or changing circumstances, such licences often become
enormously valuable and are resold in the open market for huge sums.
This excess is what is meant by economic rent, and plutocrats, big-time
speculators and businesspeople dealing with such licences or privileges
are called rent-seekers.</span><br>
<br>
We can now see that the term "economic rent" encompasses a wide range
of resources, and can be defined as the excess over a competitive rate
of return attributable to owning an asset or resource whose supply is
limited, at least in the short run. Note the underlined words, for they
indicate sort of some monopoly privilege, as we have seen.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TOTALLY SELLING OUT</span><br>
<br>
The problems above have exact parallels with the land problem. The
monopolistic privileges have often been sold off once and for all to
the highest cash bidder (or perhaps given away or even stolen) instead
of being auctioned and then regularly (annually?) assessed to determine
the economic rent that belongs to the community.<br>
<br>
A limited resource is usually a gift of Nature. The windfall profits
arising from the granting of timber and mining rights are other
instances of uncollected economic rent. Otherwise, economic rent mainly
arises as the result of monopolies, duopolies, oligopolies and cartels.
The solution is either to regularly assess and collect the economic
rent, or to prevent natural monopolies (such as "public" utilities)
from falling into private hands in the first place.<br>

<br>
Human nature is a most curious thing. Australians are taxed in various
ways for around half their average total earnings, yet few ever
seriously study the nature of these taxes and their different effects.
Perhaps they can be forgiven because of the way we tend to use one
word, tax, for a wide range of clearly different things. (If I was a
conspiracy theorist, I'd accuse neoclassical economics of deliberately
confounding the language.) A tax may be:
<ul>
  <li>a simple revenue-raising device  </li>
  <li>a user fee  </li>
  <li>a fine or deterrent (perhaps with an element of political or
social ideology)  </li>
  <li>a means of redistributing wealth (a transfer payment)  </li>
  <li>a resource rental  </li>
  <li>or often a mix of the above. </li>
</ul>
And, just as the nature of taxes varies greatly, so too do their
effects. We've already seen some of the impacts of taxes, but here
we're going to expand our knowledge to drive home a point and counter
the effect of a lifetime of steady conditioning.<br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">There's a simple rule of
thumb which will guide us here - taxes on land (in its wider sense of
natural resources) are desirable and do not inhibit wages or
production, and taxes on labour and capital punish both. Remember this
catchy little slogan? - pay for what you take, not what you make.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHERE'S ROBIN HOOD WHEN YOU NEED HIM?</span><br>
<br>
The history of taxation reveals that taxation has increasingly been
diverted from land to capital to today's mixture of capital and labour.
Fascinating studies have shown that the prosperity of the average
English labourer with a family of five actually peaked around 1495.
This was the age of "Merrie England" when taxes were almost entirely on
land, and land prices were low. But then the infamous enclosures of the
commons accelerated, with land taxes increasingly being replaced by
taxes on capital and labour. In 1495, the wages of the average English
labourer were around 2.9 times the cost of living, but this relatively
affluent state was rapidly turned around as taxes were shifted off
land. By the mid 1600's wages were almost down to the breadline as
common land had been almost entirely enclosed by the Crown and the
"nobility".<br>
<br>
Other examples of the destructive power of taxation abound. In the
Middle Ages, merchants and the emerging middle class were slugged.
Duties were levied on traded goods everywhere, stifling trade and
enterprise and giving rise to the inefficiencies of smuggling and
organised crime. Wealth taxes in France were based on the number of
windows in a person's house, resulting in houses being boarded up. The
same taxes were imposed in the Arab world on the number of palm trees
that a person owned - you can guess the result.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A MEDIEVAL MENTALITY</span><br>
<br>
Before we modern, educated citizens start chuckling too loudly at our
forebears, we should look at our own tax system. What does the GST do
to sales (and, by implication, production and employment)? How is a
person's motivation to work affected by income taxes? What effect do
payroll taxes have on the number of people on the payroll?<br>
<br>
But the right taxes can have constructive results. The reason why some
Geonomists advocate taxes on social undesirables such as tobacco and
alcohol is because they are not really arbitrary taxes, but an attempt
make people who choose to abuse their health pay for their future
health costs.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TAXES AIN'T JUST TAXES!</span><br>
<br>
Green taxes have long been supported by Geonomists. Full resource
rentals imposed on such things as timber extraction or commercial
fishing prevent undervaluation, wastage and overexploitation. "Polluter
pays" pricing policies preserve the planet from plunderers (sorry). In
fact, the whole range of carbon taxes are forms of LVT in the sense of
being charges for use and abuse of air, water and other natural
resources.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">electromagnetic spectrum</span>
also falls within the wide definition of land. To sell it off for good
to the highest cash bidder is to set up an exploitative and
economically inefficient monopoly. The spectrum belongs to the people
who increase its value as much as they increase that of land.
Government should act as its custodian, auctioning off for rent the
various segments of the bandwidth. To prevent changing economic
circumstances or technological developments from dropping big chunks of
economic rent into the laps of bandwidth lessees, rents should be
regularly and appropriately reviewed and raised. That Kerry Packer's
broadcasting licences have appreciated by well over a billion dollars
shows the foolishness of failing to distinguish, for tax purposes,
between land and capital. And perhaps shows the political influence of
a powerful rent-seeker.<br>

<br>
We all-too-meekly accept being legally robbed of the fruits of labour
and capital, because we have been stooged into believing that there is
no other way to pay for responsible government expenditure. Having
established that beachhead, our governments then steadily make further
inroads into earned income as well as into other human rights. After
having been dispossessed of our share of the Global Commons, it would
seem pretty inconsequential to complain about taxation eroding privacy,
but it's worth looking into.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WADING THROUGH THE MIRE</span><br>
<br>
But just how trifling is the fact that a mass of laws, too many and
complex for anyone to fully get a handle on, forces us to account for
much of our "personal" activities? Our private lives are open to
scrutiny following all sorts of disclosure. "But we have to pay our
taxes," Peabody bleats as he obediently discloses every detail the tax
system demands of his earnings, assets and investments. "We don't need
to understand all this tax legislation," the dutiful drone on, "as we
can simply employ accountants and sometimes tax lawyers to do it for
us." "It's part of our duty as responsible citizens," Elroy explains as
he files away his complete audit trails of financial transactions &amp;
statements required for tax purposes.<br>
<br>
And we have to obey the law, don't we? The Tax Commissioner has powers
of investigation in some circumstances greater than the police - in
fact he is the law, with masses of legislation to support him and his
sleuths. But as he's unlikely to kick in our bedroom door in the middle
of the night, his other low-key invasions of privacy don't get much of
a mention in the media.<br>
<br>
And now GST dumps on us the onus and cost of collecting it. And the
massive compliance costs of Business Activity Statements alone now
display all-too-clearly the time and resources spent by taxpayers that
would otherwise go into production.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BIG BENEFACTOR, NOT BIG BROTHER</span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">While humans are being
closely monitored, natural resources are not - the inverse of Geonomics.</span>
Only recently have we been getting some laws prohibiting or restricting
certain types of pollution, but land and other natural resources are
still being treated as mere commodities liable to being owned outright
and treated as truly private private property. But natural resources
don't behave as ordinary commodities, because many of them are scarce
and some are necessary for human existence. At least we can be thankful
that sunlight is abundant and renewable, for if it could be limited
then someone would try to bottle it up and make a fortune on it.<br>
<br>
Geonomics does not intrude into people's lives. Unlike the current
assessors of misguided property tax, LVT assessors would never need to
inspect and assess buildings and improvements, and rarely if ever would
they need to set foot on the land itself, hence assuring complete
privacy for most people. But Geonomics would monitor the direct usage
of natural resources in order to determine the full and fair LVT and
resource rentals. Usage of this sort obviously should not be kept
private.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT PLANETARY CURSE</span><br>
<br>
'Twas ever thus, within an economic system that, deliberately or not,
supports the mother of all monopolies - land monopoly. Landlords get
rich in their sleep because of what happens around, not on their land.
The vice-like grip of land privileges crosses all national and cultural
boundaries, and this writer has spent years tramping around places like
Iran, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Yemen and Uganda, and had this
bitter fact confirmed everywhere.<br>
<br>
Here is the type of thing I saw again and again. Landless peasants are
living on the breadline, working for their relatively wealthy
landlords. Some philanthropic organisation funds the building of a
well, so that the women don't have to spend so many hours each day
tramping to fetch it. Guess what happens to their rents when the well
is completed? With amazing certainty, rents rise in proportion to the
benefits of access to that well. It's the same deal with the provision
of roads, schools, clinics, irrigation schemes, bridges etc. Net
result: the living standards of the landless change little, but that of
the landlords are considerably enriched. Someone wasn't kidding when he
said, "Third World aid is the giving by the poor people of rich
countries to the rich people of poor countries."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE FEEL-GOOD FACTOR</span><br>
<br>
Of course, this is not to deny outright the goodwill and even the
occasional good result of aid programs. Indisputably, emergency aid
that puts food into starving hands will always be a blessing. Also,
where there is a high percentage of land ownership, benefits obviously
accrue to more people. But to which people? Some will undoubtedly
benefit more than others, and some won't benefit at all. Furthermore,
when you factor in the political corruption of many Third World
governments, the benefits are more unevenly distributed.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ROOT, NOT THE FLOWER</span><br>
<br>
Again, land monopoly and all its privileges would be destroyed by LVT.
Whereas landlords had been able to sit back and leave much of their
land to be idle or inefficiently used, LVT would force them either to
put it to its optimum use or to effectively stand aside to allow others
to do so. The boot would then be on the other foot, as vast amounts of
land will be thrown onto the market and labourers would be offered a
fair wage.<br>
<br>
Nor would any landowner - small or large - benefit, in net terms, more
than another when a domestic or foreign government finances local
development . Land rendered more productive or desirable would pay
proportionally more LVT. And, of course, that LVT would not end up in
any private pocket but would be the natural source of that society's
revenue, benefiting one and all. We'll take this up a theoretical notch
in the very next module "Land Reform - Real and Illusory".<br>

<br>
In the last module we've just seen how LVT would place the benefits of
aid and development fairly and squarely in the hands of the people, not
just the landowners. "But, hang on!" comes the objection, "There are
other types of land reform besides LVT." This, as the module title
suggests, is our subject - how other types of land reform have never
delivered and never will.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">VIVA LA REVOLUCI&Oacute;N!</span><br>
<br>
Certainly there have been endless attempts at land reform. "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Viva la revoluci&oacute;n!</span>" has
been the cry all through Latin America, for instance, but the lot of
the average peasant has changed little, even with the best will in the
world behind land reform.<br>
<br>
Here's the problem. So-called land reform has always been seen as land
redistribution, based on the same form of outright land ownership. But
there are three cogent reasons why land redistribution, as remarked
above, does not work and never will.
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Firstly, to redistribute land
means to divide it up. But land is so vastly different as to make this
task utterly impractical,</span> what with wilderness, marginal
agricultural land, good agricultural land, outer suburban land and
prime real estate in the heart of the cities. Where's Solomon to wisely
divide it all up, with the added problem of buildings and improvements
that some people have built and others haven't? Would A have to get 100
square kilometres of desert to match B's parcel of two square metres
opposite the GPO?</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondly, even if the different
values were measured at a given moment, they would immediately begin to
change, and would continue to do so.</span> Even if everyone might
start with a parcel of land equal in value to everyone else's, those
values would at once begin to shift. In the first year a dam is built
here, a school is closed down there, and roads are built everywhere.
Appreciation and depreciation would continue year after year, and in no
time everyone's "equal" parcels would have ceased to be such. A great
way to operate a casino, but what sort of way to run a society?</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Thirdly, even if you could wave a
magic wand and somehow take into account the different and
ever-changing values of land, what about new entrants like the newborn
of the next and future generations? And what do immigrants get?</li>
</ul>
Besides the Big Three reasons above, there are two minor ones worth
mentioning.<br>
<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">After the land "reform," would
selling, speculating and profiteering go on as before, or would all
have to stick to their allocated plots for the rest of their lives?</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It would require a really
squeaky-clean government for the "casino" of changing land values not
to turn into a den of political influence and corruption.</span> Most
likely, development would be skewed towards the land of the politically
empowered. Or maybe the kleptocracy would get the tip-off to buy land
where development is going to take place.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">REAL REFORM, NOT REVOLUTION</span><br>
<br>
None of the problems above would exist with LVT, the implementation of
which would be far less revolutionary than that of historical land
reforms. We need land reform here in Australia, of course - but in the
Third World where poverty is so great, matters are urgent. What good
has foreign aid done over all these years, when you look at the
disparities of wealth in recipient countries? Why do governments even
today (as in Zimbabwe) still go down the path of land reform whereby
land is doled out to a handful of government supporters?<br>
<br>
We all know the proverb: Give a man a fish and he'll be fed for a day,
but teach a man to fish and he'll feed himself for a lifetime. One
would assume that Western governments, the World Bank and the IMF also
knew it, but they continue to hand out fish instead.<br>

mere abolition of rent would not remove injustice, since it would
confer a capricious advantage upon the occupiers of the best sites and

it should be paid to the estate or to some body which performs public
services; or, if the total rental were more than is required for such
purposes, it might be paid into a common fund and divided equally among
the population."</span> - Bertrand Russell (1872 - 1970), Welsh

AND SOCIALISM</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;"Under
capitalism man exploits man, under socialism the reverse is true."</span>
- Polish proverb<br>
</div>
<br>
There are defenders of capitalism who attack Geonomics (Georgist
economics) for being socialist. Similarly, socialists and communists
criticise Geonomics for being capitalist - in fact, Marx called Henry
George "capitalism's last ditch". Who is right?<br>
<br>
"Capitalism" is a woolly word, meaning different things to different
people. Geonomists wouldn't criticise capitalism per se, but rather
decry "land monopoly capitalism".<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEN TOO MUCH IS BARELY ENOUGH</span><br>
<br>
Whatever is wrong with the acquisition of capital? Who would not want
to afford a roof over one's head, adequate food and clothing, some
means of transportation, a decent education, and to go travelling and
see the world? I've put this question innumerable times to
self-declared opponents of capitalism - many of them very well read -
and have never received any sort of adequate rebuttal. The response is
usually along the lines of: "Well, some capital like that is OK, but
nobody should have too much capital". In the final analysis, "too much"
capital means any amount more than the speaker's!<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The flaw here, as we see it,
is that socialists do not make the vital distinction between earned and
unearned wealth when they attack the owners of capital.</span><ul>
  <li>Was this accumulated capital honestly earned in a free and a fair
market?  </li>
  <li>Was there no monopolistic privilege?  </li>
  <li>Was there the creation of real wealth or was there merely the
gaining of speculative profits?</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NO WEALTH-ENVY FROM US!</span><br>
<br>
As we see it, if someone is a rich "capitalist" who has accumulated a
fortune, say, by being a great inventor, author, sportsperson or a
plain hard worker who lives frugally, then "God bless him!" If they
then want to live in a big house and drive a big car, then "Good luck
to 'em!" They've provided services that actually benefit society in a
truly free and fair market, and they'd pay their way in the form of
LVT. We need more such capitalists!<br>
<br>
The other capitalists are a different kettle of fish. Reaping where you
don't sow is not in the Geonomic bible, and the full retention of the
economic rent for the benefit of society would leave absolutely nothing
for the cigar-chomping, would-be robber barons. But let's not forget
the subtle forms of speculation and unearned wealth as practiced even
by well-meaning citizens by speculating in one form or another.
Unfortunately, the "quick bucks" culture is not promoted only in
investment circles. Even the nightly news promotes, and even glorifies,
speculative profits without ever questioning where the wealth comes
from.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SORRY, BUT IT'S A DUD</span><br>
<br>
Socialism may well be inspired by noble ideals, but in terms of
economic policy it has been an unmitigated failure. Not that it is
necessarily undemocratic, but a command economy requires a large
bureaucracy with its attendant inefficiencies and corrupting
centralisation of power. Rent-seeking speculators have little chance to
do their stuff, true, but neither do ordinary people. There is no
economic incentive to work harder or better and, in any case, the
markets that might quickly adopt new products and processes don't exist.<br>
<br>
Another blunder of socialism (and especially communism) is the failure
to examine the source of property - the dictate that all property
should be socialised fails to differentiate between what is earned and
what is unearned. Again, Geonomics says that any confiscation of
privately created wealth, whether by taxation or by private monopoly,
is plain theft.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NO ROYALISTS, ARE WE!</span><br>
<br>
In general, Geonomists support a free and fair market with governments
mainly stepping in to prevent unacceptable environmental damage (which
eco-taxes would largely prevent) and unfair trading practices
(particularly the formation of monopolies and cartels). In this sense
we could be called libertarians of a sort, but often apply the
distinguishing (and pejorative!) label of royalist to conventional
libertarians who effectively condone the privileges of land monopoly
capitalism.<br>
<br>
It should be pretty clear by now that Geonomics doesn't fit on the
conventional left-right spectrum. It's the Third Way - and the only
sustainable one at that.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"George's
blend of radicalism and conservatism can puzzle one, until it is seen
as a reconciliation of the two. The system is internally consistent,

"Solving the land question means the solving of all social questions&#8230;
Possession of land by people who do not use it is immoral - just like
the possession of slaves."</span> - Leo Tolstoy, (1828 - 1910)<br>
</div>
<br>
It was the power of the passion of George which led many of his
supporters to believe he was somehow inspired and, in fact, George
himself related an amazing inner experience he had when finishing his
classic <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE RELIGION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE</span><br>
<br>
But you don't have to be at all religious to catch on to Geonomics, and
we should stress that there's certainly no dogma in it, religious or
economic. But, while we all inevitably delve into economic theory at
one stage or another, what really puts fire into our bellies and keeps
us going in the face of so many obstacles is the whole issue of social
justice. It was this concern that fueled George's passionate mission
more than anything else, and it rubs off on many of those who
understand the fundamental economic principles he elucidated.<br>
<br>
If you've read this far, you don't need to be told of the increasing
disparities of wealth on this planet, both in developing and so-called
developed nations. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It's not
the reality of social injustice that motivates most Georgists, but
rather the conviction that it's all so unnecessary! </span>Here's a
very brief recap on why:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speculators can sit on large
parcels of land and wait for the community to build up its value.</span>
Land Value Taxation (LVT) would prevent speculation, induce the land to
be put to its best possible use, and instead divert the increased land
value to the community coffers. Valuable natural resources, which often
fall into private hands, would again become part of the common wealth.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Current taxation is largely
legalised robbery.</span> But the rich, who often made their fortunes
by misappropriating what should be the community's economic rent, have
the means to set up tax shelters. LVT, in sharp contrast, is impossible
to evade.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">At the moment, whoever is lucky
(or powerful) enough to own land earns greater and greater rent while
the base earnings are forced down as population growth pushes the point
of marginal land out further and further.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our tax system rewards sloth and
speculation while punishing industry, thrift, savings and honesty.</span>
Many public works, infrastructure and beautification projects are
presently unaffordable because their value ends up in landowners'
pockets rather than being recycled back to the community through LVT.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land monopoly is the "mother of
all monopolies". </span>Those without land still need it, and have to
work on the terms of those who have laid their hands on it first.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Involuntary unemployment is
totally unnecessary.</span> There are so many productive things that
need to be done by those who presently are prevented from doing them.
Additionally, many wage earners have their bargaining power and earning
potential reduced by the threat of unemployment.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the late 19th and early 20th
century, a number of the most influential American plutocrats applied
their considerable resources to stifle the work (and especially the
ideas) of Henry George, and bankrolled the installation of neoclassical
economics.</span> In academic and professional circles today there's
nothing much conspiratorial - only ignorance and an unwillingness to
admit that their "dismal science" has consistently failed to deliver
any viable alternative. George's economic analysis has never been
seriously or scientifically challenged, let alone undermined - and
still holds as true today as it did one hundred years ago.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The principles of our social
justice proposals are radical and yet elegant: You don't get taxed on
what you earn. What you rightly owe to society is based on what society
does for you </span>- in other words, on the physical and social
infrastructure available to you. Nothing more, nothing less.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the Third World, where land
ownership is often concentrated in the hands of a few families, things
are worse.</span> Vast tracts of land remain unused because, without
the pressure of LVT forcing site holders to turn their sites to
productive use in order to cover the cost of the LVT, the landowning
families can afford to wait until the desperately poor work on the
terms dictated to them.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">We'll have our birthrights
restored! Geonomics effectively makes us co-owners of all the Global
Commons.</span> And land will be effectively free of a purchase price,
as land price currently is the "capitalisation" of annual land values
into private pockets. The great burden facing all entrants to this
planet - having to save huge amounts to pay for what should be our
inheritance - will no longer exist!</li>
</ul>
As the reader may have concluded, it is not possible to stick purely to
social justice issues, keeping the economics out of it. The two issues
are inextricably linked, so that understanding the solution to social
injustice necessarily entails some more-than-basic knowledge of
economics.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE REAL THING'S A TURN-ON!</span><br>
<br>
But economics, to many people, seems so dry, money-minded and
mathematical as to be a real turn-off. Yet these same people will often
rail against injustice. Maybe it's because the problem is obvious but
the solution is hard to figure out. It is the same with a number of
environmental activists - they won't hesitate to stand in front of a
bulldozer, but much less often will they attempt to understand the
underlying economics that has led to the pillaging of the Global
Commons in the first place.<br>
<br>
It's rather analogous to the tale of the guy who, blind drunk at night,
is looking for his keys under a lamp post. A passer-by asks, "Are you
sure you lost them here?" The drunk slurs a reply, "No - I lost them in
the alley over the road, but there's no light there." The drunk is the
environmental activist (or an ordinary citizen angered by injustice),
his keys are the solution, the area under the street light is the
easy-but-ineffectual answer (like hugging a tree or raising taxes on
the rich), but the keys really lie in the difficult area of economics.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Our
primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one man
to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have
made his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes
on. It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a
curse."</span> - Henry George, (1839 -1897)<br>

<br>
For those would rather get their teeth into a book at this stage, we
recommend:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Elementary Economics by George Charles, a veteran
Melbourne Geonomist. He wrote this 90-page overview for his classes at
the University of the Third Age.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Social Problems by Henry George. A wonderfully
readable book, more philosophical than economic.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The Corruption of Economics by Prof. Mason Gaffney
of California and Fred Harrison of England. It's a powerful
expos&eacute; of how neoclassical economics was installed to get
Georgist economics out of the public eye. It's my personal tip - once
you read it, you will never be the same. 260 pages</small><br>
