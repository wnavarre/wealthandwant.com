<p align="center">  <strong>Seeing the Cat</strong>
</p>
<p>From Louis F. Post's book, <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Prophet of San
Francisco</span> (pp.
12-14). It seems that the expression "seeing the cat" originated in a
speech by Judge James G. Maguire in support of land value taxation in
the late 1880s. In his speech, Judge Maguire said:</p>
<blockquote>I was one day walking along Kearney Street in San
Francisco when I noticed a crowd in front of the show window of a
store. They were looking at something inside. I took a glance myself,
but saw only a poor picture of an uninteresting landscape. As I was
turning away my eye caught these words underneath the picture: "Do you
see the cat?" I looked again and more closely, but I saw no cat. Then I
spoke to the crowd. "Gentlemen," I said, "I do not see a cat in that
picture; is there a cat there?" Some one in the crowd replied: "Naw,
there ain't no cat there. Here's a crank who says he sees a cat in it,
but none of the rest of us can." Then the crank spoke up. "I tell you,"
he said, "there is a cat there. The picture is all cat. What you
fellows take for a landscape is nothing more than a cat's outlines. And
you needn't call a man a crank either because he can see more with his
eyes than you can with yours."
  <p>Well, I looked again very closely at the picture, and then I said
to the man they were calling a crank, "Really, sir, I cannot make out a
cat in that picture. I can see nothing but a poor drawing of a
commonplace landscape." "Why, Judge," the crank exclaimed, "just you
look at that bird in the air. That's the cat's ear." I looked but was
obliged to say: "I am sorry to be so stupid but I really cannot make a
cat's ear of that bird. It's a poor bird, but not a cat's ear." "Well,
then," the crank persisted, "look at that twig twirled around in a
circle; that's the cat's eye." But I couldn't make out an eye. "Oh,
well," returned the crank a bit impatiently, "look at those sprouts at
the foot of the tree, and the grass; they make the cat's claws." After
a rather deliberate examination, I reported that they did look a little
like claws, but I couldn't connect them with a cat. Once more the crank
came back at me as cranks will. "Don't you see that limb off there? and
that other limb just under it? and that white space between?" he asked.
"Well, that white space is the cat's tail." I looked again and was just
on the point of replying that there was no cat's tail there that I
could see, when suddenly the whole cat stood out before me.</p>
  <p>There it was, sure enough, just as the crank had said; and the
only reason the rest of us couldn't see it was that we hadn't got the
right angle of view. but now that I saw the cat, I could see nothing
else in the picture. The poor landscape had disappeared and a fine
looking cat had taken its place. And do you know, I was never
afterwards able, upon looking at that picture, to see anything in it
*but* the cat.</p>
  <p>In my view, "the cat" is the possibility of a world without
privilege.</p>
