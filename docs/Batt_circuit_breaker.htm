<p align="center"><strong>Can a Circuit Breaker Ever <em>Really</em> Work?</strong><br />
  Submission to Chairman, Commission on Property Tax Relief<br />
H. William Batt, Ph.D., April 23, 2008</p>
<p>  Wednesday, April 23, was the final testimony hearing for the Suozzi Commission
  in Albany,<strong><em>1</em></strong> and I  stayed throughout the session not just to testify myself
  in favor of the <a href="Batt_NYS_PropTax_Commission_WP.htm">deferral option</a> but also to  listen to what others had to say
  about possible property tax relief.<strong> I was astonished to see how  much
  support there was for the property tax &quot;circuit breaker&quot; option.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">1 New York State Governor's Commission on Property Tax Relief <a href="http://www.cptr.state.ny.us">www.cptr.state.ny.us</a>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The &quot;circuit breaker&quot;, for those who don't know, is a provision
  whereby a household's property tax  liability would be automatically limited
  (i.e., capped) by formula if it exceeded a stipulated  proportion of its income<strong><em>2</em></strong> &#8212;  hence
  application of this electrical metaphor. Assemblywoman Sandy  Galef
  and Senator Betty Little have collaborated to sponsor a bill that would offer
  relief in  accordance with both variables in any given year.<strong><em>3</em></strong> It
  has been endorsed by the Fiscal Policy  Institute (FPI) which has provided
  considerable analysis of its distributive impacts.<strong><em>4</em></strong> At
  least so far  as that is possible!</p>
<blockquote>

    gross income.<br />

<p>  It is that which I doubt. <strong>The whole scheme so ignores several critical
    variables and confuses concepts<em>5</em> that it can never hope to achieve
    its goals, however noble the attempt. </strong>No matter that  many other states have adopted the &quot;circuit
  breaker&quot; idea, its problems
  are so basic, at least as now  conceived, that it can never be more than a
  poor solution to what is essentially a conceptual  problem. That other states
  have adopted this program is no reason for believing that it is sound policy;
  rather, there is every reason to believe that it has been adopted more by default
  for reasons that its impacts and implications have not been thoroughly scrutinized.</p>

  <p><font size="-1">5
      I have addressed much of this confusion in other papers, see <a href="http://www.wealthandwant.com/">www.wealthandwant.com</a>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>  At its sponsors see things, the fundamental challenge is to find <strong>equity</strong>  in
  taxation by linking  income with wealth. But the correlation between income
  and wealth is very problematic,  especially as people enter their advanced
  years. A home may have radically appreciated in value,  while the owner's income,
  perhaps only a pension and Social Security, has precipitously dropped.  Sometimes
  also households have temporary exigencies &#8212; losing
  a job, for example &#8212; that lead to  inconsistencies between incomes and
  home values. Efforts to solve such incongruities by the &quot;circuit breaker&quot; can never properly assess these real world situations.
  Moreover, because the data  used to calculate the tax burden will always be
  incomplete and problematic, one must always doubt  how fairly the tax design
  plays out in practice. The property tax as now understood is a wealth tax,  a
  poor one at that.<strong><em>6</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <font size="-1">6 Plausibly the property tax, particularly the portion that
    falls on land value, could be seen as a user fee, as payment for use of sites
    according to their
    market value. In some localities the lion's share of  residential parcel
    values is in land, particularly for older homes. But there has been little
    discussion
    of it in this vein. Were this logic to be employed, there would be little
    likelihood that relief measures would be offered, any more than for parking
    charges.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, one could argue in passing that it misconstrues the nature of wealth.
    Accepting natural  resource as wealth through capture of property titles
    leads down a path of windfall gains that are  not only unearned but frequently
  ephemeral. We are seeing this now particularly in what may be  the biggest real estate bubble since the 1930s.</p>
<p>  It is the focus upon equity concerns that are the root of the problem. If
  it were clear that the equity  problems were really solved by the &quot;circuit
  breaker&quot; provisions,
    argument for their adoption might  be persuasive. But that can't be shown.
    All that its proponents can do is offer models or sample  cases, none of
    which adequately justify the imposition of a scheme which, in consideration
    of its  other limitations, hardly warrants further defense. FPI has been
    able to show distributions and  benefits in the aggregate, but would be hard
    put to show the validity of its claims if variances were  taken into account.
  Still, while the equity claims are problematic and never conclusive, other  liabilities the &quot;circuit breaker&quot; solution faces are massive.</p>
<p>  Any tax regime needs to be judged according to a number of criteria, the
    tenets of which have been  enumerated and refined since the work of Adam
    Smith. I have chosen in my writing to break them  down into six because it
    offers the best explanatory refinement. They are <strong>neutrality</strong>, <strong>efficiency</strong>,  <strong>equity</strong>,
    <strong>stability</strong>, <strong>administrability</strong>, and <strong>simplicity</strong>. <strong>The &quot;circuit breaker&quot; tries
    to meet the  principle of equity, or fairness, but at such a huge cost in
  compromises to other principles as  to be not worth the candle.</strong></p>
<p>  The first problem it faces is in its compromise of tax neutrality as it
  attempts to achieve equity. A  neutral tax is one in which decisions about
  the use of a tax base are unaffected by the application of  the tax. It is
  obvious that a &quot;circuit breaker&quot; will typically
    alter a household's choice of options  when it is applied; indeed that is
    its intent. Whether such intents should be fostered as a matter of  policy
    ought to be openly discussed, not hidden in agendas that are only partially
    explicated. For  example, any tax relief granted by a &quot;circuit breaker&quot; will
    be capitalized in part in a parcel's market  value, thereby altering the
    considerations applied to it for alternate use. Other public considerations  should play a part in such choices; for example, preferential tax relief
    may compromise efforts to  foster the &quot;<strong>highest and best use</strong>&quot; of
    locations. Issues of <strong>generational equity</strong> are raised by  institution of &quot;circuit
    breaker&quot; relief. The policy can even influence
  the choices beyond public  view faced by families alone.</p>
<p>  A second concern is raised by the impact of a &quot;circuit breaker&quot; upon
    the performance efficiencies  of the economy. As noted above, the policy
    may compromise land use considerations of highest  and best use, so that
    patterns of sprawl and urban blight are engendered. The <strong>distributional
    impacts</strong>  of the policy will likely create considerable <strong>deadweight
    loss</strong>, not just by
    the spatial  configurations fostered but also by resource allocation among
    households and commercial  interests. These are harder to identify and measure,
  but they are nonetheless real, especially in  view of scarce resource allocation that necessarily obtains in the real world.</p>
<p>  The matter of fairness, the one that the &quot;circuit breaker&quot; is
  intended to address first and foremost,  after all is said and done leaves
  out of the equation several other parties to claims on <strong>distributive
  justice</strong>.
  Among them are not just those in different income and age groups that are typically  excluded,
  but those who are not homeowners at all &#8212; <strong>renters, non-residential
  titleholders</strong>,
  and so
  on. Deliberately or not, studies of property tax incidence often fail to
    take into account these other
  titleholders, especially with respect to claims about progressivity. Their
    self-serving nature is 
  often explained by their sponsorship, those done by AARP, for example.</p>
<p>  The &quot;circuit breaker&quot; is not likely to have any significant impact
    upon the <strong>stability</strong> of a revenue  stream, unless, as in California, tax obligations
    are linked to assessment practices which only occur  with a title transfer.
    In those cases, the forgone tax revenue is reflected in the market value
    of  parcels. There the ripple effects wrought by the wholesale corruption
  of the property tax regime  has affected not just stability but every other principle as well.</p>
<p>  It is the <strong>administrability</strong> and the <strong>simplicity</strong> of
  the property tax that are most compromised by the &quot;circuit breaker.&quot;  Take first of all the simplicity concerns. The formula as it stands incorporates
  
  factors of household income, of property tax burden, and both are adjusted
    to accommodate the  regional differentials that are so profoundly evident
    in New York State. Those regional  differentials are extremely broadly drawn,
    and palpably invite compromise in equity concerns they  hope to address.
    Those differentials take no account of the tax rates that obtain regionally.
    In  downstate areas, they are in the neighborhood of 1 percent; upstate,
  as high as 3 percent in some  places.</p>
<p>  A still further consideration involves the wider economic and public policy
    forces at work  influencing property values inter-regionally. <strong>Transportation
    costs</strong> have an enormous influence  upon the market value of sites &#8212;  consider
    the projected real estate growth in anticipation of  improved rail service
    in the Hudson River Valley. One need also only recall the projected impact  two
    decades ago of the removal of tolls on the NYS Thruway as an illustration
  of such factors. </p>
<p> Consider further the changes in the IRS code regarding the write-off of capital
    gains on the rise of  second homes which in fact are often claimed as primary
    homes. Innumerable factors have had an  impact on property values beyond
  what any simple relief formula is able to address. </p>
<p>  An analogy can be drawn with the experience of the federal government decades
    ago where a  growing number of exemptions, deductions, credits, and other
    modifications were made to the  personal income tax. The growing complexity
    and confusion surrounding such designs culminated  in 1986, when agreement
    was finally reached to broaden the base and lower the rates. This was an  effort
    to bring simplicity to the system once more. The property tax faces a similar
    experience  now in growing complexity, all of which threatens the integrity
    and legitimacy of the design. A  good part of the antipathy toward the property
    tax is due to suspicion and antagonism of its  administration, but an equal
  measure of blame should be directed toward its design. The &quot;circuit  breaker&quot; would compound this sentiment.</p>
<p>  One needs to look at how the property tax base itself is managed to see
  how vulnerable any  formulas are to distortion, obsolescence and abuse. As
  noted elsewhere, the real property tax from  an economic perspective is really
  two separate taxes, each with its own peculiar dynamic.<em><strong>7</strong></em> It is a tax on land
  values and a tax on improvements (buildings or structures). A Federal Reserve
  Board study discerned that improvements typically depreciate
    at 1.5 percent per annum.<strong><em>8</em></strong> This means that  over a relatively short period
    of time a building will have a much lower market value. Land  values, in
    contrast, appreciate, these typically far faster than the cost of labor and
    goods or the rate  of inflation generally. Much of this is influenced by
    factors such as the health of the local  economy. But a significant influence
    also is the attraction of real estate as an investment venue,  precisely
    because it has been so favored by public policies. Assessments quickly become
    dated  unless they are revised regularly, and too much reliance upon their
    validity simply invites  challenge to their soundness. Given that assessments
    are so problematic, why should political  leaders adopt a tax design that
    rests upon such questionable data variables? Ample evidence  exists, much
    that I can provide, that demonstrates how poor the assessments presently
  are, and not  just in New York State.</p>

<p>  The last consideration prompts questions about whether the &quot;circuit
  breaker&quot; is
  indeed  <strong>administrable</strong> at all. To be sure, public officials are imbued with
  a &quot;can
  do&quot; spirit and a service  orientation that leads them to accept and respect
  whatever laws are enacted by legislative bodies. But surely they have an obligation
  to speak to questions about the administrability of laws they are expected
  to carry out. Testimony before the Assembly Property
    Tax Committee elicited  assurances from its spokesperson last year that difficult
    provisions relating to the STAR program  were finally being dealt with. But
    this was years after the program was initiated. The confusion  and misunderstandings
    concerning its administration were costly not only in time and resources
   but also in loss of public trust. It is this very sentiment that is now prompting
  calls for a redesign  in the property tax regime: the old system isn't working.</p>
<p> But will the new one work? Can it work? Of course, it will likely hobble
    along if it is enacted.  And the public will likely comply with the same level
    of resentment and suspicion that leaders are  taking as a benchmark of all
    tax regimes. Every indication suggests, however, that, if the &quot;circuit  breaker&quot; is
    adopted, it will have as many problems as earlier designs, suggesting that
    a more  concerted and deeper analysis of applicable principles of taxation
    is called for. This I have  addressed in other submissions to the Commission.
    A far more palatable, politically salable, and  administrably feasible alternative
    is<strong> the deferral option</strong>.<em><strong>9</strong></em> It involves far fewer people and parcels, far easier
    and quicker to institute, and a better way to encourage the economic vitality
  of New York State's suffering towns and cities.</p>
