Justice, and Economic
Reform</font><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="+1"><br>
</font><i>The Henry George Lecture at St. John's University: March 18,
1997</i>
<p>Nicolaus Tideman</p>
</center>
<p>There is a bumper sticker that says, "If you want peace, then work
for justice." At a superficial level, this simple slogan contains an
important half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound
half-truth. To understand these half-truths and why they are only
half true, we need to know what peace is, what justice is, and we
need to understand the relationship between the two. So in this talk
I want to explore the meanings of peace and justice, their
relationship, and the role of economic reform in attaining both.</p>
<p>"If you want peace, then work for justice." The more obvious and
superficial meaning of this slogan is that people who are treated
unjustly will prevent the attainment of peace until the wrongs to
which they are subject are righted. Demonstrators shout: "No justice.
No peace." The apparent meaning of peace in this case is tranquility,
the absence of strife. And if this meaning of peace is accepted, the
slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as long as people
have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only half
true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really
is.</p>
<p>Peace is more than armistice, more than the cessation of violence.
Peace is unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all
pleased to cooperate with one another. When we have attained true
peace, there will be no person who has any purpose that any other
person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world, everyone will feel the
truth of John Donne's meditation,</p>
<blockquote><i>No man is an Island entire of itself; every man is a
piece of the Continent; a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by
the sea, Europe is the less, and well as if a promontory were, as well
as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death
diminishes me because I am involved in Mankind; therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee</i>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000" size="-1">[1]</font></span></small></blockquote>
<p>Is it imaginable that we might ever attain a world where everyone
felt so? And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that
world? What is justice?</p>
<p>There are so many conflicting, strident claims for different
conceptions of justice that a person might reasonably despair of ever
finding a meaning of justice that people would agree upon. Any
conception of justice may seem to be no more than one person's
opinion. And yet there are things that we all know about justice. If
I tell you that I stand before you as justice, you know that across
my face you will find -- a blindfold. In my left hand I hold aloft -- a
pair of scales. You know that in my right hand I have -- a sword that I
will use if necessary. And my gender is female.</p>
<p>The blindfold, the scales, the sword, and the feminine gender.
These features of the traditional symbol tell us much about justice.
The blindfold might seem out of place, since it prevents justice from
either seeing what the scales say or wielding the sword effectively.
But we know that the blindfold has a distinct and essential meaning.
The blindfold ensures that justice will not be swayed by any visible
characteristics of those who plead before her. Justice is not
concerned with whether you are black or white, short or tall,
beautiful or ugly. Every person receives the same treatment from
justice.</p>
<p>The scales have at least two possible interpretations. The first
interpretation is that the disputants at the bar of justice each
place their arguments in one of the pans of the scales, and justice
determines who has the weightier arguments. Our language supports
this interpretation with references to the scales of justice tipping
in one direction or another. But there is different use of the scales
that is particularly relevant to questions of social justice, as
opposed to personal disputes. The scales can be used to achieve an
equal division. Justice is done when the contents of one pan of the
scales are exactly balanced by the contents of the other. This is the
meaning of the scales that I shall apply.</p>
<p>And then the sword. The sword represents the fact that justice is
prepared to use the threat of force, and force itself, to see that
her decrees are carried out. In a world where men have so often used
weapons to achieve selfish dominance, the feminine gender helps make
credible the claim that the sword is used only to achieve justice,
and not to advance the selfish interests of the person who wields
it.</p>
<p>Thus if we know that justice is the blindfolded woman with the
scales and the sword, then we know that justice is the principles of
equality and evenhandedness that command and prohibit the use of
force in resolving conflicts.</p>
<p>Consider what this tells us. It tells us first that if we wish to
claim that justice authorizes the force we wish to use, or that
justice forbids the force that others wish to use against us, then we
must be able to show that our claim is consistent with equality and
evenhandedness.</p>
<p>The slogan "might makes right" is an oxymoron, a misuse of
language. An autocrat like Genghis Khan who imposes his will on
others, without any reference to principles, does not operate in the
realm of justice.</p>
<p>Second, the blindfold tells us that we are not in the realm of
justice if the principles we offer to explain why our use of force is
justified are of the form, "Because I am better than you," or
Hitler's, "Because Aryans are better than Jews." Justice compels us
to acknowledge the equality of all persons. Claims of individual or
group supremacy cannot be accepted by justice.</p>
<p>Third, not only are all persons equal in the blindfolded eyes of
justice, but their different goals in life all deserve equal respect.
Lenin's claim that all power should be in the hands of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party, because the Party was the unique
source of true understanding of the historical dialectic, cannot be
accepted by justice. Even if the Party is the unique source of true
historical understanding, that is not a sufficient reason to give all
power to the party. Justice provides equal treatment for those who
wish to pursue lives that are inconsistent with the advance of the
historical dialectic. And any other elitist claim that some
particular goal provides the basis for favored treatment must
similarly be rejected by justice.</p>
Even the utilitarian proposal that conflicting claims should be
settled in the way that yields the greatest possible utility must be
rejected as an elitist imposition of a particular goal on people who
may have other plans. If I choose to pursue a life that can be
guaranteed to lead to depression and despair, I have as much claim to
the protection of justice in that pursuit as if I choose the path
that leads to bliss. Justice must be neutral in its evaluation of
people and their goals. As Bruce Ackerman has said in defining
neutrality,
<blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">No reason [justifying the
exercise of power] is a good reason if it requires the power holder to
assert: (a) that his conception of the good is better than that
asserted by any of his fellow citizens, or (b) that, regardless of his
conception of the good, he is intrinsically superior to one or more of
his fellow citizens.<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">[2]</span></small></span></blockquote>
<p>If we commit ourselves to neutrality, does that provide a unique
definition of justice? No, it doesn't. There are a number of
definitions of justice that might claim to satisfy neutrality,
although the claims of some definitions are dubious, and other
definitions can be rejected on other grounds.</p>
<p>Consider first the conservative claim that justice is defined by
traditional rules. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservative </span>says,
"I don't say that I'm
better than anyone else, nor do I say that my conception of the good
is better than anyone else's. I may not even like what tradition
demands. But if you want to be just, you will follow the rules that
have traditionally been followed." I have seen one drawing of justice
that reflects this conservative view by portraying justice as a
seated woman, with a book in her lap. The book is clearly the
received law, the source that justice cites as the foundation of her
decrees. But this is not the standard image of justice.</p>
<p>There is an important virtue of conservatism. This is that it
eliminates the waste of resources in fighting over who has what
rights, the waste from what economists call <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">rent-seeking</span>.
Furthermore, there will be some situations where there is no time to
secure agreement on anything other than the status quo. Thus there is
reason to have at least some element of conservatism in the
procedures by which disputes are resolved. But conservatism cannot be
the ultimate rule of a just society. It would perpetuate slavery, the
selling of daughters as brides, racial and sexual inequalities in
civil rights, and every other historical injustice that, through our
moral evolution, we have overcome. The neutrality of Conservatism is
superficial. Conservatism cannot claim to offer either the
evenhandedness that the blindfold promises or the equality that
scales require.</p>
<p>Next, consider the claim that justice is defined by what the
majority wants. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarian </span>says,
"If you want to know who
should prevail in a conflict, take a vote." As appealing as
majoritarianism may be on the surface, it cannot provide a coherent
theory of justice.</p>
<p>If one wishes to make sense of majoritarianism, one must first
specify the perspective from which voters are expected to vote. Are
voters to vote as proponents of their selfish personal interests, or
are they to vote as disinterested judges of what is best?</p>
<p>Suppose first that voters vote on the basis of their selfish
personal interests. Then voting is incoherent as a basis for justice.
If voters always vote selfishly, then at any time when you might
think that the voting was over, there will always be some measure
that can be proposed that will benefit a majority at the expense of a
minority, which could therefore be adopted by selfish voting. The
process of deciding by voting will never end if any proposal can be
advanced at any time and people always vote selfishly. Selfish voting
can be used to decide between any two proposals. And it can be used
in more general settings if there is some more or less arbitrary
stopping rule to keep the process from going on indefinitely. But
selfish voting as a general mechanism for determining what is just is
incoherent.</p>
<p>Now suppose that voters behave as unselfish, disinterested judges
of what is best. In this case, voting as a mechanism for determining
what is just is incomplete, because it leaves unanswered the question
of what is meant by "best." Does "best" mean "creates the greatest
total utility" or "comes closest to preserving the expectations of
the status quo" or "maximizes the rate of growth of the population"
or something else? How would you know what best means? If the Supreme
Court knows that what is best is what comes closest to preserving the
expectations that have developed from our Constitution and
traditions, then the justices can employ voting to decide cases and
establish new precedents. But to say that what is just is what is
voted to be best by unselfish, disinterested judges without
specifying what best means is to decline to answer the question of
what justice is. Thus neither selfish voting nor unselfish voting
serves to define justice, although there can be an element of voting
in our efforts to resolve disagreements about what an agreed
definition of justice requires in particular circumstances.</p>
<p>If voting cannot be used to define justice, one might entertain
the possibility of using a contractarian formulation: What is just is
the rules to which people would have agreed if they did not know
their personal circumstances. In his 1958 paper, "<b><i>Justice as
Fairness</i></b>," John Rawls said,</p>
<blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">[Suppose that a group
lets] each person propose the principles upon which he wishes his
complaints to be tried with the understanding that, if acknowledged,
the complaints of others will be similarly tried, and that no
complaints will be heard at all until everyone is roughly of one mind
as to how the complaints are to be judged. . . . each person will
propose principles of a general kind which will, to a large degree,
gain their sense from the various applications to be made of them, the
particular circumstances of which being as yet unknown.<small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">[3]</span></small></span></blockquote>
<p>This is a reasonable recipe for implementing the Golden Rule and a
fine idea for seeking agreement about the principles by which
complaints shall be judged. If people were to follow this suggestion
and achieve the agreement that is described, they would achieve
fairness.</p>
<p>However, this does not make Rawls's suggestion a good way to
identify justice. The critical difficulty with his suggestion is that
those who mete out justice cannot afford the luxury of securing
complete agreement on principles. They must bring their judgement to
bear on those who have not agreed on principles. In this context, the
closest that a person can come to Rawls' suggestion is to ask
himself, "Are the principles that I propose to apply ones that I
would agree to if I did not know how I would personally be affected
by them?"</p>
<p>In later writings, Rawls claims that in the original position,
people would choose the rules that maximized the well-being of the
representative member of the least advantaged class.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[4]</span></small> John
Harsanyi, on the other hand, has said that in the original position
people would choose the rules that maximized average
utility<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.[5]</span></small>
Someone else might say that in the original
position people would choose the rules that provided the greatest
stability. How can we know what people would choose?</p>
<p>No matter how a contractarian answers this question, there will be
the difficulty raised by Ackerman, in <b><i>Social Justice in the
Liberal State</i></b>. Describing the attempt to apply the Rawlsian
criterion, Ackerman says:</p>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Despite my best efforts, I
shall be defenseless . . . the moment I try to make it clear to another
person why it is right that I, rather than he, should establish a claim
over a disputed thing: I: When I look into myself, I am sure that I
would have insisted upon this right as a condition for entering society
with you. YOU: You haven't the slightest idea what you would have
insisted on in a presocial state. You're simply using the idea of a
potential entrant as a screen upon which to project the deepest desires
of your socialized self. But I too have desires; why should mine be
sacrificed to yours? And if you insist, it is possible that I too may
delve deep into my psyche and find a transcendent grounding for my
desires.<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">[6]</span></small></blockquote>
<p>The sword of justice is too momentous to be constrained by only
the requirement that those who judge be able to convince themselves
that their judgements satisfy principles to which they would have
agreed, if they had not known how they would be affected by those
principles. The contractarian approach may be a good way to seek
consensus. It may be a good guideline for those who are called upon
by disputants to arbitrate between them. But it is not a good way to
define justice.</p>
<p>Next, consider <span style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>.
The egalitarian says that justice
is equality. There is a conceptual difficulty in specifying how
beings as different from each other as humans are could ever be
equal, unless we create a society where all humans are female clones
of one another. (This should be technologically feasible within a few
decades, if it is not already.) But I do not think that egalitarians
want a society of clones.</p>
<p>Ackerman has offered a suggestion for determining whether any
persons among a genetically diverse group are genetically
disadvantaged. His suggestion is that, to be genetically undominated,
a person must possess a set of abilities that permit him to pursue
some life purpose that some persons have, with as much facility as
any other person is able to pursue that life purpose. And Ackerman
asserts that every person has a right to be genetically
undominated.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></p>
<p>I doubt that we have the technological capability yet to ensure
that every child who is born will be genetically undominated, and
until we have that capability and decide to use it, any egalitarian
will need to deal with the question of how genetic inequalities are
to be rectified.</p>
<p>John Rawls has proposed that the talents that individuals possess
be regarded as a common pool, so that anyone who has more than his
share has an obligation to compensate those who have less then their
shares.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]</span></small>
Ronald Dworkin has made the contractarian
suggestion that people can justly be required to pay an income tax
that represents the insurance against being untalented that they
would have desired to purchase before they knew what talents they
would have.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[9]</span></small></p>
<p>Dworkin's acknowledges that his suggestion would not produce
equality. If we believe Harsanyi's claim that people who did not know
their personal circumstances would want to maximize their expected
utility, then, even in the absence of adjustments for incentive
effects, Dworkin's suggestion leads not to equal utilities, but
rather to equal marginal utilities of money, which generally implies
unequal utilities when people have different capacities to get
utility from money.</p>
<p>Ackerman suggests that each person who is genetically dominated is
owed compensation by those who dominate him.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[10]</span></small></p>
<p>All of these suggestions should be rejected. Talents are not a
common pool from which some persons have taken more then their
shares. If we are all fishing in the same pond, the quantity of fish
that you take will diminish the quantity that is available to me. But
the quantity of talent that you have in no way diminishes the
quantity that is available to me. Your talent is not acquired at my
expense.</p>
<p>From the perspective of peace, no man is an island; each of us is
a part of mankind. And any of us who has been graced with an extra
measure of talent should recognize that, often, the best use of our
talent is to provide for others. Nevertheless, from the perspective
of justice, each of us must be allowed to act like an island if he
wishes.</p>
<p>Suppose that a bone-marrow transplant from me would save your
life -- or at least prolong it. And suppose that there is no other
person whose tissue type matches yours. Would you assert that you
have a right to receive such a transplant whether or not I want to
give it? Would you suggest that the sword of justice should be used
to force me to give it? An egalitarian ought to be prepared to
require me to provide the transplant, for if I refuse I am denying
the possibility of continued life to another person, when I have
continued life for myself, and the cost to me would be relatively
modest.</p>
<p>If you do not mind requiring a bone-marrow transplant of me, then
what about a kidney? Suppose that, through no fault of your own, both
of your kidneys have failed, and I am the only person who has a
kidney that is compatible with your tissue. Would you force me to
donate a kidney? And if you call yourself an egalitarian and you
would not, then why not? After all, I have two working kidneys and
you have none. What could be more equal than requiring us to divide
the available working kidneys equally?</p>
<p>If you do not mind requiring me to donate a kidney, then what
about my heart? Suppose that I have lived for 50 years and you have
lived for only 25. Your heart has been damaged by an illness, through
no fault of your own. I have the only heart that matches your tissue,
and it would be good for another 25 years. One of us will have to
die. Why shouldn't we put the one available heart in your chest, so
that we might divide the available years of life equally between us?
A good egalitarian should require me to part with the one available
heart after I have had my share of years.</p>
<p>But I don't think you would. I don't think anyone would. We are
not egalitarians. We recognize the sanctity of the boundaries of the
human body. In a peaceful world I will gladly give a spare kidney to
anyone who needs it. But in a just world, no one will forcefully
extract a kidney from me, even to save someone else's life. Justice
is not egalitarianism.</p>
<p>Just as I own my kidneys, so do I own my talents. In a peaceful
world I will use them for the benefit of all mankind. But the sword
of justice should not be used to force me to compensate those with
less talent. Nor should it be used to force me to abide by the
insurance contract that you believe I would have signed, if I had had
the chance, before I knew what talents I would have. Nor, in
Ackerman's framework, should I be held responsible for the fact that
someone else decided to have a child that turned out to be
genetically dominated by me. If anyone is held responsible for the
fact that a genetically dominated child is brought into the world, it
should be the child's parents. And if the parents are irresponsible,
then the parents' parents, or the parents' teachers, should be held
responsible.</p>
<p>If would-be parents are too poor to provide for the children that
they ought to be able to have, then we should ask whether their
parents provided inadequately for them, or whether they were unjustly
deprived of resources that ought to have been theirs. But it is not a
reason to levy assessments on those who have talent. An egalitarian
redistribution to compensate for differences in talent is as unjust
as an egalitarian redistribution of kidneys. Egalitarianism is not
justice.</p>
<p>A proper definition of justice begins with the principles of
classical liberalism. In a just world each person is permitted to
determine the purposes to which his or her body is put--the hands and
the brain no less than the kidneys. We each have rights of
self-determination. This includes the right of ownership of what we
produce, at least, as John Locke said, when we leave as much in
natural opportunities for others as we appropriate for our own
productive activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small></p>
<p>We have the right to co-operate with whom we choose for whatever
mutually agreed purposes we choose. Thus we have the right to trade
with others, without any artificial hindrances, and we have the right
to keep any wages or interest that we receive from such trading.</p>
<p>These components of the classical liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: how are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?</p>
<p>John Locke qualified his statement that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.</p>
<p>One tradition in classical liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>,"
as exemplified by Murray
Rothbard, who say that there is really no need to be concerned with
Locke's proviso. Natural opportunities belong to whoever first
appropriates them, regardless of whether opportunities of equal value
are available to others.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[13]</span></small></p>
<p>The other tradition is that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>,"
as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span></small> Any
excess in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</p>
<p>There are two fundamental problems with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land. The first problem is the
incongruity with historical reality. Humans have emerged from an
environment of violence. Those who now have titles to land can trace
those titles back only so far, before they come to events where fiat
backed by violence determined title. And the persons who were
displaced at that time themselves had titles that originated in
violence. If there ever were humans who acquired the use of land
without forcibly displacing other humans, we have no way of knowing
who they were or who their current descendants might be. There is, in
practice, no way of assigning land to the legitimate successors of
the persons who first claimed land. And to assign titles based on any
fraction of history is to reward the last land seizures that are not
rectified.</p>
<p>The second fundamental problem with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</p>
<p>It would be inefficient, for one thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</p>
<p>Justice -- the balancing of the scales -- is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position, "I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you." (How one compares, in
practice, the value of different natural opportunities is a bit
complex. If you really want to know, you can invite me back for
another lecture.)</p>
<p>Justice is thus a regime in which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities.</p>
<p>Getting back to where we started, is it true that, "If you want
peace-- real peace--you should work for justice?" and if so why?
Well, it's half true. To see why, consider what peace is, and how one
might create it.</p>
<p>Peace is unity and harmony. Peace is people recognizing that we
are all parts of one another, that it is always for ourselves that
the bell tolls.</p>
<p>What keeps us from attaining peace? One of the greatest hindrances
to the attainment of peace -- real peace -- is that resistance that so
many of us feel to tolerating oppression and injustice. When we know
that we, or others we care for, have been treated unjustly, it is
ever so difficult to attain a state of unity and harmony with others.
The leap to peace is so much easier from a position of justice. So,
even though peace and justice are very disparate things, and peace is
much the more attractive one, still it make sense, if you want to
help people reach peace, to work for justice.</p>
<p>But the reason that this is only half true is that, in fact,
justice is not actually necessary to your attainment of peace. If you
want peace for yourself, you can have it, at any time, in any
circumstances in which you find yourself. Whether you are treated
justly or not, you are a part of the being that is all humanity. Each
person's joy is your joy. Each person's grief is your grief. You
don't have to wait until you are treated justly to see this.</p>
<p>So if you want a peace for others, then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</p>
<p>But if you want peace for yourself, simply have it.<br>
