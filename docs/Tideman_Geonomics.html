<center><b>Basic Principles of Geonomics<br>
</b>Nic Tideman
</center>
<p>A geonomy respects the freedom of individuals, the limits of the
environment, and the claims of future generations. Individuals must
be free to organize their economic lives as they wish, within bounds
determined by the equal freedom of others and the recognition that
land, natural resources and environmental amenities are the common
heritage of all generations.</p>
<p>For an economy emerging from central control, the first principle
of geonomics is free enterprise. Individuals must be free to set up
new enterprises, to charge whatever prices they and their customers
mutually agree, and to pay whatever wages they and their workers
mutually agree. Free enterprise requires free trade and freedom to
use internationally valued currencies. There should be no taxes or
other restrictions on what can be imported or exported and no
restrictions on the use of foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Currency and trade restrictions arise primarily because
governments resort to printing money at rates that cause currencies
to lose their value. This practice transfers resources from citizens
to governments and causes citizens to desire to hold their savings in
foreign currencies. Governments must have other sources of revenue so
that they do not feel forced to print money to survive.</p>
<p>The first source of revenue for a government should be the rental
value of land. This is <span style="font-weight: bold;">just</span>,
because no one made the land, so that no
one can justly claim a disproportionate share of its value. It is
<span style="font-weight: bold;">efficient </span>because, unlike
other factors of production, land does not
withdraw its services when taxed. </p>
<p>There should be private possession of land. Individuals and
enterprises should be guaranteed that they will never be removed from
the land they improve (unless it is needed for an essential public
purpose, in which case they should be compensated for their
improvements and relocation costs). Individuals and enterprises
should be able to use their land as they choose, up to the point
where they cause harmful effects on their neighbors. They should be
able to transfer their land and improvements to whomever they choose,
on whatever terms are mutually agreed. To justify the exclusive use
of land, every user should make an annual payment to the local
government with jurisdiction over the land, equal to the rental value
of the land, so that rental value can be shared equitably.</p>
<p>The rental value of land can be determined by having local
assessors acquire, each year, samples of sites with little or no
improvements. These would be auctioned as unimproved land, on the
basis of bids that represented offers of payment for the first year,
with payments in future years determined by future bids for similar
sites. The rental value of each site in the initial year can then be
determined by comparisons with sites that have been auctioned. There
are several other sources of revenue that are equally just, efficient
and necessary for a well-functioning geonomy. Some of these sources
are, as collection of the rent of land is, payments for natural
opportunities that must be assigned to someone. In this category are</p>
<ul>
  <li>payments for parking on crowded streets,  </li>
  <li>payments for the right to
broadcast on particular frequencies, and  </li>
  <li>payments for depletion of
natural resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The other just and efficient
sources of public revenue involve
payments for activities that impose costs on others.</span> In this
category
are fines for causing pollution or engaging in other activities that
reduce the rental value of surrounding land, charges for driving on
crowded streets, and fees for public services, determined by the
costs of providing those services, including the costs of congestion
and delays experienced by other customers.</p>
<p>To the extent that the rental value of land is raised by the
provision of public services, the money collected from users of land
should be allocated to pay for those services. To the extent that the
rental value of land is purely the product of nature, it should be
regarded as the equal income of all and shared equally among all
citizens in a locality, unless they decide democratically to use it
for some other purpose.</p>
<p>Levels of government higher than the local level should be
supported by charges on localities. These charges should vary with
the services that localities receive from the higher levels, with
extra charges on localities with disproportionately large amounts of
land, natural resources, or initial social capital relative to their
populations.</p>
<p>An economy emerging from central control must also arrange for the
future management of enterprises that have previously been managed
centrally. Enterprises that are monopoly providers of local public
services such as water or electricity should be managed by
localities. Other enterprises should be privatized in such a way as
to transfer their value to all citizens in proportion to the number
of years they have worked. This can be done by transferring the
ownership and control of enterprises to mutual funds whose managers
are rewarded in proportion to the profit of the enterprises they
control. Shares in these mutual funds would be given to all citizens
in proportion to the number of years they have worked. Any citizen
would then be permitted to withdraw and reinvest his or her assets as
desired.</p>
<p>To summarize, the basic principles of geonomics are:</p>
<p><b>1. Equal sharing of land and natural resources, achieved
by:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">a. public collection of the rental value
of land and of
appropriate fees for broadcast rights and other opportunities that
must be assigned exclusively, for depletion of natural resources, and
for causing pollution or engaging in other activities that reduce the
value of surrounding land;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">b. equal sharing among the population of
  that part of rent and
  other public revenue not attributable to public services;</p>
<p><b>2. Elimination of taxes on labor, capital and enterprise,
limiting government revenue to the items mentioned in 1.a.
above;</b></p>
<p><b>3. Economic freedom, encompassing free enterprise, free trade,
and freedom to use foreign currencies;</b></p>
<p><b>4. Assignment of the ownership of previously centralized
enterprises to all workers in proportion to the number of years they
have worked, through shares in mutual funds whose managers are
rewarded in proportion to the profits earned.</b></p>
