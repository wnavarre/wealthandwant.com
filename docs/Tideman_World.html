Conclusion</a>
<p><b>How would the world look if its political institutions were
shaped by the conception of social justice advanced by Henry
George?</b></p>
<p>Henry George was one of the most famous reformers of the late 19th
century. Ever since the 1879 publication of his book, <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b></a>, his ideas have inspired people working for
economic and social reform all around the world. He is most famous
for proposing the abolition of all taxes except for a tax on the
value of land. But I will argue that the single tax on land was not
George's most important contribution, and that the power of his
thinking can be best appreciated by focusing on the theory of social
justice that he used to explain why a single tax on land is just.</p>
<p>First I will argue that George's theory of social justice provides
the dramatic climax as well as the logical foundation of
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.</p>
<p>Next, I will discuss the functions of a theory of justice.</p>
<p>Then I will address the question of what George's theory of social
justice implies for relations among nations.</p>
<p>Finally, I will ask what constitutes justice within nations, in a
world where relations among nations are governed by George's theory
of social justice.</p>
<p><a name="I. Social Justice as the Climax"></a><b>I. Social Justice
as the Climax and Logical Foundation of <i>Progress and
Poverty</i></b></p>
<p>While George wrote a number of books &#8212; the precise number depends
on how you count &#8212; the most powerful statement of his ideas is
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, a volume that he divided into ten
Books.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The work is in part a restatement of economic theory, (Books I,
III and IV),</li>
  <li>part an examination of the causes of and proposed cures for
persistent widespread poverty (Books II, V, and VI),</li>
  <li>part a brief for curing poverty and the unacceptable distribution
of wealth by eliminating all taxes except a tax on the value of land
(Books VII, VIII and IX), and</li>
  <li>part a theory of human progress (Book X).</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that the most significant lasting impact of Progress and
Poverty will come from the conception of justice in Chapter 1 of Book
VII, a chapter titled "<b>The Injustice of Private Property in
Land</b>." From a dramatic perspective, this chapter is the cenptral
component of the climax of the work.</p>
<p>The climax begins with the second of the two chapters of Book VI.
In the first chapter of Book VI, George analyzes six different
proposed remedies for persistent poverty and explains why they are
inadequate. In the second chapter, which consists of just three
pages, he asserts that the only effective remedy for the relief of
poverty and the unacceptable distribution of wealth is to "<b>make
land common propert</b>y."</p>
<p>George's choice of words here may have been unnecessarily
inflammatory.</p>
<p>When people see this phrase, they generally presume that George
was proposing public ownership of land. In fact he rejected public
ownership of land. What he actually meant was that we must recognize
that land is everyone's common heritage, and we must develop
institutions that reflect this. In any case, he recognized that his
assertion would sound outrageous to many of his readers, and he
promises to defend it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><i>The laws of the universe are harmonious. And if the
remedy to which we have been led is the true one, it must be consistent
with justice; it must be practical of application; it must accord with
the tendencies of social development and must harmonize with other
reforms.</i>
    <p><i>All this I propose to show.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, Book VII is concerned with the justice of making land
common property, Book VIII deals with the method and practicality of
making land common property &#8212; not by public ownership of land, but
by abolishing other taxes and financing government by public
collection of the rent of land, and Book IX explores economic
consequences of this remedy.</p>
<p>The first chapter of Book VII thus plays the crucial role of
overcoming the reader's inclination toward knee-jerk rejection of
George's startling idea. And George is prepared with a theory of
justice in powerful language:</p>
<blockquote><i>What constitutes the rightful basis of property? What is
it that enables a man justly to say of a thing, "It is mine!" From what
springs the sentiment which acknowledges his exclusive right against
all the world? Is it not, primarily, the right of a man to himself, to
the use of his own powers, to the enjoyment of the fruits of his own
exertions? Is it not this individual right, which springs from and is
testified to by the natural facts of individual organization</i> <span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span><font style="font-style: italic;"
 size="+2"><small>&#8212;</small></font><span style="font-style: italic;">the
fact that each particular pair of hands obey a particular
brain and are related to a particular stomach; the fact that each man
is a definite, coherent, independent whole</span><font
 style="font-style: italic;" size="+2"><small><small>&#8212;</small></small></font><span
 style="font-style: italic;">which alone justifies individual
ownership? As a
man belongs to himself, so his labor when put in concrete form
belongs to him. </span></blockquote>
George then argues that if ownership is derived from
labor, then no one can own land, since no one produced it:
<blockquote><i>This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes
the possibility of any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully
entitled to the produce of his own labor, then no one can be rightfully
entitled to the ownership of anything which is not the produce of his
labor, or the labor of someone else from whom the right has passed to
him. If production give to the producer the right to exclusive
possession and enjoyment, there can rightfully be no exclusive
possession and enjoyment of anything not the production of labor, and
the recognition of private property in land is a wrong.</i></blockquote>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;">If we are all here by
the equal permission of the creator, we are
all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his
bounty<font size="+1"><b> &#8212; </b></font>with an equal right to
the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This is a right
which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests in every
human being as he enters the world, and which during his continuance
in the world can be limited only by the equal rights of others. There
is in nature no such thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth
no power which can rightfully make a grant of exclusive ownership in
land. If all existing men were to unite to grant away their equal
rights, they could not grant away the right of those who follow
them.</p>
<p>To summarize George's rights-based theory of justice: Each person
has an exclusive right to his or her productive powers. We understand
this intuitively, and on this basis accept the idea that people own
what they produce. But if this is what ownership means, then no one
can claim to own land, since no one produced it. People do have
rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers, which are
here for our use, but the rights of each person are limited by the
equal rights of all other persons.</p>
<p>A careful analyst might object that there are some logical gaps in
George's theory of justice. Logically, a right of ownership of things
based on the right of each person to his or her productive powers
does not preclude a right of ownership of natural opportunities on
some other basis. We could mean by ownership only those rights that
are derived from the right of each person to his or her productive
powers, but we could also mean something broader and more
complex.</p>
<p>The easiest way to repair this gap in George's theory is to
specify that rather than having just one axiom, that each person has
a right to his or her productive powers, he actually has two, the
second one being that all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities.</p>
<p>A second logical gap occurs when George asserts that because
people have rights to their productive powers, they own what they
produce. This would follow only if they also had rights to the
natural opportunities that they appropriate in the process of
production. It is possible that the natural resources component of
what a person produces is more than his share, considering the equal
rights of everyone to all that nature offers. This caveat can be
conceded without jeopardizing the two axioms, that each person has an
exclusive right to his or her productive powers, and all persons have
equal rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers.</p>
<p>This pair of axioms is the logical starting point of George's
ideas. His proposal for the abolition of all taxes except a tax on
land is a consequence that follows from them. Coercive taxes on the
act of producing or on income from productive effort are unjust
because people have rights to their productive powers. On the other
hand, taxes on the rental value that land would have if it were not
improved are not unjust, since this value is not produced by human
effort. Support of government spending from this source is a
convenient way of giving expression to the equal rights of all to
natural opportunities.</p>
<p><a name="II. The Functions of a Theory o"></a><b>II. The Functions
of a Theory of Justice</b></p>
<p>While George used his theory of justice to support a proposal that
he had developed from a different line of inquiry, I would like to
start with his theory of justice and ask what implies for relations
among nations. It might seem that this is pointless, since there is
no authority that can require nations to behave justly toward one
another. But I submit that a theory of justice between nations is
still very important.</p>
<p>What is the use of a theory of justice? A theory is an
abstraction. By itself, it can't make anything happen. But when a
theory of justice takes root in us, it modulates our emotional
responses to distributive outcomes. If you should come to realize
that the theory of justice to which you subscribe says that something
you thought you wanted to do is unjust, you will find that course of
action no longer so appealing. If you come to a new realization that
justice is on your side, you are likely to feel emboldened and ready
to persist despite obstructions.</p>
<p>If you should come to the realization that justice requires of you
a course of action that you had not planned on, you will feel a pull
in that direction, and if you do not follow through, you are likely
to feel guilty.</p>
<p>If your theory of justice informs you that another person is
treated unjustly, even a stranger, you are likely to feel compassion
for that person, and you may also feel a chivalrous impulse to take
up that person's cause and seek redress of the injustice. It was
because of feelings of injustice that slavery was abolished and women
were granted the right to vote.</p>
<p>As the world shrinks, nations impinge upon one another in more and
more ways, providing applications for a theory of justice among
nations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The fishing that one nation does leaves fewer fish in the
oceans for others.  </li>
  <li>When a river flows from one nation into another,
the removal of water by the upstream nation leaves less water for the
downstream nation.  </li>
  <li>Near the borders of nations, the use of a
frequency by one nation for radio or TV broadcasting precludes its
use by the other.  </li>
  <li>Geosynchronous parking spaces for communications
satellites may become scarce.  </li>
  <li>Air-borne and water-borne pollutants
cross international borders and cause harm.  </li>
  <li>The burning of fossil
fuel produces global warming at rates and with consequences that are
not yet understood.  </li>
  <li>Chlorofluorocarbons emitted in the northern
hemisphere enlarge the Antarctic ozone hole and cause skin cancer in
Australia.</li>
</ul>
In most of these areas, the awareness of our global
interdependence has led to agreements among nations. But agreement is
not always reached. Negotiations are intricate and time-consuming.
Sometimes key participants refuse to accept what is agreeable to
others. A shared theory of justice among nations would point the way
to agreement and shame those who refused to accept the result. Henry
George's theory of justice provides a simple and far-reaching
framework for specifying the requirements of justice among
nations.
<p><a name="III. Applying George's Theory o"></a><b>III. Applying
George's Theory of Justice to Land Rights Among Nations</b></p>
<p>In connecting his proposals for reform to his theory of justice,
George made the implicit assumption that all of the people to whom
the theory applies are citizens of the same nation. But it is
interesting to ask, as George did not, what his theory of justice
implies for relations among sovereign nations.</p>
<p>To rearrange and condense George's axiom about natural
opportunities:</p>
<blockquote><i>The equal right of every human being to the use of all
that nature offers is natural, inalienable and limited only by the
equal rights of others.</i></blockquote>
<p>How would acceptance of this axiom affect relations among
nations?</p>
<p>To see the matter clearly, suppose first that the world consists
of just two agricultural island nations, with equal populations but
different amounts of land of a uniform quality, and no rent
differentials arising from locational differences. Suppose further
that each island is initially governed by an oligarchy that collects
all of the rent of land and provides no public services, but leaves
the population otherwise free to produce what they choose.</p>
<p>If the people of this world come to an understanding that the
equal right of every human being to the use of all that nature offers
is natural, inalienable and limited only by the equal rights of
others, they will see that justice requires them to share the rent of
land equally rather than have it collected by the oligarchies.</p>
<p>Would they then divide the rent of each island nation among the
people of that nation? No, they would not. From the clear meaning of
the words, the people of the nation with more land would understand
that they, as a nation, were appropriating more than their share of a
common heritage to which the people of the other nation had as much
right as they did, and that they were therefore required to
compensate the people of the other nation.</p>
<p>Consider some forms that such compensation might take. One
possibility is that everyone with exclusive use of land would divide
the rental value of his land equally among all persons. This would be
equitable, but it would have a very high transactions cost. The
conceptually simplest way to compensate for unequal appropriations of
the common heritage is to have everyone send to a clearing house the
full rental value of the land to which he has exclusive access. The
clearinghouse would then divide the proceeds equally among all
persons in both nations.</p>
<p>While this is conceptually simplest, it entails transferring more
money than necessary. It would suffice for each person with more than
his share to send the difference between the rental value of his land
and the global average rental value per capita. This would provide a
fund that would exactly suffice to compensate every person with less
than the global average per capita amount, for the difference between
the average and his holding.</p>
<p>With people organized into two nations, it would probably be
convenient to have the excess rent sent not to a global clearing
house, but to a national clearing house. The clearing house of the
larger nation would then send the clearing house of the smaller
nation an amount of money equal to the rental value of the amount of
land by which nation's area exceeded half of total land. Both
clearing houses would then have just enough money to compensate their
citizens who had less than the global average per capita access to
land.</p>
<p>The assumptions of just two nations, equal populations and land of
uniform quality simplify the identification of what one nation owes
the other. It is easy to dispense with these assumptions. When there
are many countries, land quality varies and population sizes differ,
a nation is fully entitled to what it is using, taking account of the
equal entitlements of the citizen of other nations to all that nature
offers, if its average rent per capita is no greater than the global
average rent per capita. If the nation's rent per capita is greater
than this, it owes compensation equal to the excess of its aggregate
rent above the product of its population and the global average rent
per capita.</p>
<p>Note that an equal sharing of natural opportunities does not imply
either that people derive equal satisfaction from their shares of
natural opportunities or that what constituted one persons share will
remain constant over time. If you are the only person who likes
mountain top land, you may be able to obtain a great deal of it as
your share of what nature offers, and be much more satisfied than
those who like land in valleys and have to compete with many others
who want valley land. If mountain top land becomes more popular, the
amount that constitutes your share will decline.</p>
<p>Now suppose that nations are not entirely agricultural, but have
cities as well as agricultural areas. Cities have streets, water
systems, sewer systems, and a variety of other public services that
raise the rental value of land. How does this additional source of
rent affect the compensation process? Recall the principle: The equal
right of every human being to the use of all that nature offers is
natural, inalienable and limited only by the equal rights of
others.</p>
<p>Streets, water systems, sewer systems, and other public services
are not offered by nature. The additions to the rental value of land
that these services provide are the product of the human effort that
goes into creating and sustaining them. Thus the increases in the
rental value of land that arise from them are not part of what must,
by the application of George's axiom, be shared among nations.</p>
<p>This distinction between rent to which all persons have equal
rights and rent that is properly the income of a particular community
creates a problem of assessment. To fulfill their obligations to
people in rest of the world, the people of a city must know what the
rental value of the land they occupy would be if the city were not
there. How can they know this? This assessment problem is formidable,
but not a reason to abandon the effort to achieve equal rights to
natural opportunities. In principle, the pre-development value of the
land beneath a city is the difference between the rental value of the
land when developed optimally and the annual cost of that
development. One might call upon city planners or the developers of
new towns to make such estimates. Even if we could not achieve
complete precision in such estimates, we might achieve substantial
agreement. It would be a great step in the direction of equal rights
to natural opportunities if each nation were to make a declaration of
the form, "This is what we believe to be the pre-development value of
our land, and of the land in the rest of the world, and this is the
basis for our belief."</p>
<p>What has been established so far is that adherence to a principle
of equal rights to natural opportunities requires payments among
nations to offset inequalities in the value of natural opportunities
per capita, that natural opportunities are exemplified by the
pre-development rental value of land, that significant difficulties
can be expected in identifying these pre-development rental values,
and that such difficulties are not a sufficient reason to abandon all
efforts to identify the pre-development rental value of land.</p>
<p><a name="IV. Applying George's Theory of"></a><b>IV. Applying
George's Theory of Justice to Some Other Connections Among
Nations</b></p>
<p>The pre-development rental value of land is only the beginning of
the natural opportunities to which all persons have equal rights.</p>
<p>Consider fishing in the oceans. If there were so many fish in the
oceans that the removal of some by the fishermen of one nation had no
detectable impact on the opportunities available to the fishermen of
other nations, then there would be no economic scarcity of fish in
the oceans as a natural opportunity, and the value of fish would
represent returns on the labor and capital of the fishermen, along
with some luck. But when fishing by one nation leaves noticeably
fewer fish for the others, the reduction in the value of fish stocks
caused by fishing represents an appropriation by that nation of the
common heritage of all, for which account needs to be taken in
establishing what compensation is needed to achieve equal rights to
natural opportunities.</p>
<p>The pie to be divided now consists of the sum of the
pre-development rental value of all land plus the depletion cost of
the fishing that all nations do. A nation is fully entitled to the
proportion of this total represented by the proportion of its
population in total population.</p>
<p>The same logic that applies to fishing applies also to the rent
component of the value of all things &#8212; the iron and other metals
in products of all kinds, the gold and other resources in jewelry,
the component of land rent in lumber, etc. Each nation's use of such
resources must be included in the pie to be divided.</p>
<p>Sometimes rivers flow from one nation into another. If the
withdrawal of water by the upstream nation reduces the value of the
natural opportunities that are left to the downstream nation, then
this reduction in the value of the downstream opportunities is part
of what the upstream nation appropriates from the common heritage of
all nations. The total value of the available natural opportunities
is maximized while also achieving justice, if all withdrawals of
water by both nations are charged at a price that equates supply and
demand, the money so collected is counted as part of the pie to be
divided, and land is valued according to the rental value it would
have if unimproved, considering the price of water.</p>
<p>If nations are close enough together that effective use of parts
of the frequency spectrum by one requires that others refrain from
using those parts, and if bandwidth on the spectrum is scarce, then
any recognition that one nation will have exclusive use of a portion
of the frequency spectrum should be accompanied by a payment into the
fund to be divided, equal to what others give up by not using it.</p>
<p>If geosynchronous parking spaces for satellites are scarce, then
each nation that has the use of such parking spaces should include a
payment for their market value in the pie to be divided.</p>
<p>When nations generate air and water pollution that reduces the
value of land in neighboring countries, these reductions in the
rental value of land become components of what the polluting nation
must include in its calculation of the value of natural opportunities
that it appropriates, while the recipients of pollution can make
corresponding reductions in the reported totals of the natural
opportunities they appropriate.</p>
<p>If scientists reach a consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases
must be restricted, then each nation should include its emissions of
such gases among the natural opportunities it appropriates, valuing
each emission according to the price that potential emitters would be
willing to pay for the right to additional emissions.</p>
<p>When we become aware of a global problem like the ozone hole
increasing as a result of atmospheric emissions of particular gases,
if any of the harmful activities are continued, the nations that
permit such continuations of harmful activities should include the
value of the resulting harm as additional components of the natural
opportunities that they appropriate.</p>
<p>In sum, all of the things that a nation does that limit the
ability of other nations to use natural opportunities are charges on
that nation's account. This includes claiming land, claiming
exclusive use of portions of the frequency spectrum, claiming
geosynchronous orbits, appropriating water in international rivers,
appropriating fish in the oceans, appropriating rent in the form of
the use of resources that are incorporated into goods, and any form
of pollution with international consequences. The axiom that all
persons have equal rights to natural opportunities implies that each
nation has a right to a share of the total of all such appropriations
equal to its share in world population. Any nation that appropriates
more than its share has an obligation to compensate those who have
less than average per capita shares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
  <a name="V. Differences in Ability and i"></a><b>V. Differences in
  Ability and in Wealth</b></p>
<p>Suppose that a nation appropriates only its share of natural
opportunities but is richer than other nations because its citizens
are, on average, more highly talented or harder working than the
citizens of other nations. Does justice require the richer nation to
compensate the others? By Henry George's theory of social justice,
definitely not! Each person has an exclusive right to his or her
productive powers. Therefore the nation as a whole has a right to the
product of its citizens' talents, no matter how greatly this product
exceeds that of the citizens of other nations. The citizens of a rich
nation may feel compassion for those who are poorer than themselves,
and therefore contribute to poor nations as a matter of charity, but
justice does not compel them to do so.</p>
<p>What about a greater income that arise from greater wealth? This
requires more elaborate analysis. When greater wealth is the result
of greater saving from the product of talent or from the product of a
nation's share of natural opportunities, then a nation with greater
wealth is fully entitled to the greater income that comes from it.
However, when greater wealth is the result of a history of theft or
of unjustifiably large appropriations from the natural opportunities
that are everyone's common heritage, then the nation that possesses
that wealth cannot rightly claim either the income from the wealth or
the wealth itself.</p>
<p>To achieve justice, the wrongful appropriations must be rectified.
The unjustly acquired wealth must be restored from those from whom it
was taken, or if that is not possible, shared among all nations. To
the extent that persons who are still alive received past income from
this wealth, that income must be disgorged.</p>
When George addressed this issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span>, he
suggested that all such past misappropriations be forgiven, that the
generation whom he addressed be content to receive their shares of
future rent. But the desirability of such a policy is a matter that
the dispossessed of any era must decide for themselves. Justice does
not require them to forego such rectification.<br>
<p><a name="VI. Resources that Fluctuate ov"></a><b>VI. Resources
that Fluctuate over Time</b></p>
<p>The natural opportunities that have been considered to this point
are ones that, to a first approximation, yield constant returns over
time. A new set of issues arises when George's theory of social
justice is applied to resources that yield returns that necessarily
vary over time. Now the issue of intergenerational justice arises
along with that of international justice. Consider first the issue of
intergenerational justice without the complication of international
concerns. The efficient use of depletable natural opportunities
requires that they be allocated over time in such a wayas to maximize
the present value of receipts from sales. As economists havelong
known, this requires that the price charged for depleting resources
riseat the rate of interest. But this is just efficiency. It says
nothing aboutwho should get the money.</p>
<p>The axiom that all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities suggests that when we deplete a resource such as oil,
there are two steps that must be taken to achieve intergenerational
equity. In the first step, when oil is sold we must share the
proceeds over generations in such a way that every person in every
generation can receive a check of the same real value every year. To
satisfy this obligation when the number of people alive in different
years is not proportional to the amount of oil used in those years,
we need to invest the proceeds of oil sales in a fund that would make
annual payments to all persons of a size that could be maintained for
all generations.</p>
<p>This first step provides intergenerational equity with respect to
oil revenue, but it does nothing about the fact that, if oil is
allocated efficiently over time, later generations will face a higher
price of oil than early generations. To provide equity with respect
to the changing price of access to natural opportunities, there must
be a second step that redistributes money among generations to offset
the changing price. For any pair of generations, the additional money
that people in the later generation receive should be sufficient to
compensate them for the higher price of oil that they face.</p>
<p>This second step implicitly assumes a world with no change in
technology. If an early generation provides a later generation with
improved technology, then the later generation is treated justly if
the combination of prices of commodities, technology and money
received from the earlier generation permits them to attain the same
overall level of satisfaction as the earlier generation.</p>
<p>This specification of justice presumes that everyone has the same
tastes. When tastes differ, an improvement in technology that more
than compensates some persons for a greater scarcity of some natural
resources will be inadequate compensation for others. Such inequality
cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>All that can be expected is that those who use exhaustible
resources will, by limiting their use and providing endowments for
future generations, make it possible for the typical member of every
future generation to attain the same level of well-being as the
typical members of the earlier generations of resource users. Success
in such an effort cannot be guaranteed. We don't know the tastes of
future generations. We don't know the rate at which technology will
advance. We don't know the rate at which new resources will be
discovered. Estimates of all these things must be made to determine
the proper rate of resource use and the proper endowments of future
generations. The most that can be asked is a good-faith effort to
achieve the standard required by justice.</p>
<p>Now consider the international dimension of intergenerational
equity.</p>
<p>What one nation can owe to others with respect to
intergenerational equity is compensation for making it more difficult
for the other nations to provide adequately for their future
generations. If all nations are using the same amount of oil per
capita, then no nation can complain about what the others are doing.
But if one nation is using more oil per capita than the others, then
it owes compensation to the others for making it harder for the
others to provide all of their future generations with equal rights
to natural opportunities. If oil is being allocated efficiently and
equitably among generations, the amount of compensation that an
excessively consuming nation owes will be the market value of its
excess oil consumption, valued in terms of the price of oil in the
ground. The same result is obtained if all nations include the
resource value of all oil that they consume, and all other depletable
resources, in the calculation of what they appropriate for themselves
from everyone's common heritage.</p>
<p>One of the ways that a nation can compensate other nations for
disproportionate use of natural opportunities is by creating
technology that other nations can use to compensate their future
generations for scarcer natural resources. If gasoline costs twice as
much but cars are twice as efficient, people are not, on net,
disadvantaged by the higher price of gasoline. This line of reasoning
requires contestable judgements about the value of new technology and
how long it would have taken before someone else would have made the
same discovery. Nevertheless, technological improvements are a valid
form of compensation for resource scarcity.</p>
<p>One issue that arises when technological improvements are used as
compensation is that not all nations place the same value on
technology. If some island nation wishes to maintain a way of life
that does not involve cars, then that nation cannot be said to have
been compensated for an increased scarcity of fish by increased
efficiency of car engines. What compensates a particular nation must
reflect the typical preferences of that nation.</p>
<p>Another troublesome issue with respect to natural opportunities is
that people have different ideas about which creatures are properly
treated simply as resources, and which deserve a higher level of
respect. When creatures are non-migratory, the right to control them
can simply go with the land they occupy, and bids for the land will
reflect values with respect to the creatures that occupy the land.
However, with migratory creatures such as whales and songbirds, a
different mechanism must be created to deal with desires to protect.
If nations representing 80% of the world's population want to protect
whales, then they should be able to protect 80% of whales. How such a
rule would be implemented in practice is a problem that I leave for
others to wrestle with.</p>
<p><a name="VII. Justice Among Nations with"></a><b>VII. Justice
Among Nations with Respect to Population Growth</b></p>
<p>If the population of one nation grows faster than the populations
of other nations, then in the future the citizens of the more rapidly
growing nation will be able to say to the other nations, "We
constitute a greater percentage of the world's population than our
forbearers. We deserve a correspondingly larger proportion of the
value of using the world's scarce natural opportunities." It would
not be just for the rest of the world to reply, "It's not our fault
that your parents had so many children. You only get as a nation the
same fraction that your parents got. You must each do with less."</p>
<p>This would not be just because the equal right of every person to
natural opportunities is not contingent on having had parents who
were not excessively prolific. The equal right is an equal right of
persons. But this means that at the earlier time when the population
was growing, the citizens of the less rapidly growing nation could
say to those of the more rapidly growing nation, "Your decision to
have a population that grows more rapidly than the world population
requires us to set aside a greater quantity of resources for future
generations, as their shares of depletable resources, and as
compensation for greater scarcity of land in the future. This cost
that you are imposing on us must be counted in the calculation of
your share of natural opportunities."</p>
<p>Thus the costs of differences in population growth rates are
counted in the calculation of compensation for unequal appropriations
of natural opportunities. Similarly, those nations whose populations
grow more slowly than average can claim a credit for their slower
growth.</p>
<p><a name="VIII. What to Do When Some Nati"></a><b>VIII. What to Do
When Some Nations Fail to Fulfill Their Obligations</b></p>
<p>The theory that has been developed incorporates all of the ways
that nations impinge upon one another by their appropriations of
natural opportunities &#8212;</p>
<ul>
  <li>through
their claims to land, natural resources, the frequency spectrum, and
geosynchronous orbits,  </li>
  <li>through their appropriations of fish in the
ocean, through their use of natural resources that are embedded in
goods,  </li>
  <li>through their emissions of pollutants that cross international
borders, including the ones that produce global warming and ozone
depletion,  </li>
  <li>through their decisions to have population growth rates
that differ from the world average, and  </li>
  <li>in any other way that nations
appropriate scarce natural opportunities.  </li>
</ul>
The theory describes what
nations must do to fulfill their obligations to other nations.
<p>But, you may object, how will unwilling nations be forced to
fulfill their obligations if they do not wish to do so?</p>
<p>The answer is that the theory is not designed to accomplish that.
The theory is designed to describe what must be done by those who
would like to fulfill their obligations. And universal acceptance is
not needed to permit the theory to work. In the first place, under
the theory only some nations have obligations. The others have
claims. Until a careful analysis is done, it is not possible to
specify which nations have the obligations and which have the claims.
Only the nations with obligations need to be persuaded to fulfill
their obligations under the theory, and these are likely to be
predominantly rich nations. Because the transfers depend on what the
recipient nations do, the recipient nations receive incentives to
economize on their appropriations of natural opportunities, even if
they do not agree with the theory.</p>
<p>But suppose that only some of the nations with net obligations are
willing to honor those obligations. How should the ones who are
willing respond to the lack of cooperation by others? By computing
their obligations as if the resources and populations of those
nations did not exist. All persons have equal rights to all natural
opportunities. If some natural opportunities have been improperly
grabbed by people who refuse to acknowledge their obligation to
share, then those who do recognize their obligation should understand
that they must all claim less.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they should do what can reasonably be done to deny
acceptability to claims of ownership based on excessive claims to
natural opportunities. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If some nation
appropriates the oil, diamonds
or other resource under the ground that it occupies without regard to
the rights of people in other nations, then the people in the other
nations should decline to purchase those resources, or products made
with them. To do so would be to purchase stolen property. </span>If
they
have a dire need for the resources, they should recognize the claims
of all persons to them by including the value of these resources in
their own calculations of what they appropriate from everyone's
common heritage. In this way, economic pressure would be put on all
resource users to acknowledge the equal rights of all persons to
natural opportunities.</p>
<p>What if a nation refuses to share the value of natural
opportunities among its citizens? A reasonable test of whether a
nation can properly be treated as the agent of its citizens and the
appropriate recipient of its citizens' shares of the value of natural
opportunities is whether the nation allows its citizens to leave. If
a nation does not allow its citizens to leave, then it is not proper
to treat the nation as the agent of its citizens. The citizens are
effectively imprisoned. We have no way of honoring our obligations to
them. We might put their shares in trust, but if they are not allowed
to leave, then we should not trust their government to use their
shares of the value of natural opportunities as they would wish. On
the other hand, if the citizens could leave and decline to do so,
then we are justified in regarding their continued citizenship as
evidence of their implied consent to the decisions of their
government about how their shares of natural opportunities will be
used. This rule may induce governments that would otherwise keep
their citizens captive within their borders to instead allow them
liberty.</p>
<p>Thus the proper application of a principle of equal rights of all
persons to natural opportunities will generate incentives for
increased compliance and increased liberty for all persons. It is not
necessary to have a world government that has the power to coerce all
nations to abide by a single authority's determination of what they
owe. Every nation can make their own determination of what, if
anything, they owe to others. Within broad limits people can accept
differing interpretations of obligations. If some nation exceeds the
limits of tolerance, other nations can reasonably respond by
declining to regard that nation or its citizens as the true owners of
the things they seek to trade. What is created is a diverse,
tolerant, and responsible international community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="IX. Justice Within Nations"></a><b>IX. Justice Within
Nations</b></p>
<p>Suppose that economic relations among nations are governed by the
principles that I have described. What would economic justice within
nations look like in such a world?</p>
<p>The first thing to be noted is that every just nation would allow
its citizens to leave, as an acknowledgement of the right of all
persons to decide how their productive powers are to be used.
Whenever someone exercised this power, the claim of his former fellow
citizens on natural opportunities would be reduced, and the claim of
his new fellow citizens would be increased. This fact would tend to
make the nations who were potential recipients of immigrants more
welcoming.</p>
<p>The freedom of individuals to move and the fact that those who
moved would carry with them their claims to equal rights to natural
opportunities would make it possible for a political majority in a
nation to justify its adoption of policies that were opposed by
minorities, not by a claim that because they were a majority they
were right&nbsp; <font size="+1"><b>&#8212;</b></font> a nonsensical claim
&#8212; but rather with the explanation
that they were simply seeking to express, with their shares of
everyone's common heritage, their conception of what a nation ought
to be.</p>
<p>This would not be a completely satisfactory explanation, because
if a majority changed a long-established tradition, they would
require the minority who opposed the change to either accept a change
that they did not desire or bear the costs of breaking their ties to
their traditional homes. But the only way to completely avoid the
costs of such dislocations would be to prohibit all change, and that
is not sensible. One can reasonably expect sensitive accommodation on
the part of both majorities and minorities
<font size="+1"><b>&#8212;</b></font> majorities not to disregard the
feelings of minorities just because they are a majority, and
minorities not to expect perpetual extension of the <i>status quo
ante</i>.</p>
<p>If a very sharp and deeply felt division of opinion about the
proper role of the state were to occur, then it would be sensible to
consider allowing the minority to secede. There is nothing sacred or
inevitable about any particular number of nations or their borders.
If a majority allows a disgruntled minority, who are a majority in a
particular region, to leave and take territory with them, then the
remaining majority will avoid a potential problem of underpopulation
and excessive claims to natural opportunity that would occur if the
minority were to simply emigrate.</p>
<p>When the people of a nation ensure that they do not claim more
than their shares of natural opportunities, and they permit any
citizen who desires to leave to do so, and they stand ready to allow
any substantial majority within a reasonably compact subarea to
succeed, then the people of that nation can truly say, "The laws we
choose to live under represent our conception of what a nation ought
to be. If you don't like it, create your own nation somewhere
else."</p>
<p>Economic theory can say something about the types of nations that
might be expected to emerge in such a world. As mentioned previously,
one would expect fewer barriers to immigration, since immigrants
would arrive with claims to their shares of natural opportunities.
This would imply that nations could expect to have greater
difficulties holding on to citizens when they had either laws that
people found oppressive or low wages. Nations would acquire more of
the characteristics of competitive firms. To attract or retain
citizens, they would need to offer citizens something close to wages
that equaled what the citizens were able to produce, and rates of
return on their capital that were close to the marginal product of
capital. In other words, taxes on the earnings of persons and on the
return to capital would tend to be precluded by the need to attract
people and capital. What would be left as sources of public revenue
would be charges for exclusive access to natural opportunities &Auml;
land, natural resources, water rights, fishing rights, the frequency
spectrum, etc., plus charges for activities that imposed costs on
others. We would see a world that approximated the one that Henry
George advocated, not as something that was imposed on everyone, but
rather as a competitive equilibrium among nations.</p>
<p>Would there be enough revenue for the public sector? To address
this question, one should consider different types of public
activities separately. The type of public activity that can most
readily be financed by charges for exclusive access to natural
opportunities is local public services. When these are desired by
voters and provided efficiently, they tend to raise the rental value
of land by enough to pay for themselves, since a local public service
provides a benefit in a limited region, and people will bid up the
rental value of that land by the value of access to the service. Thus
local services can be financed without even beginning to draw on the
value of opportunities provided by nature.</p>
<p>Another broad area of public spending is national defense. While
defense increases the value of land in a dangerous world, one might
reasonably hope that the need for defense spending would be greatly
reduced in a world that had adopted a general norm of acknowledging
the equal rights of all persons to natural opportunities. To the
extent that defense costs are raised when a nation becomes a more
attractive target by acquiring more capital, it would be efficient to
have an annual charge on capital <font size="+1"><b>&#8212;</b></font>
a property tax<font size="+1"><b> &#8212;</b></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>to defray those
costs. Between the possibility of greatly reduced need for defense
spending and charges on capital for the extra defense costs that
having extra capital imposes, it is reasonable to expect that defense
costs would absorb a small share of the value of exclusive access to
natural opportunities.</p>
<p>The next major area of government spending to consider is social
welfare programs <font size="+1"><b>&#8212;</b></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>welfare, social
security, unemployment compensation, health insurance, etc. These
would raise the rental value of land by enough to pay for themselves
only if appreciation of their value was so widespread that potential
immigrants would bid up the rental value of the nations that had
these program, or that had more extensive programs, compared to those
that did not. While one can expect some rise in land rent, it could
not be expected to cover all costs. These programs often have an
insurance component, requiring payments by potential beneficiaries.
If a program is so close to a true insurance program that virtually
everyone receives an expected benefit that is as great as his
assigned contribution, then no one will object to the program, and it
can be financed by the assigned contributions.</p>
<p>The difficulty with respect to social welfare programs comes when
those who design them seek to require some persons to pay for
benefits for others. In a world that recognized the equal rights of
all persons to natural opportunities and the right of any person to
emigrate, social welfare programs of this sort would be possible only
to the extent that they reflected shared conceptions of community. If
such a program draws on shared feelings of community responsibility,
then people will be happy to contribute their shares of the value of
natural opportunities, or even part of their earnings to such
programs. If people do not have these feelings of community, or if
insurance is desired that exceeds what people are prepared to pay for
out of a sense of community, then everyone will have to buy his own
insurance. And if those who are never able to provide for themselves
are to be provided for, parents will need to buy insurance against
this contingency before they conceive children. But I believe that
feelings of community are sufficiently extensive that those who need
help would receive it. Unlike the present situation, every person
would have a share of the value of the use of natural opportunities,
which would provide a guaranteed income that would take care of many
contingencies.</p>
<p><a name="X. Conclusion"></a><b>X. Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Humanity is emerging from eons of development during which
survival has been promoted by the ability to grab resources from
others. In recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that
taking from the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social
order that prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out
how to do it.</p>
<p>Some people think of preventing grabbing in terms of preserving
the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that were
acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status quo
commits us to defending the indefensible.</li>
  <li>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before which
unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and after
which they are reversed. A practice of allowing an appropriation to be
treated as just if it has survived long enough gives aggressors an
incentive to see if they can grab and hold on long enough. The result
is actions like Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only if we have a standard of justice that is independent of
history can we expect to end such actions. Henry George's theory of
economic justice &#8212; that every persons his a right to his or her
productive powers, and that all persons have equal rights to all
natural opportunities &#8212; provides a simple formula around which
opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can coalesce. This may
seem hopelessly optimistic. But no other theory that I have seen has
anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this theory.</p>
<p><b>The theory needs a simple name. I suggest calling this theory,
this perspective on social justice the Geoliberal perspective</b>.
Liberal for its commitment to individual liberty. Geo- for its
attention to land, for its planetary perspective, and for its
reliance on the ideas of George. If you like these ideas, I invite
you call yourself a geoliberal. I invite you to help me work out its
implications, to explain geoliberalism to others, and develop a
public dialogue about its value and implications. As Henry George
said, "Until there be correct thought, there cannot be right action;
and when there is correct thought, right action WILL follow."</p>
