<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">How Profit Shapes
Urban Space</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">by Jeffery J. Smith<br>
President, The Geonomy Society&nbsp; <br>
</div>
It was the lure of cold cash that drove urbanites out of downtown.
The usual suspect, the car, was merely a convenient ride. Despite our
present dependency on cars, the drive to profit is powerful enough to
bring people back.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Local governments have begun to modify
the profit motive. Rather than meekly pick up the
ever-rising tab for expanding the infrastructure, some
localities now charge developers a portion of this
cost. While this move may stymie development at the
edge, what&#8217;s needed is something to draw
development into the
urban core.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Without spending a penny of subsidy,
cities can make
urban renewal more profitable than
suburban
development. How is about as
commonsensical as
Einsteinian physics, but like "e=mc2",
it works. The trick
is to forget subsidies and lower one
tax while raising
another. That is, levy a tax or charge
a fee to collect
land value while eliminating any tax
on buildings or
improvements.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The present property tax works
backwards, like an
intruder from the anti-universe. It
increases as owners
improve their property; it decreases
when owners let
buildings dilapidate. "Save money,
create slums," cities
tell owners.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Some owners do keep prime sites
covered with parking
lots or abandoned buildings while
waiting for land
values to rise. "Good numbers are hard
to come by,"
notes <a href="../auth/Batt.html">Bill Batt</a>, former fiscal policy
researcher for the
New York legislature, "but easily a
quarter of a US city
is under-utilized." Thus
urban cores decay, an
entropy that seems
natural and inevitable yet
is policy-induced.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If the property tax is a
centrifugal force that
flings structures
outward, its opposite is
a land levy, a centripetal
force that pulls development inward.
To pay this
charge, owners try to put their
parcels to better use.
"Owners of the most valuable sites,
paying the most,
try hardest," explains Tom Gihring, a
Seattle-based
consultant.. "Since the most valuable
lots lie about the
center, it is the center which draws development." In-fill
happens.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The world looks different to owners
dozing at the wheel,
waiting for land values to rise.
Title-holders keeping
prime downtown sites vastly
underutilized "now pay
only, say, $25,000 per year in
property tax for a half
block," figures <a href="../auth/Gaffney.html">Dr. Mason Gaffney</a>
of
the University of
California at Riverside. "Post-PTS
(property tax shift),
these owners of parking lots and
abandoned
warehouses might have to part with
three times that
amount each year." At $75,000 per
annum, no longer
could they afford to let prime sites
lie relatively idle.
"They'll put their land to uses that
generate much more
revenue than does an empty building or
car-covered
lot," adds Gaffney. "They'll get busy
building
apartments, stores, offices, schools,
theaters, mixing
all uses together to maximize their
return."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Post-PTS, would these speculators
turned developers
find customers? Or would potential
customers continue
to set up shop and home out in the
cheaper 'burbs?
Many house-hunters are drawn to where
all the
amenities are in walking distance.
Many shopkeepers
locate where people walk about. Other
businesses
collect themselves close to their
suppliers and
customers. There are plenty of takers
for new
downtown development.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
At least that's what land values tell
us. Land values
merely reflect the desirability of
locations. The more
people want on, the more they must
pay. The lots that
people are willing to pay the most for
are the heart of
the city.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A computer model of Boston modestly
shifted tax
liability landward; the city
contracted by a half mile (Joe
DiMasi in The National Tax Journal,
1987 Dec.).
Johannesburg, SA, while taxing land
alone recycled
sites so rapidly that little
development was
leftover to sprawl onto
suburbs. The Northwest
Environmental Watch
calls this levy "the
sprawl tax."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As does nature, her
defenders might also
want to abhor a vacuum.
"Letting one city block lie
fallow means paving
over many suburban
acres," calculates Gaffney, consultant
to Alaska on oil
royalties. "Conversely, using one
block intensely means
many outlying acres need not be used
at all." The
biggest gain in saving suburban land
comes from using
urban land more efficiently. Hence the
Sierra Club,
Friends of the Earth, writer James
Kunstler, and a host
of others recommended the PTS, putting
this
cutting-edge reform on the radar
screen of mainstream
policy makers. In December,
Minnesota&#8217;s
Environmental Quality Board added
their voice to the
growing chorus.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This property tax shift (PTS) "helps
cities recover from
auto-dependency," notes Gihring,
author of The Journal
of the American Planning
Association&#8217;s first article on
revenue reform (1999 Winter). The PTS
turns lots for
cars into structures for people. By
densifying a city, it
provides more riders for mass transit,
justifying more
routes and times. As riding becomes
convenient while
remaining a bargain, and parking grows
inconvenient
while rising in cost, more people
switch from driving to
riding. Less traffic lets cities
transform streets for bikes,
pedestrians, sidewalk cafes, and
street performers.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Architecture, too, could blossom. As
car use wanes, so
might those keep-out-snout houses.
Frank Lloyd
Wright, who&#8217;d design around a
tree rather than ax it,
advocated de-taxing structures while
re-taxing sites.
This idea peaked about a century ago
with the
popularity of American reformer<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/About_HG.html"> Henry
George</a>. Today,
some Australian towns still do tax
land alone; they have
50% more built value per acre than
those that don&#8217;t
(Kenneth Lusht, Pennsylvania State
University).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Might the PTS work too well? Might it
spur edge-to-edge
development, leaving no lot unbuilt?
"While each owner
may want to build, the community may
prefer open
space and would buy the owner out,"
says Batt, a
retired professor. Pittsburgh, PA,
taxes land six times
more than buildings. The city
converted its most
valuable location, the Golden Triangle
where the three
rivers meet, into a park without
developer resistance or
an agonizing grassroots effort.
Pittsburgh also renewed
itself without federal subsidy and
enjoys the lowest
housing costs and crime rate of any
major US city.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In New York, the city council keeps
Manhattan&#8217;s Central
Park unbuilt not because Greens rule
the Big Apple but
because property values overall are
higher with the park
than with luxury condos on the site.
Land value is at its
maximum when land use is at its
optimum - mixed use
including non-use. Batt adds, "the
higher land value is,
the more revenue there is for public
benefit. Limiting a
locality&#8217;s funding sources to
land value puts
government squarely on the side of the
land&#8217;s health."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Despite the benefits of the PTS, it is
rarely adopted.
Giving up one's land value to
government is not an easy
sell. Nevertheless, during the '90s
the PTS did win a
few victories. In Allentown,
Pennsylvania (where 15
other nearby towns, including
Pittsburgh, have already
shifted their property tax landward),
voters passed this
shift into law overwhelmingly despite
an expensive
media campaign waged by the real
estate lobby. In
Mexicali, Mexico, the mayor persuaded
the landed
interests to accept a total PTS (zero
tax on buildings, a
far higher rate on land) and invested
the proceeds in
improving the infrastructure. The rich
got to be rich in a
more comfortable setting.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To shift the property tax in
Pennsylvania, it is not
necessary to amend the state
constitution; any town
can change its tax rates any way. In
many other states,
overhauling the constitution may be a
prerequisite. Or, it
may be legal for a locality to concoct
some sort of
land-use fee or raise the deed fee and
impose it
annually, similar to the fee for
registering titles to cars in
many states.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The bottom-line is on the side of PTS
backers. The shift
makes more winners than losers. Since
the PTS
lightens the tax load for a majority
of residents (most
residents do not own prime locations), proponents of
the PTS do have a huge pool of support
to draw from.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The minority who would pay more,
owners of valuable
lots, do put themselves in opposition
of the PTS. They'd
have to pay much more than the typical
residents get to
save and tend to oppose forcefully
while savers
propose shyly. Yet there are ways to
stoke the savers
and mollify the higher-payers.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
One way is education. Some owners of
prime
locations, those already carrying a
heavy tax load for
their built value, could pay less.
Those paying more do
get more for their money. 
<ul>
  <li>They get
zero tax burden on
any improvement. <br>
  </li>
  <li>They get a vibrant
economy in which
to conduct business. <br>
  </li>
  <li>And as the built
environment
improves and the natural environment
heals for the
formerly less fortunate, the prime
owners get to relax
amid lower crime rates and less class
tension.&nbsp;  </li>
</ul>
Still, it may be easier to pull the
idea of redirecting
"rents" than to push it, just as it's
easier for gravity to
pull planets than it is for other
nuclear forces to push
them. To create pull, reformers could
propose a
Housing Voucher, funded from a hefty
portion of the
collected revenue and good for rent,
mortgage, or
taxes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land value in many cities is
astronomical.</span>
Tapping it, a locality could fund
basic services, repeal
other taxes, and pay residents this
income supplement
from the surplus, much like
Alaska&#8217;s oil dividend (that
Gaffney consulted on). Being included
in the
apportioning of ground rent, residents
might be more
likely to warm up to the idea and urge
its adoption. And
the bigger the share, the stronger the
longing.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As land values rise, so would
one&#8217;s voucher, letting
even poor residents stay where they
love, and love
where they live. Spending the vouchers
on buying or
leasing land or improvements would
keep employment
high in construction, a mainstay for
many workers.
Thus urban advocates might ally
with
environmentalists, attaining a
critical mass for shifting
the property tax.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Housing Voucher also sweetens the
pot for the
middle class. Currently, in order to
tap their site value,
they must cash in and move out, or
take on a second
mortgage and go into debt. Getting
back a voucher
much greater than the land tax or fee
they pay in would
constantly recycle their community's
site values,
making them available in real time.
It'd be like cashing in
while staying put.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
While attracting some people, the
Housing Voucher
may help neutralize others. Builders
and owners,
accustomed to capturing land value for
themselves,
would profit as vouchers are spent on
real estate, the
source of much income for many
owners.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Although society may have a feeble
claim to many of
the things it taxes, land value is
precisely what society
should not forgo. It&#8217;s not lone
owners but the
community who generates this value by
its
infrastructure and its mere presence.
Leaving ground
rent uncollected constitutes a
"giving" that communities
and eco-systems can ill afford. Let's
wean owners from
socially-generated site values and
make urgent their
hunger, and they'll hunt up their own
built value where
it's needed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To use land wisely, her value needs to
be disbursed
fairly. Collecting land value while
removing taxes upon
buildings organically puts structures
where they&#8217;re
supposed to go. The PTS can do so as
long as we ride
this planet around the sun.
