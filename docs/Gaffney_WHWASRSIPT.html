</b></font><b>What happens when a state radically
slashes its property tax?</b>
<br>
&nbsp;Mason Gaffney
<p>an excerpt from a paper delivered at <br>
the Conference on Land,
Wealth, and Poverty; <br>
The Jerome Levy Institute, 3 November 1995</p>
<p align="left">Michiganders are saying they must wait and see, but there is no
  need for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To
  read your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened
  since California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.</p>
</center>
<p>The obvious direct results have been to cut public services, raise
other taxes, and lose credit rating. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Our school support fell from #5, nationally, to #40 in 1985 when
last seen, still falling. </li>
  <li>County road maintenance is down to where my county (Riverside) is
repaving its roads at an annual rate of once every 130 years. Once in
20 years is recommended here, and up north you generally need higher
frequency. You can't just build infrastructure and then stop paying for
it, it's a perpetual commitment. Thanks to urban sprawl, a high
fraction of our population now depends on these county roads.</li>
  <li>In 1978 we had a surplus in Sacramento.
    <ul>
      <li>Since then we have raised business taxes, income taxes, sales
taxes and gas taxes, but go broke every June. </li>
      <li>Now our State bond rating is last among the states. </li>
      <li>One of our richest counties (Orange) has gone bankrupt; </li>
      <li>Los Angeles is on the brink of it, saving itself by closing
emergency rooms and hospitals that serve as a last resort for the
uninsured poor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>The private sector is doing badly, too.</b> Raising income
taxes, business taxes, and sales taxes is no way to stimulate an
economy; they are all a drag on work and enterprise. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Our income per capita was down from #7 to #12 among the states by
1992, then fell some more. </li>
  <li>From 1992-94, California was one of three states where median
household income fell. </li>
  <li>Our unemployment rate is 9%, 50% higher than the national mean of
6%. </li>
  <li>Our poverty rate is 18%, compared to 14.5% nationally. </li>
  <li>Not surprisingly, therefore, the only government function that
grows now is building and operating prisons. </li>
  <li>One of our few rebounding industries is cinema, the art of
escaping from reality: we excel at that. </li>
  <li>Another thriving activity is that of auctioning off used
machinery for export to the east.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1993 there was net outmigration (including international
migration) from this state that has symbolized American growth since
time immemorial. It is unheard of. 426,000 people were lost, nearly
2% of the population. This is a watershed change: imagine of all
states California, America's trendsetter, our El Dorado, The Golden
State, our Horn of Plenty, the safety-valve for job-seekers and
retirees and entrepreneurs from everywhere, the end of the rainbow,
losing population! It's almost enough to make a person click off the
tube and think.</p>
<p>The fall of our income per capita is greater than appears from the
purely monetary measure. Real pay has fallen more, because of the
drastic rise of shelter prices. </p>
<ul>
  <li>In San Francisco, shelter takes 50% of the median income, with
many other cities, especially coastal ones, not far behind. </li>
  <li>It is unusual to find livable quarters for less than $600/mo. </li>
  <li>The median home price rose 163% during the 1980s, to $258,000
(remember that is just the median - the mean is higher). </li>
</ul>
<p>These rises are part of the C.O.L. of all renters and new buyers,
a part not fully incorporated in standard CPI measures (for various
unworthy reasons too technical to open up now).</p>
<p>Some cities are in desperate straits. San Bernardino in 1976 was
chosen an "All-America City, a City on the Go." It went, all right:
today, 40% of its people are on welfare.</p>
<p><b>California has always been earthquake country, but has always
renewed itself, routinely.</b> It was different after the Northridge
quake in the San Fernando Valley, January, 1994. This is the
upper-middle neighborhood of Los Angeles, but now large pockets of
ruined buildings remain, unreconstructed, inhabited only by vagrants
and criminals: an instant Bronx West. These blighted sections,
ominous portents, spread more blight around them.</p>
<p><b>It should give one pause. It is, however, if you think about
it, the expectable result of what the voters did.</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>They turned property from a functional concept into a sacred one;
from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce goods, and
pay taxes into a welfare entitlement. </li>
  <li>They rejected the concept of a tax on inert wealth in favor of
the rival concept of taxing liquidity and cash flow. </li>
</ul>
<p>The predictable result is to inhibit economic activity, and
encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.</p>
<p>We had a construction boom in the 1980s, but it was not wealthy.
It was marked by extreme sprawl, and extreme instability. Downtown
L.A. was to become a great new financial capital, but now has nearly
the highest office vacancy rate in the U.S., with of course a high
rate of builder bankruptcies. Speculative builders were led on to
overbuild, in part, by anticipated higher land rents and prices. This
Lorelei effect was magnified by national income-tax provisions luring
on speculative builders, but we have to ask why California fell
harder than other states, even with the object-lessons of the oil
states in clear view.</p>
<p>David Shulman tersely summarized the distributive effects of Prop.
13 as he left us for Salomon Brothers in Manhattan: "it breached the
social compact." Alienation is the result, and the Rodney King riots,
arson and looting are the results of alienation. True, the Watts
riots preceded Prop. 13, but they were part of a national epidemic.
By 1967 there were riots with arson and looting in 70 or more
American cities. The Rodney King riots were endemic to California,
and spread over a much wider area of Los Angeles than the Watts riots
did. The looters and arsonists were not all black, and the targets
were not all white, but mainly Korean-Americans who just happened to
be there minding their stores.</p>
<p><b>Conventional wisdom blames our bust on the end of the Cold
War.</b> Surely that is a factor, but as a causal explanation it is
too pat, too easy, and a-historical. Compare today with 1945. Los
Angeles' economy depended much more on The Hot War, 1940-1945, than
it ever did on The Cold War. Los Angeles' wartime boom had swelled
its population as no other great city, 1940-45. After 1945 the U.S.
pulled the plug on defense spending, more than today. Jane Jacobs, in
The Economy of Cities, tells us what happened to military spending in
Los Angeles after 1945. It lost 3/4 of its aircraft workers, and 80%
of its shipbuilders. It lost its military and naval overseas supply
and replacement businesses. Troops stopped funneling through. It got
worse: petroleum and cinema and citrus, its traditional exports, all
declined.</p>
<p>Pundits then forecast a regional collapse. Yet, regardless, Los
Angeles never collapsed, nor missed a beat. The wartime immigrants
stayed put here. They formed creative, innovative small businesses in
large numbers, giving L.A. its deserved reputation for having the
most dynamic, flexible, adaptable industrial base in the nation.
Besides exporting goods, L.A. also became more self-contained,
providing itself with more of the goods it previously imported. How
could this be?</p>
<p><b>1/8 of all new businesses started in the U.S. were in
L.A., 1945-50. </b>These were small, creative, flexible, and too
varied to classify. No Linnaeus could sort them in conventional
categories: the new Angelenos simply stayed here and started
producing everything for themselves, some things previously imported,
and others never seen before. Eastern firms established branch plants
here. Top eastern students came to California's great university
system, and stayed behind to make careers and jobs here. There was a
kind of regional "El Dorado Effect," as demand and supply grew
together, and growing local demand allowed for economies of scale
serving local markets. Food and shelter were cheap and abundant. Land
for business was accessible, providing a basis for the whole
self-contained phenomenon. A "continental tilt" developed in both
interest rates and wage rates, drawing in eastern capital and
labor.</p>
<p><b>Why is that not happening today, 1995?</b> An invisible,
pervasive change is <b>Proposition 13</b>, which makes it possible to
hold land at negligible tax cost. In 1945 land was taxed at 3% every
year, building a fire under holdouts to turn their land to use. Today
that same tax cost is well below 1%. Using <b>Gwartney's Rule of
Thumb</b> (see below under B,1), it is about 1/8 of 1%: a rate of 1%
applied to 1/8 of the true value.</p>
<p><b>Landowners are only taxed now if they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they meet the drag of our
high business and employment and sales taxes, necessitated by the
fall of property taxes. A handful of oligopolistic landowners control
most of the market; small businesses are squeezed out. This helps us
segue from being at the cutting edge of industrial progress to a
third-world economy - from the NH model to the AL model - with little
relief in sight.</b></p>
<p><b>What was different then? One obvious difference was the high
property tax dependence in 1945, and the lower burdens of sales tax,
business tax, and income tax. We not only had high property tax
rates, they were more focused on land then than now. </b>California
was more hospitable to Georgist thinking than perhaps any other state
then, shown by its long run of Georgist political action in the prior
thirty years. Several states had "single-tax" movements and
initiatives, 1910-14, but most of them petered out. In California
they continued through 1924, and then popped up again in 1934-38.
Even while "losing," such campaigns raised consciousness of the issue
to such a degree that assessors were focusing more attention on land.
Thus, in California, 1917, tax valuers focused on land value so much
that it constituted 72% of the assessment roll for property taxation
- a much higher fraction than today. This became the California
tradition.</p>
<p>In 1934 the "EPIC" campaign of Upton Sinclair included a strong
Georgist element - he proposed to set up new factories on idle land.
Meantime, Jackson Ralston was pushing a purer land tax initiative,
1934-38. Ralston lost, but the mere existence of such political
action in California, when the movement was torpid elsewhere, tells
us a lot. It reveals a large matrix of supportive voters and workers
to whom politicians (including tax assessors) would naturally respond
by focusing on land assessments.</p>
<p>California displayed amazing growth up to 1978, and the resilience
to shrug off the loss of war industries after 1945 and still grow
"explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we have a string of
reverses. The timing, along with a priori causative analysis, plus
various direct observations too numerous for this time-slot, support
an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13.
<b>Michigan, be warned of our lot, and learn about taxes from us:
"This Could Happen to You."</b></p>
