<p><a name="Rent rules"></a><b>Rent rules </b></p>
<p>To get rich, or more likely to stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </p>
<p>If we are to sustain our selves, our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency -- the compact city -- not waste -- the mall and
automobile. </p>
<p><a name="Past isms neither one or the ot"></a><b>Past isms neither
one or the other </b></p>
<p>Proposals to share rent have surfaced before - in antiquity by
<b>Moses</b> in the West and <b>Mencius</b> in the East. In the
modern era, the idea appears in a century cycle: </p>
<ul>
  <li>In the 1600s, philosopher <b>John Locke</b> questioned "the
'sacredness' of property". Biblical scholar Spinoza proposed public
ownership of land. Quaker William Penn and Pilgrim William Bradford
urged the shift from taxes to Ground Rent. </li>
  <li>In the 1700s, the <b>physiocrats</b>, which included Quesnay and
Turgot, Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine, advocated taxing only land. One
wise man, Mirabeau the Elder, called the discovery of<em> l'impot unique</em>(the single tax) as momentous as the invention of writing. </li>
  <li>In the 1800s Europe had <b>J. S. Mill</b> and America <b>Henry
George</b>, author of <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b> which outsold
every book but the Bible. Candidate for mayor of New York, he was
cheated out of his victory by Tammany Hall. George inspired most of the
real-world implementations of the land tax that some jurisdictions
enjoy today. </li>
  <li>In the late 1900s and early 2000s, the <b>environmentalists</b>,
including organizations like the Sierra Club, push the <b>Property Tax
Shift</b> from buildings to locations and the broader tax shift from
income to pollution and from production to depletion. Many more green
groups fault subsidies. A few even call for a dividend, a la Alaska's
oil dividend. Even some Libertarian groups have joined the chorus. It's
as if the issue of sharing Earth were nagging our collective conscience
(see our "101 Famous Thinkers on Owning Earth"). </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Public policy! Front and center"></a><b>Public policy!

<blockquote><i>(An earlier version of this section appeared in Rhizome,
newsletter of the Environmental Studies Association of Canada, 2001
winter issue) </i></blockquote>
<p>Drawing their cue from the public, governments tolerate
"rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land
values. Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the
economy, all governments -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to
stimulate development; they cut taxes and slop subsidies. Going
beyond the call of duty, the state excuses producers' their routine
pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting the cost of insurance.
Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or customer are not
benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this tilted
playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of
taxes, technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as
suppliers of materials, homes, food, rides, and energy. </p>
<p><a name="1, Materials - Extraction vs. R"></a><b>1. Materials -
Extraction vs. Recycling </b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Rent</i></b>: The light levy on the value of resources in
the raw, government vitiates that with depletion allowances. Plus,
government accepts under-market bids for leases of publicly owned
pastures and deposits. Getting to keep Rent makes extracting virgin
materials extra remunerative; recycling used materials, wherein Rent
does not even exist, has no such gratis profit. </li>
  <li><b><i>Taxes</i></b>: The tax on sales complicates business. One
must do extra bookkeeping or hire an accountant; an easier burden upon
entrenched firms than upon startups, such as a store to sell ap-tech
(the products that consume fewer resources) so every home can be an
eco-home. Being sneakily regressive, the tax nibbles away at would-be
customers' discretionary income. </li>
  <li><b><i>License</i></b>: The price of raw materials does not
include all the costs from the loss of habitat, other species, sources
of new medicines, the downwind and downstream costs from tailings, etc,
disadvantaging recyclers. </li>
  <li><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>: Government logging roads and way
under-market leases favor loggers and miners, not selective harvesters
and recyclers. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="2. Construction - Sprawl vs. Ec"></a><b>2. Construction -
Sprawl vs. Eco-City</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Rent</i></b>. This social surplus is why developers build
sprawl, not car-free villages. Rent, so-called "equity," is what
homeowners borrow against for a bout of consumeritis. </li>
  <li><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The property tax assessment is skewed toward
the building, away from the land, benefiting speculators and
developers, not owners. Localities often abate the tax for years for
developers and major corporations who sprawl on new campuses. </li>
  <li><b><i>License</i></b>: The price of new homes too close to
streams or on freshly cleared hillsides does not include the cost of
washing out the homebuyers or their neighbors.</li>
  <li><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>: Where new homes go in, localities pick up
the tab for new schools and infrastructure, saving developers $25,000
per home (Better Not Bigger, Eben Fodor, 1999). When people build on
floodplains and get flooded out, the federal government bails them out
(National Wetlands Newsletter, 1993, Scott Faber). </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="3. Agriculture - &quot;Mechemical&quot; v"></a><b>3. Agriculture -
"Mechemical" vs. Organic</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Rent</i></b>. Farm owners, by retaining Rent, use land as
collateral to qualify for loans to buy big-ticket combines and
irrigators. Retaining Rent also raises the price of land, precluding
poorer farmers who might try the less expensive organic methods. </li>
  <li><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The tax on income makes labor more
expensive, especially at the margin, where youths entering the
workforce would seek jobs in recycling, reforestation, organic
agriculture, and deconstruction (what better outlet for male adolescent
energy). Having to pay wages plus taxes on income and for social
security, bosses, including farmers, employ fewer workers. </li>
  <li><b><i>License</i></b>. The price of processed food does not
include all the costs from losses of soil fertility, bio-diversity,
collapsed aquifers, poisoned ponds, etc, disadvantaging organic
growers. </li>
  <li><b><i>Subsidies</i></b>. Price supports and limited liability
prop up mechani-chemical agri-business, not organic gardening. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="4. Transportation - Cars vs. a"></a><b>4. Transportation
- Cars vs. a Mix of Modes </b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Rent</i></b>. Not having to pay Rent to their community,
urban owners awaiting a higher future return under-use prime sites,
forcing development outward. Sprawl requires cars, displacing buses,
bikes, and people. </li>
  <li><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The tax on income makes capital less
remunerative, so a blue chip stock, not quite so visionary, becomes
more attractive than a risky new start-up trying to make money doing
good. A hybrid electric car or a fuel-cell light enough to power buses
and trucks begs for funds while a GM doesn't. Tariffs fall on imported
vehicles, which tend to be more fuel-efficient than their domestic
counterparts. Thus the market share of efficient cars is kept smaller
than it otherwise would be. </li>
  <li><b><i>License</i></b>. The price of gasoline does not include all
the costs from smog - damage to crops, lungs, buildings, etc -
disadvantaging bikes and buses. </li>
  <li><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>. Freeways, overly wide streets, highway
patrols, traffic courts, ambulances, and free military chastisement of
overseas suppliers that everyone pays for, not just drivers, pave the
way for car dependency, not an integrated use of bikes and buses.
Gasoline ought to cost at least $7.00 per gallon figures the World
Resources Institute (Green Fees, 1992). </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="5, Energy - Fossil Fuels vs. Re"></a><b>5. Energy -
Fossil Fuels vs. Renewables</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Rent</i></b>. By taxing, rather than living off Rent,
governments can afford to lose land to a dam or its value to a nuclear
power plant. Clean energy, on the other hand, would tred lightly on
land values, the proper source of public funds. </li>
  <li><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The tax on property makes improvements to
buildings more expensive year after year. Some states do exempt certain
ap-tech improvements, which amounts to a few dollars, but they also
grant tax-free bonds to utilities, which adds up to millions of
dollars. States make up its exemptions by raising tax rates. An
ecologizer may pay no greater property tax for solar panels, but like
everyone else will pay more to higher taxes on sales and income. </li>
  <li><b><i>License</i></b>. The price of AC electricity does not
include all the costs from inundated valleys, nuclear radiation, acid
rain, etc., disadvantaging safe power producers. </li>
  <li><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>. The federal government pays a billion
dollars a year to oil companies to pump oil back into the ground as a
"strategic reserve" rather than just leave it under Louisiana and
Texas. Cost-plus contracts benefit power utilities, not independent
solar converters. Rents, tax breaks, license, and subsidies total
trillions each year in the US. Destructive subsidies total $1.5
trillion each year worldwide (The Natural Wealth of Nations: Harnessing
the Market for the Environment, 1998, by David Roodman in The
Worldwatch Environmental Alert Series; he also suggests capturing the
windfall rent-jumps in settled areas.) Thus virgin extraction, sprawl,
mechani-chemical agri-business, gasoline car manufacture, and fossil
fuels look like bargains, making recycling, eco-homes, organic
gardening, mass transit, and solar power look expensive. Low prices win
over customers who string along investors. As long as the economy is
rigged against the eco-system, guess which one is going to continue to
go downhill? </li>
</ul>
<p>Henry David Thoreau said the best thing government can do for
business is get out of it. Nevertheless, some hope to shift subsidies
from grey bads to green goods. Yet the state need not subsidize at
all. It's dauntingly difficult to know whom to fund; a solar steam
generator may be the most promising idea one day while photovoltaics
are the next. Efficient alternatives don't need largesse but
fairness. A handout shields new industry from the forces that compel
efficient growth. The best thing government can do for the
environment is exit environmental enterprise. </p>
<p><a name="Rent rewarding eco-sense"></a><b>Rent rewarding eco-sense
</b></p>
<p>Now wipe out the taxes, subsidies, liability limits, and rent
retention. Instead, replace all that with running government like a
business. Charge full-market value for state acknowledgements (the
seven secret subsidies):</p>

Collecting rent for
government-granted privileges would not only raise trillions but also
whittle corporations down to a competitive size, less hazardous to
democracy.
<p>Besides charging what privileges are worth, government should also
replace license with responsibility ("internalize the
externalities"). To temper the temptation to use lands both fragile
and valuable, society could impose surcharges - an Ecology Security
Deposit, Restoration Insurance, Emission Permits, and fines when
users exceed standards. To minimize all these charges, producers
would seek sustainable alternatives. Getting and sharing rent from
land titles is the centerpiece of this geonomic revenue reform. Each
phase of such a revenue shift motivates sustainable choices in its
own way. </p>
<blockquote><a name="1. Get the rent."></a><b>1. Get the rent. </b>Having
to pay over rent to community makes speculation not worth the bother.
So owners use their land and resources more efficiently. Using some
land more intensely means using other land not at all. Plus, intense
use augments the housing stock, lowering the housing cost. Pittsburgh,
while taxing land six times more than buildings, enjoyed the most
affordable housing of any major US city. More residents are owner
occupants who choose to improve their homes, plugging heat leaks, etc.
  <p><a name="2. De-tax wages and interest."></a><b>2. De-tax wages and
interest.</b> Removing such taxes while collecting rent moves
investment funds in the opposite direction, from extraction and
speculation into advancing physical capital and hyper-training labor.
The resultant investment shift would accelerate techno-progress,
helping us get more from less. </p>
  <p><a name="3. De-subsidize favored produce"></a><b>3. De-subsidize
favored producers.</b> Besides giving lobbyists a reason to contemplate
a career change, abolishing subsidies would force producers to cut
waste, to call on all the tools and techniques extolled by Amory Lovins
and other green industrialists. </p>
  <p><a name="4. Pay out the rent."></a><b>4. Pay out the rent.</b>
Getting money for nothing, would people still pursue mindless
consumption of goodies or switch to mindful consumption of leisure? The
pressure to consume stuff for prestige should be lessened by the
increased equality in society. Everyone would pay in land dues equal to
the value of the nature they claim and get back rent dividends equal to
everyone else. These dues and dividends would narrow the income gap. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conserver ethic would have a context in which to grow, since
community is the crucible for morality. Stable neighborhoods put
Pittsburgh's crime rate on par with a small town, by far the lowest
in the US. Where residents become owner occupants, they participate
more in community, even adopt environmental values. Pittsburgh
converted its most valuable location, where the three rivers meet,
into a public park. Not bad for a working class town twice named
America's Most Livable. </p>
<p><a name="Ecological Economics, the only"></a><b>Ecological
Economics, the only economics </b></p>
<p>Noticing rent, realizing its social nature, accepting that it's to
be shared, and understanding that wages and interest should not be
expropriated, for most people that's a new way of thinking. Thinking
such thoughts leads to a new way of conceiving economics, too.
Ecological economics becomes not just a branch of economics but a
whole new discipline, needing a new name. In geonomics we maintain
the distinction between items bearing exchange value that come into
being by human effort &#8212; wealth &#8212; and those that don't &#8212; land. Keeping
this distinction in the forefront makes it obvious and
non-controversial that speculating in land drives sprawl, that
hoarding land retards Third World development, that borrowing to buy
land plus buildings engorges banks, that so-called "interest" is
quasi-rent, that the cost of land inflates faster than the price of
produced goods and services, that over half of corporate profit, says
the Urban Land Institute, is from real estate. </p>
<p>Summing up these analyses, <span style="font-weight: bold;">geonomists
offer a Grand Unifying
Theory, that the flow of rent pulls all other indicators in its wake.
</span>Geonomics differs from economics as chemistry from alchemy, as
astronomy from astrology. The acid test of any science is prediction,
a test that economics fails and geonomics passes. Plugging in the
land price cycle of 17+ years lets geonomists crank out predictions
more accurate than those generated by "the experts" who missed, for
example, the collapse of mighty Japan. When the land of the Rising
Sun was on the market for four times the assessed value of all
America, that's when a few geonomists, like voices in the wilderness,
countered conventional wisdom by proclaiming that the Japanese boom
would bust. According to these geonomic prognosticators, don't expect
America's next downturn for at least another five years, despite the
tech wreck or any other stock market fluctuations. </p>
<p>For real science, what works in theory must work in practice.
Wherever tried, to the degree tried, applying geonomics has worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Shifting taxes landward has broken up
rural land concentration,
prompted efficient use of urban land, spurred development, supplied
affordable housing, raised employment, lowered inflation, and
augmented income. </span>Check out the record in California,
Australia, New
Zealand, Taiwan, Denmark, Johannesburg, Hong Kong, and elsewhere (see
our "Where Tax Reform Has Worked"). </p>
<p>Geonomics draws its power to predict and fix what ails economies
by being grounded in reality. It holds to the notion that economies
are not apart from but part of the embracing eco-system. As part of
whole, economies self-regulate by the same natural feedback loops.
The prey/predator cycle is mimicked by the pricing cycle, also known
as the <b>Law of Supply and Demand</b>. This familiar pattern is
found, too, in the <b>Share Rent Cycle</b>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>(1)&nbsp; Getting more rent, people work less, so output
drops. <br>
(2)&nbsp; Less output lowers land values and deflates the rent-share. <br>
(3)&nbsp; Getting less rent, people work more. <br>
(4) More output raises site values and swells the rent-share. <br>
(1) Again, ad infinitum. </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, production is put into balance with consumption and work
with play. Geonomics yields a policy that's not at war with but
aligned with nature as model. Perhaps the most central feature of
economics is price. Price is to production what DNA is to
reproduction, the guides to growth. Rather than distort price with
taxes and subsidies, with license (so-called "externalities") and
rent-retention, geonomics respects the integrity of price, allowing
it to accurately reflect our costs and values, by sharing rent. Then
economies ("geonomies") can operate without the deadweight losses of
taxation and rent seeking. </p>
<p><a name="Clean break"></a><b>Clean break </b></p>
<p>While constituting a shift of the paradigm, geonomics is winnable.
It appeals to a broad constituency by being not left nor right but
green, neutral, and effective. Not only is shifting the flow of
public revenue winnable, it is doable at any level. In the locality,
for example, reformers can shift the property tax from buildings to
locations, as urges Sierra Club, Brookings, and a host of others (see
our "Green on George: 122 Notable Environmentalists on Taxing Only
Land"). With the collected rent, the locality could pay Housing
Vouchers to residents. And not only is some variant of geonomics

natural world. </p>
