<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Comparison
of George's Economic Theory of Justice <br>
with the Catholic Church's Social Teachings <br>
Concerning the Right to Private Property in Land</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">by Brendan Hennigan<br>
Ottawa, Ontario, Canada</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br>
<br>
Without diluting the difficulties that exist between the Georgist
position on private property in land, and the Catholic Church's social
teachings, on the same subject, there are some surprising similarities
between the basic principles advocated by both. Recent documents, in
particular those developed after Vatican II, are of particular interest
to the followers of Henry George. The Vatican II document "<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Pastoral
Constitution of the Church in the Modern World: Gaudium et Spes</span>"
(proclaimed 7 December, 1965), extended and defined the meaning of the
common good. The common good is that: which is the sum total of social
conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to
reach their fulfilment more fully and more easily.<br>
<br>
The document also emphasised that all created earthly goods were to be
shared fairly. This would include land, all natural resources, and
those things produced by one's labour. Pope John Paul II, was a
participant at the council and assisted in the writing of key
documents. He has first hand knowledge of the spirit of Vatican II, its
intent, and importance of the Church's role in the modern world. John
Paul II's social encyclicals renew and update the themes of the
economic, ethical, and social realities of "New Things", which include
a response to the worker question, poverty, and social injustice. John
Paul II was in an unique position to comment on these social questions.
He lived under two Totalitarian regimes: the Soviets and the Nazi's.
His pontificate saw the fall of communism or as he calls it "Real
Socialism": the political and economic system he experienced in his
native Poland. He is a renowned advocate of the dignity of the human
person, the rights of workers and the oppressed. What do the Catholic
Church and the popes have to say about land? Catholic social teachings
and John Paul II's encyclical letter <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Centesimus Annus: On
the Hundredth Anniversary of Rerum Novarum</span> (1991), are of
relevance to Georgists. Henry George's book <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Condition of
Labour: An Open Letter to Leo XIII</span>, published in 1891, was a
critique of the Church's first social encyclical Rerum Novarum. In it,
George severely criticised the Church's view that one had a natural
right to private property in land. He systematically exposed the
failure of the encyclical to address the true cause of poverty, that
is, private property in land. Also, in George's opinion, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Rerum Novarum</span> did not provide a
sufficient remedy for the eradication of poverty and other social
problems. George had friends and adversaries within the Catholic
Church. The tone of his writings reflect the respect he had for the
office of St. Peter. However, this did not stop him from thinking the
Catholic Church had got it all wrong. In fact, it inspired him to
broadcast his views on landownership, private property, and land value
taxation to a wider audience of believers. The purpose of the open
letter to Leo XIII was not to debate, but to define his own views.
Quoting from a letter he wrote to his son, Henry George junior: What I
really aimed at, he informed his son, "is to make clear brief
explanation of our principles, to show their religious character, and
to draw a line between us and the socialist. I have written to such men
as Cardinal Manning, General Booth and religious minded men of all
creeds."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
Georgist movement needs to do the same thing today. They need to reach
out to all men and woman of good will. The dream that Henry George had
of a more just society must not die. It may be obscured by time and
circumstances, but it is alive in his writings and the actions of
people who desire a better world, one not racked by poverty and the
misuse of God's gift to humanity: land.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
A century later the question must be asked. Is there some compatibility
between the philosophy of George and Catholic social teachings on the
land question. <span style="font-weight: bold;">My purpose is to
highlight Catholic social teachings in the areas of property rights,
the common good and justice. My proposition is that justice demands
that Christians and all people of good will put their differences aside
and look for common ground on matters concerning the land question and
poverty.</span><br>
<br>
Both Henry George and Catholic social teachings agree that natural law
and justice are the foundation of property rights. George was fervently
opposed to the concept of private property in land. Catholic social
teachings wholeheartedly support it. However, George and his principles
were never directly condemned in Catholic social encyclicals. This
leaves open the possibility of dialogue when considering land, economic
justice and the common good.<br>
<br>
I emphasise 'directly condemned'. It is true that Henry George believed
Rerum Novarum was written as an attack on his social and economic
theory. It could be argued, that since George's purpose was to
differentiate his theory of natural and economic justice from the
socialist model; the fall of communism may have actually helped his
cause. George was not a socialist and his adversaries do him an
injustice to class him as one. Today, Georgism must accurately define
its mission and insist that land reform, and the introduction of a land
value tax system, is neither collectivist nor absolutely
individualistic. It is a doctrine in accord with the Christian
principles of natural law, justice, and social development. In the
economic and ethical realities of landownership, George's guiding light
was the Golden rule "do unto others as you would have them do unto
you." It is a maxim that one ought to keep in mind in our discussion
today.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Catholic social teachings</span><br>
<br>
Three important points should be remembered when discussing Catholic
social teachings: 
<ul>
  <li>First, the Church does not offer any 'technical solutions' to
land management and taxation. No economic or political system is
specifically promoted. However, human dignity and the Church's ministry
must be respected at all times. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Second, the Church's way is not a 'third way' between
collectivism and primitive capitalism. Neither is it an ideology. "Its
main aim is to interpret [economic and social] reality" in accordance
with Gospel teachings. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Third, "the goods of this world are originally meant for all".
There is a "social mortgage" that needs to be taken into account when
considering private property. Land and created goods each have both an
individual and a social function.</li>
</ul>
The idea of a social mortgage, in relation to land, its use, and
property rights, has a familiar ring to Georgist ears. Was not George
advocating the same thing, with the collection of the economic rent,
with the expression in Progress and Poverty "give to the individual
what belongs to the individual, and to the community what belongs to
the community." The Church's preference is proclamation, rather than
condemnation. Similar to Henry George, the Church wants to show how to
do good and avoid evil. The arguments I make will be based on two areas
that are of mutual concern to Georgists and Catholics. They are: (1) <a
 href="#Natural_rights_and_Land">natural rights and land</a>; and (2) <a
 href="#Solidarity_and_justice">justice and solidarity</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="Natural_rights_and_Land"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural
rights and Land</span><br>
<br>
George and Catholic social teachings are in agreement that land is a
gift from God to all humankind from generation to generation. Equal
rights to land is based on the dignity of the human person. Work is
both personal and necessary. It is through land and work that one
provides for one's daily needs and wants. The universal destination of
earthly goods requires stewardship of and respect for God's gift. The
claim of Catholic social teachings is that individual rights must
always be subordinate to community rights. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">John Paul II writes in his Encyclical "</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">On Human Work</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">" the right to individual ownership or
property is not absolute: Christian tradition has never upheld this
right as absolute and untouchable. On the contrary, it has always
understood this right within the broader context of the right common to
all to use the goods of the whole of creation: the right to private
property is always subordinate to the right to common use, to the fact
that goods are meant for everyone.</span><br>
<br>
How one is to determine the rights to individual property and common
property is what seems to separate George and Catholic social
teachings. It may be one that is not insurmountable. Both believe that
it is by work that we attach one's natural right to property and that
is the way we can call a thing our own. For example, if I plant a crop,
build a house, or bake a loaf of bread one has a moral and a legal
entitlement to it. Does the same principle apply to land? Land meaning
the natural materials, forces, and opportunities of nature. Unlike
George, Catholic social teachings does not differentiate between
private property in land and private property in productive goods.
George says that private property in land is a violation of natural
law. Land is common property and private property rights cannot be
attached to it. Catholic social teachings is based on the fundamental
principle, as stated in Rerum Novarum, that while it is true that land
is a gift given to all, individual property in land (here the Church
means agricultural land) is in accordance with natural law. Rerum
Novarum and other encyclicals talk of the "inviolability of private
property" rights. But these rights are not absolute. St. Thomas Aquinas
says that the "world's resources" must be used wisely. Selfishness must
not impede the aim of the common good.<br>
<br>
<a name="Solidarity_and_justice"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Solidarity
and justice</span><br>
<br>
John Paul II identifies the justification for land ownership to the act
of work. In his 1991 encyclical <span style="font-style: italic;">Centesimus
Annus</span>, commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of Rerum
Novarum, he seems to be in agreement with George that land speculation
is unjust, especially when it deprives others of a livelihood:
Ownership of the means of production, whether in industry or
agriculture, is just and legitimate if it serves useful work. It
becomes illegitimate, however, when it is not utilized or when it
serves to impede the work of others, in an effort to gain a profit
which is not the result of the overall expansion of work and the wealth
of society, but is rather the result of curbing them or of illicit
exploitation, speculation or the breaking of solidarity among working
people. (ft.: see John Paul II's Laborem Exercens: On Human Work, no.
14, "Work and Ownership".) Ownership of this kind has no justification,
and represents an abuse in the sight of God and man.<br>
<br>
How are these abuses to be addressed? Those concerned about the impact
of urban decay and urban sprawl may see in John Paul II's observations
that land-use must take into account the needs of the community.
Especially, when misuse of land deprives others of work. Legitimate
public authorities have a responsibility and duty to guard the common
good. The principle of "solidarity" is one of the cornerstones of
Catholic social teachings. It has a twofold purpose: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) promote the idea of Christian
friendship and charity between individuals; and <br>
(2) fraternity between communities, both locally and world-wide.</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">George believed that land value
taxation is the way to achieve a balance between individual and
communal rights. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vacant city
lots</span> could be put to better use, for example, for affordable
housing, when the tax system limits inefficient land speculation. </span>Social
reforms which created better living conditions for the less fortunate
in society would be justified under the principle of 'solidarity'.
Modifying existing tax laws to emphasise the best use of land would be
compatible with Catholic social teachings. As long as taxes were not a
burden on any particular group or class.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Agrarian
reform</span> is also advocated by Catholic social teachings. The
Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace report: Towards A Better
Distribution of Land (1997), acknowledges the human and social problems
created by the concentration and misappropriation of land. This is
especially true in Third World countries, but does not exclude the
concerns of all those living in more developed countries. Again, those
possessing land must not view it as exclusively theirs: Section 23 of
the document reads:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The underlying nature of creation is
that of being a gift from God, a gift for all, and God wants it to
remain so. God's first command is therefore to preserve the earth in
its nature as a gift and blessing, not to transform it into an
instrument of power or motive for division.</div>
<br>
The report goes on to say that the possession or ownership of land
(private property) is not "unconditional" and it "entails some very
precise obligations". <span style="font-weight: bold;">Large land
holdings are "illegitimate" when they are "poorly cultivated, or simply
left uncultivated for speculation". It is morally wrong to deprive
people of the necessities of life and the capacity to access nature's
bounty:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;In
the social teachings of the Church, such <span
 style="font-style: italic;">latifundia </span>go against the
principle that "the world is given to all, and not only to the rich."
so that "no one is justified in keeping for the exclusive use what he
does not need, when others lack necessities."</span> (footnote: Paul
VI, Encyclical Letter Populorum Progressio, 1967, no. 23.)</div>
<br>
George did not believe that the equal distribution of land would
eradicate poverty. This being said, he was in favour of a wider
distribution of land. There seems to be enough common ground so that
Georgists and Christians can co-operate to achieve this goal.<br>
<br>
Henry George writes in <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Science of
Political Economy</span>: "The government of the universe is a moral
government, having its foundation in justice."<br>
<br>
George talks a lot about justice and how it is to be achieved. The
traditional definition of justice quoted by Catholic philosophers and
moral theologians can be found in the writings of Aristotle and St.
Thomas Aquinas. Justice is: "The habit whereby a man renders to each
one his due by constant and perpetual will." And goes on further to say
that: "Justice is the virtue of the good citizen."<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In Catholic social teachings, justice
is applied three ways: through communative, legal, and distributive
justice and all these constitute a social whole.</span><ul>
  <li>Communative justice governs the exchange between individuals and
where contracts are freely entered into with strict respect to one's
rights.  </li>
  <li>Legal justice is what the individual owes to the community.  </li>
  <li>Distributive justice is what the community owes to the individual.</li>
</ul>
George writes about justice in relation to natural law and social
progress. Tax is a matter of human law and would thus fall under the
title of legal justice. It is what the individual owes "in fairness" to
the State. A land value tax would be an example of this. A land value
tax is also linked to the distributive justice. The disbursement of
public revenues in proportion to one's needs is an application of
distributive justice. It is what the community regulates or owes to the
individual.<br>
<br>
An argument may be made that the present system of taxation is unjust
because it does not comply with the principle of justice. Communative
justice, that is, legally and freely entered into, and binding
contracts, is called into question with the payment of economic rent to
landowners. Is it a fair and equal transaction in relations to one's
rights? Or are your rights violated by the landowner demanding the
community portion of the economic rent. Distributive justice may be
breached when the community does not have the revenue to invest in the
social development of the community. A good many Catholic moral
theologians would most likely disagree with me on this, but it is one
worth exploring.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span><br>
<br>
Fr. Edward McGlynn of New York was suspended from his public priestly
duties for 4 years for supporting and advocating George's remedy. In
the first part of the last century Catholic moral theologians have
published articles and books criticising George and his "Single Tax".
Of note is the Swiss born Jesuit Scholar Father Victor Cathrein
(1845-1931) and American Monsignor John A. Ryan (1869-1945). But time
has dimmed the name of Henry George and this may be a blessing in
disguise. The demise of "Real Socialism", concern for the environment
and natural resource management, and the failure of governments to stop
urban decay, provide affordable housing and public transportation, may
create the atmosphere where Georgist philosophy is once again at the
forefront of social consciousness.<br>
<br>
Henry George had many Catholic followers, especially amongst the
working poor of Europe and the United States. Politically the "Catholic
vote" is still of importance in the United States, especially in a
Presidential election year. For example, a headline in the New York
Times, dated 20th April, 2004, read: "Conservatives Try to Exploit
Catholic Democratics' Views".<br>
<br>
The Catholic constituency does not have a united position on land
reform and taxation, property rights, or how to tackle social problems.
But the time is ripe for Georgists to promulgate their views amongst
those Christians advocating social justice for all. Gerry Barr, the
president and CEO of the Canadian Council for International
Co-operation, a coalition of organisations working in Canada and
overseas to end global poverty, wrote a recent article in "The Ottawa
Citizen" newspaper on development, charity, and poverty. He chides
governments and individuals for thinking charity alone will help
developing nations. He writes:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The problem isn't lack of knowledge or
basic skills but access to resources (be it fishing grounds or
equipment) or fair market system (to sell their catch).</div>
<br>
Access to land and fair markets are still important issues today. On
key principles Catholic social teachings and George do coincide. There
is still the difficulty of the concept of private property in land, but
this should not stop Catholic, Christian, and Georgist dialogue.<br>
