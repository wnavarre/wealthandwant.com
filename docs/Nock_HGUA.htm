<div align="center"><strong>Henry George: Unorthodox American
</strong></div>
<p align="center">by Albert Jay Nock</p>
<p align="center"><strong>I</strong></p>
<p>A depression was on in the year 1864. In those days depressions did not go
  by their Latin name as a rule, except when people wanted to put on airs about
  them, but were called by the simple English name of hard times. This streak
  of hard times lay very heavily on the Pacific Coast. It was aggravated by a
  great drought that burned up the grain crop and pasturage, and killed most
  of the cattle on the ranches. There was no business in farming or ranching,
  industries were closed down, and commerce was at a dead halt.</p>
<p>At this time Henry George was twenty-five years old, living miserably in San
  Francisco, where, after a long struggle with misfortune, he had set up in a
  small way as a job printer. He had a wife and child, and his wife was shortly
  to give birth again. He could get no work, whether at printing or anything
  else, nor could he ask help from any one, for all the people he knew were wretchedly
  poor. Long afterward, speaking of this period, he said that as things went
  from bad to worse &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;I came near starving to death, and at one time I was so close to
    it that I think I should have done so but for the job of printing a few cards
      which enabled us to buy a little corn meal. In this darkest time in my
    life
      my second child was born.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this event happened he had no money, no food, no way to provide his wife
  with any care; he was alone in a bare lodging with a helpless suffering woman
  and a newborn baby. In a desperate state of mind he left the house and took
  to the last resort of the destitute.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;I walked along the street and made up my mind to get money from the
      first man whose appearance might indicate that he had it to give. I stopped
      a man, a stranger, and told him I wanted five dollars. He asked what I
    wanted it for. I told him that my wife was confined and that I had nothing
    to give
      her to eat. He gave me the money. If he had not, I think I was desperate
    enough to have killed him.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry George had seen depressions before. When he was sixteen years old he
  saw one in Australia, where he lay in port for a month as foremast-boy on an
  old East Indiaman sailing out of New York for Melbourne and Calcutta. There
  he found times &#8220;very hard ashore, thousands with nothing to do and nothing
  to eat.&#8221; Two years later, in 1857, another depression threw him out of
  work in Philadelphia and sent him wandering to the Pacific Coast. After 1864,
  too, he was to be wrecked by still another depression, when the appalling hard
  times which followed the panic of 1873 broke up in succession two newspaper
  enterprises which had employed him, and he was once more set adrift and penniless.</p>
<p>Thus it was that the question occurred to him, why do these depressions happen?
  Why should there be any hard times? Nobody seemed to know. People took depressions
  as they took tuberculosis or typhoid, or as people in the Middle Ages took
  the bubonic plague, as something bound to happen, something that had to be
  put up with. They had always happened about once every so often, undoubtedly
  would always go on happening, and that was that. Yet in the nature of things
  there seemed no reason why they should happen. There was plenty of natural
  opportunity for everybody, plenty of everything that anybody could possibly
  need. The country was not poor and overpopulated &#8212; far from it. On the
  contrary, it was fabulously rich and had only a thin and straggling population.
  Nevertheless, every so often, with a strange regularity, hard times came around
  and vast masses of the people were left without work and without bread.</p>
<p>There must be some reason for this which no one had as yet discovered, and
  Henry George made up his mind that if he lived he would find out what it was.</p>
<p>Somehow he did manage to live. By one means or another he got over the peak
  of his greatest distress, and four years later, in the winter of 1868, he came
  from California to New York on an errand for a newspaper. He was then not quite
  thirty years old, and did not even yet have a dollar in his pocket that he
  could call his own. New York showed him something brand-new in his experience.
  Up to this time he had not been in a position to see any great show of inequality
  in the distribution of wealth. Life was simple in the Philadelphia of his boyhood
  days, and in the rough and new California of his youth one person lived much
  like another. But now, in the New York of 1868, he saw our western Palmyra
  in all the shoddy glory of its post-war period, and by all accounts it must
  have been a most dreadful sight, as repulsive as the pens of Dickens and George
  William Curtis pictured it. Shoddy riches, shoddy show, shoddy ideals and taste,
  shoddy people &#8212; and on the other hand, whole populations of troglodyte
  slum-dwellers living at an almost inconceivable depth of wretchedness and degradation.</p>
<p>Years afterward George said that here &#8220;I saw and recognized for the
  first time the shocking contrast between monstrous wealth and debasing want.&#8221; What
  was the cause of it? Again, nobody seemed to know. Like depressions and plagues,
  it was taken as part of the regular order of nature. It had always existed
  in large commercial and industrial centers, apparently it was bound always
  to exist, and it seemed to be just another one of the things that had to be
  put up with. There was no cure for it, so far as anybody knew. All that could
  be done was to take some of the curse off it by charity of one sort or another,
  and this was being done; in fact, it was beginning to be organized on a large
  scale, more lavishly perhaps than in any other country.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, George reasoned with himself, the thing had to have a cause,
  for nothing in nature ever happens without a cause. If that cause could be
  found, a cure might be found; but trying to deal with an effect without knowing
  anything about its cause would be mere fumbling in the dark. Here, then, was
  a second question, to which George pledged his lifetime for an answer. <strong>The
  first question was, what is the cause &#8212; not any superficial and apparent
  cause, but the true fundamental cause &#8212; of recurrent industrial depressions?
  The second question was, what is the true fundamental cause of the enormous
  inequality in the distribution of wealth?</strong></p>
<p>George succeeded in answering these two questions to his own satisfaction
  while he was still a comparatively young man. This was the only success he
  ever had in his life; whatever else he touched failed. His one success, however,
  such as it was, led him through one of the strangest and most remarkable careers
  ever achieved in America, or for that matter, in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>II</strong></p>
<p>In principle, as the politicians say, Henry George&#8217;s boyhood followed
  the course laid out by the storybooks that used to be written around the romance
  of American life. He did not exactly run away from school or run away to sea,
  but he did what came to the same thing. He served notice on his parents so
  firmly that they decided to let him have his own way. In the matter of schooling
  they perhaps thought it was just as well, for he seems to have been an all-round
  failure at any kind of book-learning. Between the ages of six and fourteen
  he tried his luck at four different schools, three of them private schools,
  and all of them first-rate as schools went in those days &#8212; and probably
  they went about as well then as they do now &#8212; but he was not worth his
  salt at any of them. He worried through the grammar grades, entered the high
  school, stuck at it almost half a year, and then struck his colors for good
  and all; he never had another day&#8217;s schooling.</p>
<p>He said afterward, rather austerely, that in his half year at the high school
  he &#8220;was idle, and wasted time.&#8221; He may have done so, but if he
  did it was exceptional, for as boy or man he was never shiftless or dissipated,
  but always a hard worker, with an uncommon amount of intellectual curiosity
  and scientific imagination. The worst of him was that he was hasty and impatient,
  and of a roaming, restless disposition which probably made his parents think
  that his best hope of getting any kind of discipline lay in the forecastle,
  and that since he wanted most of all to go to sea, it might be the best thing
  for him if they should let him go.</p>
<p>One matter connected with this period in his life is worth notice. When he
  was forty years old, he suddenly appeared before the world as the master of
  a superb English prose style, a style that very few writers have equaled. Everybody
  of any literary experience at once began to wonder where in the world he could
  have got it, and how, and when. His record was open. With virtually no schooling,
  he had been a sailor, a typesetter, a tramp, a peddler, printer, shopclerk,
  newspaperman, weigher in a rice-mill, ship&#8217;s steward, inspector of gas
  meters, gold-seeker, farm laborer. There was clearly nothing in any of these
  pursuits, or in all of them put together, to raise a man&#8217;s prose style
  to that high level. How did he come by it?</p>
<p>It is usually said that he learned to write by hard practice, mainly between
  1865 and 1870, and it is true that his actual career as a writer began in that
  period. But he did not get his style then, for he always had it. Scraps of
  a diary that he kept on shipboard show that he wrote the same clear, precise,
  and beautiful English at seventeen that he did at forty. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Wed. 11. I was roused out of a sound sleep at twelve o&#8217;clock
    to come on deck and keep my watch. On turning out I found a great change
    in the weather. The wind had shifted to N.W., and come out cold and fierce.
    The
    ship was running dead before it in a S.E. direction, making about eight or
    nine knots an hour. After keeping a cold and dreary watch until four A.M.,
    we were relieved. ... In the afternoon all hands were engaged in getting
    the anchors on the forecastle and securing them for a long voyage. The colour
    of
    the sea is green on sounding, the shade varying according to the depth of
    water, and a beautiful blue outside; and so very clear that objects can be
    seen at
    a great depth.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this, which any critic would pass unquestioned as having been written by
  R. H. Dana &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;The wind, which had been strong from aft the day before, during the
      middle watch died away and was succeeded by a calm until eight A.M., when
    a stiff breeze from the south sprang up, accompanied by shadows of rain.
    At twelve
      M. all hands were called to reef. While reefing the fore-topsail, the parrel
      of the yard gave way, causing a great deal of trouble and keeping all hands
      from dinner. It was two-thirty P.M. before our watch got below to their
    plum-duff, which had been allowed in honour of the day. The rest of the day
    was rainy,
      with wind constantly varying, keeping us hauling on the braces. Thus closed
      the most miserable Fourth of July that I have ever yet spent.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a boy of seventeen turns off such English as that, day after day, for
  his own eye only, no one should be surprised at what he does for the public
  eye at forty. It is not easy to hit just that blend of precision, clearness,
  simplicity and grace &#8212; let the reader try it. George never wrote a sentence
  that needed a second reading to tell not only what it meant, but the only thing
  it could possibly mean, or be made to mean. In this respect he stands with
  the most formidable champion of the established order that he ever had to face &#8212; Professor
  Huxley &#8212; and with all its force of clearness and precision, his style
  has also a grace of warmth and color which Huxley&#8217;s has not.</p>
<p>But as George himself would have said, a man&#8217;s style must come from
  somewhere, it must have a cause. A person is not simply born knowing how to
  do that sort of thing. More probably he got it from the kind of English that
  he was brought up to hear and speak at home, and from his familiarity with
  the English of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. Such of the family&#8217;s
  letters as exist are extremely well written, and his schoolmates and cronies &#8212; Bishop
  Henry C. Potter and his brother, Bishop Horstmann, James Morgan Hart, Doctor
  R. Heber Newton and his brother &#8212; were certainly bred to have a decent
  respect for their native tongue, so in all probability George heard excellent
  English from his infancy. His father was a vestryman of old St. Paul&#8217;s,
  who brought up his children in the strict ways of old-style Evangelical Protestantism,
  with the result that Henry seems to have known the King James Version practically
  by heart, so that his own English may have been modeled, more or less consciously,
  on its narrative style.</p>
<p>He went to sea in April, 1855, and his voyage on the Hindoo lasted a year
  and two months. She was an old wooden affair of 600 tons, in none too good
  shape, bought second-hand for a kind of tramp service after twenty-five years
  of hard wear and tear as an East Indiaman. She went out of New York in lumber
  for Melbourne. The record is that she carried half a million feet, which seems
  close to an overload for a ship of her tonnage &#8212; an awkward cargo, at
  any rate. She took a deal of tinkering, as the passage just quoted from George&#8217;s
  journal shows. Before she was a week out her tiller broke in half, rotted at
  the core, but fortunately the sea was calm enough to let the crew fix tackles
  on the rudder to steer by, while the carpenter rigged a new gear. Except for
  incidents like this, and a few days&#8217; stretch of heavy weather in the
  Indian Ocean, the voyage was uneventful, enabling George to learn the sailor&#8217;s
  trade in as easy circumstances, probably, as he could have had. His captain
  seems to have been a very good sort, who saw to it that the crew got as decent
  treatment as the state of the ship allowed.</p>
<p>George did not go ashore much, though the Hindoo lay off Melbourne nearly
  a month. He looked the town over once, and did not care for it. This was three
  years after the gold rush of 1852, and a &#8220;readjustment&#8221; had set
  in &#8212; in plain language, hard times &#8212; which made everything look
  down at the heel. All the people he saw were poor, idle, and dejected. Calcutta
  also disappointed him. He did his duty by the scenery up the river, finding
  it very fine, and he took in the features of native life that seemed quaint
  to an American eye, the bamboo huts, home-made earthenware, the strange shape
  of the river-boats, some of which, he wrote, &#8220;had sails to help them
  along, in which there were more holes than threads.&#8221; He noticed the handsome
  country residences of the rich English living on both sides of the river, and
  also, by way of contrast, the number of corpses floating downstream in all
  stages of decomposition, covered with obscene black birds picking them to pieces. &#8220;The
  first one I saw filled me with horror and disgust,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;but
  like the natives, you soon cease to pay any attention to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Altogether it was not quite the India that a boy dreams of at a distance.
  He found it, as he afterwards said, &#8220;a land where the very carrion birds
  are more sacred than human life.&#8221; A brief look at things ashore was enough
  for him, and when the Hindoo had got her thousand tons of rice aboard, he was
  glad to leave the land and go back on the open sea. He had sailor&#8217;s blood
  in his veins, by his father&#8217;s side of the family, two generations back,
  which may have given him something of the true sailor&#8217;s virtuoso spirit.
  At the end of a year&#8217;s voyage, although looking forward eagerly to seeing
  his family and friends in Philadelphia, he wrote in his journal, &#8220;Oh,
  that I had it to go over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sea was not through with him, however. After the reunion with his people
  was over, the next thing was to cast about for something to do. His father
  got him a place with a printing firm to learn typesetting, where he stayed
  nine months, long enough to become a good journeyman compositor, and then quit
  in consequence of a row with his foreman. He had an offer from another firm,
  but the pay was nothing worth thinking of, and he did not take it. The depression
  of 1857 was coming on, and the few employers who had a place open were offering
  sweatshop terms. Finding that there was simply nothing doing in Philadelphia,
  he went to Boston, working his way on a topmast schooner that carried coal.
  There was nothing doing there either; so, on his return, attracted by reports
  of the fortunes being made on the Pacific Coast, he shipped on the lighthouse
  tender &quot;Shubrick,&quot; which was going on the long voyage around the
  foot of South America, for service out of San Francisco.</p>
<p>While learning his new trade of typesetting in Philadelphia, he took lessons
  at night in penmanship and bookkeeping, with useful results. When his handwriting
  was fully formed, it was small and highly characteristic, but very clear and
  neat. Part of his father&#8217;s idea in having him learn to set type was to
  improve his spelling. Like some other great writers, notably <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Count
  Tolstoy</a>,
  he could not spell. This branch of the mechanics of writing seems to call for
  some obscure kind of natural gift or aptitude, which George never had. He thought
  typesetting helped him a little, but it could not have helped him much, for
  he misspelled even the commonest words all his life.</p>
<p>While he was working at the case, too, there happened one of those trivial
  incidents that turn out to be important in setting the course of one&#8217;s
  life. He heard an old printer say that in a new country wages are always high,
  while in an old country they are always low. George was struck by this remark
  and on thinking it over, he saw that it was true. Wages were certainly higher
  in the United States than in Europe, and he remembered that they were higher
  in Australia than in England. More than this, they were higher in the newer
  parts than in the older parts of the same country &#8212; higher in Oregon
  and California, for instance, than in New York and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>George used to say that this was the first little puzzle in political economy
  that ever came his way. He did not give it any thought until long after; in
  fact, he says he did not begin to think intently on any economic subject until
  conditions in California turned his mind that way. When finally he did so,
  however, the old printer&#8217;s words came back to him as a roadmark in his
  search for the cause of industrial depressions, and the cause of inequality
  in the distribution of wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>III</strong></p>
<p>Like all those who anticipated Horace Greeley&#8217;s classic advice to young
  men, Henry George went west for quick money and plenty of it. He had no notion
  of mining, but of prospecting; that is to say, his idea was not to work a mine,
  but to pick up mineral land, and then either sell it or have it worked on shares
  with somebody who would do the actual mining. In short, as he would have phrased
  it in later years, his idea was to make his fortune by appropriating the economic
  rent of natural resources, rather than by applying labor to them.</p>
<p>But there were too many ahead of him who had the same idea. Although the mineral
  region of California is as large as the British Isles, he found that these
  lively brethren had pre-empted every foot of it. He tried Oregon with no better
  luck, living meanwhile as best he could, by all sorts of expedients &#8212; farm
  work, tramping, storekeeping, peddling &#8212; and when he finally went back
  to his trade, he did it as only another makeshift, for the vision of sudden
  wealth still haunted him. In a letter to his sister he says that in a dream
  the night before he was &#8220;scooping treasure out of the earth by handfuls,
  almost delirious with the thoughts of what I would now be able to do, and how
  happy we would all be;&#8221; and he adds wistfully that he supposes he dreamed
  all this as starving men dream of splendid feasts, or as desert wanderers dream
  of brooks and fountains.</p>
<p>His trade kept him only very precariously, for times were not easy even then,
  and there was no great demand for printing or printers. He got a job with one
  newspaper, then with a second, where, he says, &#8220;I worked until my clothes
  were in rags and the toes of my shoes were out. I slept in the office and did
  the best I could to economize, but finally I ran in debt thirty dollars for
  my board bill.&#8221; He left this job and went adrift again; and then, with
  no work, no prospects, and with but one piece of money in his pocket, he made
  a runaway match with a young Australian girl named Annie Fox.</p>
<p>They married not wisely &#8212; there is no doubt about that &#8212; but wonderfully
  well, for their marriage appears to have remained perfect until his death in
  1897 dissolved it. Balzac called attention to a little-known truth when he
  said that &#8220;a great love is a masterpiece of art,&#8221; and there are
  probably about as few really first-rate artists in this field as in any other.
  Moreover, a masterpiece in this field of art must be a collaboration, and the
  chance of two first-rate artists finding each other is extremely small, practically
  a matter of pure luck. A Daphnis in any age may wander over the whole earth
  without meeting a Chloe, and a Cynthia may survey whole legions of men and
  never see a Claudius. George&#8217;s meeting with his wife was almost the only
  piece of sheer good luck he ever had, but it was a great one. On the night
  of the twelfth of October, 1883, he wrote this note, and put it by her bedside
  for her to find next morning:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;It is twenty-three years ago tonight since we first met, I only a month
    or two older than Harry, and you not much older than our Jen. For twenty-three
    years we have been closer to each other than to anyone else in the world, and
    I think we esteem each other more and love each other better than when we first
    began to love. You are now &#8216;fat, fair and forty,&#8217; and to me the
    mature woman is handsomer and more lovable than the slip of a girl whom twenty-three
    years ago I met without knowing that my life was to be bound up with hers.
    We are not rich &#8212; so poor just now, in fact, that all I can give you
    on this anniversary is a little love-letter &#8212; but there is no one we
    can afford to envy, and in each other&#8217;s love we have what no wealth
    could compensate for. And so let us go on, true and loving, trusting in Him
    to carry
    us farther who has brought us so far with so little to regret.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>George kept to his trade, since nothing that looked more lucrative turned
  up, and after his starving-time of 1864 he began to make a little better living
  as a printer, though not much better, and he also began to consolidate some
  sort of position in San Francisco. No sooner was he fairly launched, however,
  than he threw his future to the winds by enlisting in a filibustering expedition
  to help out the Mexican patriots who were fighting the French emperor&#8217;s
  ill-fated scheme for setting up a vassal empire in Mexico, with the Austrian
  Archduke Maximilian on the throne. The expedition was a comic-opera affair,
  planned in a fashion that amounted to piracy, and Providence certainly stood
  at George&#8217;s elbow when the Federal authorities put a stop to it before
  it got under way.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with this grotesque performance, George immediately went into
  another. He took part in organizing the Monroe League, which was to father
  a second crusade into Mexico. The league had an elaborate ritual which might
  have been got up by Gilbert and Sullivan, swearing in its members on a naked
  sword and the republican flag of Mexico; and Mrs. George, poor soul! was sworn
  in as the only woman member. One wonders what she really thought of it. The
  league shortly perished of inanition without having done anything, and George
  made no further efforts in behalf of the afflicted Mexicans.</p>
<p>These two incidents reveal the one defect in George&#8217;s natural endowment,
  which in spite of his superb gifts, his prominence, and his apparent influence
  over a large and enthusiastic public, made him in the long run ineffectual.
  He was unquestionably one of the three or four great constructive statesmen
  of the nineteenth century, perhaps of any century &#8212; he ranks with Turgot.
  His character was unmatched in the whole public life of his period. He was
  nobly serious, grandly courageous, and so sincere as to force even his enemies,
  of whom he had many, to speak well of him. He had great brilliance, some wit,
  and the command of a fine irony; but he had absolutely no humor. He was as
  humorless as Oliver Cromwell, a born crusader of the Old Testament type, convinced
  that he had an Old Testament mission to hew Agag in pieces. All his life he
  had labored under the unhumorous man&#8217;s inability to learn what none of
  us probably enjoys learning, that Truth is a cruel flirt, and must be treated
  accordingly. Court her abjectly, and she will turn her back; feign indifference,
  and she will throw herself at you with a coaxing submission. Try to force an
  acquaintance &#8212; try to make her put on her company manners for a general
  public &#8212; and she will revolt them like an ugly termagant; let her take
  her own way and her own time, and she will show all her fascinations to every
  one who has eyes to see them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>IV</strong></p>
<p>George now committed himself to newspaper work, moving from paper to paper
  in all kinds of capacities, from typesetter to editor and part owner, and by
  1868 he had become prosperous enough to start a bank account. His editorial
  career was very spirited; he was in one row or another all the time, and while
  it may be said that in his treatment of State and local grievances he was on
  the popular side, he always lost. He made things lively for the Associated
  Press news <a href="../themes/Monopoly_Oligopoly.html">monopoly</a>, but though he got an anti-monopoly bill through the legislature,
  all that happened was that the monopoly broke his paper. He fought the Wells-Fargo
  express monopoly, and lost again &#8212; too much money against him. He attacked
  the Central Pacific&#8217;s <a href="../themes/Subsidies.html">subsidies</a>, and ran for the Assembly as a Democrat
  on that issue, but again there was too much money on the other side &#8212; the
  Democrats lost, the Central Pacific quickly bought up his paper, merged it
  with another, and George was out.</p>
<p>So it went. Every turn of public affairs brought up the old haunting questions.
  Even here in California he was now seeing symptoms of the same inequality that
  had oppressed him in New York. &#8220;Bonanza kings&#8221; were coming to the
  front, and four ex-shopkeepers of Sacramento, Stanford, Crocker, Huntington,
  and Hopkins, were laying up immense fortunes out of the Central Pacific. The
  <a href="../HG/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">railway</a> was bringing in population and commodities, which everybody thought
  was a good thing all round, yet wages were going down, exactly as the old printer
  in Philadelphia had said, and the masses were growing worse off instead of
  better.</p>
<p>About this matter of wages, George had had other testimony besides the old
  printer&#8217;s. On his way to Oregon a dozen years before, he fell in with
  a lot of miners who were talking about the Chinese, and ventured to ask what
  harm the Chinese were doing as long as they worked only the cheap diggings. &#8220;No
  harm now,&#8221; one of the miners said, &#8220;but wages will not always be
  as high as they are today in California. <a href="../themes/Population_Growth.html">As
  the country grows, as people come in, wages will go down</a>, and some day or other white people will be glad to
  get those diggings that the Chinamen are working.&#8221; George said that this
  idea, coming on top of what the printer had said, made a great impression on
  him &#8212; the idea that &#8220;<a href="../themes/Progress.html">as the
  country grew in all that we are hoping that it might grow</a>, the condition of those who had to work for their living
  must become, not better, but worse.&#8221; Yet in the short space of a dozen
  years this was precisely what was taking place before his own eyes.</p>
<p>Still, though his two great questions became more and more pressing, he could
  not answer them. His thought was still inchoate. He went around and around
  his ultimate answer, like somebody fumbling after something on a table in the
  dark, often actually touching it without being aware that it was what he was
  after. Finally it came to him in a burst of true Cromwellian or Pauline drama
  out of &#8220;the commonplace reply of a passing teamster to a commonplace
  question.&#8221; One day in 1871 he went for a horseback ride, and as he stopped
  to rest his horse on a rise overlooking San Francisco Bay &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;I asked a passing teamster, for want of something better to say, what
    land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing so far off that they
    looked like mice, and said, &#8217;I don&#8217;t know exactly, but there is
    a man over there who will sell some land for a thousand dollars an acre.&#8217; Like
    a flash it came over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty with
    advancing wealth. <a href="../themes/Population_Growth.html">With the growth
    of population</a>, land grows in value, and
    the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there it was. Why had wages suddenly shot up so high in California in
  1849 that cooks in the restaurants of San Francisco got $500 a month? The reason
  now was simple and clear. It was because the placer mines were found on <a href="../themes/Land_Common_Property.html">land
  that did not belong to anybody</a>. Any one could go to them and work them without
  having to pay an owner for the privilege. If the lands had been owned by somebody,
  it would have been land-values instead of wages that would have so suddenly
  shot up.</p>
<p>Exactly this was what had taken place on these grazing lands overlooking San
  Francisco Bay. The Central Pacific meant to make its terminus at Oakland, the
  increased population would need the land around Oakland to settle on, and land
  values had jumped up to a thousand dollars an acre. Naturally, then, George
  reasoned, the more public improvements there were, the better the transportation
  facilities, the larger the population, the more industry and commerce &#8212; the
  more of everything that makes for &#8220;prosperity&#8221; &#8212; the more
  would land values tend to rise, and the more would wages and interest tend
  to fall.</p>
<p>George rode home thoughtful, translating the teamster&#8217;s commonplace
  reply into the technical terms of economics. He reasoned that there are <a href="../themes/Three-Factor_Economics.html">three
  factors in the production of wealth</a>, and only three: natural resources, labor,
  and capital. When natural resources are unappropriated, obviously the whole
  yield of production is divided into wages, which go to labor, and interest,
  which goes to capital. But when they are appropriated, production has to carry
  a third charge &#8212; <a href="../themes/Rent.html">rent</a>. Moreover, wages and interest, when there is no
  rent, are regulated strictly by free competition; but rent is a monopoly-charge,
  and hence is always &#8220;all the traffic will bear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, then, since <a href="../themes/Natural_Resources.html">natural resource
    values</a> are purely social in their origin,
  created by the community, should not rent go to the community rather than to
  the Individual? <a href="../themes/Untaxing.html">Why tax industry and enterprise
  at all</a> &#8212; why not just
  charge rent? There would be no need to interfere with the private ownership
  of natural resources. Let a man own all of them he can get his hands on, and
  make as much out of them as he may, untaxed; but let him pay the community
  their annual rental value, determined simply by what other people would be
  willing to pay for the use of the same holdings. George could see justification
  for wages and interest, on the ground of natural right; and for private ownership
  of natural resources, on the ground of public policy; but he could see none
  for the private appropriation of economic rent. In his view it was sheer <a href="../themes/Theft.html">theft</a>.
  If he was right, then it also followed that as long as economic rent remains
  unconfiscated, <a href="../themes/Piracy.html">the taxation of industry and
  enterprise is pure highwaymanry</a>,
  especially <a href="../themes/Tariffs.html">tariff</a> taxation, for this virtually delegates the government&#8217;s
  taxing power to private persons.</p>
<p>George worked out these ideas in a tentative way in a forty-eight page pamphlet
  with the title, &#8220;<em>Our Land and Land Policy, National and State</em>,&#8221; which
  did not reach many readers, but added something to his reputation as a tribune
  of the people. The subject mulled in his mind through five years of newspaper
  work, at the end of which he lost his paper and was once more on the ragged
  edge. He had begun a magazine article on the cause of industrial depressions,
  but was dissatisfied with it &#8212; one could do nothing with the topic in
  so little space. What was needed was a solid treatise which should recast the
  whole science of political economy.</p>
<p>He felt that he could write this treatise, but how were he and his family
  to live meanwhile? He had used his influence on the Democratic side in the
  last State campaign, and had been particularly instrumental in selecting the
  governor; so he wrote to Governor Irwin, asking him &#8220;to give me a place
  where there was little to do and something to get, so that I could devote myself
  to some important writing.&#8221; The governor gave him the State inspectorship
  of gas meters, which was a moderately well-paid job, and a sinecure. This was
  in January, 1876; and in March, 1879, he finished the manuscript of a book
  entitled <em><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty: an Inquiry Into the Cause of Industrial
  Depressions, and of Increase of Want With Increase of Wealth; the Remedy</a></em><a href="../George_P&P.html">.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>V</strong></p>
<p>No one would publish the book, not so much because it was revolutionary (though
  one firm objected to it emphatically on that ground) but because it was a bad
  prospect. No work on political economy, aside from textbooks, had ever sold
  well enough either in the United States or England to make another one attractive.
  Besides, the unparalleled depression of the &#8217;seventies was making all
  the publishing houses sail as close to the wind as they could run. Logically,
  a book on the cause of hard times ought to interest people just then, but book
  buyers do not buy by logic, and publishers are aware of it.</p>
<p>By hook or crook George and his friends got together enough money to make
  plates for an author&#8217;s edition of five hundred copies; George himself
  set the first few sticks of type. At three dollars a copy he sold enough of
  these almost to clear the cost; and presently the firm of Appleton, who had
  rejected the manuscript, wrote him that if he would let them have his plates,
  they would bring out the book in a two-dollar edition; and this was done.</p>
<p>It fell as dead as Caesar, not even getting a competent press notice in America
  for months. George sent some complimentary copies abroad, where it did rather
  better. Emile de Laveleye praised it highly in the Revue Scientifique; it was
  translated into German, and its reviews, as George said, were &#8220;way up.&#8221; Some
  sort of sale began in March, 1880, with a brilliant review in the <em>New York
  Sun</em>, which was followed by more or less serious treatment in the Eastern press
  generally; but it amounted to almost nothing.</p>
<p>The truth about the subsequent meteoric success of <em>Progress and Poverty</em> as
  a publishing venture is that it was a purely adventitious success. The times
  were not only just right for such a book, but they stayed right for nearly
  twenty years. The course of popular interest played directly into its hand,
  not only in America, but in the whole English-speaking world. It is significant
  that in countries where the course of interest ran otherwise, as in France,
  for instance, it had no vogue. In the English-speaking world, its immense vogue
  was almost wholly that of an instrument of discontent, or in the vernacular
  of the book trade, a hell-raiser. Even so (to a person who has had any experience
  at all of the human race), the fact that a solid treatise like <em>Progress
  and Poverty</em> should have had an aggregate sale running <strong>well over
  two million copies</strong>  is almost incredibly fantastic; yet that is what it had.</p>
<p>From first to last, the history of American civilization is a most depressing
  study; but that of the decade from which <em>Progress and Poverty</em> emerged is probably
  unmatched in the whole record, unless by the history of our own times. There
  is no need to dwell on it here; one feels utterly degraded at any reminder
  of it. George&#8217;s book nicely caught the tide of turbulent reaction which
  brought in &#8220;the era of reform&#8221; under Cleveland in 1884, and ran
  fairly full throughout the &#8217;nineties, George&#8217;s death in 1897 marking
  the approximate point of its complete subsidence.</p>
<p>This tidal wave carried George himself as well as his book; he threw himself
  on its crest. He expected some good to come of the great general unrest, and
  he bent all his energies to the task of educating the awakened social forces
  and giving them what he believed to be a right direction. The temper of the
  times filled him with hope. A sincere republican, he was a second Jefferson
  in his naive idealization of the common man&#8217;s intelligence, disinterestedness,
  and potential loyalty to a great cause. Therefore hell-raising quite suited
  him; Peter the Hermit had raised hell, and Savonarola had seen no other way
  to get the common man properly stirred up. Before George was nominated for
  the mayoralty of New York in 1886, Tammany sent William M. Ivins to buy him
  off with the promise of a seat in Congress. Ivins told him he could never be
  mayor &#8212; and in fact there is little room for doubt that he was fraudulently
  counted out &#8212; and George asked why, if that were so, there could be any
  objection to his running. Ivins told him frankly that it was because his running
  would raise hell; and George replied with similar frankness that was precisely
  what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>With this purpose in mind, George came to New York on the heels of his book,
  selling out what little he possessed in California. &#8220;My pleasant little
  home that I was so comfortable in is gone,&#8221; he wrote sadly, &#8220;and
  I am afloat at forty-two, poorer than at twenty-one. I do not complain, but
  there is some bitterness in it.&#8221; During his first year in New York, while
  his cherished book lay dead, he lived in obscurity, wretchedly poor; and then
  the time came when he could take advantage of something on which the eyes of
  the whole English-speaking world were fixed &#8212; the Irish rent-war.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>VI</strong></p>
<p>Ireland at that time was front-page news on every paper printed in the English
  language. Parnell and Dillon crossed the ocean, spoke in sixty-two American
  cities, addressed the House of Representatives, and took away a great fund
  of American dollars wherewith to fight the battles of the rack-rented Irish
  tenant. They were followed by the best man in the movement, Michael Davitt,
  who came over late in 1880 to tend the fire that Parnell and Dillon had kindled.
  George met him and got him &#8220;under conviction,&#8221; as the revivalists
  say, and then wrote a pamphlet entitled &#8220;<a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
  Irish Land Question; what it involves, and how alone it can be settled.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>From that moment Henry George was, in the good sense of the term, a made man.
  The pamphlet was a masterpiece of polemics, a call to action, and a prophecy,
  all in one. Published simultaneously in America and England, it had an immense
  success. George was amazed at the space it got in the Eastern papers. &#8220;The
  astonishing thing,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;is the goodness of the comments...
  I am getting famous, if I am not making money.&#8221; It is hard to see how
  a man who had ever done a day&#8217;s work on a newspaper could write in that
  unimaginative way. With Irish influence as strong as it was on the Eastern
  seaboard, and with every Irishman sitting up nights to curse the hated Sassenach
  landlords and their puppet government, how could the newspaper comments not
  be good? The Eastern papers simply knew which side their bread was buttered
  on.</p>
<p>A rabble of charmed and vociferous Irish closed around the simple-hearted
  pamphleteer, probably not troubling themselves much about his philosophy of
  the Irish land question, but nevertheless all for him. He was against the government
  and against the landlords, and that was enough. In this they were like the
  vast majority of readers who were led to peck at <em>Progress and Poverty</em> because
  they had heard that the book voiced their discontent; probably not five per
  cent of them read it through, or were able to understand what they did read,
  but they were all for it nevertheless, and all for glorifying Henry George.
  The American branch of the Land League immediately put George on the lecture
  platform, and when the Irish troubles culminated in the imprisonment of Davitt,
  Dillon, Parnell, and O&#8217;Kelly, an Irish newspaper published in New York
  sent him to the seat of war as a correspondent.</p>
<p>He reached Dublin, dogged by secret service men, and gave a public lecture
  with such effect that his audience went fairly wild. He wrote a friend that
  he had &#8220;the hardest work possible&#8221; to keep the crowd from unharnessing
  his cab-horse and dragging his carriage through the streets to his hotel. His
  reports to the <em>Irish World </em>got wide distribution. When he crossed to England,
  interest opened many doors to him outside political circles, and curiosity
  opened many more. He dined with most of the lions of the period, Besant, Herbert
  Spencer, Tennyson, Justin McCarthy, Wallace, Browning, Chamberlain, John Bright,
  and made an excellent impression. He wrote his wife that he could easily have
  become a lion himself if he had liked, but he thought it best to keep clear
  of all that sort of thing.</p>
<p>He spoke in England, and addressed huge audiences in Scotland. Returning to
  Ireland, he got still wider publicity out of being locked up twice on suspicion.
  His notoriety was helped, too, by the humorous character of the proceedings
  before the examining magistrate, which reminded all England of Mr. Nupkins&#8217;s
  examination of the Pickwickians. George took this occasion to write the President
  a blistering letter about the truckling imbecility of the American Minister,
  Lowell, and this not only gave him another line of publicity but also had a
  good practical effect. The Secretary of State sent out a circular letter prodding
  up the service, and asked George to file a claim for damages, which George
  refused to do, saying he was not interested in that, but only in seeing that
  the rights of American citizens in foreign lands were properly defended.</p>
<p>All this celebrity was a great lift for <em>Progress and Poverty</em>. <strong>The book suddenly
  became an international best seller. </strong><em>The London Times</em> gave it a five-column
  review which made its fortune in all the British possessions; the review came
  out in the morning, and by afternoon the publishers had sold out every copy
  in stock. When a new edition was rushed out, one house in Melbourne ordered
  1300 copies, and 300 were sent to New Zealand. George was invited everywhere,
  banqueted everywhere, asked to speak on all sorts of occasions, reported everywhere;
  and when he left the British Isles for home, he was perhaps the most widely
  talked-of man in either hemisphere.</p>
<p>He had intended to stay abroad three months, but remained a year. When he
  landed in New York he found himself, as he modestly said, &#8220;pretty near
  famous.&#8221; At once the newspapers blew his horn, the labor unions got up
  a tremendous mass meeting for him, and, strange as it seems, some of the upper
  crust of Wall Street gave him a complimentary dinner at Delmonico&#8217;s,
  with Justice van Brunt, Henry Ward Beecher, and Francis B. Thurber among the
  speakers. No one knows why they did this. Possibly it was a more or less perfunctory
  gesture toward an American who had made a name in England; possibly an inexpensive
  and non-committal move to please the influential Irish; possibly a gesture
  of amity toward a man well on his way to becoming a dangerous enemy, but who
  might be led to see something on their side of social questions. Whatever prompted
  the occasion, it was a notable affair, and George rose to its measure with
  easy and affable dignity.</p>
<p>In a sense, this banquet marked the parting of the ways for George, though
  probably no one was aware of it at the moment, George least of all. A reformer
  has a choice of three courses. He can carry his doctrine direct to the people,
  and promote it by methods that are essentially political; he can convert people
  of power and influence, and promote it largely by indirection; or he can merely
  formulate it, hang it up in plain sight, and let it win its own way by free
  acceptance. The first is the course of the evangelist and missionaries; and
  to a firm believer in eighteenth-century political theory, like George, it
  is the only one possible &#8212; it is wholly republican, wholly in the American
  tradition. It is interesting to speculate on what might have happened if, for
  a while at least, he had followed up his one chance to get at the minds of
  those who really controlled the country&#8217;s immediate future, or if he
  had taken the third or Socratic course; but he did neither. He was a stanch
  republican, committed to republican method.</p>
<p>For the next two years George lived before the populace, speaking and writing
  incessantly, and directing the development of his doctrine into a distinctly
  political character. At that time the press was much more an organ of opinion
  than it is now, much freer and more forceful, so that his writings were in
  demand. Even a popular publication like <em>Leslie&#8217;s</em> asked him for a series
  on the problems of the time, while at the other end of the scale the <em>North
  American Review</em> made him a proposal to start a straight-out political and economic
  weekly under his editorship.</p>
<p>Yet though his method was that of the evangelist, he did not adopt the tactics
  of the demagog or the practical politician. He was probably the most effective
  public speaker of his time &#8212; <em>The London Times</em> thought he was fully the
  equal of Cobden or of Bright, if not a little better &#8212; but he never took
  advantage of an audience, or flattered the galleries, or left the smallest
  doubt of where he stood and what was in his mind. When, for example, somebody
  introduced him in a maudlin way to a working-class audience as &#8220;one who
  was always for the poor man,&#8221; George began his speech by saying, &#8220;Ladies
  and gentlemen, I am not for the poor man. I am not for the rich man. I am for
  man.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, it soon became apparent that his hell-raising was raising as much
  hell with his supporters and potential friends as with his enemies. Like Strafford
  of old, he was for &#8220;thorough,&#8221; no matter whose head came off or
  whose toes smarted. All the Irish leaders, even Davitt, cooled off to the freezing
  point when they found that he was down on the Kilmainham treaty and dead against
  any compromise on the issues of the rent-war, or any watering down of the program
  of restoring one hundred per cent of Ireland&#8217;s land to one hundred per
  cent of Ireland&#8217;s people. The Socialists were not unfriendly at first,
  and some of George&#8217;s followers thought a sort of working alliance with
  them might be vamped up for political effect, but when George attacked their
  doctrine of collectivism and stateism, they most naturally showed all their
  teeth. George held with Paine and Thomas Jefferson that government is at best
  a necessary evil, and the less of it the better. Hence the right thing was
  to decentralize it as far as possible, and reduce the functions and powers
  of the state to an absolute minimum, which, he said, the confiscation of rent
  would do automatically; whereas the collectivist proposal to confiscate and
  manage natural resources as a state enterprise would have precisely the opposite
  effect &#8212; it would tend to make the state everything and the individual
  nothing.</p>
<p>George was moreover the terror of the political routineer. When the Republicans
  suddenly raised the tariff issue in 1880 the Democratic committee asked him
  to go on the stump. They arranged a long list of engagements for him, but after
  he made one speech they begged him by telegraph not to make any more. The nub
  of his speech was that he had heard of high-tariff Democrats and revenue-tariff
  Democrats, but he was a no-tariff Democrat who wanted real free trade, and
  he was out for that or nothing; and naturally no good bi-partisan national
  committee could put up with such talk as that, especially from a man who really
  meant it.</p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, when the official free-traders of the Atlantic seaboard,
  led by Sumner, Godkin, Beecher, Curtis, Lowell, and Hewitt, opened their arms
  to George, he refused to fall in. His free-trade speeches during Cleveland&#8217;s
  second campaign were really devoted to showing by implication that they were
  a hollow lot, and that their idea of free trade was nothing more or less than
  a humbug. His speeches hurt Cleveland more than they helped him, and some of
  George&#8217;s closest associates split with him at this point. In George&#8217;s
  view, freedom of exchange would not benefit the masses of the people a particle
  unless it were correlated with freedom of production; if it would, how was
  it that the people of free-trade England, for example, were no better off than
  the people of protectionist Germany! None of the official free-traders could
  answer that question, of course, for there was no answer. George had already
  developed his full doctrine of trade in a book, published in 1886, called <em><a href="../themes/underpop/about_PoFT.htm">Protection
  or Free Trade</a></em> &#8212; a book which, incidentally, gives a reader the best possible
  introduction to <em>Progress and Poverty</em>.</p>
<p>He laid down the law to organized labor in the same style, showing that there
  was no such thing as a labor-problem, but only a monopoly-problem, and that
  when natural-resource monopoly disappeared, every question of wages, hours,
  and conditions of labor would automatically disappear with it. The political
  liberal got the hardest treatment of all. George seems to have regarded him
  as the greatest obstruction to social progress &#8212; an unsavory compound,
  half knave, half fool, and flavored odiously with &#8220;unctuous rectitude.&#8221; When
  John Bright, the Moses of Liberalism, followed George on the rostrum at Birmingham,
  calling his proposals &#8220;the greatest, the wildest, the most remarkable
  ... imported lately by an American inventor,&#8221; all George could find to
  say was (in a private letter) that &#8220;the old man is utterly ignorant of
  what he is talking about&#8221; &#8212; which was strictly true; and of Frederic
  Harrison&#8217;s lectures at Edinburgh and Newcastle he said only that &#8220;his
  is the very craziness of opposition, if I can judge by the reports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>VII</strong></p>
<p>Thus intellectually he was out with every organized force in the whole area
  of discontent; out with the Socialists, out with the professional Irish, the
  professional laborites, professional progressivism, liberalism, and mugwumpery.
  His sympathies and affections however were always with the rank and file of
  revolt against the existing economic order; his heart was with all the disaffected,
  though his mind might not be entirely with them. This being so, the two years
  following his first visit to England fastened upon him the stigma of a mere
  proletarian class-leader whose principles and intentions were purely predatory.
  As Abram S. Hewitt most unscrupulously put it, his purpose was no more than &#8220;to
  array working men against millionaires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then at the end of these two years there happened the one thing needful to
  copper-rivet this reputation and make it permanent. When the labor unions of
  New York City decided to enter the mayoralty campaign of 1886, they looked
  to George as the best vote-getter in sight, and gave him their nomination.
  With this, whatever credit he may have had in America as an economist and philosopher
  vanished forever, leaving him only the uncertain and momentary prestige of
  a political demagogue, an agitator, and a crank.</p>
<p>George had misgivings, not of defeat but of discredit in his role of candidate,
  but they came too late. The course he had chosen years before led straight
  to the quicksand of practical politics, and now his feet were in it. He temporized
  with the nomination, demanding a petition signed by thirty thousand citizens
  pledged to vote for him, which was immediately forthcoming &#8212; and there
  he was!</p>
<p>The campaign was uncommonly bitter. The other candidates were Hewitt and Theodore
  Roosevelt, and their methods bore hard on George in ways that Hewitt, at any
  rate, must somewhat have gagged at, for he was a man of breeding &#8212; still,
  he lent himself to them. It was easy to vilify George, because the allegation
  that he was a sheer proletarian leader was true enough, as far as this campaign
  went; he was, officially and by nomination, a labor candidate. Some among his
  supporters, of course, understood his ideas and purposes and believed in them,
  but these were relatively few; the majority were mere Adullamites. Hewitt won
  the election nominally &#8212; in all reasonable likelihood he was counted
  in &#8212; but George&#8217;s vote was so large that the <em>New York Times</em> saw
  in it &#8220;an event demanding the most serious attention and study;&#8221;  while the <em>St.
  James Gazette</em> of London, in a strong grandmotherly vein, advised &#8220;all
  respectable Americans to forget the trumpery of party fights and political
  differentism, and face the new danger threatening the commonwealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as George was concerned, there was no need of this warning, for his
  day in politics was done. This one campaign was the end of him. He was no longer
  a man to be feared or even reckoned with. To those on the inside of practical
  politics, he was henceforth hopelessly in the discard as the worst of all liabilities,
  a defeated candidate. To America at large, he was only another in the innumerable
  array of bogus prophets and busted spellbinders. Then, too, the temper of the
  times changed. Disaffection broke up into sects, and popular attention was
  soon addled by a kaleidoscopic succession of men and issues cleverly manipulated
  on the public stage &#8212; Cleveland and &#8220;reform,&#8221; Hanna and the
  full dinner-pail, Peffer and populism, McElinley and imperialism, Bryan and
  free silver, Roosevelt and progressivism; foreign embarrassments, jingoism,
  the Spanish War, Mrs. Mary Ellen Lease, Mrs. Eddy, Carry Nation, Jerry Simpson,
  La Follette and the Wisconsin idea, organized charity, &#8220;foundations&#8221; for
  this-or-that, the rise of the higher learning, woman&#8217;s suffrage, the
  Anti-Saloon League, &#8220;commission government&#8221; for cities, the initiative
  and referendum &#8212; was ever such a welter of nostrums and nostrum-peddlers
  turned loose anywhere on earth in the same length of time? No wonder that Mr.
  Jefferson, mournfully surveying America&#8217;s prospects, said, &#8220;What
  a Bedlamite is man!&#8221; Before a year was over, George had dropped into
  a historical place amidst all this ruck, from which he has never emerged, as
  just one more exploded demagogue. He ran for a state office in 1887, but got
  little more than half the votes in New York City, his stronghold, that he had
  got in the mayoralty campaign only a year before.</p>
<p>The last ten years of his life were devoted largely to a weekly paper, <em>the
  Standard</em>, in which he continued to press his economic doctrine, but it amounted
  to very little. He revisited England, where he found his former popularity
  still holding good. He also made a trip around the world, and was received
  magnificently in his former home, California, and in the British colonies.
  His main work during this period, however, was writing his <em>Science of Political
  Economy</em>, which his death interrupted; fortunately not until it was so nearly
  finished that the rest of his design for it could be easily filled in.</p>
<p>In this period, too, his circumstances, for the first time in his life, were
  fairly easy. He had received some small gifts and legacies, and latterly a
  couple of well-to-do friends saw to it that he should finish his work without
  anxiety. It is an interesting fact that George stands alone in American history
  as a writer whose books sold by the million, and as an orator whose speech
  attracted thousands, yet who never made a dollar out of either.</p>
<p>His death had a setting of great drama or of great pathos, according to the
  view that one chooses to take of it. The municipal monstrosity called the Greater
  New York was put together in the late &#8217;nineties, and some of George&#8217;s
  friends and associates, still incorrigibly politically minded, urged on him
  the forlorn hope of running as an independent candidate for the mayoralty in
  1897. Seth Low, then president of Columbia University, and Robert van Wyck,
  who was the impregnable Tammany&#8217;s candidate, were in the field &#8212; the
  outcome was clear &#8212; yet George acceded. It is incredible that he could
  have had the faintest hope of winning; most probably he thought it would be
  one more chance, almost certainly his last, to bear testimony before the people
  of his adopted city with the living voice.</p>
<p>He had had a touch of aphasia in 1890, revealing a weakness of the blood vessels
  in his brain, and his condition now was such that every physician he consulted
  told him he could not possibly stand the strain of a campaign; and so it proved.
  He opened his campaign at a rapid pace, speaking at one or more meetings every
  night, nearly always with all his old clearness and force. Three weeks [editor's
  note: 3 days] before election he spoke at four meetings in one evening, and
  went to bed at the Union Square Hotel, much exhausted. Early next morning his
  wife awoke to find him in an adjoining room, standing in the attitude of an
  orator, his hand on the back of a chair, his head erect and his eyes open.
  He repeated the one word &#8220;yes&#8221; many times, with varying inflections,
  but on becoming silent he never spoke again. Mrs. George put her arm about
  him, led him back to his bed with some difficulty, and there he died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>VIII</strong></p>
<p><em>Progress and Poverty</em> is the first and only thorough, complete, scientific
  inquiry ever made into the fundamental cause of industrial depressions and
  involuntary poverty. The ablest minds of the century attacked and condemned
  it &#8212; Professor Huxley, the Duke of Argyll, Goldwin Smith, Leo XIII, Frederic
  Harrison, John Bright, Joseph Chamberlain. Nevertheless, in a preface to the
  definitive edition, George said what very few authors of a technical work have
  ever been able to say, that he had not met with a single criticism or objection
  that was not fully anticipated and answered in the book itself. For years he
  debated its basic positions with any one who cared to try, and was never worsted.</p>
<p>Yet, curiously, though there have been a number of industrial depressions
  since George&#8217;s death in 1897, some of them very severe, the book has
  been so completely obscured by the reputation which George&#8217;s propagandist
  enterprises fastened on him, that one would not know it had been written. In
  the whole course of the recent depression, for instance, no utterance of any
  man at all prominent in our public life, with one exception, would show that
  he had ever heard of it. The president of Columbia University resurrected George
  in a commencement address two years ago, and praised him warmly, but from what
  he said he seems not to have read him.</p>
<p>It is interesting, too, now that successive depressions are bearing harder
  and harder on the capitalist, precisely as George predicted, to observe that
  George and his associate anti-monopolists of forty years ago are turning out
  to be the best friends that the capitalist ever had. Standing staunchly for
  the rights of capital, as against collectivist proposals to confiscate interest
  as well as rent, George formulated a defense of those rights that is irrefragable.
  All those who have tried to bite that file have merely broken their teeth.
  There is a certain irony in the fact that the class which has now begun to
  suffer acutely from the recurring prostrations of industry and the ever-growing
  cost of stateism, is the very one which assailed George most furiously as an &#8220;apostle
  of anarchy and revolution.&#8221; Yet the rapid progress of collectivism and
  stateism could have been foreseen; there was every sign of it, and the capitalist
  class should have been the one to heed those signs devoutly and interpret them
  intelligently. Bismarck saw what was coming, and even Herbert Spencer predicted
  terrible times ahead for England, and still more terrible times for America &#8212; a
  long run of stateism and collectivism, then &#8220;civil war, immense bloodshed,
  ending in a military despotism of the severest type.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>IX</strong></p>
<p>Like John Bright, nearly every one credited the &#8220;American inventor&#8221; a
  brand-new discovery in his idea of confiscating economic rent. George did in
  fact come by the idea independently, but others whom he had never heard of
  came by it long before him. Precisely the same proposal had been made in the
  eighteenth century by men whom Mr. Bright might have thought twice about snubbing &#8212; the
  French school known as the Economists, which included Quesnay, Turgot, du Pont
  de Nemours, Mirabeau, le Trosne, Gournay. They even used the term <em>l&#8217;impot
  unique</em>, &#8220;the single tax,&#8221; which George&#8217;s American disciples
  arrived at independently, and which George accepted. The idea of confiscating
  rent also occurred to Patrick Edward Dove at almost the same time that it occurred
  to George. It had been broached in England almost a century earlier by Thomas
  Spence, and again in Scotland by <a href="Ogilvie_Essay_1782.html">William
  Ogilvie</a>, a professor at Aberdeen.
  George&#8217;s doctrine of the confiscation of social values was also explicitly
  anticipated by Thomas Paine, in his pamphlet called <em>Agrarian Justice</em>.</p>
<p>George&#8217;s especial merit is not that of original discovery, though his
  discovery was original &#8212; as much so as those of Darwin and Wallace. It
  was simply not new; Turgot had even set forth the principle on which George
  formulated the law of wages, though George did not know that any one had done
  so. George&#8217;s great merit is that of having worked out his discovery to
  its full logical length in a complete system, which none of his predecessors
  did; not only establishing fundamental economics as a true science, but also
  discerning and clearly marking out its natural relations with history, politics,
  and ethics.</p>
<p>The key to an understanding of George&#8217;s career may be found in the story
  that Lincoln Steffens tells about an afternoon ride with the devil on the top
  of a Fifth Avenue bus. The devil was in uncommonly good spirits that day, and
  entertained Steffens with a fine salty line of reminiscences half way up the
  avenue, when Steffens suddenly caught sight of a man on the sidewalk who was
  carefully carrying a small parcel of truth. Steffens nudged the devil, who
  gave the man a casual glance, but kept on talking, apparently not interested.
  When Steffens could get a word in, he said, &#8220;See here, didn&#8217;t you
  notice that that man back there had got hold of a little bit of truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course I noticed it,&#8221; replied the devil. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely that&#8217;s a very dangerous thing,&#8221; Steffens said. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t
  you going to do something about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No hurry, my dear fellow,&#8221; the devil answered indulgently. &#8220;It&#8217;s
  a simple matter. I&#8217;ll be running across him again one of these days,
  and I&#8217;ll get him to organize it!&#8221;</p>
<p>It is impossible, of course, to guess what George&#8217;s historical position
  would now be if he had had less of the Covenanter spirit and more of the experienced
  and penetrating humor of a Socrates, with a corresponding distrust of republican
  method in the propagation of doctrine. The question is an idle one, yet to
  a student of civilization the great interest of George&#8217;s career is that
  at every step he makes one ask it. Perhaps in any case the Gadarene rout would
  have trampled him to the same depth of obscurity. Probably &#8212; almost certainly &#8212; his
  doctrine would have been picked up and wrested to the same service of a sectarian
  class-politics that would have left it unrecognizable. Experience, humor, and
  reason go for very little when they collide with what Ernest Renan so finely
  called <em>la materialisme vulgaire, la bassesse de l&#8217;homme interesse</em>. Yet
  one can hardly doubt that George would emerge from obscurity sooner, and his
  doctrine stand in a clearer and more favorable light if he had taken another
  course.</p>
<p>Much more important, however, is the question whether George&#8217;s faith
  in the common man&#8217;s collective judgment was justified; whether such faith
  is ever justified. Does the common man possess the force of intellect to apprehend
  the processes of reason correctly, or the force of character to follow them
  disinterestedly? The whole future of eighteenth-century political doctrine,
  the doctrine on which our republic was nominally established, hangs on this
  question &#8212; the question, in short, whether republicanism has not put
  a burden on the common man which is greater than he can bear.</p>
<p>George never had a moment&#8217;s doubt of the answer. Yet, seeing what sort
  of political leadership the common man invariably chose to follow, and the
  kind of issue that invariably attracted him, he ended the argument of <em>Progress
  and Poverty</em> with a clear warning, too long to be quoted here, against the wholesale
  corruption of the common man by the government which the common man himself
  sets up. It is well worth reading now, whether one finds the root of this corruption
  in the common man&#8217;s weakness of mind and character, or whether one finds
  it, as George did, in the unequal distribution of wealth. Whatever one may
  think about that, there is no possible doubt that George&#8217;s warning has
  the interest of absolutely accurate prophecy.</p>
<p>It is rather remarkable, finally, since the reading public&#8217;s whim for
    biography has set writers to pawing over so many American worthies, that no
    one has written a competent full-length biography of Henry George, who was
    not only one of America&#8217;s very greatest men, but also was in so many
    respects typically American, and whose spectacular career was also so typical.
    His disabilities were precisely those of the civilization that produced him,
    and his life was sacrificed on the altar of those disabilities, precisely
    where the life of that civilization is being sacrificed. What more by way
    of interest
    could an able and honest biographer ask?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>ALBERT JAY NOCK</strong></p>
<p>Back in the dark days of 1932, when a despairing world and its culture were
  being torn asunder by a major catastrophe, the worst economic depression ever
  known, a man who is foremost among America's few living exponents of belles-lettres
  wrote in his diary under the date of Oct. 27; &quot;Now that Roosevelt has
  dug up W. G. Sumner and the Yale Press shows signs of life, enough to republish
  his writings; I should think someone might soon be rediscovering Henry George.
  If so, he will find that George was one of the first half-dozen minds of the
  nineteenth century, in all the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The man who set that down in his characteristically small, fine hand, an essayist
  and historian who is one of the chief catalyzers of the intellectual ferments
  of our time, was noting no passing fancy. The idea returned to him and on Oct.
  31 he recorded: &quot;I have been looking over the biography of Henry George,
  by his son Harry, a pains-taking sort of book. The best one can say for it
  is that it is competent. There should be a better one, for George was undeniably
  a great man.&quot;</p>
<p>Not only was Albert Jay Nock, the chronicler just quoted, thinking of these
  things. In New York the editors of <em>Scribner's Magazine</em> had the same notion
  and they commissioned Mr. Nock to do the job. The essayist went abroad the
  following February and through the Spring lived in his beloved low countries,
  breaking his stay at last for a junket through France and Spain into Portugal.
  With his papers full of commissions, some of which he would not do, some he
  might do and a few he would do if time, and the business of living fully, permitted,
  the assignment from Scribner's caused him no preoccupation. But the personality
  of George kept popping up: at Port Cros, watching a schooner put off ten tons
  of coal on March 31, he mused: &quot;All by hand labor, with the help of one
  donkey. I wonder whether most of our labor-saving devices have really saved
  anything worth saving ... Henry George attacked this problem, in '<em>Progress
  and Povert</em>y', and solved it, but his solution, being valid, will not be accepted
  in a hurry.&quot;</p>
<p>Through his friends he was keeping in close touch with hectic America. Henry
  L. Mencken wrote him, after the fiasco of the World Economic Conference: &quot;'The
  republic proceeds towards hell at a rapidly accelerating tempo.&quot; Nock
  was not profoundly stirred; he spent the next day at the Lisbon Museum. But
  the idea of re-creating Henry George was still rankling him. On June 9 he wrote
  in the diary: &quot;Overnight at Porto, on the way to Vidago, where I hope
  to find a pleasant place to stop awhile and write 'an overdue paper for Scribner's
  on Henry George.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon he was in Vidago where &quot;one sees miserable dwellings, occupied by
  people absolutely lost in poverty and filth, built of magnificent huge granite
  blocks after the Roman fashion&quot;; in Vidago among a Portuguese people whom
  he found, nevertheless &quot;without a single exception, the kindest people
  I have ever seen.&quot; On June 15 he noted. &quot;Working steadily at quite
  high pressure on my article for Scribner's on Henry George, so the days pass
  very quickly. I hope it will call attention to him, though I suppose nothing
  will do so effectively as long as Americans are what they are&quot; or until
  tremendous hardship puts an end to their being drugged and doped by nostrums
  dealt out to them by demagogues and scoundrels.&quot; In his idyllic refuge
  --&quot;what a superb climate and what grand scenery&quot; he remarked of Vidago
  -- America became remote to him; &quot;one can hardly convince oneself while
  here, that it exists.&quot; But George, along of all his environment, persisted
  and on June 26, Mr. Nock recorded: &quot;I am done with Henry George, and shall
  leave here tomorrow. What a great man he was, and how well he managed to get
  himself misjudged and forgotten! I suppose, Scribner's, people will pull a
  long face over getting a really serious piece of work -- I often think of that
  dreadful person, Bok, writing to Lyman Abbott for 'a short, snappy life of
  Christ.'&quot; The aftermath was typical of the man; on July 29 he noted: &quot;ScrIbner's
  people seem satisfied with my piece on Henry George, and say it will come out
  in November, so I suppose all the single-taxers in the country will curse me
  afresh.&quot;</p>
<p>That is how &quot;Henry George, Unorthodox American&quot; came to be written,
  as anyone can see for himself in Mr. Nock's &quot;A Journal of These Days:
  June 1932-December 1933&quot; (Morrow, 1934.) But to understand how this tabloid
  biography came to be the unique study it is, even when one compares it with
  the admirable similar studies by Broadus Mitchell and Rexford G. Tugwell, one
  must recall Mr. Nock's career. He took his bachelor's degreeat St. Stephen's
  College, where he steeped hirnse1f in the classical languages and their literatures.
  With Francis Neilson he wrote &quot;How Diplomats Make War&quot; (1915; 2d
  Ed., 1916). From 1920 to 1924, he edited the old Freeman in company with Neilson,
  Suzanne Lafollette and others equal1y notable, setting unexcelled standards
  in periodical journalism. During that period he wrote &quot;The Myth of a Guilty
  Nation&quot; under the pseudonym of Historicus (1922) and edited &quot;The
  Selected Works of Charles F. Browne (Artemus Ward)&quot; (1924), in the latter
  work establishing the native humorist as the social satirist he was.</p>
<p>A scholar's life-time job found fruit in his &quot;Jefferson&quot; (1926 ).
  He followed this with a collection, &quot;On Doing the Right Thing and Other
  Essays&quot; (1928). Then, with Catherine Rose Wilson, he wrote &quot;Francis
  Rabelais, the Man and His Work&quot; (1929), first fruit of another lifetime
  interest. With Miss Wilson, he edited the Urquhart-Le Matteaux translation
  of the works of &quot;Francis Rabelais&quot; (2 vols., 1931), concluding a
  monumental work of scholarship with his book, &quot;A Journey Into Rabelais's
  France&quot; (1934). Meanwhile he had served as visiting professor of American
  history and government at Saint Stephen's and had published, under the pseudonym
  of Journeyman, &quot;The Book of Journeyman&quot; (1932) together with a noteworthy
  structure on an institution close to him, &quot;The Theory of Education&quot; (1932).</p>
<p>The contradiction between state and society, in which Ludwig Gumplowicz and
  Franz Oppenheimer had interested him long before, resulted in a work as significant
  in a social sense as &quot;Rabelais&quot; and &quot;Jefferson&quot; had been
  in literary and historical senses, &quot;Our Enemy the State&quot; (1935).
  He followed this with &quot;Free Speech and Plain Language&quot; (1937). Throughout
  all these dates a stream of essays on contemporary themes poured from his pen,
  to find critical and keenly appreciative hearings among the readers of The
  New Republic, The Atlantic Monthly, The American Mercury and similar literary
  papers.</p>
<p>What we have, then, in &quot;Henry George, Unorthodox American,&quot; is
  a living portrait of one unusual citizen of the world by another.</p>
