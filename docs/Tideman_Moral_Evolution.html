<center><b>The Constitutional Conflict Between Protecting
Expectations and Moral Evolution</b></center>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">By Nicolaus Tideman</p>
<a name="Abstract"></a><b>Abstract<br>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Constitutions must be amendable, to
allow for the possibility of incorporating new moral insights into
them. This impinges on the protection of expectations, including those
regarded as property. Protection of property rights is achieved by
constitutional restrictions on the ability of voters and legislators to
reduce the value of property by regulation, taxation or expropriation.
But such restrictions also prevent voters and legislatures from
reflecting new moral insights in legislation, if those insights would
reduce the value of property. There have been times in the past when
moral development has compelled societies to change laws in ways that
reduced the value of property (e.g., elimination of slavery). We cannot
guarantee that there will be no future advances in our moral evolution
that would require similar changes in laws, reducing or eliminating the
value of what we now consider property. Looking forward to the
possibility of such moral advances, we should design constitutions that
permit amendments to reflect new moral insights, while prohibiting
legislators (or voters in referenda) from passing laws that
redistribute in ways not explicitly sanctioned by the constitution.</div>

<p><a name="One" id="One"></a><b>1. The
Possibility of New Moral Insights that Necessitate
Redistribution</b></p>
<p>The main point of this paper is simple. Unless the process that
generates a constitution is perfect, there should be provision for
the possibility of changing the constitution. It is true that the
stability provided by constitutions is valuable. By limiting the
opportunities for transient majorities to redistribute, constitutions
protect property rights. The resulting stability promotes efficiency
by reducing rent-seeking. But as valuable as stability is, it is not
lexically more valuable than the chance to incorporate new moral
understandings into a constitution. And when a society perceives the
need to incorporate a new moral understanding into its constitution,
a disappointment of pre-existing expectations is likely to be
necessary.</p>
<p>Perhaps the point seems so simple that it does not even need to be
stated. How could anyone doubt that it will sometimes be appropriate
to change a constitution, and that some will lose in the process?
However, associated issues are complex enough that some elaboration
is warranted. The first point to be made is that disagreement about
what constitutes an improved understanding of a moral imperative is
nearly inevitable at the time when the new understanding is emerging.
That such improvements in our understanding do occur, and that they
are controversial when they occur, can be seen most easily by looking
back into history. </p>
<p>Three hundred years ago virtually no one questioned the propriety
of slavery. Even John Locke, that most articulate advocate of human
freedom, invested in slaves. But over the course of the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, amid extreme controversy in some times and
places, slavery was nearly eliminated from the world. With a bit of a
lag, a consensus gradually evolved among humanity that slavery was
wrong, indeed that no distinctions in civil rights based on race
could be justified. </p>
<p>Two hundred years ago almost no one thought that women should be
allowed to vote. Amid extreme controversy in some times and places,
they were granted voting rights. Now virtually no one argues that
women should be denied any rights that men have. We have not yet
arrived at a consensus about what equality of the sexes means, but we
are near a consensus that we should strive for it.</p>
<p>The next point to be made is that it would not be reasonable to
expect constitutional changes that reflect new moral understandings
to be made as approximate Pareto improvements. It would have been
possible to end slavery in a way that made almost no one noticeably
worse off as compared to their expected utilities under slavery. It
would merely have been necessary to declare the slaves free, provided
that they made reasonable progress on paying debts to their former
masters equal to their market value as slaves, and that they used
their first earnings to buy insurance policies that would compensate
their former masters in the event that they died or became
incapacitated before they finished paying the debts. But such an end
to slavery would never have satisfied the impulse that pushed for its
abolition.</p>
<p>Ending slavery was not an issue of economic efficiency or voter
preferences. Slavery needed to be ended because so many people could
not in good conscience participate in a legal system that enforced
slavery. If slavery was wrong, there was no basis for requiring
persons subjected to slavery to purchase their freedom. They had to
be recognized as unconditionally free. Others would need to bear the
loss from the fact that those formerly recognized as the owners of
slaves would no longer be allowed to appropriate the product of slave
labor. Who should bear the loss?</p>
<p><a name="Two" id="Two"></a><b>2. Assigning the
Costs of Moral Accidents</b></p>
<p>In addressing this question, it is helpful to employ ideas from
the theory of accidents. We now see that the perpetuation of slavery
was a moral accident. To reduce the likelihood of future moral
accidents, it is sensible to assign the costs of accidents to some or
all of the persons who could have prevented them. Costs might also
reasonably be assigned to anyone who benefitted from the accidents.
Among the prominent candidates for bearing the cost would be those
who captured people and sold them into slavery, those who bought,
sold and transported slaves, those who held slaves, those who passed
and enforced laws perpetuating slavery, those who bought products
produced with slave labor, those who sold goods to persons involved
in the selling or holding of slaves, etc. Anyone who received an
inheritance derived from slavery could be called upon to relinquish
it as well. Emphatically not on the list are the slaves themselves
and any person who came of age without an inheritance after slavery
ended. They did not cause slavery. Thus it was wrong of Britain, in
ending slavery in the 1830s, to compensate those who were
historically regarded as the owners of slaves with funds from general
revenues, and with a rule permitting them to work the slaves for a
few more years, during which many slaves were worked to death.</p>
<p>There are particular advantages to assigning the cost of the end
of slavery to those who thought of themselves as slave owners. It is
administratively more efficient than other possibilities, because in
means leaving the costs where they fall. More importantly, the idea
that slavery might be seen to be wrong, and that then the costs of
ending slavery might be left where the fall, provides a continuing
incentive for those involved in slavery to cease.</p>
<p>Contrary arguments can be made. From a utilitarian perspective,
concentrating the losses leads to a greater felt cost than if the
same losses are dispersed. Uncertainty in rights makes it more
difficult to effect the transactions that lead to efficient resource
allocation. And the persons historically regarded as the owners of
slaves will generally be a politically powerful group, who may
exercise their power to perpetuate slavery far longer if they must
bear the full cost of freeing slaves than if the cost is shared. </p>
<p>Furthermore, defenders of historical institutions will argue, when
social arrangements look exploitive, there is often another
perspective from which those arrangements promote efficiency. For
example, slavery has been defended as a Pareto improvement from an
environment in which those defeated in war are killed. Another
example comes from the theory of the origin of government advanced by
Mancur Olson. He theorizes that autocratic governments originated in
an environment of roving bandits, when some potential bandits decided
that there was a greater gain in becoming stationary bandits and
protecting the victims from roving
bandits.<font size="-1"><b><i>1</i></b></font></p>
<p>The Russian Mafia today can be understood, in many cases, as
promoting efficient resource allocation by preventing the dissipation
of rent through competition. For example, Old Arbat Street in Moscow
was for many years a place where artists would sell their wares to
tourists. But to operate there, artists were required to pay the
Mafia gang that controlled the street. The fees collected by the
Mafia served to ration the space to an efficient number of artists.
Without that rationing device, there would have been an excess of
artists crowding the street and interfering with each other
inefficiently. And people would have been getting up at 2:00 in the
morning to get space before anyone else claimed it. In these
circumstances, the Mafia action served to prevent the dissipation of
the rent and did not reduce the net incomes of artists. If there were
no public-good aspects of the provision of art, it could be argued
that complete efficiency was achieved by this "spontaneous" private
appropriation of rent.</p>
<p>The person who wishes to abolish such exploitative institutions as
slavery, autocratic governments and Mafia protection schemes, without
compensation for those who derive income from them, can be asked to
explain why it is right to terminate these incomes without
compensation, when the development of the institutions served to
improve allocative efficiency. </p>
<p>The answer comes in two parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Part of the answer is that slavery,
autocratic government, Mafia protection and other exploitive
institutions are second-bests. Slavery may be better than the killing
of those who are defeated in war, but magnanimity by victors, or an
end to war, are better. And once slavery starts, it generates
enslavements of the weak who would otherwise be safe. Autocratic
government may be better than suffering the predations of roving
bandits, but government that reflects a sense of community among the
governed is certainly better. Mafia protection of Old Arbat Street
artists may be better than chaotic appropriation of selling space,
but public collection of rent for the use of selling space is better.
The fact that these institutions may be improvements on what would
otherwise have existed does not imply that they should continue to
exist when yet better institutions become feasible.</li>
  <li>The second part of the answer is that if one is tempted to
suppose
that the income from the indefinite duration of an exploitive
institution is needed to induce people to invest efficiently in
creating the institution, that temptation should be resisted. If the
developer of an exploitive institution were able to capture exactly
the full increase in aggregate income from its development, and if
the profit in developing such an institution depended on receiving
the increase in income for all eternity and not just until a better
institution became feasible, and if the time when the better
institution became feasible was independent of whether the first
institution was developed, then it would not be worthwhile to develop
the institution in the first place. In these circumstances a right in
perpetuity is like a perpetual patent on something that would have
been discovered by someone else if not by its first inventor. In the
same way that a perpetual patent can motivate excessive expenditures
on inventive activity, a perpetual right to benefit from an
exploitive institution induces excessive investments in
exploitation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe that a little extra incentive for the creation of
property rights does no harm, there are reasons for disagreeing.
Those who develop exploitive institutions are not limited to
collecting the increase in aggregate income from the development of
those institutions. If they sometimes promote efficiency, they more
generally steal unboundedly. There is no need to worry about
insufficiency of the incentive to exploit. When we are able to
replace an exploitive institution with a better one, we should not be
concerned about the efficiency consequences, or the justice, of
disappointing the financial expectations of those who counted on the
continuation of exploitation.</p>
<p>Returning to earlier points, there is the utilitarian argument
that a concentrated loss produces a greater felt cost than the same
loss when spread. While this is true, general attention to this
argument would lead to complete leveling. We refrain from spreading
costs for the sake of creating incentives.</p>
<p>Next is the argument that uncertainty in rights adds to
transactions costs and therefore impedes the efficient allocation of
resources. This too is true, but need not stop us. During the course
of the U.S. civil war, the market price of slaves rose and fell with
the fortunes of the Confederacy. But improving the efficiency with
which those who thought of themselves as slave owners allocated slave
labor would not have been a sufficient reason to guarantee them
against loss from the end of slavery.</p>
<p><b>More serious is the argument that, since those who benefit from
exploitation will use their considerable power to perpetuate it, a
greater good is achieved by buying them off.</b> Insurance companies
often pay to retrieve stolen property from persons they believe to be
thieves, to avoid the greater cost of compensating the victims of
thieves. As a financial proposition, compromise with principle can
pay. </p>
<p>But there are enduring costs. Truth is often a casualty as well.
If one were dealing with a straightforward iniquitous person (a
professional blackmailer or kidnapper, perhaps), who would
acknowledge that his position was without moral justification and
represented nothing more that a selfish effort to extract what he
could from his position of power, then one could readily weigh the
costs and benefits, and bow to power if that was less costly. But if
one is dealing with persons who style themselves the owners of slaves
and want acknowledgement that they are justly entitled to
compensation for the taking of their property, then concession may
cloud the perception of right and wrong for a long time. Concession
in this case comes at a great price. This is what makes it worthwhile
to fight for the establishment of principle instead of cutting a deal
with those who perpetuate iniquity.</p>
<p><a name="three" id="three"></a><b>3. The
Possibility of a Right of Secession</b></p>
<p>But slavery is long gone. Of what relevance, you may ask, are such
arguments today? I suggest that, some time in the next century or
two, a number of moral issues as momentous and contentious as slavery
will rise to public consciousness and pose the same issues of moral
advance versus the protection of financial interests that might be
thought of a property rights.</p>
<p>Consider the issue of secession. While there is often a
correspondence between the borders of a nation and the set of persons
who want to identify with a particular nationality, there are many
instances when the preponderance of persons in a region would
strongly prefer not to be part of the nation that exercises
sovereignty over them--Chechins in Russia, Basques in Spain, Kurds in
Turkey, Iran and Iraq, Kashmiris in India, Catholics in Northern
Ireland, Hungarians in Serbia, Romaina, and Slovenia, Corsicans in
France, Palestinians in Israel, Christians in Sudan, and so on around
the globe. The particular locations of national borders are primarily
the result of wars. In many cases, the only justification that can be
given for borders apart from "If you try to take what I claim, I'll
kill you," is that any acknowledgement that borders were subject to
question would lead to interminable conflict, so we are better off
abiding by what we have than allowing the question to be opened.</p>
<p>But this puts the advocates of maintaining existing borders in the
potentially uncomfortable position of needing to support every
"reasonable" government that seeks to suppress its secessionists.
This then necessitates an evaluation of the reasonableness of the
complaints of every minority with regard to language, religion,
education, the provision of public services, marriage rules,
child-rearing practices, tolerated intoxicants, and every other area
of social life about which people can disagree. The person who wants
to support the efforts of a government to suppress its secessionist
minorities must be able to say that in every area where the
government imposes a rule on the minority, no right that the minority
ought to have is violated. It is becoming increasingly difficult to
sustain a claim that it is possible to know what rights minorities
deserve. I predict that within a century, humanity will come to a
consensus that the right of a defined unit to secede from a larger
governmental entity is a basic human right, that no nation or
administrative sub-unit is entitled to cling to control of a compact
sub-unit whose citizen are united in their desire not to be
controlled by the larger entity.</p>
<p>Already we may be seeing the first signs of this. Czechoslovakia
was peacefully partitioned into The Czech Republic and Slovakia,
although the fact that this seems to have been mutually desired makes
it less evidential for the thesis. The Kremlin acquiesced with only a
little grumbling to the dismantling of the USSR. Here one might
propose that with democracy looming, it was valuable for Russians to
ensure that they would not become a minority in their own nation.
After some fighting, the international community pressured the
remnants of Yugoslavia to accept the departure of Slovenia, Croatia
and Bosnia. Canada seems to acknowledge implicitly that if the people
of Quebec really want to no longer be part of Canada, they may have
their way. When Quebecoi insist that Native American tribes that want
to remove their tribal lands from the jurisdiction of Quebec must
never be allowed to do so, they sound inconsistent. This is not
enough evidence to make a convincing case, but it may be straws in
the wind. Still, in so many other cases, there is little if any
general international support for the efforts of secessionists.</p>
<p><a name="Four" id="Four"></a><b>4. The
Complementary Right of Equal Access to Natural Opportunities</b></p>
<p>One of the factors that makes the case for secession difficult is
the problem of regional inequality in natural resources. When the
people who called themselves Biafrans sought to secede from Nigeria
in the 1960s, the morality of their claim was undermined by the fact
that, if they had succeeded, they would have taken disproportionate
oil resources from the rest of Nigerians. The limited support for the
efforts of the Chechins to separate from Russia is explained in part
by the understanding that, even though the Chechins have been abused
by Russians for centuries and have never fully acceded to their
incorporation into Russia, if Chechniya were allowed to separate from
Russia, that would create a precedent that would make it difficult to
oppose an effort by the people of the sparsely populated Yakutsia
region of Eastern Siberia, rich in oil and diamonds, to insist that
they too have a right to be a separate nation.</p>
<p>Perhaps, a general recognition of a right of secession will need
to wait for another component of moral evolution: a recognition that
all persons have equal claims on the value of natural opportunities.
If this were recognized, then any nation or region with
disproportionately great natural resources would be seen to have an
obligation to share the value from using those resources with those
parts of the world that have less than average resources per capita.
This would eliminate the desire to appropriate natural resources as a
reason for secession and as a reason for opposing secession. Signs of
a recognition of the equal claims of all persons on the use of
natural opportunities are slim. One can point to John Locke: </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Whether we consider natural Reason, which tells us, the
Men, being once born, have a right to their Preservation, and
consequently to Meat and Drink, and such other things, as Nature
affords for their Subsistence: Or Revelation, which gives us an account
of those Grants God made of the World to Adam, and to Noah, and his
Sons, 'tis very clear, that God, as King David says, Psal. CXV. xvi.
has given the Earth to the Children of Men, given it to Mankind in
common.<font size="-1"><b><i>2</i></b></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Locke goes on to say that every person has a right to himself, and
therefore to the things of value that are created by combining his
efforts with natural opportunities, "at least where there is as much
and as good left in common for others." He then argues that with so
much unclaimed land in America, no one can justly complain if all of
Europe is privately appropriated. Locke does not address the question
of how rights to land should be handled if there is no unclaimed
land.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, writing on the subject of patents, said, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But
      while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of
      property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit
      a natural and even an hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by
      those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual
      has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for
      instance.<font size="-1"><b><i>3</i></b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry George said,</p>
<blockquote>The equal right of all men to the use of land is as clear
as their equal right to breathe the air -- it is a right proclaimed by
the fact of their existence. For we cannot suppose that some men have
the right to be in this world and others no right.
  <p>If we are all here by the equal permission of the creator, we are
all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his bounty--with an
equal right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers. This
is a right which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests
in every human being as he enters the world, and which during his
continuance in the world can be limited only by the equal rights of
others.<font size="-1"><b><i>4</i></b></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>General recognition of the equal rights of all to the use of land
and other natural opportunities is hard to find. When the powerful
nations of the world got together to eject Iraq from Kuwait, very
little was heard of the bizarreness of supposing that Emir of Kuwait
and his relatives had a right to all the oil that lay under Kuwait.
Some recognition of equal rights to the use of natural opportunities
can be found in the proposed Law of the Sea Treaty, which would have
had all nations benefiting from the granting of franchises to extract
minerals from the sea. From an economic perspective, the treaty was
flawed by the fact that it would have created an artificial scarcity
of seabed mining activities in order to raise revenue, and it was
opposed by the U.S. and not implemented. But it did suggest general
recognition of global equal rights to at least those natural
opportunities that no one has yet begun to use.</p>
<p>One impediment to the recognition of equal rights to the use of
natural opportunities is that some system of assessment would be
needed to identify the transfers that would compensate for unequal
access to natural opportunities. Another impediment is that a system
of rewards for those who discover new opportunities would be needed.
But if there were a will to address them, these technical
difficulties could be solved adequately, as they are in jurisdictions
such as Alberta, Canada, that claim all mineral rights for the
government.</p>
<p><a name="Five" id="Five"></a><b>5. Power,
Population and Process</b></p>
<p>There are two other difficulties that are more serious. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, the existing distribution of recognized exclusive rights
to natural opportunities (land, mineral resources, fishing rights,
water rights, etc.) is the outcome of a game of power, and those who
have won at this game have great power are loathe to part with their
winnings.</li>
  <li>Second, Malthusian analysis has led people to expect that if the
value of exclusive use of natural opportunities were distributed
equally, population would expand until everyone was at a subsistence
level.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a solution to the second problem, contained in the idea
that all persons have equal rights to the use of natural
opportunities. If the crowding effects of additional persons outweigh
the beneficial effects of greater economies of scale, then any region
that has an above-average population growth rate is appropriating
more than its share of the scarce natural opportunity to be a parent.
The costs that this region thereby imposes on other regions can
justly be subtracted from what would otherwise be its claim on the
value of using natural opportunities. Each region could then decide
for itself whether to pass those costs on to individual couples who
decide to conceive children.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a region imposes costs on others through
interregional pollution, the costs so imposed should be subtracted
from the region's claim to the value of exclusive use of natural
opportunities. The great challenge is to overcome the entrenched
power that benefits from continued blindness to moral necessity. The
mechanism must not be force of arms, for that entails too great a
risk of installing a new power elite who would be as unprincipled as
the first. Nor should the mechanism be the power of majorities,
through legislation and referenda, for these processes can also be
used for the selfish aggrandizement of those who control them. It is
good that constitutions prohibit the taking of property without just
compensation. It is to be hoped that courts will interpret such
restricitons as prohibiting taxes that take all of the value of
things currently regarded as property. </p>
<p>When respect for a newly understood moral truth requires the
dissappointment of previously protected expectations, those who would
push their fellow citizens to incorporate that truth into the
governmental process should be obliged to have their ideas reviewed
in a constitutional amnedment process that will ensure that they will
be adopted only if a broad consensus on them is achieved. When people
are ready to see a new moral truth, that truth can overcome such a
hurdle.</p>
