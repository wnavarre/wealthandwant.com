    <p style="text-align: center;">Mason Gaffney, 15 June 92</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Chapter 10 in Gene Wunderlich
    (ed.), <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Ownership, Tenure, and
  Taxation of Agricultural Land.</span> Westview Press.</p>
<p>It is a common belief that property tax relief is "good for
farmers." It certainly raises the private share of economic rent.
That in turn raises the investment grade of farmland and encourages
its purchase as a store of value, a place to park slack money. This
may be at odds, however, with using it as a vehicle for enterprise
and an outlet for workmanship. Lower farm property taxes are
associated with lower ratios of capital to land, and labor to land,
both over time and among states. They are also associated with bigger
mean farm size and less equal distribution of farm sizes.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, I first document the rise of
inequality in the distribution of farmland that followed a sharp drop
in farm property tax rates after 1930. Then I show, by
cross-sectional analysis, a positive relationship between higher
property tax rates and more intensive use of farmland, which in turn
is associated with more equal distribution of farmland. Conversely, I
find property tax relief associated with underuse and
underimprovement of land.</p>
<i>A priori</i>, a tax on buildings works to suppress building and
to penalize smaller farmers, whose building to land ratio is higher
than that of bigger farmers. The findings seem to show, therefore, a
stronger countereffect, proincentive and pro-subdivision, of the
other part of the property tax, the part based on land value.<br>
&nbsp;
<center><b>PROPERTY TAX RELIEF <br>
AND THE MARCH OF CONCENTRATION,
<br>
1930-1988</b></center>
<p>The national average of farm property tax rates peaked in 1930 at
1.32 percent. It fell to 0.77 percent in 1945, and stabilized at
about that level--it was 0.85 percent in 1987.<font size="-1"><b><i>
(1)</i></b></font> Sales and income taxes, which bear heavier on
urban activities, replaced the missing property taxes as sources of
revenue.<br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-2"><big>(1) The rates for
1930 and 1945 are from U.S. Department of Agriculture, The Economic
Almanac (New York, 1960): 33. The 1988 rate is from Bureau of the
Census, 1987 Census of Agriculture, Vol. 3, Related Surveys, Part 2, <b>Agricultural
Economics and Land Ownership Survey (AELOS)</b> (Washington, D.C.:
1989): 179, Table 50. Earlier information is fuzzy, but before 1930
there were no state sales taxes and few state income taxes. In 1920,
half of all state government revenues were from property taxes, as well
as 90% of local revenues (particularly counties and school districts).
The levies of special improvement districts, e.g. for irrigation and
drainage, are not legally "taxes," but "benefit assessments," and were
in addition to the numbers given.</big></font></div>
<p><a name="Vanishing Farmers and Unafforda"></a><b>Vanishing Farmers
and Unaffordable Farms</b></p>
<p>Mean acres per farm had remained fairly constant for 65 years
(1870-1935) at about 155 acres, despite two major industrial merger
movements. After 1935 the mean took off and had tripled to 462 acres
by 1987. As the number of farms was falling, national population was
on the rise. In 1900 there was one farm per 11 Americans; in 1987
only one per 113. Farms became unaffordable. Real wage rates have not
risen as fast as real land prices since 1955, and not at all since
about 1975, <font size="-1"><b><i>(2)</i></b></font> which has raised
the labor-price of land. Coupling this with rising acres per farm,
the labor-price of a farm roughly tripled, from about 6 years' wages
(before payroll deductions) in 1954 to about 17 years' wages in 1987.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(3)</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote><big><font size="-2"><big>(2) In constant dollars, average
hourly earnings of nonsupervisory production labor in U.S.
manufacturing peaked in 1975, and had dropped about 7 percent by 1988.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Handbook of Labor Statistics, Bulletin 2340
(Washington, D.C., 1991):312, Table 80.</big></font> </big><br>
  <big><font size="-2"><big>(3) Average hourly earnings (before tax) of
nonsupervisory production workers were $1.71 in 1955 and $8.57 in 1985.
The value of land and buildings per farm was $20,400 in 1954 and
$289,000 in 1987. Using 2,000 as the number of working hours per year
yields the labor-cost of a farm in yearly wages. I have understated
both the rise and the years by using "earnings" instead of disposable
pay after payroll taxes, which have risen sharply. Also, I did not
allow for layoffs, sickness, injury, unemployment, etc.</big></font></big></blockquote>
<p><a name="The Vanishing Middle Class"></a><b>The Vanishing Middle
Class</b></p>
<p>In 1900 the Census Bureau began publishing farm data ranked by
acres per farm. Using those data, the
<a name="Gini Ratio (GR)"></a><b>Gini Ratio (GR)
</b><font size="-1"><b><i>(4)</i></b></font> was .58 in 1900, and it
rose only slowly, to .63 in 1930. After that it rose faster, to .70
by 1950, plateaued there for 15 years, then rose again to .76 by
1987. <font size="-1"><b><i>(5)</i></b></font> (By comparison, GRs
for personal income are much lower, about .40, and are much more
stable over decades.) The accelerated rise since 1930 coincided with
the rise of mean acres per farm, and both followed the fall of
property tax rates.</p>
<blockquote><big><font size="-2"><big>(4) The GR is a measure of
unequal distribution. It is a pure index that sums and standardizes
large amounts of disparate data in one number. A rise in GR means the
big got bigger and/or the small got smaller. It ranges from .00
(complete equality) to 1.00 (complete inequality). Its essence is
explained in many basic texts on industrial organization. See, e.g., D.
Needham, The Economics of Industrial Structure and Performance (New
York: St. Martin's Press, 1978):424. </big></font></big>

<p>As a measure, GR deals only with concentration among existing
farms. Industrial economists fault it for not reflecting the loss of
farms. Acknowledging the critics, GR can be modified to combine both
effects. Simply add the ghosts of 4.5 million farms that died between
1935 and 1988 to the lowest bracket, as farms with zero acres in
1988. This raises GR for 1988 from .76 to .92, a radical rise of
inequality since 1930 (.63). Calculating the GR this way gives one a
better sense of how concentration shot up after 1930-1935. In the
Great Depression (1930-1941), millions of small farms provided a
refuge for the jobless and homeless. Today, that refuge is closed,
with explosive social consequences in urban slums.</p>
<p><a name="The Rise of Land Quality in Vas"></a><b>The Rise of Land
Quality in Vast Farms</b></p>
<p>The concentration of the value of farm real estate is growing
faster than that of farm acres. The <b>value of land and buildings
($L+B) per acre</b> in the top bracket (farms of 1,000 acres and
over) has risen relative to all farms. For easy recall and reference,
I label this ratio <a name="GAMMA"></a><b>GAMMA</b>. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Gamma is the top
bracket acre value divided by the mean acre value.</span> In 1910,
Gamma for
$L+B was .35. By 1930 it had dropped to .29, after 20 years of high
farm property tax rates.<font size="-1"><b><i>(6)</i></b></font> By
1987, after 57 years of low property tax rates, it had doubled to
.61. <font size="-1"><b><i>(7)
</i></b></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(6) Calculated from Bureau of
the Census, 1940 Census of Agriculture, Vol. 3:78-79, 82; and 1950
Census of Agriculture Vol. 2:776.<br>
</small><font size="-1">(7) Calculated from 1987 Census of Agriculture,
93, Table 51; 1940 Census of Agriculture, Vol. 3:78-79, 82; and 1950
Census of Agriculture Vol. 2:776. In 1940 and 1950 the "top bracket"
was 1,000 acres and over; in 1987 it was 2,000 acres and over. I
adjusted for this by combining the top two brackets in 1987.</font></div>
<p>Accordingly, the share of $L+B in farms of 1,000 acres and over
  rose faster than the share of acreage from 1930-1987. The share of
  acreage rose from .28 to .62, a rise of 123 percent. The share of
  $L+B rose from .08 to .38, a rise of 375 percent.</p>
<p>The <a name="land share of real estate value"></a><b>land share of
real estate value (LSREV)</b> in the top bracket (1,000 acres and
over) has probably risen faster than overall. LSREV is an acronym for
$L/($L+B), that is the value of land as a fraction of the value of
land and buildings together. <a href="#GAMMA">Gamma</a> for $L alone
always stood higher
than for $L+B during the years 1900-1940 when the census published
separate data on $L and $B for all farms. There is no comparable
later data published to test directly whether Gamma for $L has risen
even higher over Gamma for $L+B (for 1988, AELOS separates $L and $B
only for owner-occupied farms, not for all farms.) There is indirect
evidence, however, that LSREV in the top bracket may have risen
faster than overall.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">One indicator is the share of
harvested cropland, by size of farm.</span>
This share in the top bracket has risen relative to the share for all
farms. This ratio in 1925 was 8.5 percent over 37.3 percent, or .23.
It rose to .37 in 1950 and to .69 by 1987.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(8)
</i></b></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">(8) Data for 1925-1950
are from the 1950 Census of Agriculture, Vol. 2:780-782; for 1987 from
the 1987 Census of Agriculture, 90-91, Table 51. To maintain
comparability it was necessary for me to consolidate the top two
brackets in 1987.</font></div>
<p>Another confirming indicator is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">rising
concentration of
irrigated land.</span> When irrigation was young in Anglo-America
(1890-1914), it was the recourse of small farmers struggling for land
against bonanza wheat farmers and ranchers (the familiar grist of
horse operas). Then, vast spreads were subdivided to create small
irrigated farms. There was drastic subdivision and intensification
(1900-1930). <font size="-1"><b><i>(9)</i></b></font> Land in farms
of 1,000 acres and over actually dropped (nationally) by 15 percent
from 1900 to 1910, the only drop on record.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Now, however, 34 percent
of all irrigated land is in the top bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. </span><font size="-1"><b><i>(10) </i></b></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Control of irrigated
land means control over water. Control of water gives control over
arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. For farms with irrigated land, GR = .82,
</span><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><i>(11)</i></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> substantially higher than
the GR of .76 for all farms.</span></p>
<blockquote><big><font size="-2"><big>(9) For example, the number of
farms in Stanislaus County, California, quintupled from 1900 to 1920.
Subdivision for more intensive culture by small farmers was the
dominating trend there then. Heavy land taxes were levied there (by
irrigation districts) to finance public irrigation works. See B.F.
Rhodes, "The Thirsty Land," Ph.D. dissertation, University of
California, Berkeley, 1943; available from the university's Main
Library and on microfilm, HD1740, M6R4. See also A. Henley, 1969,

</blockquote>
<p>An independent study by Villarejo illustrates the trend from 1940
to 1982 in a specific area intensively studied by Wilson and Clawson
in 1940. The study area was the irrigable and irrigated land in Kern
and Tulare counties, California. Replicating the study in 1982,
Villarejo found that "land ownership has become more concentrated as
more land has been placed in irrigated farms."

Enough?&nbsp;&nbsp;(Davis:&nbsp;California Institute for Rural Studies,

<p>A last confirming indicator is concentration by sales. Data for
this are available from 1950. GR for farms ranked by sales has risen
faster from 1950-1987 (.67 to .80) than GR for farms ranked by acres
(.70 to .76). Sales were less concentrated than acres; now they are
more concentrated. That is consistent with the hypothesis that land
quality in large holdings is rising.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(13)</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote><big><font size="-2"><big>(13) Data on sales for 1930 are
not available, but going back to 1900, GR&nbsp;by sales was .50, while
GR&nbsp;by acres was .58.</big></font></big></blockquote>
<a name="Rising Land Share and Rising Ra"></a><b>Rising Land Share
and Rising Ratio of Price to Cash Flow</b>
<p>The LSREV almost certainly rose from 1940, when land prices were
depressed, to 1987. By splicing disparate tables to get comparable
data, I estimate LSREV for all farms rose from .69 to about .80.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(14)</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote><font size="-2"><big>(14) In 1940, the last year in which
the census of agriculture separated $L and $B, LSREV was .69 overall.
In AELOS, 1988, the figure is reported for owner-operators (.71) and
for "landlords with debt" (.89), but not for overall LSREV. From that,
I "ballpark" LSREV&nbsp;at .80 for 1988.</big> </font></blockquote>
<p>Higher LSREV means a higher price to cash flow (P/C) ratio. That
is because cash flow (C) from buildings and other capital includes
allowance for depreciation (D). Depreciation is part of cash flow,
but not part of earnings; price is capitalized only from earnings
(C-D). Thus, the price of capital is capitalized from less than its
cash flow. The price of land, oppositely, is capitalized from more
than its cash flow. It is from cash flow plus the current
appreciation (C+A). <font size="-1"><b><i>(15)</i></b></font> Land
price also captures expectations of cash and service flows from

<a name="THE LESSER IMPROVEMENT OF BIGGE"></a><b>THE LESSER

<p>A result of rising concentration is the separation of land from
capital. With some exaggeration, American latifundia are now lands
without buildings, but buildings cluster on smaller farms, many
without enough land. This implies at least three points.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, building wealth is more equally distributed than land
wealth.</li>
  <li>Second, the property tax would be more progressive if changed to
a pure land tax, exempting buildings.</li>

support the case first using national data, and then by comparing

<p>It is awkward that the 1987 Census of Agriculture defines "farm
size," and ranks farms, only by acres rather than value. I used the
acreage rankings above for intertemporal comparison because they are
comparable with each other over time and are all that is available
over time. Data on value per acre is available by acreage brackets,
but a proper data set to test my thesis cross-sectionally would rank
farms by land value ($L), rather than acres. This would reshuffle and
rerank individual farms.<font size="-1"><b><i> (19)</i></b></font>
For example, in the brackets from 260 acres to 1999 acres there are
now more farms worth $1 million and over than there are in the top
bracket (2,000 acres and over).
<font size="-1"><b><i>(20)</i></b></font> Half the farms in the top
bracket are worth less than $1 million each. If all farms were
properly reranked by value, the degree of inequality and the effect
of "size" on factor proportions would change. In what follows, I use
available data to simulate what those changes might be. One available
data set, although partial, is ranked by value, and it confirms my
thesis with startling force.</p>

<p>The 1987 Census of Agriculture does not provide overall land-value
data (separate from $B), but it does provide one surrogate for land
quality: land irrigated. Irrigated land is generally flatter, lower,
and warmer; in addition, the water supply itself is an easement over
more land (the watershed, whose acreage is not counted with acres per
farm). Farms of 2,000 acres and over have 34 percent of all irrigated
land, but only 24 percent of $L+B.

<p>AELOS (1988) gives no comparable comprehensive data, but it does

For "landlords with debt,"
<font size="-1"><b><i>(38)</i></b></font> the BSREVs are lower
overall (.11) than for owner-operators (.29), but the immediate
interest here is how the shares fall with size of holding. Ranking by
acres per farm, BSREV is .11 overall, and falls gently to .07 in the
top bracket. These data, however, are also ranked by $L+B. Ranking
thus, BSREV is still, of course, .11 overall, but--here is the
shocker--BSREV falls to an astonishingly low .01 in the top bracket.

one results from several concurrent factors: (1) these data are for

data are ranked by value, not acres. Thus, they are ideal to test my
thesis in its purest form. They show, technically, how very sensitive
concentration data are to the choice of ranking variable. Above all,
they show substantively that the largest holdings of farm wealth
consist of land without buildings.</big></font></big></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A share of .01 is breathtaking in any such scatter, but more so
here because the ranking variable includes $B. When a scatter of
points is loose, the choice of ranking variable (i.e., the definition
of "size") biases the findings to show the share of the ranking
variable rising with size. However, the present data are ranked by
$L+B, which is neutral between $L and $B. Thus, BSREV = .01 in the
top bracket is free of ranking bias and fully significant without
adjustment. This is an uncommonly strong relationship. The biggest
landlord holdings, in dollar value, are 99 percent pure land.</p>

their income for housing. As discussed above and again below, land in
small farms is also more productive in purely cash terms (sales per

had 5 percent of the land in farms, and 11 percent of the farm labor.

<p>To sum up what national data show, there is evidence that land
quality rises with acreage harvested, using irrigated acres as a
surrogate for quality, and that BSREV falls. Ranking farms by sales,
the same rule holds. For all owner-operated farms, ranked by acres,
BSREV falls steeply with size. For landlords with debt, ranked by
$L+B, BSREV falls even more steeply with size, nearly to zero. The

The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> nine arid ranching states</span>

because of its high $L/acre.) <br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">seven small urban states</span>
are Massachussetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland and New Hampshire. (New Hampshire is surprisingly included,
because of its small area and high $L/acre. Ideally, northern New
Hampshire would be treated separately as rural, but then many other
states should be split as well.) <br>

</p>
<p>My overall findings are displayed in Figure 10.1, a scatter
plotting of LSREV against $L per farm, by states. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Land value per farm
ranges from $71,000 (West Virginia) to $630,000 (Arizona).</span>
Arizona
and other big-farm states have higher LSREVs than West Virginia and
other small-farm states. Overall, the scatter displays a strong
positive relationship between $L per farm and LSREV, state to state.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(48)</i></b></font> This supports the basic
finding which is, otherwise put, that land is much more concentrated
than buildings among farms.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(49)</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote><big><font size="-2"><big>(48) Using $L to rank the states
would reintroduce an element of ranking bias were grouped data not
being used. Lumping data causes extreme understatement of the
relationship displayed, so no net exaggeration is perpetrated by Figure
10.1.</big></font> </big><br>
  <big><font size="-2"><big>(49) If that is not clear, think of it in
extreme terms. It is as though buildings were all of equal value, from
farm to farm, and farms differed only in their lands.</big></font></big></blockquote>
<a name="Urban Influence"></a><b>Urban Influence </b>
<p>Data by states also provide new insights into interstate and
interregional differences. I divide states into three groups: 9 small
urban states, 7 arid ranching states, and 34 rural and rural-urban
states (See Table 10.1).</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the small urban states, the CV values for $L and $B are .42
and .16;</li>
  <li>for the arid ranching states, .32 and .29;</li>
  <li>for the 34 rural states, .67 and .32. <font size="-1"><b><i>(50)</i></b></font></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, $L is more concentrated than $B among the states within each
of the three groups, but the difference is greatest among the small
urban states, where farm values are most affected by urban
speculation. This suggests that the effect of urban land speculation
is toward higher concentration of landholdings, a point made earlier
by Gray, and by Goldenweiser and Truesdell,
<font size="-1"><b><i>(51) </i></b></font>and observable today around
growing cities.<font size="-1"><b><i>(52)</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote><big><font size="-2"><big>(50) To sharpen these
differentials, I have experimented with dividing states synthetically
into regions. Thus, it is reasonable to impute the characteristics of
Iowa to the northern third of Missouri and the southern third of
Minnesota, leaving the residuals to the other two-thirds of each state.
The result is a steep jump in the mean deviation of $L per farm, with a
small rise in that of acres per farm and $B per farm. County-by-county
data processed in this way would make the points even sharper. Several
prior researchers have used county data to good effect.</big></font> </big><br>

  <big><font size="-2"><big>(52) Florida, singled out below as a
"bellwether" state, is not a "small" urban state, but ranks high in
urban sprawl, which spreads urban price influence over farmland: 7.4
percent of Florida is "urban and built-up," compared with less in other
states of comparable area and population--5.1 percent in Illinois, 5.2
percent in Michigan, and 5.8 percent in New York (U.S. Department of
Commerce, Statistical Abstract of the United States 1988, (Washington,
D.C., 1989):187). Florida ranks low in per capita income, but second
among states in domestic travel spending. The Florida land boom of 1926
is history, but the dispersed settlement pattern that fostered it still
stamps Florida, and helps explain its farmland characteristics, viz.
high LSREV and high GR.</big></font></big><br>

BSREV. Wisconsin has the highest BSREV, .47; Florida has the lowest,
.15. Yet, Wisconsin's <b>farm property tax rate
<a name="(PTR)"></a>(PTR)</b> exceeds Florida's 4 to 1. Wisconsin,
the high-tax state, leads Florida 3 to 1 in farm output per dollar of
farmland value, 5 to 1 in farm buildings per dollar of farmland
value, and (surprisingly) 7 to 3 in machinery/livestock. Florida, the
low-tax state, leads Wisconsin in GR (2 to 1); in $L per farm (5.5 to
1); in acres per farm (3 to 2); in $L per acre (4 to 1); and in real
estate/all assets (11 to 8) (Table 2).

<blockquote><big><font size="-2"><big>(53) Florida also outranks
Wisconsin in many measures of social and civic morbidity. Florida leads
the nation in violent crimes per 100,000 population, and it leads
Wisconsin 5 to 1 (Federal Bureau of Iinvestigation's Uniform Crime
Rates, 1991 World Almanac, p.848). That is the more significant
considering its age distribution, which is short on the violence-prone
youthful cohorts. Florida ranks 44th in voter turnout, to 4th for
Wisconsin, even though Florida ranks first in share of population over
age 65, the high-voting ages. Florida also leads Wisconsin in infant
mortality rate, 12.8 to 9.5; divorce rate, 6.7 to 3.6; and prisoners
per 100,000 people, 243 to 102. In a cultural factor like patents
issued per million people, Wisconsin leads Florida 185 to 113. (Data
from 1990 Statistical Abstract, pp. xii-xxi, 535; State and
Metropolitan Area Data Book, 1986; Annual Reports, USDC, Commissioner
of Patents and Trademarks; America Votes 19, Washington: Congressional
Quarterly, 1991.) These data are only partial and exploratory: many
factors, including urban factors, contribute to such contrasts. A
much-discussed treatment is Walter Goldschmidt, As You Sow. Glencoe:
The Free Press, 1948. Also worth consulting is M.R. Greenberg, G.W.
Carey, and F.J. Popper, "Violent Death, Violent States, and American
Youth," The Public Interest No. 87, Spring 1987:38-48.</big></font></big></blockquote>

<p>Florida and Wisconsin are not exceptions or outliers, but
bellwethers. Extending the data to 8 states below Florida, and 8
above Wisconsin, the differences persist and accumulate consistently.
The <a name="&quot;Florida 9&quot;"></a><b><i>"Florida 9"</i></b> are Florida,
Arizona, New Mexico, Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming,
California, and Texas. The
<a name="&quot;Wisconsin 9&quot;"></a><b><i>"Wisconsin 9"</i></b> are
Wisconsin, Delaware, Maine, Pennsylvania, New York, New Hampshire,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Ohio. There are two contrasting
Gestalts along the lines shown.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Wisconsin 9 have higher PTRs
[Property Tax Rates] overall than the Florida 9. To
the extent that the PTR is a cause of the effects with which it is
associated, its effect is not so much to abort farm capital, as
expected.</span> It is associated with high BSREV. High PTR is also
associated with small farms (low $L per farm, low $L per acre), low
GR values, high ratios of M&amp;E to livestock and to real estate,
low shares of leased land, <font size="-1"><b><i>(54)
</i></b></font>and fuller land usage, as measured by sales per
$L.</p>
<blockquote><font size="-2"><big>(54) Florida, my bellwether state, is
an exception to this rule.</big></font></blockquote>
<p><b><i>The inverse relationship between PTR and GR is particularly
consistent and noteworthy. </i></b>In this respect North Dakota and
Delaware, otherwise nonconforming members of their respective groups,
fall into line. Delaware has a low PTR and a high GR; North Dakota
the opposite. The egalitarian effects of a high PTR seem stronger
than its negative incentive effects, even though buildings are part
of the tax base. These egalitarian effects would be stronger if the
tax base was limited to naked land value, because LSREV rises steeply
with size of farm. Untaxing buildings would also eliminate negative
incentive effects.</p>
<p><a name="CONCLUSION"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p>One may at least firmly conclude that large farm units are less
improved and less peopled than small and medium-sized farms. There
are two possible interpretations. One is that big farms are more
efficient, getting more from less, but that is refuted by their
getting less output per $L. The other is that Veblen was right, many
of them are oversized stores of value, held first to park slack money
and only secondly to produce food and fiber, and complement the
owner's workmanship. <font size="-1"><b><i>(55)</i></b></font> The
Florida 9 may represent a home grown rural "third world" of large,
underutilized landholdings that preempt the best land and force
median farmers onto small farms on low-grade land.</p>
<blockquote><big><font size="-2"><big>(55) T. Veblen, "The Independent
Farmer," Absentee Ownership, (New York: B.W. Huebsch, Inc.,
1923):129-42.</big></font></big></blockquote>
<p>The issue cannot be settled in a few words, but the implications
for tax policy are the same either way. If large units are more
efficient, they can bear heavier taxes. If they are less efficient,
heavier PTRs will induce them to release surplus land for others,
which will tend at the margins to equalize factor proportions, moving
more states from the Florida toward the Wisconsin model.</p>
