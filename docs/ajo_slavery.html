<p align="center"><b>SLAVERY</b></p>
<center>
  <p>[By A. J. O.]<br>
[It is suspected that the author is Mark Twain]</p>
</center>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;THE SLAVER</p>
<p>Suppose I am the owner of an estate and 100 slaves, all the land
about being held in the same way by people of the same class as
myself. It is a profitable business, but there are many expenses and
annoyances attached to it. I must keep up my supply of slaves either
by buying or breeding them. I must pay an overseer to keep them
continually to their work with a lash. I must keep them in a state of
brutish ignorance (to the detriment of their efficiency), for fear
they should learn their rights and their power, and become dangerous.
I must tend them in sickness and when past work. And the slaves have
all the vices and defects that slavery engenders; they have no
self-respect or moral sense; they lie, they steal, they are lazy,
shirking work whenever they dare; they do not care what mischief
their carelessness occasions me so long as it is not found out; their
labor is obtained by force, and given grudgingly; they have no heart
in it. All these things worry me.</p>
<center>FLASH! ....</center>
<p>Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no
unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were
free they would still have to look to me for work somehow. So one day
I announce to them that they are all free, intimating at the same
time I will be ready to employ as many as I may require on such terms
as we may mutually and independently agree. What could be fairer?
They are overjoyed, and falling on their knees, bless me as their
benefactor. Then they go away and have a jollification, and next day
come back to me to arrange the new terms.</p>
<center>THEY BELIEVE ...</center>
<p>Most of them think they would like to have a piece of land and
work it for themselves, and be their own masters. All they want is a
few tools they have been accustomed to use, and some seed, and these
they are ready to buy from me, undertaking to pay me with reasonable
interest when the first crop comes in, offering the crop as security.
As for their keep, they can easily earn that by working a few weeks
on and off on any of the plantations, or by taking a job clearing or
fencing, or such like. This will keep them going for the first year,
and after that they will be better able to take care of
themselves.</p>
<center>HOLD ON, NOW!</center>
<p>"But," softly I observe, "you are going too fast. Your proposals
about the tools and seed and your maintenance are all right enough,
but the land, you remember, belongs to me. You cannot expect me to
give you your liberty and my own land for nothing. That would not be
reasonable, would it?" They agree it would not, and begin to propose
terms. A fancies this bit of land, and B that. But it soon appears
that I want this bit of land for my next year's clearing, and that
for my cows, and another is too close to my house and would interfere
with my privacy, and another is thick forest or swamps, and would
require too long and costly preparation for me who must have quick
returns in order to live, and in short that there is no land suitable
that I care to part with.</p>
<center>THE BENEFACTOR</center>
<p>Still I am ready to do what I promised &#8212; "to employ as many
as I may require, on such terms as we may mutually and independently
agree." But as I have now got to pay them wages instead of getting
their work for nothing. I cannot of course employ all of them. I can
find work for ninety of them, however, and with these I am prepared
to discuss terms.</p>
<p>At once a number volunteered their services at such wages as their
imagination had been picturing to them. I tell the ninety whose
demands are most reasonable to stand on one side. The remaining ten
look blank, and seeing that since I won't let them have any of the
land, it is a question of hired employment or starvation, they offer
to come for a little less than the others. I tell these now to stand
aside, and ten others to stand out instead. These look blank now, and
offer to work for less still, and so the "mutual and voluntary"
settlement of terms proceeds.</p>
<p>But, meanwhile, I have been making a little calculation in my
head, and have reckoned up what the cost of keeping a slave, with his
food and clothes, and a trifle over to keep him contented, would come
to, and I offer that. They won't hear of it, but as I know they can't
help themselves, I say nothing, and presently first one and then
another gives in, till I have got my ninety, and still there are ten
left out, and very blank indeed they look. Whereupon, the terms being
settled, I graciously announce that though I don't really want any
more men, still I am willing, in my benevolence, to take the ten,
too, on the same terms, which they promptly accept, and again hail me
as their benefactor, only not quite so rapturously as before.</p>
<center>WAGE SLAVES? ...</center>
<p>So they all set to at the old work at the old place, and on the
old terms, only a little differently administered; that is, that
whereas I formerly supplied them with food, clothes, etc., direct
from my stores, I now give them a weekly wage representing the value
of those articles, which they will henceforth have to buy for
themselves.</p>
<p>There is a difference, too, in some other respects, indicating a
moral improvement in our relations. I can no longer curse and flog
them. But then I don't want to; it's no longer necessary; the threat
of dismissal is quite as effective, even more so; and much pleasanter
for me.</p>
<p>I can no longer separate husband from wife, parent from child. But
then again, I don't want to. There would be no profit in it; leaving
them their wives and children has the double advantage of making them
more contented with their lot, and giving me greater power over them,
for they have now got to keep these wives and children out of their
own earnings.</p>
<p>My men are now as eager as ever to come to me to work as they
formerly were to run away from work. I have neither to buy or breed
them; and if any suddenly leave me, instead of letting loose the
bloodhounds, I have merely to hold up a finger or advertise, and I
have plenty of others offering to take their place. I am saved the
expense and worry of incessant watching and driving. I have no sick
to attend, or worn-out pensioners to maintain. If a man falls ill
there is nothing but my good nature to prevent my turning him off at
once; the whole affair is a purely commercial transaction &#8212; so
much wages for so much work. The patriarchal relation of slave-owner
and slave is gone, and no other has taken its place. When the man is
worn out with long service I can turn him out with a clear business
conscience, knowing that the State will see that he does not
starve.</p>
<p>Instead of being forced to keep my men in brutish ignorance, I
find public schools established at other people's expense to
stimulate their intelligence and improve their minds, to my great
advantage, and their children compelled to attend these schools. The
service I get, too, being now voluntarily rendered (or apparently so)
is much improved in quality. In short, the arrangement pays me better
in many ways.</p>
<center>REJOICE! I AM CAPITAL AND I EMPLOY PEOPLE!</center>
<p>But I gain in other ways besides pecuniary benefit. I have lost
the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
country, and his own fortune together."</p>
<p>Whereas it is not my capital that does any of these things. lt is
not my capital but the labourer's toil that builds up my fortune and
the wealth of the country. It is not my employment that keeps him
from pauperism, but my monopoly of the land forcing him into my
employment that keeps him on the brink of it. It is not want of
capital that keeps the labourer from using the land, but my refusing
him the use of the land that prevents him from acquiring capital. All
the capital he wants to begin with is an axe and a spade, which a
week's earnings would buy him, and for his maintenance during the
first year, and at any subsequent time, he could work for me or for
others, turnabout, with his work on his own land. Henceforth with
every year his capital would grow of itself, and his independence
with it, and that this is no fancy sketch, anyone can see for himself
by taking a trip into the country, where he will find well-to-do
farmers who began with nothing but a spade and an axe (so to speak)
and worked their way up in the manner described.</p>
<center>ENTER THE LANDLORD ....</center>
<p>But now another thought strikes me. Instead of paying an overseer
to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8212; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
yearly pay. He, not I, shall find all the capital, take all the risk,
and engage and supervise the men, paying me a lump sum, called rent,
out of the proceeds of their toil, and make what he can for himself
out of the surplus. The competition is as keen in its way for the
land, among people of his class, as it is among the labourers for
employment, only that as they are all possessed of some little means
(else they could not compete) they are in no danger of immediate
want, and can stand out for rather better terms than the labourers,
who are forced by necessity to take what terms they can get. The
minimum in each case amounts practically to a "mere living", but the
mere living they insist on is one of a rather higher standard than
the labourers'; it means a rather more abundant supply and better
quality of those little comforts which are next door to necessaries.
It means, in short, a living of a kind to which people of that class
are accustomed.</p>
<p>For a moderate reduction in my profits, then &#8212; a reduction
equal to the tenant's narrow margin of profit &#8212; I have all the
toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk too,
for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be forthcoming,
and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the full amount,
no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence of all other
debts. All my capital is set free for investment elsewhere, and I am
freed from the odium of a slave owner, notwithstanding that the men
still toil for my enrichment as when they were slaves, and that I get
more out of them than ever. If I wax rich while they toil from hand
to mouth, and in depressed seasons find it hard to get work at all;
it is not, to all appearances, my doing, but merely the force of
circumstances, the law of nature, the state of the labour market
&#8212; fine sounding names that hide the ugly reality.</p>
<p>If wages are forced down it is not I that do it; it is that greedy
and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor labourers,
not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; I only want my rent --
and
get it. <b>Like the lilies of the field, I toil not, neither do I
spin, and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered)
comes to me of itself. </b>Nay, people bid against each other for the
privilege of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the labourers' toil. It
is the fruit of their labour which they ought to have; which they
would have if I did not take it from them.</p>
