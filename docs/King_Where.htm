<p align="center"><strong>Final Words of Advice</strong></p>
<p align="center">The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You know, very few people have even heard of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
    last book. It was called <em>Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community? </em>(New
    York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967).</p>
  <p>Toward the end of that book, in a chapter titled &quot;Where We Are Going,&quot; King
    states his support for a policy that right-wingers and left-wingers had both
    been studying. See what he says to us:</p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the treatment of poverty nationally, one fact stands out: there are twice
  as many white poor as Negro poor in the United States. Therefore I will not
  dwell on the experiences of poverty that derive from racial discrimination,
  but will discuss the poverty that affects white and Negro alike. </p>
<p>Up to recently we have proceeded from a premise that poverty is a consequence
  of multiple evils:</p>
<ul>
  <li> lack of education restricting job opportunities;</li>
  <li> poor housing which stultified home life and suppressed initiative;</li>
  <li> fragile family relationships which distorted personality development.</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic of this approach suggested that each of these causes be attacked
  one by one. Hence a housing program to transform living conditions, improved
  educational facilities to furnish tools for better job opportunities, and family
  counseling to create better personal adjustments were designed. In combination
  these measures were intended to remove the causes of poverty.</p>
<p>While none of these remedies in itself is unsound, all have a fatal disadvantage.
  The programs have never proceeded on a coordinated basis or at a similar rate
  of development. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Housing measures have fluctuated at the whims of legislative
        bodies. They have been piecemeal and pygmy. </li>
  <li>Educational reforms have been
        even more sluggish and entangled in bureaucratic stalling and economy-dominated
        decisions. </li>
  <li>Family assistance stagnated in neglect and then suddenly
      was discovered to be the central issue on the basis of hasty and superficial
      studies. </li>
  </ul>
<p>At
            no
              time has a total, coordinated and fully adequate program been conceived.
            As a consequence, fragmentary and spasmodic reforms have failed to
      reach down to the profoundest needs of the poor.</p>
<p>In addition to the absence of coordination and sufficiency, the programs of
  the past all have another common failing &#8212; they are indirect. Each seeks
  to solve poverty by first solving something else.</p>
<p><strong>I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective
  &#8212; the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely
  discussed measure: the guaranteed income.</strong></p>
<p>Earlier in this century this proposal would have been greeted with ridicule
  and denunciation as destructive of initiative and responsibility. At that time
  economic status was considered the measure of the individual's abilities and
  talents. In the simplistic thinking of that day the absence of worldly goods
  indicated a want of industrious habits and moral fiber.</p>
<p>We have come a long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the
  blind operation of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in
  the market operation of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust
  people into idleness and bind them in constant or frequent unemployment against
  their will. The poor are less often dismissed from our conscience today by
  being branded as inferior and incompetent. We also know that no matter how
  dynamically the economy develops and expands it does not eliminate all poverty.</p>
<p>We have come to the point where we must make the nonproducer a consumer or
  we will find ourselves drowning in a sea of consumer goods. We have so energetically
  mastered production that we now must give attention to distribution. Though
  there have been increases in purchasing power, they have lagged behind increases
  in production. Those at the lowest economic level, the poor white and Negro,
  the aged and chronically ill, are traditionally unorganized and therefore have
  little ability to force the necessary growth in their income. They stagnate
  or become even poorer in relation to the larger society.</p>
<p>The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full
  employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one
  method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned
  that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that
  enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional
  jobs are not available.</p>
<p>In 1879 Henry George anticipated this state of affairs when he wrote, in <em>Progress
  and Poverty</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;The fact is that the work which improves the condition of mankind,
      the work which extends knowledge and increases power and enriches literature,
      and elevates thought, is not done to secure a living. It is not the work
    of slaves, driven to their task either by the lash of a master or by animal
    necessities.
      It is the work of men who perform it for their own sake, and not that they
      may get more to eat or drink, or wear, or display. In a state of society
    where want is abolished, work of this sort could be enormously increased.&quot;  
    [from Book IX: Effects of the Remedy; Chapter 4: Of the changes that would
    be wrought in social organization and social life]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are likely to find that the problems of housing and education, instead
  of preceding the elimination of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty
  is first abolished. The poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal
  on their own to alter housing decay. Negroes, who have a double disability,
  will have a greater effect on discrimination when they have the additional
  weapon of cash to use in their struggle.</p>
<p>Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably
  will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual
  will flourish when the decisions concerning his life and in his own hands,
  when he has the assurance that his income is stable and certain, and when he
  know that he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts between
  husband, wife and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human
  worth on a scale of dollars is eliminated.</p>
<p>Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income
  operates as a consistently progressive measure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest
    levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate
    welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions.</li>
  <li>  Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically
        increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain
        static under
      growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic
      reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed
      income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without
        these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the
        gains of security
      and stability.</li>
</ul>
<p>This proposal is not a &quot;civil rights&quot; program, in the sense that
  that term is currently used. The program would benefit all the poor, including
  the two-thirds of them who are white. I hope that both Negro and white will
  act in coalition to effect this change, because their combined strength will
  be necessary to overcome the fierce opposition we must realistically anticipate.</p>
<p>Our nation's adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated if we
  realize that for nearly forty years two groups in our society have already
  been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom of our confused
  social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest and the poorest.
  The wealthy who own securities have always had an assured income; and their
  polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed an income, however miniscule,
  through welfare benefits.</p>
<p>John Kenneth Galbraith has estimated that $20 billion a year would effect
  a guaranteed income, which he describes as &quot;not much more than we will
  spend the next fiscal year to rescue freedom and democracy and religious liberty
  as these are defined by 'experts' in Vietnam.&quot;</p>
<p>The contemporary tendency in our society is to base our distribution on scarcity,
  which has vanished, and to compress our abundance into the overfed mouths of
  the middle and upper classes until they gag with superfluity. If democracy
  is to have breadth of meaning, it is necessary to adjust this inequity. It
  is not only moral, but it is also intelligent. We are wasting and degrading
  human life by clinging to archaic thinking.</p>
<p>The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel
  and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when
  men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil
  or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us
  to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.</p>

  <strong>&#8220;Where do we go from here?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p align="center">speech by The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.<br>
1967</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This address was made to the Tenth Anniversary Convention of the S.C.L.C.
    in Atlanta on August 16, 1967. Dr. King projected in it the issues which led
    to Poor People's March on Washington.(From: Foner, Philip S.; THE VOICE OF
    BLACK AMERICA; New York, 1972) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Where we are now</strong></p>
<p>Now, in order to answer the question, &quot;Where do we go from here?&quot; which
  is our theme, we must first honestly recognize where we are now. When the Constitution
  was written, a strange formula to determine taxes and representation declared
  that the Negro was 60 percent of a person. Today another curious formula seems
  to declare he is 50 percent of a person. Of the good things in life, the Negro
  has approximately one half those of whites. Of the bad things of life, he has
  twice those of whites.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Thus half of all Negroes live in substandard housing.</li>
  <li>  And Negroes have half the income of whites.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we view the negative experiences of life, the Negro has a double share.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  There are twice as many unemployed.</li>
  <li>  The rate of infant mortality among Negroes is double that of whites
    and</li>
  <li>  there are twice as many Negroes dying in Vietnam as whites in proportion
        to their size in the population.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other spheres, the figures are equally alarming.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  In elementary schools, Negroes lag one to three years behind whites,
    and</li>
  <li>  their segregated schools receive substantially less money per student
    than the white schools.</li>
  <li>  One twentieth as many Negroes as whites attend college.</li>
  <li>  Of employed Negroes, 75 percent hold menial jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where we are. Where do we go from here? First, we must massively assert
  our dignity and worth. We must stand up amidst a system that still oppresses
  us and develop an unassailable and majestic sense of values. We must no longer
  be ashamed of being black. The job of arousing manhood within a people that
  have been taught for so many centuries that they are nobody is not easy.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Depiction of Blackness and Negro Contributions</strong></p>
<p>Even semantics have conspired to make that which is black seem ugly and degrading.
  In Roget's Thesaurus there are 120 synonyms for blackness and at least 60 of
  them are offensive, as for example, blot, soot, grim, devil and foul. And there
  are some 134 synonyms for whiteness and all are favorable, expressed in such
  words as purity, cleanliness, chastity and innocence. A white lie is better
  than a black lie. The most degenerate member of a family is a &quot;black sheep.&quot; Ossie
  Davis has suggested that maybe the English language should be reconstructed
  so that teachers will not be forced to teach the Negro child 60 ways to despise
  himself, and thereby perpetuate his false sense of inferiority, and the white
  child 134 ways to adore himself, and thereby perpetuate his false sense of
  superiority.</p>
<p>The tendency to ignore the Negro's contribution to American life and to strip
  him of his personhood, is as old as the earliest history books and as contemporary
  as the morning's newspaper. To upset this cultural homicide, the Negro must
  rise up with an affirmation of his own Olympian manhood. Any movement for the
  Negro's freedom that overlooks this necessity is only waiting to be buried.
  As long as the mind is enslaved, the body can never be free. Psychological
  freedom, a firm sense of self-esteem, is the most powerful weapon against the
  long night of physical slavery. No Lincolnian Emancipation Proclamation or
  Johnsonian Civil Rights Bill can totally bring this kind of freedom. The Negro
  will only be free when he reaches down to the inner depths of his own being
  and signs with the pen and ink of assertive manhood his own Emancipation Proclamation.
  And, with a spirit straining toward true self-esteem, the Negro must boldly
  throw off the manacles of self-abnegation and say to himself and to the world, &quot;I
  am somebody. I am a person. I am a man with dignity and honor. I have a rich
  and noble history. How painful and exploited that history has been. Yes, I
  was a slave through my foreparents and I am not ashamed of that. I'm ashamed
  of the people who were so sinful to make me a slave.&quot; Yes, we must stand
  up and say, &quot;I'm black and I'm beautiful,&quot; and this self-affirmation
  is the black man's need, made compelling by the white man's crimes against
  him.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Basic Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Another basic challenge is to discover how to organize our strength in terms
  of economic and political power. No one can deny that the Negro is in dire
  need of this kind of legitimate power. Indeed, one of the great problems that
  the Negro confronts is his lack of power. From old plantations of the South
  to newer ghettos of the North, the Negro has been confined to a life of voicelessness
  and powerlessness. Stripped of the right to make decisions concerning his life
  and destiny he has been subject to the authoritarian and sometimes whimsical
  decisions of this white power structure. The plantation and ghetto were created
  by those who had power, both to confine those who had no power and to perpetuate
  their powerlessness. The problem of transforming the ghetto, therefore, is
  a problem of power - confrontation of the forces of power demanding change
  and the forces of power dedicated to the preserving of the status quo. Now
  power properly understood is nothing but the ability to achieve purpose. It
  is the strength required to bring about social, political and economic change.
  Walter Reuther defined power one day. He said, &quot;Power is the ability of
  a labor union like the U.A.W. to make the most powerful corporation in the
  world, General Motors, say 'Yes' when it wants to say 'No.' That's power.&quot;</p>
<p>Now a lot of us are preachers, and all of us have our moral convictions and
  concerns, and so often have problems with power. There is nothing wrong with
  power if power is used correctly. You see, what happened is that some of our
  philosophers got off base. And one of the great problems of history is that
  the concepts of love and power have usually been contrasted as opposites -
  polar opposites - so that love is identified with a resignation of power, and
  power with a denial of love.</p>
<p>It was this misinterpretation that caused Nietzsche, who was a philosopher
  of the will to power, to reject the Christian concept of love. It was this
  same misinterpretation which induced Christian theologians to reject the Nietzschean
  philosophy of the will to power in the name of the Christian idea of love.
  Now, we've got to get this thing right. What is needed is a realization that
  power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental
  and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice,
  and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against
  love. And this is what we must see as we move on. What has happened is that
  we have had it wrong and confused in our own country, and this has led Negro
  Americans in the past to seek their goals through power devoid of love and
  conscience.</p>
<p>This is leading a few extremists today to advocate for Negroes the same destructive
  and conscienceless power that they have justly abhorred in whites. It is precisely
  this collision of immoral power with powerless morality which constitutes the
  major crisis of our times.<br>
  </p>
<p><strong>Developing a Program?</strong></p>
<p>We must develop a program that will drive the nation to a guaranteed annual
  income. Now, early in this century this proposal would have been greeted with
  ridicule and denunciation, as destructive of initiative and responsibility.
  At that time economic status was considered the measure of the individual's
  ability and talents. And, in the thinking of that day, the absence of worldly
  goods indicated a want of industrious habits and moral fiber. We've come a
  long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the blind operation
  of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in the market operations
  of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust people into idleness
  and bind them in constant or frequent unemployment against their will. Today
  the poor are less often dismissed, I hope, from our consciences by being branded
  as inferior or incompetent. We also know that no matter how dynamically the
  economy develops and expands, it does not eliminate all poverty.</p>
<p>The problem indicates that our emphasis must be twofold. We must create full
  employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one
  method or the other. Once they are placed in this position we need to be concerned
  that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that
  enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional
  jobs are not available. In 1879 Henry George anticipated this state of affairs
  when he wrote in <em>Progress and Poverty</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The fact is that the work which improves the condition of mankind, the work
    which extends knowledge and increases power and enriches literature and elevates
    thought, is not done to secure a living. It is not the work of slaves driven
    to their tasks either by the task, by the taskmaster, or by animal necessity.
    It is the work of men who somehow find a form of work that brings a security
    for its own sake and a state of society where want is abolished. [Book IX:
    Effects of the Remedy; Chapter 4: Of the changes that would be wrought in
    social organization and social life]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
  Work of this sort could be enormously increased, and we are likely to find
  that the problems of housing and education, instead of preceding the elimination
  of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty is first abolished. The
  poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter
  housing decay. Negroes who have a double disability will have a greater effect
  on discrimination when they have the additional weapon of cash to use in their
  struggle.</p>
<p>Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably
  will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual
  will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands,
  when he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts among husbands,
  wives and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth
  on the scale of dollars is eliminated .</p>
<p>Now our country can do this. John Kenneth Galbraith said that a guaranteed
  annual income could be done for about twenty billion dollars a year. And I
  say to you today, that if our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars
  a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars
  to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children
  on their own two feet right here on earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p><strong>Commitment To Nonviolence</strong></p>
<p>Now, let me say briefly that we must reaffirm our commitment to nonviolence.
  I want to stress this. The futility of violence in the struggle for racial
  justice has been tragically etched in all the recent Negro riots. Yesterday,
  I tried to analyze the riots and deal with their causes. Today I want to give
  the other side. There is certainly something painfully sad about a riot. One
  sees screaming youngsters and angry adults fighting hopelessly and aimlessly
  against impossible odds. And deep down within them, you can even see a desire
  for self-destruction, a kind of suicidal longing.</p>
<p>Occasionally Negroes contend that the 1965 Watts riot and the other riots
  in various cities represented effective civil rights action. But those who
  express this view always end up with stumbling words when asked what concrete
  gains have been won as a result. At best, the riots have produced a little
  additional antipoverty money allotted by frightened government officials, and
  a few water-sprinklers to cool the children of the ghettos. It is something
  like improving the food in the prison while the people remain securely incarcerated
  behind bars. Nowhere have the riots won any concrete improvement such as have
  the organized protest demonstrations. When one tries to pin down advocates
  of violence as to what acts would be effective, the answers are blatantly illogical.
  Sometimes they talk of overthrowing racist state and local governments and
  they talk about guerrilla warfare. They fail to see that no internal revolution
  has ever succeeded in overthrowing a government by violence unless the government
  had already lost the allegiance and effective control of its armed forces.
  Anyone in his right mind knows that this will not happen in the United States.
  In a violent racial situation, the power structure has the local police, the
  state troopers, the National Guard and, finally, the Army to call on - all
  of which are predominantly white. Furthermore, few if any violent revolutions
  have been successful unless the violent minority had the sympathy and support
  of the nonresistant majority. Castro may have had only a few Cubans actually
  fighting with him up in the hills, but he could never have overthrown the Batista
  regime unless he had the sympathy of the vast majority of Cuban people.</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear that a violent revolution on the part of American blacks
  would find no sympathy and support from the white population and very little
  from the majority of the Negroes themselves. This is no time for romantic illusions
  and empty philosophical debates about freedom. This is a time for action. What
  is needed is a strategy for change, a tactical program that will bring the
  Negro into the mainstream of American life as quickly as possible. So far,
  this has only been offered by the nonviolent movement. Without recognizing
  this we will end up with solutions that don't solve, answers that don't answer
  and explanations that don't explain.</p>
<p>And so I say to you today that I still stand by nonviolence. And I am still
  convinced that it is the most potent weapon available to the Negro in his struggle
  for justice in this country. And the other thing is that I am concerned about
  a better world.</p>
<ul>
  <li> I'm concerned about justice.</li>
  <li>  I'm concerned about brotherhood.</li>
  <li>  I'm concerned about truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>And when one is concerned about these, he can never advocate violence. For
  through violence you may murder a murderer but you can't murder. Through violence
  you may murder a liar but you can't establish truth. Through violence you may
  murder a hater, but you can't murder hate. Darkness cannot put out darkness.
  Only light can do that.</p>
<p>And I say to you, I have also decided to stick to love. For I know that love
  is ultimately the only answer to mankind's problems. And I'm going to talk
  about it everywhere I go. I know it isn't popular to talk about it in some
  circles today. I'm not talking about emotional bosh when I talk about love,
  I'm talking about a strong, demanding love. And I have seen too much hate.
  I've seen too much hate on the faces of sheriffs in the South. I've seen hate
  on the faces of too many Klansmen and too many White Citizens Councilors in
  the South to want to hate myself, because every time I see it, I know that
  it does something to their faces and their personalities and I say to myself
  that hate is too great a burden to bear. I have decided to love. If you are
  seeking the highest good, I think you can find it through love. And the beautiful
  thing is that we are moving against wrong when we do it, because John was right,
  God is love. He who hates does not know God, but he who has love has the key
  that unlocks the door to the meaning of ultimate reality.</p>
<p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
  do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
  must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
  society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask
  the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
  when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic
  system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that question,
  you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that
  more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society.
  We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's market place.
  But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs
  restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my friends,
  when you deal with this,</p>
<ul>
  <li> you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot;</li>
  <li>  You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot;</li>
  <li>  You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay
    water bills in a world that is two thirds water?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are questions that must be asked.</p>
<p><strong>About Communism</strong><br>
    <br>
    Now, don't think that you have me in a &quot;bind&quot; today. I'm not talking
about Communism.</p>
<p>What I'm saying to you this morning is that Communism forgets that life is
  individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood
  is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of capitalism
  but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines
  the truths of both. Now, when I say question the whole society, it means ultimately
  coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation,
  and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that
  are interrelated.</p>
<p>If you will let me be a preacher just a little bit - One night, a juror came
  to Jesus and he wanted to know what he could do to be saved. Jesus didn't get
  bogged down in the kind of isolated approach of what he shouldn't do.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Jesus didn't say, &quot;Now Nicodemus, you must stop lying.&quot;</li>
  <li>  He didn't say, &quot;Nicodemus, you must stop cheating if you are doing
    that.&quot;</li>
  <li>  He didn't say, &quot;Nicodemus, you must not commit adultery.&quot;</li>
  <li> He didn't say, &quot;Nicodemus, now you must stop drinking liquor if you
    are doing that excessively.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>He said something altogether different, because Jesus realized something basic
  - that if a man will lie, he will steal. And if a man will steal, he will kill.
  So instead of just getting bogged down in one thing, Jesus looked at him and
  said, &quot;Nicodemus, you must be born again.&quot;</p>
<p>He said, in other words, &quot;Your whole structure must be changed.&quot; A
  nation that will keep people in slavery for 244 years will &quot;thingify&quot; them
  - make them things. Therefore they will exploit them, and poor people generally,
  economically. And a nation that will exploit economically will have to have
  foreign investments and everything else, and will have to use its military
  might to protect them. All of these problems are tied together. What I am saying
  today is that we must go from this convention and say, &quot;America, you must
  be born again!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So, I conclude by saying again today that we have a task and let us go out
  with a &quot;divine dissatisfaction.&quot;</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until America will no longer have a high blood
    pressure of creeds and an anemia of deeds.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until the tragic walls that separate the outer
    city of wealth and comfort and the inner city of poverty and despair shall
    be
    crushed by the battering rams of the forces of justice.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until those that live on the outskirts of hope
    are brought into the metropolis of daily security.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until slums are cast into the junk heaps of history,
    and every family is living in a decent sanitary home.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until the dark yesterdays of segregated schools
    will be transformed into bright tomorrows of quality, integrated education.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until integration is not seen as a problem but
    as an opportunity to participate in the beauty of diversity.</li>
  <li>Let us be dissatisfied until men and women, however black they may be,
    will be judged on the basis of the content of their character and not on the
    basis of the color of their skin. Let us be dissatisfied.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until every state capitol houses a governor who
    will do justice, who will love mercy and who will walk humbly with his
    God.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until from every city hall, justice will roll
      down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until that day when the lion and the lamb shall
      lie down together, and every man will sit under his own vine and fig tree
      and none
      shall be afraid.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied. And men will recognize that out of one blood
      God made all men to dwell upon the face of the earth.</li>
  <li>  Let us be dissatisfied until that day when nobody will shout &quot;White
      Power!&quot; - when nobody will shout &quot;Black Power!&quot; - but everybody
      will talk about God's power and human power.</li>
</ul>
<p>I must confess, my friends, the road ahead will not always be smooth. There
  will still be rocky places of frustration and meandering points of bewilderment.
  There will be inevitable setbacks here and there. There will be those moments
  when the buoyancy of hope will be transformed into the fatigue of despair.
  Our dreams will sometimes be shattered and our ethereal hopes blasted. We may
  again with tear-drenched eyes have to stand before the bier of some courageous
  civil-rights worker whose life will be snuffed out by the dastardly acts of
  bloodthirsty mobs. Difficult and painful as it is, we must walk on in the days
  ahead with an audacious faith in the future. And as we continue our charted
  course, we may gain consolation in the words so nobly left by that great black
  bard who was also a great freedom fighter of yesterday, James Weldon Johnson:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Stony the road we trod,<br>
    Bitter the chastening rod<br>
    Felt in the days<br>
    When hope unborn had died.</p>
  <p> Yet with a steady beat,<br>
    Have not our weary feet<br>
    Come to the place<br>
    For which our fathers sighed?</p>
  <p> We have come over the way<br>
    That with tears hath been watered.<br>
    We have come treading our paths<br>
    Through the blood of the slaughtered,</p>
  <p> Out from the gloomy past,<br>
    Till now we stand at last<br>
    Where the bright gleam<br>
    Of our bright star is cast.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let this affirmation be our ringing cry. It will give us the courage to face
  the uncertainties of the future. It will give our tired feet new strength as
  we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom. When our days become
  dreary with low hovering clouds of despair, and when our nights become darker
  than a thousand midnights, let us remember that there is a creative force in
  this universe, working to pull down the gigantic mountains of evil, a power
  that is able to make a way out of no way and transform dark yesterdays into
  bright tomorrows. Let us realize the arc of the moral universe is long but
  it bends toward justice.</p>
<p>Let us realize that William Cullen Bryant is right: &quot;Truth crushed to
  earth will rise again.&quot; Let us go out realizing that the Bible is right: &quot;Be
  not deceived, God is not mocked. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
  reap.&quot; This is our hope for the future, and with this faith we will be
  able to sing in some not too distant tomorrow with a cosmic past tense, &quot;We
  have overcome, we have overcome, deep in my heart, I did believe we would overcome.&quot;</p>
