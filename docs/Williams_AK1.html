<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
neoclassical economists' view of their proper role is rather like that
in The Realtor's Oath, which includes a vow 'To protect the individual
right of real estate ownership.' The word 'individual' is construed
broadly to include corporations, estates, trusts, anonymous offshore
funds, schools, government agencies, institutions, partnerships,
cooperatives, the Duke of Westminster, the Sultan of Brunei, the
Medellin Cartel, Saddam Hussein, congregations, Archbishops, families
(including criminal families) and so on, but 'individual' sounds more
all-American and subsumes them all. This is a potent chant that stirs
people to extremes of self-righteousness and siege mentality when
challenged."</span> - <a href="../auth/Gaffney.html">Professor Mason Gaffney</a>, US Geonomic academic<br>
</div>
<br>
We have just progressed through the <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Williams_Intro_Kit.html">Introductory</a>
and <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Williams_Intermediate_Kit.html">Intermediate</a> Kits. We
trust you now have a reasonable understanding of the fundamental
principles of economics, and are reassured enough to know that the path
to prosperity and social justice lies in a few elegant, simple laws. As
Einstein said, "If the formula itself is not beautiful, then it cannot
be true." In stark contrast, neoclassical economics is often ridden
with bamboozling jargon, mathematical formulae, models with absurd
assumptions, academic esoterica and totally abstract theories.<br>
<br>
Understanding this Advanced Kit will not require an economics or a
commerce degree - in fact, whoever has been indoctrinated in one might
even find it a hindrance, as I did!<br>
<br>
There's still much to discover, but we have already covered the essence
of it. The slogan "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pay for what you
take, not what you make</span>" is an axiom of sorts, for it admits of
exceptions, and we have to hang a few bells and whistles off our
general principles. No rigid dogma binds us, so that we can easily
cater for those few people who might fall through the cracks of
Geonomics. Some of the wisest and most compassionate features of the
old social welfare system would still apply.<br>
<br>
So again we're going to spiral around Geonomics, checking out some new
areas and delving deeper into some old ones. As your understanding
broadens, you yourself may well discover a multitude of downline
effects of an apparently simple change in taxation. But the end result
of a sane economic system and a commitment to real social justice is
almost unimaginable. When you are convinced, as we are, that Geonomics
is really the only viable solution to our present difficulties, then
you may offer to lend a hand. The best way to start is simply spreading
the word enthusiastically. Georgists have a terrible reputation for
ruining dinner parties!<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"<span style="font-style: italic;">LAND,
n. A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory
that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the
foundation of modern society, and is eminently worthy of the
superstructure. Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some
have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own
implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass
are enacted wherever property in land is recognised. It follows that if
the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no
place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist."</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="FEUDALISM" id="FEUDALISM"></a>HISTORY: THE RISE
AND FALL OF FEUDALISM</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"To
be ignorant of what happened before you were born is to be ever a
child, for what is man's lifetime without the memory of past events
woven with those of earlier times?"</span> - Cicero (106 - 43 BC),
Roman orator, statesman and man of letters</div>
<br>
One of the main reasons for the decline and fall of the Roman Empire
was economic. It had been eaten from within by that very malaise that
curses us today: the appropriation of the land on the part of a
powerful, politically empowered elite to the exclusion of the rest. The
result was inevitable. Who wants to fight for land he does not own?
Certainly not the slaves who were doing the donkey work to support the
landowners of the decaying Roman Empire.<br>
<br>
When the barbarian tribes began to turn into civilised nations, they
realised that the privilege of controlling land had to be
counterweighted by extra duties like the costs of administration,
defence and the social services (education, health, hostelry etc.).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BALANCED FEUDALISM - GIVING AND TAKING</span><br>
<br>
Hence Feudalism. This social system, which lasted about seven centuries
(far longer than either capitalism or socialism) consisted in an
exchange of services between king, nobility, the Church and the people.
Who did what?<br>
<br>
The king was the nominal owner of the land. This provided him with an
independent income, which allowed him (occasionally her) to govern. The
nobility were the actual occupiers of the various duchies, counties
etc. They controlled the land by taking part of the rent as
personal/family income and spending the rest in the services of
defence, administration and justice. The Church also occupied large
tracts of land, taking part of the rent for the upkeep of its
monasteries and spending the rest in the social services: education,
health, hostelry etc.<br>
<br>
The people supported the system by working, mostly agriculturally. For
about four weeks of the year the peasants worked either for their lord
in exchange for administration and defence costs or for the Church in
exchange for social services. 14-15 weeks of work would be enough for
the support of a medium to large family (small families were an
exception), and 10 weeks more would provide for whatever extras were
available in those days, like beer, bacon and the like. Working time
amounted to some 200 days/year, with 150 for leisure (from handicrafts
to Gothic cathedrals). There was no concept of unemployment or vagrancy.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT SO NOBLE!</span><br>
<br>
What broke the equilibrium was the nobility. Conventional history books
gloat over the English barons demanding "freedom" from king John by
forcing him to append his seal to the famous Magna Charta. What they
don't explain is the type of freedom demanded. It was freedom from
duty, i.e. from spending the excess rent on administration and defence.<br>
<br>
In time, the nobility of other countries followed suit, but
administration and defence costs remained, gradually becoming the
responsibility of the king. Increasingly it was the people who had to
pay for such, by means of increasing taxation.<br>
<br>
Things deteriorated, but not too much while the social services
remained in the hands of Church bureaucracy. A dramatic slide for the
worse occurred when the king, unable to get sufficient income, had to
start selling his land to the nobility, the only people who had the
money to buy it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT LAND GRAB</span><br>
<br>
The trend continued. Henry VIII of England having run out of land of
his own, confiscated Church lands while the nobility began the process
of enclosing more and more common land which forced the people either
to work in the large estates for bare subsistence or to starve outside
them.<br>
<br>
Slavery, shown the door during the first millennium, re-entered through
the window during the second. There exist in fact two ways of unjustly
appropriating the work of others: either considering a human being as
private property, or preventing him from accessing land and its natural
resources, forcing the landless to work for whatever conditions
dictated to them by the exclusive holders of land. Philosophically it
is possible to distinguish between the two forms of slavery. For those
at the receiving end it makes little difference.<br>
<br>
The process of enclosure was completed towards the end of the 18th
century. The landless, expelled from the commons where they had sought
refuge, had no choice but to pour into the cities, which at the time
were experiencing the Industrial Revolution.<br>
<br>
Conventional historians are only too ready to blame the Industrial
Revolution for the appalling social conditions of the workers, but keep
silent about the more plausible interpretation that it was the
Industrial Revolution which had actually saved those poor wretches from
starvation, however unwittingly.<br>

THE NEW SLAVERY</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
Irish Famine of '46 is example and proof. The corn crops were
sufficient to feed the island. But the landlords would have their rents
in spite of famine and in defiance of fever. They took the whole
harvest and left hunger to those who raised it. Had the people of
Ireland been the landlords of Ireland, not a human creature would have
died of hunger, nor the failure of the potato been considered a matter
of any consequence."</span> - James Fintan Lalor, (1807 - 49), Irish
patriot<br>
</div>
<br>
The accursed social conditions of workers during the Industrial
Revolution naturally prompted many inquiries - in those days, the
connection between the enclosures and the Dickensian conditions in the
cities was much more apparent.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ORIGINAL ECONOMISTS</span><br>
<br>
The first great inquirer was the Frenchman <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Quesnay </span>(1694-1774), "the European
Confucius" as they dubbed him, who recommended a tax on land as a
modern remedy to re-impose the old social charge on land ownership.
Another was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Turgot </span>(1727-81).
As Minister of Finance of Louis XVI he tried to abolish the
irresponsible privileges of the nobility, but they ganged up and
destroyed him instead. Even <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adam Smith</span>
(1723-90) noticed, but as he was in the pay of the Scottish Duke of
Buccleuch, he could not bite the "benefactor's" hand.<br>
<br>
When Professor <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thorold Rogers</span>
of Oxford (1823-90) dared expose the real causes of the relentless
plunging into poverty of the English people from Henry VIII to Queen
Victoria, he lost his chair at the University of Oxford. It would not
be the last time that the vested interests tried to muzzle a seeker
after truth.<br>
<br>
The complete picture cannot be had by perusing a single book. One has
to glean a good number of apparently unconnected symptoms before seeing
the larger image hidden in a confusing array of smaller ones.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Europe had serfdom. America, a younger
land, saw traditional slavery instituted afresh.</span> Why were the
African slaves not sent to Europe? - because Europe was already full of
such! H.M. Government indeed began enthusiastically to transport its
"surplus" population to Australia. The land there was "free" in the
sense that the militarily weak Aborigines could be rendered landless
with a few musket shots, much as the American Indians would a few
decades later.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NO LAND = NO HOPE</span><br>
<br>
At the time when Don Bosco was gathering his stray waifs thrown onto
the streets of Turin by the same policy of forced landlessness, the
blight struck the Irish potato, sole crop of the landless there. Eight
million of them, expelled from their ancestral lands for the benefit of
a couple of a hundred absentee landlords, were being rack-rented to the
point of either starvation or emigration. Meanwhile, Ireland remained a
net food exporter!<br>
<br>
The Irish and later the Italians, both militarily weak, crossed the
Atlantic. The British, militarily strong, and thrown out of America
three generations earlier, found their opportunity in Africa. They
enclosed the land and forced the indigenous people to work for them
exactly along the same pattern as their English and Scottish landowner
forebears had done before. But they had another problem: a surplus
industrial production that the impoverished Britons could not buy for
lack of purchasing power. So what did they do? They went to "open up"
China, Korea and Japan, which reacted with Oriental swiftness and
cunning deception, filibuster and well-struck murderous blows.<br>
<br>
The Second German Reich was not far behind, for it had the same
problem. Forty-odd years later the insane policy would explode into the
slaughter known to this day as the Great War.<br>
<br>
The American Civil War of 1861-65 dramatically exposed the difference
between the two forms of slavery. The economic victors were the
militarily defeated Confederates, who found that hired labour was a
great deal cheaper than having to feed, clothe, shelter and cure slaves.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Thus
the form of assessment which is the most simple, the most regular, the
most profitable to the state, and the least burdensome to the
tax-payers, is that which is made proportionate to and laid directly on
the source of continually regenerated wealth (land)."</span> - Francois

 name="GEORGE" id="GEORGE"></a>HISTORY: HENRY
GEORGE AND THE LAND VALUE TAX</span><br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"We
ought to tax all idle land the way Henry George said - tax it heavily
so that its owners have to make it productive." </span>- Henry Ford,
(1863 - 1947)<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"I
believe that Henry George was one of those really great thinkers
produced by our country."</span> - Franklin D. Roosevelt, (1882 - 1945)<br>
</div>
<br>
Beyond knowing that Henry George had all the experience he needed in
terms of poverty, odd-jobbing, writing and publishing, the life of this
man of vision can be read elsewhere. On finding himself out of work in
Philadelphia, he followed the trail of the forty-niners to San
Francisco. Two expeditions in search of gold produced nothing but
hunger and disappointment.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT PARADOX</span><br>
<br>
For a long time an idea was turning over in his head. 
<ul>
  <li>Why are salaries in new countries always higher than in old ones?  </li>
  <li>Why do progress and poverty not only appear together, but also
drift farther and farther apart?  </li>
  <li>Why are public as well as private charity impotent in solving the
problem with any permanence?  </li>
  <li>Why do beggars, tramps and prostitutes cluster around
millionaires' districts?</li>
</ul>
In San Francisco he had seen the growth of progress together with
poverty. A trip to New York showed him the process in its full
maturity. The shocking contrast between the most bare-faced opulence
with the most abject squalor turned into an obsession the need to find
an answer to the old question.<br>
<br>
But he did not find that answer in New York. He found it in San
Francisco a few months later. During a horse ride in the hills east of
the city he dismounted to let the animal rest. Just to start
conversation he asked a teamster what the value of land was in the
district. "I don't know," answered the man, "but there is a man over
there asking 1000 dollars for an acre." What was happening "over there"
for an acre of land to be worth a fortune in the California of 1869?<br>
<br>
The transcontinental railway was about to arrive. The land value
throughout Oakland was being catapulted to the stars with speculators
vying with each other to secure land titles before the arrival of those
who would need land to live and work.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"EUREKA!"</span><br>
<br>
In a flash, George understood. Land value increases with the increase
in population, and those who needed land had to pay for the privilege
of using it. But the land is the primary source of all that human
beings need to live. If there is such a thing as a universal right to
life, there must also be a universal right to the Global Commons
necessary for life. He who owns ends up controlling the destiny of him
who works. Words like "republicanism" or "democracy" may be
high-sounding, but empty.<br>
<br>
The remedy suggests itself. To restore the control of land to those who
use it, it is enough to take the rent of it as a social charge with
which to defray public expenditure. The rent of land, instead of ending
up in private pockets, would pay for defence, administration and the
social services. Put it another way, let whoever occupies land pay in
proportion to the quantity and quality of value subtracted from the
common resources of nature, not for value added on them by his/her own
exertion. And let all receive the value of those resources in the form
of public services. Nobody would thus be defrauded of the fruits of
their labour, and the load of taxation would cease to fall on
production.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There was nothing new in that flash of
understanding. He had independently arrived at the conclusions of
feudalism, of Quesnay and of Turgot, without having ever heard of the
three.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HIS WORK</span><br>
<br>
He began studying and writing. In 1879, at 40, he finished <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>. The book is still
in print, by far outselling all the works of Marx put together and has
been translated into the major world languages.<br>
<br>
In the 1880s and 1890s Henry George had captivated much of the
English-speaking world with his books and hundreds of public speeches.
The merit of Henry George is therefore not originality but an uncommon
clear argument backed by a polished expression that makes of the book a
classic of both economics and literature. Why is its author then not
better known? Because he championed the efficiency of Land Value
Taxation so well and identified the underlying cause of social
injustice so successfully that he had to be stopped.<br>
<br>
And he was stopped, by the so-called neo-classical economists
bankrolled by vested interests.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
socialist mistake [is] looking on capital and labour as the two factors
of production and as the two parties to the division of the produce. As
a matter of fact there are, in our highly-developed industrial system,
three parties of production, and always a fourth and generally a fifth
related to distribution. In addition to A the employing capitalist and
B the employed labourer, there are C the landowner, D the tax collector
and generally E the representative of monopolies other than that of
land. What A and B can divide between them is not the product of their
joint efforts, but the product which C, D and E leaves to them."</span>

there will always be incentives to wage war.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE TIMELESS CAUSE OF CONFLICT</span><br>
<br>
The issue is territorial conquest. If you examine the causes of war,
you won't be able to identify many for which territorial conquest was
not an important factor. This is especially the case if you broaden the
term territory to include water (one of the things over which scores of
future wars will be fought, many say) and minerals (including oil).<br>
<br>
Wherever a society exists in which individuals or groups can own the
Earth outright and thereby profit enormously, then there's going to be
a great temptation to seize a few of the best chunks. Of course,
there'll be some ostensible justification for this confiscation, such
as:
<ul>
  <li>Some silly nationalistic "principle", like ethnic pride or
vengeance</li>
  <li>Some historical justification, like "we had it first"
(selectively choosing how far back in history to go)</li>
  <li>A pre-emptive move of forward self-defense in the face of
imminent (or beat-up) threats by a hostile neighbour</li>
</ul>
One way or another, nearly all war is about territory in the end. As
humans are physical beings, somehow stuck in time and three dimensions,
this must be ever so. If we are going to claim exclusive and eternal
possession of some of the physical environment where our bodies -
pretty much locked to our consciousnesses - want to move, then it's no
wonder that one may hear big, loud, angry-sounding bumps sometimes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT MAKES LAND SO SPECIAL</span><br>
<br>
Land is limited, a minimum of it is essential for survival, and its
quality varies greatly. This presently gives a big incentive to some
individuals/clans/tribes/ethnic groups/nations to grab more than their
fair share. And, seeing how generals or demagogues in charge usually
ensure that their own nests are pretty well-feathered, the poor old
plebs are often led into a war from which they will gain little if
anything - as the poem at the head of the page well illustrates.<br>
<br>
So how would LVT change all this? Well, it wouldn't change it all but
it would, for starters, eliminate or greatly reduce that particular
incentive for individual or group gain arising through the possibility
of claiming ownership of natural resources, including land.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A CHANGE IN CONSCIOUSNESS?</span><br>
<br>
And here's a completely different tack: while greed, malice and
cynicism rule human hearts, no system of government can hope to
eliminate war. But, given enough time, perhaps an enabling environment
would nurture more the virtuous than the vicious side of humanity and
eventually bring about peace on a personal level - a sort of bottom-up
approach. For instance, the more people there are who understand the
philosophy of social justice (not to mention the potential prosperity)
that LVT confers, the less likely they are to believe and follow some
ranting populist playing the cheap nationalist card to drag a
bewildered population into yet another war.<br>
<br>
On that very point, Henry George also believed in the innate goodness
of humanity, and seemed to inspire it among those who knew him. George
was not na&iuml;ve of our human flaws, yet was convinced that our
system of land monopoly capitalism had degraded many of our higher
virtues, and herein lay great hope. As Helen Keller said of George,
"Who reads shall find in Henry George's philosophy a rare beauty and
power of inspiration, and a splendid faith in the essential nobility of
human nature." Contrast this to the cynicism of Hitler, who wrote in
Mein Kampf "If you wish the sympathy of broad masses, then you must
tell them the crudest and most stupid things."<br>
<br>
If Hitler was right, humanity is irredeemable. If George was right, the
principles he enunciated and elaborated could encourage humanity to
such a level of social development that few would feel the need to
respond to rabble-rousing warmongers. But whatever the case, it cannot
be denied that LVT would greatly reduce the financial incentive to
violently grab natural resources.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">GOING GLOBAL</span><br>
<br>
Want to hear a wild dream of mine? The day might dawn when Geonomics
extends beyond arbitrary political boundaries to incorporate all
peoples. Nations with natural advantages (mineral wealth, small
population, benign climate, well-located sea ports etc.) would
voluntarily pay more "international LVT" to a Global Resource Agency
than others. Revenues raised could fund sustainable development
programs and environmental restoration. Where is the justice in, say, a
dirt-poor Yemeni being born on the wrong side of the border with
oil-rich Saudi Arabia?<br>

realised that natural resources should be a common heritage." </span>-

spotted in Melbourne recently)</div>
<br>
Wherever land monopolists can gain fabulous wealth without lifting a
finger, the ultimate insult to their resource-poor fellow humans is the
fact that they, with the assistance of their creative accountants and
cunning lawyers, can get away with paying little or no tax.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TAX IS OPTIONAL - FOR THE RICH!</span><br>
<br>
As a general rule, those with the resources to pay, don't pay. Family
trusts, dodgy charities, anonymous offshore funds, widespread rorts
such as the bottom-of-the-harbour tax schemes, tax havens, the
underground cash economy and more exist all over the world because no
amount of tax legislation has ever been able to keep up with the
widespread means to evade tax. We've had endless tax reforms and
promises from governments to make everyone pay their fair share but, if
anything, tax evasion is steadily getting worse. The rise of
globalisation and its concomitant transfer pricing to companies set up
in low-tax or zero-tax countries considerably lessens the ability of
sovereign governments to levy taxes from companies and corporations.
Governments then look to the softest source from which to extract
taxes, through Pay-As-You-Earn schemes and Point-Of-Sale or Service
taxes, all of which are to a greater or lesser degree regressive and
therefore inequitable.<br>
<br>
In the Third World, tax collection is usually an utterly different ball
game. There, ordinary people cannot or will not keep financial records
for tax purposes, like those demanded of us. Instead, businesses are
"assessed" most rudimentarily. A retailer will have his stock roughly
valued or a caf&eacute; owner's seats will be counted, and some
guesstimate will be made as to the annual income and capacity to pay
tax. This method goes back to biblical days, and tax assessors have the
same notorious reputation for corruption now as tax assessor-collectors
had then. The process is simple: the businessman will grease an
assessor's palm and his assessment suddenly becomes much more
"reasonable". This is the basic springboard for the Third World's
endemic corruption, and it will definitely remain this way until
Geonomics is implemented.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THERE'S NO ESCAPE!</span><br>
<br>
The contrast with Geonomics is total. It's not that LVT, as we propose
it, cannot largely be evaded - it's that it cannot be evaded at all!
Land is unique in that it can't be disguised, shifted offshore, or
hidden under a tree, a building or a rug.<br>
<br>
There is a variety of tools to ensure that LVT assessments are fair,
reasonable and free of corruption such as software-assisted crosschecks
and comparisons, as well as laid-down formulae covering various
assessment factors. But the really important anti-evasion and
anti-corruption measure upon which Geonomists insist is that all
assessments should be completely open to scrutiny. Thus you will be
able to visit the nearest office (or website) of the Valuer General and
scrutinise your neighbours' assessments and how they were calculated.
And also Kerry Packer's. Here lies another reason why plutocrats and
the mega-wealthy fought so hard to discredit Henry George, finally
deciding to instead silence him by bankrolling the introduction of
neoclassical economics and the virtual removal of Geonomics from
economics curricula.<br>

 name="WHY" id="WHY"></a>WHY LVT CANNOT BE PASSED
ON TO THE TENANT</span><br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"A
tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses. It would
fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a
monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use
of his ground." </span>- Adam Smith, (1720 - 1790)<br>
</div>
<br>
Adam Smith's statement above is the voice of authority. But we are
going to prove what he just states. In this section we shall endeavour:<br>
<ul>
  <li>To prove that a landlord cannot shift a tax levied on land values
on to a tenant</li>
  <li>To deepen your understanding of classical economics and</li>
  <li>To stimulate in you a bit of love for the understanding of real
economics, instead of thinking it as dry and dead boring.</li>
</ul>
With most commodities, the imposition of taxes leads producers/traders
to pass on the tax to consumers, eventually resulting in higher prices
and lower sales. But land is something quite unique, as we've seen, and
doesn't behave like a mere commodity.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE MENACE OF MONOPOLY</span><br>
<br>
Land effectively behaves as a monopoly good - the rent is not
determined by any cost of production, for it is already the highest
price that anyone will offer for it. There is no substitute for the
valuable land that individuals and businesses need - one can't go out
into the desert and haul in prime real estate!<br>
<br>
The LVT would not somehow increase the willingness of anyone to pay
more for the land than before, nor would it in any way add to the
ability of the owner to demand more. To suppose that LVT could be just
offloaded on tenants is to suppose that landowners did not already get
for their land all that it brought. In other words, it supposes that,
whenever they wanted to, landowners could put up prices as they please!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A PARADOX</span><br>
<br>
Here's the paradoxical twist. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">As
far as one can predict, LVT would - in a country like Australia, with
so much valuable unused land - tend strongly to lower rents. Owners of
unused land who previously were holding out for higher prices would now
be driven by LVT to seek purchasers or tenants, thereby having to lower
the asking price.</span> And, for land which is being rented, the
landowner would have to forfeit part or all of his cut to the
government. However the selling price of land, determined by net rents
to the landowner, would necessarily be much diminished (with full LVT
collection, the selling price would be around zero).<br>
<br>
Radical as Geonomics is, here - contrary to appearances - we are not
arguing about anything contentious or new. It is generally conceded by
knowledgeable economists that the landlord cannot transfer taxes levied
upon rent to the tenant. It is accepted that a tax upon anything of
which the supply is fixed or monopolised, and of which its cost of
production is not therefore a determining element (since it has no
effect in checking supply), does not increase prices and falls entirely
on the owner.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TAX RENT, NOT AREA</span><br>
<br>
But here's an interesting and important distinction: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a tax on land values is not a tax on all
land. </span>And a tax on all land - say, so many fixed $ per square
metre - would actually fall on the user. For such a tax - falling
equally on the poorest, sub-marginal land as well as the best - would
become a condition imposed on the use of any land, from which there
could be no escape, and thus the owners of rentable land could add the
tax to their rent. But we shouldn't let this little diversion confuse
things - Geonomists certainly do not support any tax falling equally on
all land, for a tax on economic rent (i.e. on land values) would not
fall on all land.<br>
<br>
History has something revealing to tell us here. When Henry George was
inspiring millions of supporters around the world, it was none other
than the big landlords who fought him so zealously, for they realised
well enough that LVT cannot be shifted on to tenants. If it could, why
the fierce opposition and frenzied cries of "confiscation"?<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"A
tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord. There are no means by which
he can shift the burden upon anyone else. It does not affect the value
or price of agricultural produce, for this is determined by the cost of
production in the most unfavourable circumstances, and in those
circumstances, as we have so often demonstrated, no rent is paid. A tax
on rent, therefore, has no effect other than its obvious one. It merely
takes so much from the landlord and transfers it to the State." </span>-

RESPECTED</span><br>

<br>
This is purely speculative, but still worth a visit. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We're going to look at some of our
worst social problems and reflect on the extent to which they might
arise from our economic and social systems.</span><br>
<br>
Many good, caring parents bring up children who turn out to be a real
mess. There must be something wrong, somewhere, with a society where so
many people become depressed, cynical, disenchanted, hopeless,
alienated etc. as to resort to drugs, vandalism, suicide (the
escalating youth suicide figures are deliberately under-reported) or
just end up apathetic or anti-social. And it could be argued that
rampant, mindless and expensive consumerism is a low-intensity but
widespread indicator of underlying discontent.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT'S MISSING?</span><br>
<br>
One can see some pretty obvious causes, but it still doesn't add up.
Institutionalised religions (or, at least, its purveyors) have clearly
failed to supply an adequate explanation of our current dilemma, let
alone offer just solutions, as people continue to turn away from it in
droves. Our cynicism of politicians is somewhat justified, as even a
few of the best seem to sell out once they get into power. The
bombardment of advertising and trash culture, with all its emphasis on
glamour and image, must screw up a lot of impressionable kids. I like
the graffiti sprayed on a Melbourne wall stating: " Obedient sheep love
to shop".<br>
<br>
No, it still doesn't add up, but here's a partial explanation why. All
the aforementioned problems take place in an economic environment which
simply is not and cannot be understood, and for that reason can never
be respected. In particular, taxation - which hits us in the hip pocket
more than anything else - springs from a mass of legislation completely
beyond the capacity of any individual to understand. In addition,
there's disrespect for our tax (and governance) system because there's
no clear rationale or validation for its principles. Compared to the
elegant beauty of Pay for what you take, not what you make, the present
tax system is seen as a necessary nuisance at best, but more commonly
as an arbitrary means of milking us. Furthermore, the economic and tax
systems make cynics and cheats of us all. Cynics - the wage-earning
workforce, both blue and white collar - stand in disgust as they
witness the rich getting richer as they confiscate the economic rent.
Cheats, because everyone else is a cheat when it comes to filling tax
returns, so why should I be a mug and be honest?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHERE INVESTMENT SHOULD GO</span><br>
<br>
Lastly, social alienation is partly a result of an economic system that
cannot afford to invest in community-building amenities and
infrastructure. We have seen how such spending effectively disappears
into the black hole of landowners' pockets instead of being recycled
back to the community through LVT, and we have also imagined A Day in
the Life which illustrates what affordable community amenities could
bring people together. But the whole area of the personal and social
benefits conferred by a stronger community network is a vast and
debatable subject in itself, and is beyond the basics of Geonomics in
these kits.<br>
