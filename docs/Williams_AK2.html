<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Percy Shelley,
(1792 - 1822), English poet<br>
</div>
<br>
It's both fascinating and disappointing to see how excessive rates of
interest are today so generally and meekly accepted by the public. Only
until a few centuries ago usury, which is the old word for the practice
of lending money at exorbitant rates of interest, was one of the
long-standing worst sins of Christendom. Islam widely outlaws interest
and excessive profit margins of any kind even today.<br>
<br>
In many respects, the basis for this prohibition is as valid now as it
was then. It is this: a significant proportion of the interest demanded
is immoral in that it is unearned and therefore undeserved. Certainly
the lender needs to be reimbursed to take account of administrative
costs, the effect of inflation, and the element of risk involved, but
what has the lender done to deserve a rate of return above and beyond
this?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LAND, AGAIN</span><br>
<br>
However varied the factors determining the rate of interest may be, the
land issue plays an overriding role. Essentially, the rate of return
available from land props up the rate of return available to
moneylenders (i.e. the profitability of holding land supports excessive
interest rates).<br>
<br>
There are two distinct yields available from land. 
<ul>
  <li>The first, its natural agricultural fertility, is of little
importance in the modern world.  </li>
  <li>The second, its locational value, remains as important as ever
and is produced by the activities of society, but ends up in private
hands under land monopoly capitalism.</li>
</ul>
The new and extremely important point is that, in the long run, the
rate of return available to investors in land is the most lucrative of
all, effectively acting as a de facto benchmark as the highest rate of
return, allowing for risk. Indeed, during the period 1960 - 2000 in
Australia, land values increased on average 5.8% pa, whereas household
disposable income only increased 1.96% pa. This gets us back to the
very nature of land. The fact that it is limited in supply and is an
unavoidable necessity for human existence means that rising populations
make land increasingly scarce and valuable, thus bidding up its price.
The other powerful, sure boost to land values arises from the fact that
the locational value of land is increased by society, particularly
through the provision of infrastructure. And history has shown that,
wherever an industry has boomed through enterprise and inventiveness,
land prices soar in its vicinity. For a recent example of this ageless
phenomenon, look at the recent spectacular rises in land prices in
Silicon Valley. So, with land being a sure-fire investment winner, why
would anyone lend for a rate less than that available from investing in
land? The corollary here is that, as we collect LVT and cut out the
opportunities to profit from owning land, interest rates must then
fall. The banking issue is not simple and deserves its own section
which follows, where the privilege of banks to create credit is
specifically dealt with.<br>

AND THE MONEY SUPPLY</span><br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"So
long as a few people have the privilege of inventing money, no one in
the country except those few people can really possess private property
at all. The rest of us in our fancied property are but tenants-at-will
of the bankers in the sense that the bankers can at any time that they
wish force us to surrender it. It is idle to say that in practice this
does not happen. In practice it happens every day. Two hundred years
ago Berkeley prophesied that it would happen. One hundred years ago
Cobbett showed that it was happening. Today we can see it happening
around us." </span>- Christopher Hollis in The Two Nations<br>
</div>
<br>
There is another great and rarely-seen source of privilege milking us -
the privilege of private banks "creating" money out of credit.
Essentially, through the so-called multiplier effect, banks can lend
out far more money than they have as deposits, all the while charging
interest as if the basis for their lending was based on something as
real as the banknotes in your wallet. Furthermore, banks have claimed a
special status and importance such that, when their irresponsible and
risky practice of lending money they don't possess gets them in
trouble, governments (read: ordinary mugs like you and I!) often have
to come to the rescue and bail them out.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">FOR PEOPLE, NOT PRIVILEGE!</span><br>
<br>
The "privilege of inventing money", like the privilege to own land,
needs to become a source of wealth for society instead of being, as it
is now, a source of power for a few at the expense of everyone else.
The fraud consists:
<ul>
  <li>In inventing money disguised as loans, and therefore burdened
with a debt that has no reason to be</li>
  <li>In inventing money not at the time and for the purpose needed,
but at the whim of banks and their clients, i.e. completely divorced
from the real economy</li>
</ul>
The story of how the banking system acquired the privilege of
defrauding the public can be read elsewhere. Here it is important to
note that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">high interest
rates are indissolubly linked to the land monopoly</span>. When land,
instead of being widely distributed, is grabbed by a powerful minority,
investing in land becomes the most profitable type of investment, with
returns guaranteed with increasing population and public infrastructure
growing around it.<br>
<br>
With such high returns to land, no one therefore would deposit money in
a bank at an interest lower than what land can offer. But banks have to
make money, so they have to lend at an interest higher than that at
which they borrow. Result: two economies come into being: one reserved
to banks and money manipulators earning returns while creating no
wealth, and the other, the real economy of production which is either
starved of necessary liquidity or forced to pay usurious interest.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A COMMON RESOURCE</span><br>
<br>
The solution is to consider money as what it is, i.e. an artificial
common resource. As such, it should be issued by the public monetary
authority debt-free, when the natural growth of the economy dictates.
How can we determine if the real wealth of an economy has grown
sufficiently in order for the government to issue more money? By the
value of land, again! Instead of basing our money supply on reserves of
gold and the whims of bankers, money should be based on the real wealth
of our nation, and nothing reflects our real wealth better than the
value of our land and natural resources. Build infrastructure and our
land values increase. Clean up the environment, reduce crime, and
generally make our nation a better place to live and our land values
increase. But do something dumb like get involved in a war and our land
values decrease. Land and natural resources should be the true
indicator of our real underlying wealth instead of paper profits, funny
money and ingots of gold. Some geonomists have been increasing
proposing such a radical monetary reform which would abolish the
outrageous privileges that banks possess.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, governments should issue money as public revenue, to be
spent on capital development works like roads, dams, bridges and
everything that increases the production of economic and environmental
wealth and health. Such an increase in public revenue from a common
resource would eliminate once and for all the anomaly of the present
system, where private power lords it over public resources destroying
the environment in the process, and public power plunders the private
resources of capital and labour, impoverishing both.<br>
<br>

<br>
Speculation in foreign currencies has reached astronomical dimensions,
with professionals like George Soros becoming billionaires in the
process. But what wealth do they create in all of this? The fact of the
matter is that they get something for nothing - and their unearned
profits are orders of magnitude more than an ordinary working person
could possibly save in a lifetime, all for a few hours of playing the
market!<br>
<br>
If the foreign currency scene was just like a casino in which players
bet amongst themselves, then ordinary folk could not complain. But
that's not the case at all, which is why it's so lucrative. Some of the
unwitting downline losers are taxpayers, ordinary consumers, and small
investors in the share market and superannuation funds.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BIG BULLY-BOYS!</span><br>
<br>
Furthermore, in an age of increasing globalisation, when currency
speculators are so big and influential that they can manipulate the
very markets in which they're playing, they can sway national economies
at their whim. That the foreign exchange market is now so massive as to
be, in itself, a source of increasing instability in the economic world
is reason enough to clamp down on it. But the big reason, it may be
argued, is plain ethical: to reap where you don't sow means that, for
every million that goes into a speculator's bank account, some other
people somewhere are going to have to produce a million dollars worth
of wealth for which they will not get paid.<br>
<br>
The fact that this outrageous form of legalised robbery can have
persisted for so long without any preventative action being taken by
governments (except, perhaps, in Malaysia) is disturbing to say the
least. And, when a fairly effective remedy has long been proposed, it
becomes doubly disturbing.<br>
<br>
The way speculators have been able to profit until now is by feeding on
economic instability and its resulting currency fluctuations. The odds
are with them that they can make a small, profitable gain in each of
many transactions, but do so in massive enough dimensions as to make
hefty profits. The proposed remedy is the so-called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Tobin tax</span>, whereby a very modest
(about 0.2 - 0.5%) tax would apply to the approx. $1.8 trillion that
crosses borders every day. The revenues from the tax could fund
sustainable development programs, peacekeeping activities and the like.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW IT WORKS</span><br>
<br>
The Tobin tax would be enough to make nearly all speculative dealings
unprofitable, as well as to alleviate currency instability and related
financial crises caused by the immense present levels of foreign
exchange trading. This measure would have little effect on ordinary,
legitimate transactions. It has to be said, however, that a few
Geonomists argue against the Tobin tax, emphasising how the ability to
gain ordinate power and to manipulate exchange rates would largely be
solved when the land issue is addressed. In any case, others criticise
it as it would penalise and obstruct non-speculative financial
transactions.<br>
<br>
Windfall profits of huge proportions are also made in the share and
commodities markets. In a truly free and fair market, the share market
plays a useful role in bringing enterprises and investors together for
their mutual benefit. But purely speculative profits are unearned in
the sense that the profit-maker has created no wealth, and again some
other mugs, in the end, have to indirectly pay for this.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE DISTINCTION</span><br>
<br>
The solution lies in distinguishing between these speculators and
long-term investors. The latter are looking for a safe place to invest
and a fair rate of return in the medium and long term. Something
similar to the Tobin tax might do the job, in that a modest tax would
neither deter genuine investors nor greatly diminish their returns in
the long run. But it would be enough to deter parasitic speculators
primarily seeking short-term profits.<br>
<br>
To some extent, the opportunity to make quick bucks exists because of
speculative opportunities in the land "bubble" market and the
consequent boom-bust economic cycles fuelled by land monopoly
capitalism. The whole issue of boom-bust cycles deserves its own
section.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"I
think in principle it's a good idea to tax unimproved land, and
particularly capital gains (windfalls) on it. Theory says we should try

</div>
<br>
For all their dismal policy failures, economists always seem to present
themselves as having learnt from the past mistakes of others and to
have caught on to the right policy mix. And yet they, too, are
invariably criticised by the succeeding generation of economists who
themselves trumpet the reasons why they have now got it right. And
nothing exemplifies this ongoing farce more than the debates
surrounding the economic boom and bust cycles - or, more particularly,
the reasons for economic recessions. We can confidently predict that
conventional neoclassical economists will never find the solution in
their own gloomy cupboards.<br>
<br>
We know already how the failure to distinguish land from capital
fatally flaws neoclassical economics at its very core. This confusion
has been taken a step further by the real estate business in a way
that, when you see it for what it is, verges on the absurd.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WORDS THAT OBSCURE</span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real estate terminology
obscures the whole land issue by hardly ever separating land from
buildings, but lumping the two together as "property."</span>&nbsp; So
when land prices start rising, the real estate sector terms this a
property boom or housing boom, concealing the fact that houses (or
capital) cannot but depreciate over time while land always appreciates.
They speak of the "housing market" as if houses levitated all over the
place. In point of fact, housing construction costs - both labour and
material combined - have declined in real terms in Australia over the
thirty five years to 1985 by 1%, while over the same period, land price
has skyrocketed by a very healthy average of around 6% per annum!<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">So, the media have convinced
the public that a "healthy property market" is a good thing and - hey!
- if you're a speculator, then you begin rubbing your hands with glee
as you estimate your latest windfall. </span>If you are a home-owner
however, your "new" net worth is of little benefit if you intend
selling up and moving, since the price of the home which you intend to
buy will in most cases have risen by a similar margin, so where is the
gain?. Well, we've got news for you. It is rising land prices that
precede and are the primary cause nearly all economic recessions.
First, these recurrent booms starve the economy as funds are poured
into land instead of productive capital, and second, they choke any
immediate chance of recovery as businesses have to pay more and more
for land.<br>
<br>
Now we get back to the peculiar nature of land. In a growing economy,
land prices must rise because competition for land sites cannot be
satisfied by producing more sites. While the real estate industry is
merrily singing about the vigor of the property market, the cost of
space begins to outpace profit margins, and the economy is headed for a
recession.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"RUSH FOR THE EXIT!"</span><br>
<br>
But we never spot the looming recession before it's too late, because
once people observe a rise in land values, they too want to get in on
the act, thus pushing up land prices even further. And away we go on
this boom that isn't a boom at all, only a speculative bubble!<br>
<br>
We do get a few warnings, but our learned friends in the real estate
sector dress them up as indicators of rosy investment opportunities. As
the real estate market continues to "strengthen", the cost of occupancy
forces companies either to pay up even more or move elsewhere. And the
suffering soon spreads, because unrealistic land prices must take a cut
from the returns to labour and capital. As a result there is less
purchasing power to buy the goods and services of others, general
production is checked, and the whole downward spiral towards recession
has begun.<br>
<br>
At a certain point in the land boom, buyers realise that the yields on
their investments are not keeping pace with exorbitant land values, and
demand for land drops, in turn causing prices to level off. This is the
moment of collective d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. Suddenly the speculators
realise, "Uh, oh! I think I've been here before!", and begin panic
selling as they realise that their investments could earn more
elsewhere. The turning tide becomes a flash flood, as speculators
recognise that the only way out is to sell quickly before prospective
buyers realise that the bottom has dropped out of the market. At the
same time some start to default on loans which they had taken out to
make their now-overvalued speculative purchases, and at this point the
banking sector is involved in the domino effect. The banks have
over-extended themselves on the speculative land bubble, and when they
must start to recall their loans, the knock-on consequences can be even
more severe.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">YOU KNOW THE REST&#8230;</span><br>
<br>
The rest is history, literally. Speculation in land (or in the shares
of companies owning natural resources) can be isolated as the prime
factor for practically every periodic panic that has caused economic
crises. Of course, there are all sorts of contributing factors or even
effects that governments, real estate professionals and neoclassical
economists will claim to be the major cause of recessions. In the 19th
century, governments often used the printing presses to increase the
money supply in desperate attempts to stave off the inevitable crises.
The restrictive trade policies of the Great Depression were not really
a cause but rather an outcome, which in turn exacerbated things. But
the great initiatory cause is invariably the speculative advance in
land price, but it's difficult to spot because it does its dirty work
while everyone is crying, "Boom, boom! Robust land market!"<br>
<br>
Broadly speaking, the recession will continue until one or more of
three things occur:
<ul>
  <li>Land values fall to affordable levels again</li>
  <li>The efficiency of labour and technology increases</li>
  <li>Labour and capital are forced to accept cuts in wages and
interest.</li>
</ul>
A boom can never be genuine under land monopoly capitalism, for
speculators inevitably bid up the price of scarce land. And when money
is diverted to speculative purposes, it is effectively sterilised, for
buying land does not create wealth (machines or jobs).<br>

The above quote just about says it all. However, because of a good deal
of misinformation about this aspect of Geonomics (with a liberal
sprinkling of half-baked, alarmist words such as socialisation,
nationalisation or confiscation with respect to land), we need to get
things straight.<br>
<br>
Land titles would definitely still exist with Geonomics. People would
still have "their" home and "their" privacy, and there's nothing unfair
or unreasonable about that. Indeed, it is a universal human need that
cannot be denied and should not be thwarted. Importantly, land
occupancy requires not so much absolute and outright ownership, but
security of tenure, and as a corollary, the freedom to do as one wishes
with the site, within the limits of course, of existing social mores.
Whether building a house, enrolling your kids in the nearby school, or
just wanting to contribute towards building up a neighbourhood, you
would want to know that you would be able to occupy your home site for
as long as you wished. Hence, your name would still be on a register of
land titles, and no one could compulsorily buy or force you out as long
as you paid your community dues in the form of LVT. Council by-laws
allowing, you could even put up fences and "Keep Out" signs. All the
trappings of present-day land ownership would still be there.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT IS <a name="OWNERSHIP"></a>OWNERSHIP?</span><br>
<br>
But what does "ownership" really mean? 
<ul>
  <li>Do we own our income if the government takes a big cut of it and
calls it taxation?  </li>
  <li>Are we all part-owners of urban infrastructure and national
parks?  </li>
  <li>Do we fully own our cars if we have to pay registration and
insurance, or if we are subject to all sorts of restrictions on their
use?  </li>
  <li>Can we be said to fully own our personal assets if inheritance
taxes take a big chunk of their value when we drop off the twig?  </li>
  <li>If you employ people, can you say that you own part of their time
(and that you own them to a degree)?  </li>
</ul>
The point is that the concept of ownership is not always black and
white, and the same applies to land under Geonomics.<br>
<br>
On the one hand, occupiers of land would be owners in the sense that
they would have the legal security of tenure as well as all the privacy
and personal liberty today accruing to home ownership. On the other
hand, occupiers would be required to discharge their dues to the
community for their exclusive occupancy of land, the value of which
they did not produce. So with Geonomics, what people do not "own" is
the community-created benefits of the land they occupy, for which they
would have to pay.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BUT WHAT'S YOURS IS YOURS!</span><br>
<br>
But don't forget these important points. Occupiers will unquestionably
own outright their houses and other improvements to their homes - and
they would never get penalised for improvements through local rates,
which today are often partly based on the value of improvements. Nor
will people see a part of their income or purchases confiscated through
the tax system. Effectively, we would all become co-owners of all the
land and natural resources, as the rent from them is pooled into the
community coffers for the benefit of all. By some calculations we could
even receive a considerable Citizen's Dividend from the unspent surplus.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What about those who might be
disadvantaged by the introduction of Geonomics? </span>It should be
stressed that there would be few such people, but there would be a few
deserving types who would qualify for schemes (too detailed to mention
here) such as limited compensation or deferral of LVT for some on
valuable land with low incomes and too old or incapacitated for
employment. There is no reason why other types of pensions and
disability payments would need to change.<br>

<br>
Before European settlement/invasion, Aboriginals generally, we are
told, had a beautiful thing going - they really knew how to share. Each
tribal group was a custodian of a traditional area, and all were taught
how to look after and respect their ancestral land. They belonged to
the Earth, and not the other way around. No individual owned any land,
and none could personally profit from Nature's gifts.<br>
<br>
These are Geonomic principles, pure and simple. However, Geonomics has
developed things such that each person is, in effect, the co-owner of
the entire country. Geonomics further allows for those wishing to live
in fixed abodes to take advantage of infrastructure, allocating land of
greatly unequal value in an elegantly fair manner.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHITE-FELLA THINKING!</span><br>
<br>
Geonomics has so much to offer the indigenous population (as well as
everyone else), if only they knew of it. On top of all the other
tragedies Aboriginals have suffered at the hands of Europeans is the
fact that many have adopted the prevailing concept of land as property
and are thus claiming exclusive ownership of land rather than the more
traditional notion of guardianship.<br>
<br>
Another problem is that the planet is a much more crowded place these
days, and there's not enough land to enable small groups to live on
large expanses of land as nomadic hunter-gatherers. And we can't turn
the clock back 200 years and return the continent to its original
inhabitants - indeed, if the federal government learned how to treat
refugees with a lot more respect, there's a good case for how Australia
has a moral duty to take in a lot more immigrants.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SELLING YOUR MOTHER?</span><br>
<br>
Given our admission of European culpability for all the misdeeds of
settlement/invasion and its present-day consequences, it's time to talk
frankly about those Aboriginal leaders who are now claiming a spiritual
relationship with the land and that the Earth is their mother, yet in
the same breath asserting ownership of vast tracts of land with
exclusive rights of occupancy as well as mineral royalties. Or those
who say that their connection to the land is something deeply spiritual
and priceless &#8230;&#8230;. and they won't accept less than $5 billion a year in
rent!<br>
<br>
These - even if well meaning - contortions, if carried through, will
establish an institutionalised, perpetual race-based class of landlords
and tenants, and in so doing, perpetuate the very injustices we are
attempting to eradicate.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"I SAW IT FIRST!"</span><br>
<br>
And what, if anything, is the basis for the race-based privilege of
indigenous land rights? "Prior occupancy", no less! So because
someone's distant ancestors, whom he never knew, got to a continent
first, they claim ownership! The logic of this declaration is certainly
worth examining. So then, what if new archeological evidence came to
light which revealed that a certain Aboriginal clan are the sole
descendants of the very first guy who crossed the Torres Strait? Could
this clan then say, "OK all you whitefellas and blackfellas descended
from the later arrivals &#8230;.. you all have to pay us the rent for living
in Australia, or clear out!"<br>
<br>
Or what if Australia hadn't been occupied when the first Europeans
landed? Could the king who sent the ship have personally claimed
ownership based on first occupancy, or would Australia more rightly
belong to the ship's captain? But hang on! - what if one of the oarsmen
jumped off the boat before the captain, and was first to hit the beach?
But, wait! - the oarsman was wearing boots, and his skin never touched
the soil until after the first mate slipped over on the beach and got a
face full of sand!<br>
<br>
Steady on, guys - what about me?! Where's my share of the Earth? Do I
have to return to England and Ireland where my ancestors had "prior
occupancy", and can I then tell those Pakistani and West Indian
immigrants to clear off or else pay me rent for standing on my
homeland? No-one stands on my spiritual motherland for nothing!<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ACTUALLY, IT'S ALL PRETTY SIMPLE</span><br>
<br>
The Earth and its bounty are the birthright of all humanity. Land and
natural resources are our equal and common inheritance, regardless of
race, creed, or gender.<br>
<br>
But it's true that culture, history, attachment to place and arbitrary
national boundaries have complicated these straightforward principles
of human rights. And there is a clear case in Australia for studying
and acknowledging the shameful history of European invasion, saying
"Sorry" on behalf of our ancestors, and trying to make amends as best
we can. If this means special programs, roles, and grants for
Aboriginals in order to help them out of their appalling condition,
then let's do it. And we should acknowledge Aboriginals being the first
occupants, caretakers and custodians, but don't use that word
"ownership", OK?<br>

are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal
is vital."</span> - Aaron Levenstein,<br>
</div>
<br>
Part of the reason we're being misled and confused by economics is due
to the way it's being expressed, and particularly the statistical
methods of summarising economic performance. Thankfully, the
environmental movement has done much in recent years to expose
governmental fraud in window-dressing statistics to misrepresent
economic performance.<br>
<br>
The main cause behind the skewing of statistics is the failure to
properly take into account natural resources. There's a huge wealth of
"natural capital" that we can either preserve or run down, but
conventional economic statistics never measure the contents of this
vital storehouse. Our economic guardians prefer to look at their
measures of income and expenditure, and largely exclude the balance
sheet side of the ledger. In other words, measures of national income
fail to account for whether our natural resources are being preserved
or run down.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BEANCOUNTERS IN CHARGE</span><br>
<br>
Accountants rule! Nowadays, income is just assumed to equate to human
well-being, and what nonsensical activities are measured to reflect
income! It will reportedly increase if, for example:
<ul>
  <li>We build more jails (no matter what the levels of crime)</li>
  <li>More people are hurt or killed in car accidents (which results in
a sort of economic activity)</li>
  <li>A priceless forest is clear-felled thus "creating jobs"</li>
</ul>
And what wealth is being ignored? - our storehouse of minerals, oil,
topsoil, ozone shield, fish, forests, biodiversity, clean air and
water, urban parkland, stable climate etc. The consequence is that our
highly-paid professional statisticians and economists tell us that
we're achieving (their calculation of) positive economic growth while
completely ignoring how such natural resources might be plundered on a
wholly unsustainable basis. Geonomics would instead provide the
statistical and qualitative data that would greatly assist us to better
measure, guard and preserve our natural resources, as well as
collecting resource rents from those to whom access to such resources
has been granted. The very nature of Geonomics concerns itself with
this sort of valuation and resource rental. That is why so many robber
barons fought to suppress Henry George's work, supplanting Geonomics
with conventional, academically driven economics.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">FUDGED FIGURES</span><br>
<br>
Many of us are aware of how unemployment figures are fudged to
understate real levels of unemployment and underemployment. Deliberate
falsifications also occur with that other important economic indicator,
the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In 1998 the federal government directed
the Australian Bureau of Statistics to remove three very significant
components of the CPI that had been escalating alarmingly, namely:
<ul>
  <li>Consumer credit charges</li>
  <li>Mortgage interest charges</li>
  <li>The cost of the land component of new home purchases</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So if you think you're working harder
but getting less for your efforts, don't swallow government claims to
the contrary!</span> One important indicator that cannot be fudged is
the rarely-publicised, declining percentage of Australian homeowners.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A NATURAL PARTNERSHIP</span><br>
<br>
Geonomics can work hand-in-glove with some excellent alternative
indexes of well-being, most notably the GPI (Genuine Progress
Indicator). This seeks to take into account the level and health of our
natural resources as well as qualitative factors such as health of the
population, crime rate, quality of education, drug dependency, cultural
integrity and/or diversity, artistic accomplishment, and so on. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Up until now, our statisticians
have applied a rule that says, "If it hasn't got a $ sign in front of
it, we can't measure it" (and therefore, for all intents and purposes,
it does not exist).</span><br>
<br>
Is it any surprise that the GPI actually shows a decline in Australia
and the USA over the last 30 years?<br>
<br>
The failure to properly examine the nature of land has even led our
bean counters astray with their captivating accounting standards.
Accountants go to all sorts of lengths to count and properly value
every last bean, but when it comes to land, guess what? Even though
land is often the biggest balance sheet item, it is traditionally
valued at "historical cost" (i.e. at the dollar figure for which the
land was purchased). There are few legal requirements to perform
regular revaluations of land, which often results in a grossly
understated reporting of a company's net worth. For those with inside
knowledge, this practice presents them with exclusive information on
which they can capitalise (at others' expense) in share trading. Of
course, such valuation problems could not exist with Geonomics.<br>

</div>
<br>
Rather than requiring a highly centralised body overseeing the
collection of LVT and resource revenue, Geonomics proposes to devolve
power to a range of relevant authorities at different levels of
government.
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">LOCAL </span>Local governments
are ideally positioned to collect LVT on sites for homes, businesses
and farmland surface land values. In Australia and many other places
council already levy rates. However the rates collected today are
minimal, are usually based on land and improvements, and have all sorts
of flaws such as fixed charges, maximum or minimum thresholds, and
exemptions. In immediate financial terms alone, the vast majority of
ratepayers would benefit from LVT, the exceptions being speculators and
businesses which waste valuable expanses of land (such as sprawling car
yards and derelict factories on prime real estate).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">REGIONAL </span>State
governments are best constituted to collect user fees for forestry and
water resources.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">NATIONAL </span>The federal
government is in the best position to collect user fees for fish caught
in national waters, oil and mineral resources.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">GLOBAL </span>We mentioned a
possible role of a Global Resource Agency in equalising natural
advantages between nations, but there's a much more achievable role
this body could take in collecting user fees from our transnational
commons. This includes site fees for satellites placed in geostationary
orbits, royalties on minerals mined in international waters or the
Antarctic, royalties on fish caught in international waters, and for
use of the electromagnetic spectrum.</li>
</ul>
Many taxes or fees based on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">polluter-pays</span>
principle would clearly fall within the province of the Global Resource
Agency. Here significant global revenue sources could, for example, be
levied on aviation fuel, international shipping, and dumping at sea
(where that would still be allowed). These could all be construed as
site and resource rents in the broad sense of those terms. If a
polluter is dumping into a river for example, and thereby rendering x
million cubic metres of water nonpotable, he would be charged a rental
value for that resource usually equivalent to the cost of returning the
water to a potable state. Such a charge will soon force polluters to
look for cleaner production processes or be forced out of business by
such punitive site and resource rents.<br>
<br>
This agency would also be best placed to administer the proposed Tobin
tax on currency speculation. And, if international arms' trading is not
to be entirely abolished, the agency could be given the authority to
impose a heavy "misery tax" on it.<br>
<br>
There's a valuable monitoring role that the Global Resource Agency
could take in being responsible for safeguarding the global commons
(e.g. air quality, ozone shield, ocean fish, worldwide biodiversity
etc.). The agency could determine access rules, issue permits, collect
resource revenue and levy fines.<br>
<br>
Not only would the access fees to the Global Commons ensure careful use
of our common heritage resources, but also this revenue could go a long
way towards solving some important problems. Where should the money be
spent? Global Geonomics has no spending doctrine or dogma, but here are
a few suggested uses:
<ul>
  <li>Sustainable development programs</li>
  <li>Environment restoration programs</li>
  <li>The facilitation of policy convergence in areas such as trade,
currency exchange, pollution targets and human rights</li>
  <li>Population control programs</li>
</ul>

</div>
<br>
Lots of provisos can be added later, but this is the basic position: we
believe in free trade only if it's fair trade. Today it's is hardly
ever fair and it's far from free, since it is dominated by ruling
monopolies in all the larger economies such as the US, Japan, Germany,
the UK, etc - but it can be.<br>
<br>
The great advantages of free trade were never more eloquently spelt out
than by Henry George himself, but these benefits have been overshadowed
and confused by the way the threatening aspects of globalisation have
spread in recent years. Globalisation has appeared all the more
menacing because of the way the plutocrats who control transnational
organisations have been calling for the last barriers to free trade to
be removed. The trouble is, they don't give a damn about freedom!
Instead of allowing real free trade, the big boys seek to further
strengthen their monopoly privileges and political influence in order
to produce greater disparities in wealth.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MANY DISADVANTAGES OF FREE TRADE</span><br>
<br>
Cultural diversity is one of the things that undoubtedly makes life
more interesting, and its erosion by unrestrained free trade would be
an irretrievable loss. Who wants McDonald's and other global chain
stores in every shopping centre? This evaluation obviously requires
difficult value judgments to be weighed against the possible economic
benefits. But cultural heritage and diversity have been grossly
undervalued by the bean counters who ignore it for not having a $ tag
on.<br>
<br>
National independence and security can be threatened by free trade, in
that a country can become too dependent on trading partners to provide
essential goods and services up to basic foodstuffs.<br>
<br>
There are often hidden environmental costs to free trade, especially
when goods are transported over vast distances and exporters are not
paying the full costs of using scarce resources and of polluting the
global commons. Furthermore, recent trade agreements have been based on
environmental standards coming down to the lowest common denominator
when they could just as easily have been based on the highest.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the loudest outcry against free trade and globalisation has
been against the increasing exploitation by transnationals of "factory
fodder" in developing nations. Even the threat of the physical transfer
of industrial plant to low wage countries further erodes the bargaining
power and wages of workers in the West.<br>
<br>
And transnationals can bully their way and dominate markets with
monopoly or cartel powers, often playing off nations against each other
to extract all sorts of tax concessions. But, when the time comes to
pay what little tax is owed, transfer pricing allows them to shift
their profits to low-taxing offshore locations. Furthermore, the rapid
movement of capital in and out of nations exacerbates economic
uncertainty and instability.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BUT DON'T DISCOUNT ECONOMIC PROSPERITY!</span><br>
<br>
Having made these admissions, we must hasten to add that free trade has
given rise to enormous economic prosperity. The efficiencies from fully
utilising each nation's natural advantages are evident in any
supermarket or electrical goods store. Self-sufficiency has enormous
costs, keeping people working far longer than they need to. Those who
cry loudest for protectionist policies are often the most wasteful and
inept domestic producers, who are effectively subsidised by the public.<br>
<br>
But will Geonomics address the current problems of free trade, and
bring about fair trade? Let's examine the problems one by one.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW GEONOMICS FITS IN</span><br>
<br>
Concerning the erosion of cultural diversity, Geonomics can help a
little. The LVT assessment process can assist in quantifying the
intangible cultural benefits of, say, retaining a traditional inn
rather than replacing it with a global-franchise motel. In the end each
community, knowing the cultural costs of certain moves towards free
trade, would decide how badly it wants to preserve its culture and how
far to cash in on it without underselling its cultural heritage.<br>
<br>
Geonomics would easily solve the rest of the problems arising from free
trade. The collection of full resource rentals would prevent any
underselling of the environment. Exploitation of Third World factory
fodder could never continue after addressing the root cause of
unemployment. The way Geonomics opens up a multitude of domestic
investment opportunities in both the public and private sectors would
no longer coerce developing countries to beg for investment by
transnational monopolies. And transnational tax avoidance would most
clearly end - no one can hide land or evade the tax assessed on it!<br>

If only the solution to this and other economic problems was simple to
explain... Then the world wouldn't be in this situation, people
wouldn't be bamboozled by economics, and you wouldn't be reading this.<br>
<br>
Of all economic problems, probably the most difficult to explain is
unemployment, whose very existence is evidence of the madness of our
present economic system. On the one hand we have all the work that
badly needs doing, and on the other we have the countless millions of
people who are prevented from doing that work. All the conventional
think tanks in the world have not been able to solve this
straightforward puzzle, because they are handicapped from the outset by
their failure to distinguish between land and capital.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MANY STRANDS</span><br>
<br>
There are so many aspects to the problem of unemployment that we've had
to take the long route, spiraling around and around until the big
picture is built up. We've examined many other aspects of economics,
but the problem of unemployment is such a curse - such an unnecessary
curse - that it's worth trying to get clear about it by pulling
together most of its strands here. Geonomics is not preoccupied with
making everyone work long and hard. In fact, we're convinced that we're
working far too hard for far too little return. Social justice,
prosperity and much more leisure time can co-exist.<br>
<br>
A summary of what we've said about unemployment goes like this. The
unique qualities of land are not recognised by neoclassical economics.
Whereas capital and labour are punished and discouraged by taxation,
LVT doesn't provide a disincentive but rather compels landholders to
use their land optimally. And with public sector investment, there are
endless employment opportunities arising from the way LVT recycles the
value of government investment back to the community for further
investment.<br>
<br>
In agricultural areas of developing nations we see some of the worst
examples of unemployment (or underemployment) and grinding poverty.
There, the power of land monopoly capitalism enables the traditional
landowning families to sit back and wait until the desperate landless
are forced to accept subsistence wages. The landless are landless
because they can't create their own land, the first ingredient in any
productive endeavour. But LVT would put the boot on the other foot,
forcing huge amounts of underused land on to the market and forcing
landowners to offer fair wages.<br>
<br>
In the West, it's more often than not the high price of land which
stifles production and employment. The full collection of LVT would
actually eliminate that great obstacle to business and employment (or
simply living!), the cost of land. We have been stooged by real estate
dealers into thinking that high land prices are "healthy" rather than
crippling. The diversion of investment funds from productive
enterprises into purchasing land is another related cause of
unemployment.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IDLE LAND, IDLE HANDS</span><br>
<br>
Land speculation leads to idle land, and idle land to idle hands. LVT
would prevent all forms of land speculation: would-be profiteers
couldn't afford to wait for the community to build up the value of
their idle land because all the time they would have to pay LVT.<br>
<br>
The huge amount of present waste, inevitably arising from land monopoly
capitalism, could instead be changed into employment-creating
opportunities. Such waste results from undervalued natural resources,
and can be seen in urban sprawl, in the huge inefficiency of our tax
system with its crippling compliance costs and all the attempts to
thwart it (including the black economy).<br>

highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land values to the
man who is putting it to an inferior use, or no use at all. All comes
back to the land value." </span>- <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston

Did we live up to our promise? Did we manage to explain some of the
most insoluble aspects of economics in clear, plain English? We'll make
another promise - it doesn't get much more complicated than this, but
it will become even more profound. We should add a word of warning
here: when the penny drops and you realise the enormous importance of
the Georgist message or mission, you'll never be the same!<br>
<br>
You have many other options at this point. If you haven't checked out
our premises at 27 Hardware St. in Melbourne, you should know that
anyone is welcome there. You'll be able to check out our range of
literature and books for sale (many at budget prices), relax in a comfy
environment (in the heart of the city), meet some of us and ask
questions.<br>

If you live in the country, we can probably arrange to put you in touch
with Geonomists near you.<br>
<br>
If you want to get stuck into some serious reading, we can make a few
recommendations. Here is another of my favourite books - it's a
compilation of all the major attempted criticisms of Geonomics by
economists and academics over the last 100 years, and the Geonomic
rebuttals. The book is "Critics of Henry George", edited by Robert V.
Andelson, published by Associated University Presses, and available
from our city premises. We can also provide you with short brochures
covering a range of topics.<br>
<br>
Details of our free introductory offer to our magazine Progress,
classes in economics, and Geonomic websites are given in the
Introductory and Intermediate Kits. It leaves us, then, with the big
issue of how deeply you want to take this.<br>
<br>
Let me suggest to you that you don't need to commit yourself until
you're absolutely convinced. Geonomics and today's neoclassical
economics can't both be right - one of them has got it badly wrong, and
you owe it to yourself to discover which.<br>
<br>
So before you think about becoming a member, convince yourself that our
claims are as immensely important as we claim. You may yet discover the
feeling that grips many Georgists, the kind of joy of which the Irish
patriot, John Mitchel (1815-75), spoke, "To have a great aim and a
cause, is this not happiness? Is there not a joy that colder, tamer
spirits never know?"<br>
<br>
But if you are satisfied with the claims of Geonomics, perhaps the best
thing you can do is to talk about it with all the enthusiasm and
conviction you can muster. Talk to friends, talk to family, talk to
whomever is willing to lend an ear - our movement needs wider public
understanding and the support arising from it.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you already convinced and eager to get more actively involved?
Then, by all means, do so. Whatever you do will always be welcome.
Membership is $30 per month, including a year's subscription to
Progress. You could also attend our monthly committee meetings at
Hardware St. on the second Thursday of every month at 6.40 p.m. Our
meetings are open to all comers, members or not, and there you will
hear about our projects. We also mail out notices of occasional social
functions.<br>
<br>
Whether you become an executive on our committee or not, your
suggestions and involvement are truly needed, especially in
advertising, promotion, lobbying and playing politics. It's a bizarre
world, and we're weird custodians!<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"Every
increase of population, extension of trade, every advance in the arts
and sciences would, as we all know, increase the value of land, and the
competition that would naturally arise would continue to force rents
upward, so much so, that in many cases the tenants would have little or
nothing left for themselves."</span> - Mark Twain, (1835 - 1910)<br>
