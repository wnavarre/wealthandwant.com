<p><a name="Defining Real Property Historic"></a><b>Defining Real
Property Historically</b></p>
<p>Just over a week from now, right here in Albany, the <b>Property
Rights Foundation of America</b> will hold its second annual
conference. These are the people who are the core of the so-called
"wise use" movement, that is those who believe that the rights of
ownership of real property stand above just about all other values in
political negotiation, and that rights to private property are
gravely threatened by a government that today seeks to encroach on
the foundations of our forefathers' vision of society. In the
American west it is better known as the "sagebrush rebellion." I
won't talk much about whether or not these rights are soundly framed
or well grounded. I will talk, however, about some changes that took
place about a century ago that have had profound consequences for the
directions of American society in the interim. Had those changes not
taken place, it is doubtful whether the groundswell of anger over the
place of private landownership would be as intense as it is
today.</p>
<p>One must start by looking at how the meaning of the word property
has changed over the course of centuries. In most societies of the
world, as was true in classic western thought, property typically
meant personal property - clothing, household goods, bodily
adornments and armor, and similar such items. Land was typically
owned by society in common, or perhaps belonged to God or nature.
Roman law made some effort to allot land titles to private
individuals and families, but it was honored more in theory than in
fact. Indeed, it was not until the now well-documented "<b>enclosure
movement</b>" in early Tudor England that land titles began their
long transformation from what has been termed "<b>leasehold</b>" to
"<b>freehold</b>." Against the will of the King and his Council,
noblemen seized the land for themselves, marking it into defined
units, fenced off in their names only, even when they had no use for
it. Karl Polanyi noted that:</p>
<p>Enclosures have appropriately been called a revolution of the rich
against the poor. The lords and nobles were upsetting the social
order, breaking down ancient law and custom, sometimes by means of
violence, often by pressure and intimidation. They were literally
robbing the poor of their share in the common, tearing down the
houses which, by the hitherto unbreakable force of custom, the poor
had long regarded as theirs and their heirs'. The fabric of society
was being disrupted; desolate villages and the ruins of human
dwellings testified to the fierceness with which the revolution
raged, endangering the defenses of the country, wasting its towns,
decimating its population, turning its overburdened soil into dust,
harassing its people and turning them from decent husbandmen into a
mob of beggars and thieves. </p>
<p>Rutgers Professor of Urban Planning Donald Krueckeberg more
recently explained how real property became for the first time a
"commodity," much as the market gives personal property exchange
value. Native Americans tied the concept of property not to ownership
but to use. "One used it, one moved on, and use was shared with
others." But the colonists took their notion of real property from
evolving British legal tradition, defined largely in terms of what
its owners could subdue and control against challengers. John Locke's
conception of property was, in one sense, more akin to the Indian
notion in as much as one owned it only to the extent that one "mixed
one's labor" with it.</p>
<p>Indeed the most widespread notion of property ownership,
especially in realms where Roman law had left no legacy, was title in
<b>usufruct</b>, meaning title to use. But that meaning has gradually
given way to the prevailing conception of title in fee simple, even
though legal constraints have grown to curtail abuses of such
ownership and are even seen sometimes as assaults on it. Krueckeberg
notes that as many as nine kinds of property rights have been
distinguished: </p>
<ul>
  <li>possession, </li>
  <li>use, </li>
  <li>alienation (the power to give away), </li>
  <li>consumption, </li>
  <li>modification, </li>
  <li>destruction, </li>
  <li>management, </li>
  <li>exchange, and </li>
  <li>profit taking. </li>
</ul>
<p>From the first application of the land law of the New England
settlers there has been a gradual extension of private control over
land titles first to simple use, then the right to benefit, and
ultimately "to the idea of gain made by selling. Land speculation,
which was to spread across the continent, radically transformed New
England's democratic town pattern." Concurrent with this spreading
application of titles in fee simple has come changes in the meaning
of the word property, a term which, although employed in the Fourth
and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, was amplified only
during the second half of the 19th century. The notion of land as a
commodity has had pernicious effects on the course of our whole
civilization.</p>
<p>As recently as a century ago classical economic thought still
regarded land for the most part as the common heritage of mankind.
From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and finally
with John Stuart Mill economic productivity was regarded as a
function of three interacting factors: land, labor, and capital. John
Locke also accepted these premises. To achieve optimal economic
productivity, one had to exact the appropriate price from each of
those factors. The price of labor was in wages; the price of capital
was interest; and the price of land, particularly following the
thinking of David Ricardo, was rent. Rent in its classical sense
means payment for the use of something in fixed supply, or, more
generally, payments above the costs incurred for its creation.
Disequilibriums and inefficiencies in economic development resulted
if the appropriate prices were not paid for each factor. But, as we
shall see, there were powerful interests in this country, bent on not
seeing any rent extracted from land use, that persuaded the nascent
economics profession at the end of the 19th century no longer to
regard land as a separate factor and to redefine the terms of
production instead in two- factor theory. This was concurrent with
the inclusion of land as property, since called "real property."</p>
<p>As land came to be transferred to other nobility and usurped under
title in fee simple rather than in usufruct, it came to be regarded
as a private financial asset. Earlier it was regarded as part of
nature, much like air, water, wind and weather. Accounting practices
now listed land as an asset "owned" in fee simple, and as a liability
on the other side of balance sheets in money "owed" to banks. This
tendency has been extended today so that we have privatized much of
our air, water, wind, and even sunlight. Land came to be simply one
kind of capital, nothing special, nothing requiring further
treatment. Ricardo's Law of Rent became an artifact of intellectual
history. The conflation of land into capital to create two-factor
economics is one of the greatest paradigm shifts in the evolution of
social philosophy. How the premises and terms of economic discourse
have been changed has been documented for the first time in a new
book by a California professor of economics, Mason Gaffney. The
account is put forth in fascinating detail entitled, <b><i>The
Corruption of Economics.</i></b> It was indeed a corruption of a
discipline, a deliberate putsch by powerful economic forces with an
interest in seeing such definitions changed, and we have all been
paying the price since that time. This revealing thesis is what I
really want to relate to you, and to explain the dire consequences it
has had for us in our contemporary world. I have come to believe it;
it makes sense to me, both historically and in contemporary analysis,
from several perspectives.</p>
<p><a name="The Corruption of Economics"></a><b>The Corruption of
Economics</b></p>
<p>As I explained, classical economics emerged from a school of
thinkers known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the
18th century. There ultimately evolved three major schools of
economic thought a century later, one the continuing tradition of
Adam Smith through J.S. Mill, a second being the aggressive and
emerging school of Marxism, and the third a proposal for two-factor
economics being pressed largely by interests in America. Marxism was
never a major force in United States; the primary challenge to the
classical tradition came from what has since come to be known as
neo-classical economics.</p>
<p>Professor Gaffney has for the first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</p>
<p>The classical tradition of economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
traveled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and traveled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</p>
<p>In classical economics, the definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being
returned to society in rent. The failure of society to recapture the
appropriate level of land rent from titleholders led also to
depression of labor wages at the margin, creating poverty and
artificial scarcity of labor where otherwise it could be relieved.
Hence the title of George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.
George recognized that the value of any land parcel arose out of its
social activity, not from anything which a titleholder might have
done to it. He recognized that many, perhaps most, titleholders in
land were speculators, reaping the benefit of others' investments,
and selling out at last when their price was met. Hence it made sense
that society had a right to a return on what it had brought about, as
well as from the fact that those titles could never be other than
leaseholds. That land rent, shortly confused by use of the words
"single tax," was, to George, the rightful return to society.</p>
<p>The railroad barons of the 19th century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors, to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885. The actual
intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got appointed and
promoted, who was funded in research, which were given endowed
chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation with
defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount preoccupation
of all of these figures. The central figures were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</li>
  <li>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</li>
  <li>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</li>
  <li>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</li>
</ul>
<p>These figures are even today the honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Friedman</a>,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. <b>Was it for the
falsity of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then
have managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather,
it was the threat George represented to powerful interests that
required him to be defeated</b>, and in doing so they succeeded but
only in the short run, as they were within decades victims of their
very successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</p>
<p>There were many arguments to be made for the classical tradition,
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</li>
  <li>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising taxes
on capital.</li>
  <li>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</li>
  <li>It constituted no disincentive to business location or population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</li>
  <li>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government revenue
without any penalty upon its base. </li>
  <li>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time promotes
economy in government.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those economists who today still persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists. They represent a
small minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they
are, they are among its most esteemed members.</p>
<p>Two-factor economics, however, had advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit. This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner. When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.</p>
<p><a name="Assessing Sound Taxation"></a><b>Assessing Sound
Taxation</b></p>
<p>What David Ricardo called the "law of rent," and which Henry
George integrated to a comprehensive economic theory, can be made the
basis of a perfect tax measured by contemporary principles of tax
theory. Public finance textbooks typically list them as </p>
<ul>
  <li>economic neutrality, </li>
  <li>efficiency, </li>
  <li>equity, </li>
  <li>administrability, </li>
  <li>simplicity, </li>
  <li>stability, and </li>
  <li>sufficiency. </li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these words embodies an important virtue of sound of
taxation going back to the insights of Adam Smith two centuries ago.
And now you know a bit of where I'm headed.</p>
<p><b>Tax neutrality</b> refers to the influence (or absence of such)
that any particular design has on economic behavior. Typically taxes
are perceived as a damp on economic activity: taxing income reduces
the incentive to work, taxing sales discourages retail transactions,
and taxing savings reduces the propensity to save. The more a tax is
perceived to be neutral the less the identifiable distortions it
imposes on the economy. The common assumption of most tax theorists
is that all taxes impose distortions; it's simply a matter of which
ones are least burdensome to economic health. A tax which imposes no
distortions is ideally best.</p>
<p><b>Tax efficiency</b> is much like tax neutrality, and is the
measure of how much shifting of behavior it imposes, resulting in
what is called "excess burden," or "deadweight loss" on the economy.
Tax economists usually hold that the best taxes are those that are
shifted little if at all. Using a tax base that has little or zero
elasticity is the best way of assuring that taxes are not shifted.
Zero elasticity is another way of saying fixed supply, as, earlier
noted, land is.</p>
<p>The principle of <b>equity</b> is central to any discussion of tax
design. Tax design requires concern with both what is fair and the
extent to which it must sometimes be compromised to satisfy the other
principal criteria. Fairness can be evaluated according to what is
termed "horizontal equity" the extent to which those in similar
circumstances will pay similar tax burdens, and "vertical equity" how
well those in different classes bear different burdens in the tax
structure. It is this latter perspective that leads to the use of
terms like "proportional," "progressive," and "regressive" in
referring to tax structures. A tax is progressive with respect to
income if the ratio of tax revenue to income rises when moving up the
income scale, proportional if the ratio is constant, and regressive
if the ratio declines. There is an ancillary question of whether
taxing to reach greater equity should employ measures of income or of
wealth, difficult as this is to measure. Such questions of equity are
a matter particularly central when discussing the property tax. This
is because people capitalize their income in the course of a lifetime
frequently in property. Although claims are often made to the
contrary and really comprehensive studies have yet to be done,
available studies suggest that the property tax is really highly
progressive, especially for the land component.</p>
<p><b>Administrability</b> refers to the ease with which a tax can be
administered and collected. Taxes which distort the economy are
inefficient but so are taxes that cost lots to administer. This is
measured not only in the direct costs of tax avoidance and accounting
expenses, but in the level of evasion and cheating, and by the cost
of government auditing and policing. When the taxpaying public
perceives that a tax is easily evaded, cumbersome, and unfair, it
loses its legitimacy and calls government itself into question.</p>
<p>This is why the principle of <b>simplicity</b> is important: the
more complex the tax design, the more lawyers and accountants will
find loopholes, encourage the appearance of unfairness, and drive up
the cost of its administration. People know that with simple taxes
other parties are also paying their fair share, and all this enhances
the legitimacy and therefore the compliance of the tax system.
Whatever you think of the current income tax, Steve Forbes certainly
pointed out its problems recently.</p>
<p><b>Stability</b> refers to the ability of a tax to produce revenue
in the face of changing economic circumstances. Income and sales
taxes, for example, vary greatly according to phases in the economic
cycle; the property tax, in contrast, is highly stable regardless of
the state of the economy. Followers of economist John Maynard Keynes
believe that revenues should be inverse to the cycles of the economy;
i.e., that the government should be used to stabilize or boost the
economy as occasions require. I should add as an aside that t<b>here
are some theorists who believe that, were revenue sources completely
based on land value, economic cycles would disappear.</b></p>
<p>In assessing the value of a tax it is also important, of course,
to understand its potential to bring in revenue for the purposes of
government. This is usually deemed revenue sufficiency. Income, sales
and property taxes, along with corporation taxes to a lesser extent,
have come to be regarded as the workhorses of the American revenue
structure. But, as anti-tax politicians are quick to note, the higher
these taxes are, the more they impose a drag on the economy. This is
why one should ponder whether to consider raising taxes which have
demonstrable distorting effects. In contrast, if you take the time to
look at a tax on land value alone, it measures up so well that it
looks like the perfect tax!</p>
<p><a name="The Costs of Poor Taxes"></a><b>The Costs of Poor
Taxes</b></p>
<p>Society pays a price for not adopting taxes which follow the
principles developed over the centuries. Here I want only to show how
the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings, the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations, they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. This is because the population and improvement
densities needed to make public transit traffic economically viable
did not come about. Taking the long view of society, George Kennen
notes in one of his books that:</p>
<blockquote>The railway. . . was capable of accepting and disgorging
its loads, whether of passengers or freight, only at fixed points. This
being the case, it tended to gather together, and to concentrate around
its urban terminus and railhead, all activity that was in any way
related to movements of freight or passengers into or out of the city.
It was in this quality that it had made major and in some ways decisive
contributions to the development not only of the great railway
metropolises of the Victorian age particularly of such inland cities as
Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and Chicago but even certain of the great
maritime turnover ports, such as London and New York.</blockquote>
<p>The automobile, on the other hand, had precisely the opposite
qualities. Incapable, in view of its own cumbersomeness and
requirements for space, of accepting or releasing large loads at any
concentrated points anywhere, but peculiarly capable of accepting and
releasing them at multitudes of unconcentrated points anywhere else,
the automobile tended to disintegrate and to explode all that the
railway had brought together. It was, in fact, the enemy of the
concentrated city. Thus it was destined to destroy the great densely
populated urban centers of the nineteenth century, with all the
glories of economic and cultural life that had flowed from their very
unity and compactness.</p>
<p><b>Failure to recapture publicly-created land rents through the
tax mechanism provided the incentive to speculators to buy land, not
to use it in production but to hold it for the rise. In this way,
choice parcels remain undeveloped or underdeveloped relative to the
full extent that their values warrant and development occurs instead
in remote areas where opportunity for profit is more immediate. The
result was low density development what we know as sprawl.</b></p>
<p>To some people this may be counter-intuitive. It may not be
obvious that increasing taxes on a parcel of land will foster its
improvement. Consider, however, the possibility that there are two
parcels of land in roughly the same location and of equal size. You
own a vacant parcel and another next to it has a twenty-story
building. If only the land-value is taxed you will be paying the same
tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you likely to do with your
parcel? If you are rational, you will either build a twenty-story
building or else sell the land to someone who will. In this way
improvements tend to be clustered in high-land-value areas except
where it is prohibited, perhaps for a park.</p>
<p>Jessica Matthews, now with the Council on Foreign Relations,
recently wrote a syndicated piece observing that:</p>
<blockquote>In a now familiar sequence, developers reach for the
cheapest land, out in the cow pastures. Government is left to fill in
behind with brand new infrastructure roads, sewerage systems and
schools paid for in part by those whose existing roads and schools are
left to decline. Property values rise in a ring that marches steadily
outward from the city and fall in older suburbs inside the moving edge.</blockquote>
<p>Because residential development can't meet the public bills, local
governments compete for commercial investment with tax discounts that
deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes then rise,
providing an incentive for new development.</p>
<p>Years of such leap-frogging construction devours land at an
astonishing pace. Now if the full social opportunity cost of land
occupancy were charged to landholders, the reward of (and incentive
for) speculation would be obliterated, and land now locked up by
speculators would be transferred to users. Users would employ more
labor and engender more capital development instead of seeing it
locked up in wasted space.</p>
<p>Absent adequate taxation the regions at the periphery are the
first developed, just as Ms. Matthews observes.</p>
<p>The economics profession is only now coming to recognize its
responsibility for what it has wrought. Economists are coming to
recognize the costs of sprawl, and studies show how astonishingly
inefficient the suburban lifestyle is. One review of the literature
on the subject of comparative development costs published by the
Urban Land Institute revealed that "houses built in sprawling
developments may cost 40 to 400 percent more to serve than if they
were located close to major facilities, were clustered in contiguous
areas, and incorporated a variety of housing types."</p>
<p>Transportation planners know that public transit typically takes a
density of at least 8-10 households per acre in order for it to be
economically viable. Because tax policies have been instituted that
have the effect of deliberately fostering low density suburban
sprawl, society has become dependent upon motor vehicle
transportation rather than transit service. Had taxes been imposed
heavily or solely upon land value, just the opposite would have
occurred: development would have been most intense on the high
land-value parcels, right by the transit services, making our society
less dependent upon motor vehicles.</p>
<p>We face a far greater problem on account of the way in which
America has allowed its landscape to be configured than most people
today realize. Over-reliance upon the car causes inefficiencies in
transportation patterns and thereby disenfranchises the poor, the
disabled, the young and the old from their right to mobility. One
1993 study concludes that "when the full range of costs of
transportation are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the
American public a total of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. This is
equal to about one-quarter of the annual GNP and is greater than our
total national annual expenditure on either education or health."
Just the costs of motor vehicle accidents nothing else represents a
figure equal to 8 percent of the American Gross Domestic Product.
Conventional American land use configurations and the automobile
dependent lifestyle that goes with it sap our resources and what
effort could be used for other ventures and activities. Since so much
of this activity is consumption and not production, it weakens
America's world economic position and precludes reinvestment in more
productive areas. Because of the way in which we have encouraged
development, people who need jobs are frequently too poor to own the
cars necessary to get to them.</p>
<p>Because our society is characterized by suburban sprawl and is
therefore motor vehicle dependent, community is destroyed. George
Kennan expresses this well in the book cited earlier, but it is more
empirically documented in a recent article entitled "<b><i>Bowling
Alone</i></b>", which David Broder of the <i>Washington Post
</i>considered the most important academic article of 1995. The
author of that piece, Harvard Professor Bob Putnam, shows that our
communal relationships are declining, and that an ever smaller
proportion of the population is involved in social activities of a
cooperative and communal nature. As Tocqueville noted, this used to
be the unique strength of American society; we're now losing it.
Suburban sprawl and the automobile play a large part in this. And the
reason we have these land-use configurations is in good part, to my
way of thinking, due to our property tax policies and our subsidies
to motor vehicle transportation.</p>
<p>It doesn't take much reflection to realize that the practices
which we are following are unsustainable. This is true not only
environmentally but also economically and socially. Author James
Howard Kunstler recently has described in his book <b><i>Home from
Nowhere</i></b> how our cities are becoming not only ugly but
unlivable. The irony is also that, by having followed the legacy of
classical economics, we could easily have provided for all our
government services through taxes based on land value.</p>
