<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
The &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle
Implies</span><br>
by Hanno Beck</div>
<p> Dinner has ended. Over a cup of tea, Sara is talking
  with Vernon:<br>
  <br>
 "... and so those new policies are justified because
  of the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle."<br>
  <br>
 Vernon says, "Tell me one more time, what the
  &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle is."<br>
  <br>
 Sara replies, "The polluter is responsible for the
  environmental and economic effects of his or her polluting activities.
  That's all. For instance, if you pollute a river and someone downstream
  gets lower-quality water, or must buy more expensive water as a result,
  you owe compensation to them. It's obvious."<br>
  <br>
 But Vernon says, "It is not obvious to me. I do not
  agree with the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle. Why does it have to be the
  polluter's problem when he causes damage to the life or property or
  rights of others? Maybe it should be all the taxpayers' problem, or
  only the problem of people whose names start with the letter K."<br>
  <br>
 Now what is Sara supposed to do? What can you do,
  when somebody says they don't agree with something that seems obvious
  to you?<br>
  <br>
 Some people might try to find a more general way to
  phrase their idea. Maybe you can find a broad idea that implies or
"includes" the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle. Then Sara can try to get Vernon
  to agree with that more general phrasing. If Vernon likes it, then Sara
  only needs to point out that the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle follows from
  it &#8212; is entailed by it. In this less direct way, she will have
  convinced Vernon (if Vernon is rational, which he is).<br>
  <br>
 Sure enough, this is what Sara tries to do. "Well,
  would you agree that if you produce an item worth a dollar, and
  somebody else does pay a dollar for it, then the dollar ought to come
  to you and no one else?"<br>
  <br>
 "Certainly," says Vernon. "Anything else would be
  unfair."<br>
  <br>
 "You're right, and the reason for that is that you
  own the fruit of your labor &#8212;- goods and services that you produce
  belong to you, and so they are yours to keep or to sell. Does that
  sound right?"<br>
  <br>
 "Yes," replies Vernon. "If I don't get the fruit of
  my own labor then I am a victim of robbery or slavery. Of course, it
  can get a little complicated. Say I produce a child's toy with the aid
  of a hammer, then the owner of the hammer is also entitled to a portion
  of the toy's value."<br>
  <br>
 Sara says, "Of course. People who contribute their
  labor, or their belongings, to the production of goods and services
  then rightfully own those goods and services. They usually make
  agreements and contracts ahead of time to sort out who gets how much,
  so that they don't have to fight or go to court."<br>
  <br>
 This seems fine to Vernon. "Right," he agrees.<br>
  <br>
 "Well then," Sara continues, "how about if you
  produce something worth minus one dollar. Let's say it is a bag of
  trash, or a waste chemical. Now isn't that also yours? And if it costs
  someone a dollar to dispose of it safely, or to recycle it, then
  shouldn't that dollar come from you and no one else?"<br>
  <br>
 "Ah," says Vernon. "I see what you mean. I have to
  pay for the effects of my polluting actions or else I'd be robbing
  someone else. Okay, I believe the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle now."<br>
  <br>
 "Great," exults Sara.<br>
  <br>
 "But the funny thing is, you don't really believe it
  yourself," says Vernon. "You aren't being consistent. You say goods and
  services that we produce belong to the producers and no one else. But
  you support the income tax and the sales tax. Those taxes take away
  from the producer, without his or her consent, part of what he or she
  produced. So it doesn't seem that you really believe your own claims.
  Why should people support the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle that says they
  are stuck with negative products they produce, when at the same time
  you wouldn't allow them to keep the positive products they produce?
  Sounds like an uneven deal."<br>
  <br>
 Sara is shocked. But she has to admit Vernon has a
  point. "Hmm, I guess this might be part of why the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot;
  Principle doesn't excite as much support as it should. If we lived in a
  world where people get to keep the full value of whatever their labor
  and their investment yields, then pollution would stand out in sharp
  contrast, as a crime against innocent people and their property. The
  &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle would be totally obvious then."<br>
  <br>
 "And instead," says Vernon, "we're surrounded by
  cases of theft by income tax, by sales tax, and so on. Well then, no
  wonder people aren't shocked when the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle isn't
  applied. And no wonder some people don't even see the wisdom of it. "<br>
  </p>
<p>  The bottom line question is this &#8212; can a person
  support the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle and support involuntary taxation
  both, or is that inconsistent? Your opinion, please!</p>
<p>Is it consistent to believe
    in both the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle and in taxation of income or sales?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes</li>
  <li>No</li>
</ul>
Please choose one:
<ul>
  <li>I believe in both the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle and in taxation of
income or sales</li>
  <li>I believe in the &quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle and not in taxation of
income or sales</li>
  <li>I believe in the taxation of income or sales and not in the
&quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle</li>
  <li>I believe in neither the taxation of income or sales nor the
&quot;Polluter Pays&quot; Principle</li>
</ul>
