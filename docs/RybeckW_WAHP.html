<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
Affordable Housing Problem?</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">By Walter Rybeck</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To <a
 href="http://www.progress.org/cgo">CGO Conference</a>, <br>
Albuquerque, New Mexico, July 2004</div>
<br>
Let me say emphatically that America has NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROBLEM.
By the time I finish my talk, I hope this startling remark (to help you
wake up this early in the morning) will not appear as ridiculous as it
may seem to you at first glance.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Squatters All</span><br>
<br>
Like all creatures -- goldfinches, squirrels, butterflies, cicadas --
we humans are squatters on this planet. We all need a part of earth for
shelter, nourishment, a work site and a place to raise the next
generation. Otherwise we perish.<br>
<br>
Villages in "primitive" societies accommodated everyone's need for a
place to reside and live in dignity. Compare "civilized" society. Some
people squat on thousand-acre ranches and at different places each
season -- penthouses in Manhattan, the French Riviera, castles in
Scotland. We heard Allen Ridley tell us a mere 40 families squat on 7
percent of New Mexico's land.<br>
<br>
While a select few squat in luxury, those at the bottom of the heap
haven't a square inch of space to call their own. Carrying bags of
everything they possess, the homeless squat on sidewalks, under
bridges, in condemned buildings, and in public parks (unless police
chase them away), often sitting ducks for predators.<br>
<br>
The bulk of Americans, meanwhile, are so well-housed that they barely
see the homeless. They easily avoid looking across the Grand
Canyon-sized chasm that exists between them and those suffering from
literally no place to squat. Those few who cater to the homeless
deserve society's inestimable praise and gratitude.<br>
<br>
There are three main categories of street people.
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some are druggies and alcoholics.</span>
We need to pay more attention to what drives so many into addictive
behavior.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many are mental cases</span>.
With the advent of new medicines to treat mental disorders, America
deinstitutionalized most patients. Without safe houses to insure that
they stay on their medicines, however, they can't cope. We freed them
from the nightmare of "snake pit" asylums but left them to face the
nightmare of scary streets.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most scandalously homeless, in
my view, are the working poor.</span>
They don't earn living wages. They lose their savings to disease, fire,
marital problems and from being downsized from better jobs. (Not to
over-romanticize, some clearly live beyond their means and make stupid
life-style choices.) Isn't it intolerable that so many men, women and
children in this 21st century are denied safe and decent places to
sleep, wash, eat and find cover from rain, smothering heat and freezing
cold? Homelessness, once a hot topic, has almost faded from the public
screen. Too few reporters and elected officials address this
embarrassing blot on our social landscape.</li>
</ul>
In the 1980s, Washington, D.C., was concerned about its growing army of
homeless. At that time I found there were 8,000 boarded-up dwelling
units in our Nation's Capital -- more than enough to accommodate some
5,000 street people. I also found there were 11,500 privately owned
vacant lots in the District of Columbia, mostly zoned for and suitable
for homes or apartments. Decent housing on these sites held in cold
storage would have provided an alternative for the many low-income
families squatting in places that were overcrowded, overpriced, overrun
with vermin and overloaded with safety hazards.<br>
<br>
These issues spurred my research described in a 1988 report, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing -- A Missing Link</span>."
Evidence from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and other
sources over a 30-year period revealed the following average cost
increases of items that go into the building and maintenance of housing:
<ul>
  <li>Wages of general building construction workers rose 14 percent a
year.</li>
  <li>Wages of special trade construction workers rose 11 percent a
year.</li>
  <li>Construction material costs rose 11.5 percent a year.</li>
  <li>Combined wage-materials-managerial costs for residential building
rose 12.5 percent a year.</li>
  <li>Fuel and utility costs for housing rose 13.8 percent a year. All
of these costs closely tracked the Consumer Price Index which, over
these same 30 years, rose by 12 percent a year. According to those
figures, housing prices and housing rents apparently were held in check</li>
</ul>
Why do those statistics not seem to jibe with what you have been told,
seen with your own eyes, and felt in your own pocketbooks?
<ul>
  <li>How to explain that, during the last decade of my research
period, U.S.
households with serious housing problems increased from 19 to 24
millions?</li>
  <li>What caused the portion of renters paying more than 35 percent of
their
income for housing doubled from 21 to 41 percent during the last two
decades of the study period?</li>
  <li>Why were over 2.4 million renters paying 60 percent or more of
their income for rent?</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Look Out Below</span><br>
<br>
The answers would be obvious except that, so far, I have not mentioned
what happened to the price of the land that housing sits on. Many of
those who talk and write about housing conveniently overlook the fact
that housing does not exist in mid air but is attached to the land, and
that the price of this land has gone through the stratosphere.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In contrast to those 11- to 14-percent
annual increases in
housing-related costs, residential land values nationwide rose almost
80 percent a year, or almost 2000 percent over those three decades. </span>To
cite a few state examples, residential land prices in 30 years rose
1501 percent in Maryland, 1737 percent in Texas, 2806 percent in New
Hampshire. <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[1]</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>[1] It's been suggested that
this study of housing and land prices be
updated, but it would be almost impossible to duplicate now. It relied
in large part on the data- rich Census of Government studies begun in
the 1950s and continued every five years, showing taxable property
values of land and buildings nationwide and in every state. The
administration of President Reagan (his funeral oratory might almost
excuse one for calling him Saint Reagan) killed this Census Bureau
series. Reagan's team also erased years of my own work under
Congressman Henry S. Reuss of Milwaukee to create a national land price
index. Certain landholding interests apparently want to keep the public
in the dark about the behavior of land and housing markets. </small><br>
</div>
<br>
A close friend in Bethesda bought a house and lot there 40 years ago
for $20,000. Two months ago he sold the property for a cool half
million. That 2400 percent increase was entirely land value. The buyer
immediately demolished the house to put up a larger one, so he clearly
paid half a million for the location value -- the land value -- alone.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Strange Signals from Housing 'Experts'</span><br>
<br>
Officials, civic leaders and commentators who bemoan the lack of
affordable housing nevertheless applaud each rise in real estate values
as a sign of prosperity. Seeing their own assets multiply through no
effort of their own apparently makes them forget the teachers, firemen,
police and low-income people who are boxed out of a place to squat in
their cities and neighborhoods.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Question and an Answer</span><br>
<br>
How did America once have so many livable cities -- compact, easy
walking, pleasant streetscapes and a housing mix for a wide range of
income levels -- in short, like Albuquerque is trying to recreate in a
central neighborhood? Did they have charrettes? Federal, state and
local subsidies? Housing vouchers? Minimum low-income housing
requirements?<br>
<br>
No. From the time of America's founding into the early 1900s, the
federal government had almost no presence in cities. There were no
income taxes or sales taxes. Guess what? States and localities in that
dynamic era relied almost wholly on the property tax. This curbed
extreme land speculation. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Many of our
Founding Fathers, George Washington included, had amassed huge estates.
But the property tax induced them to sell off excess lands they were
not using. </span>When immigrants like my grandfather came here
penniless, they could, after a few years' work, save enough to buy or
rent space in a city -- even Manhattan -- for their own candy store,
tailor shop and the like. Naturally and almost automatically, this easy
access to affordable land spawned the kind of neighborhood variety that
we learned Albuquerque is trying to recreate.<br>
<br>
Albuquerque would be well advised to reduce its taxes on income and
sales, to get rid of New Mexico's onerous gross receipts tax, and shift
to a tax that fosters progress -- a tax on location values.<br>
<br>
To get big results and get them fast, the city might be tempted to do
this quickly. But attempting a rapid change from the present regressive
system could arouse such opposition that it would never fly. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One
of the many virtues of a tax on land values is that it can be
introduced gradually. Cities that take this incremental approach report
that homeowners-voters-taxpayers hardly notice the change. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's important in modernizing
your taxation is not the speed of change but the direction you choose.</span>
If you keep the present tax system with its disincentives for compact
and wholesome growth, you will experience the treadmill effect that has
been so familiar in so-called urban and housing "solutions." You will
have to keep running faster and faster with patchwork remedies to keep
from sliding backward.<br>
<br>
A caution. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revising taxes as proposed
here will not end the need for
housing subsidies, at least not in the short run, but it will do three
things that should greatly reduce subsidies. </span><ul>
  <li>One, by deflating land costs it will enable the private market to
offer homes and sites at lower costs.  </li>
  <li>Two, this will shrink the number of families needing subsidies.  </li>
  <li>Three, it will stretch subsidy dollars farther because sites for
publicly assisted housing can be acquired far more cheaply.</li>
</ul>
In conclusion, I have tried to show that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">America has a housing land
problem, not an affordable housing problem.</span> This problem can be
substantially alleviated by freeing the market of anti-enterprise taxes
and by<span style="font-weight: bold;"> turning the property tax right
side up -- that is, by dropping
tax rates on housing and by raising them on publicly-created land
values.</span><br>
