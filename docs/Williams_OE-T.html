<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix: "<span style="font-style: italic;">Natural
Capitalism"</span> -- A Case Study in Blindness to Land Value Taxation </a><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SYNOPSIS</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Land value
taxation (LVT)</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> has often been
omitted from the lists of natural resources for which eco-taxes are
being advocated. LVT provides strong financial encouragement for land
to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate speculation on land, as
occupants must pay the full LVT whether the land is being fully
utilised or not. This leads to better land management, a reduction in
urban sprawl, less urban smothering of agricultural land, and less
farmland being pushed into hinterland.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actually increases
over time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue
base.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"The depletion of natural resources and

Historical overview</span><br>
<br>
Why has land value taxation (LVT) frequently been omitted from lists of
significant eco-taxes yet, as this paper will argue, LVT can be
enormously influential in its effect on economic and environmental
practices?<br>
<br>
One reason lies in the confusion arising from how the very word "land"
is used imprecisely or in different circumstances such as 
<ul>
  <li>land with agricultural value,  </li>
  <li>(urban) land with largely locational value,  </li>
  <li>land as the very soil itself, or  </li>
  <li>even land in the broad and inclusive sense of meaning natural
resources in general.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Even within the discipline of
macroeconomics, there have been three major shifts in the way land has
been regarded, almost in the manner of a magician's sleight of hand.</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scene 1 has the magician display
a rabbit in a cage. 
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scene 2 has the rabbit
disappear. 
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scene 3 has the magician pull
the "same" rabbit out of a hat.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul><li>Scene 1 was the era of classical economics, when the 3 factors of
production were labour, capital and land - and here the rabbit
represents land principally in the sense of urban land with locational
value, while other natural resources were accorded little or no value
as they were considered to be drawn from an almost infinite storehouse.
    
  </li>
  <li>Scene 2 was the era of neoclassical economics, whose textbooks
invariably started with a recognition that there were three factors of
production but from then on treated land as simply a type of capital.
Land was simply conflated with capital and the rabbit had disappeared!  </li>
  <li>Scene 3 is the era of the environmental reform of economics, when
the rabbit suddenly reappears in the form of natural resources which
effectively exclude land. "Hang on!" squeals a freckle-faced boy in the
front row, "that's a different rabbit!"</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The confusion between land and capital
is well exemplified by the description of property prices which
comprise, of course, buildings and land. Whereas the former depreciate,
the latter usually appreciate, yet their escalating values are
invariably referred to as "house prices increases". </span>Such
confusion demands an examination of <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the distinctive qualities of land
(whose value is largely locational) </span>on which the theory and
practice of LVT is based:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
Unlike capital which is produced and reproduced, land is fixed in supply</span>
(except for minor exceptions like multistorey developments and land
reclamation). As the old saying goes, "Invest in land - they're not
making any more of it". Furthermore, one can't go out into the desert
and truck in prime real estate. And unlike natural resources like air
and water, land can be neatly parceled up and readily "owned" (with
title deeds which confer ownership in perpetuity).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. There are all sorts of substitutes
for capital items and for many natural resources, but there's no
substitute for land - at least, not while the Law of Gravity holds!</span>
It is this twin combination of fixed supply and never-ending demand
which determines how land behaves like a monopoly good, and which led
Churchill to declare, "It is quite true that land monopoly is not the
only monopoly which exists, but it is by far the greatest of monopolies
- it is a perpetual monopoly, and<a href="Churchill_TPL.html"> it
is the mother of
all other forms of monopoly</a>."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[2]<br>

      at
King&#8217;s Theatre, Edinburgh, July 17, 1909</small></font></div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. Unlike capital, the value of land
is not built up by the occupier but by the community (principally
through the increase in presence of population and through the further
provision of tax-funded infrastructure).</span> Herein lies the
rationale for LVT, being the charge by the community for
community-created amenities. As will be further detailed, it also
explains the reason why our present form of land tenure and taxation is
supported by predatory rent-seekers.</div>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this paper to outline the detailed economic
means by which LVT operates in its unique manner, except to highlight
these foundations which may assist those wanting to examine the
theoretical side further. However, as much as brevity permits,
straightforward, non-technical explanations will be given to explain
some of the major benefits of LVT. A brief case study of a best-selling
environmental economics book is attached to this paper as an appendix,
noting the confusion which surrounds the authors' identification of all
major, desirable eco-taxes except LVT.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It should also be noted that the
advantages of LVT extend far beyond the immediate and direct
contribution to environmental solutions - they give rise to economic
efficiency, social justice, individual liberty, world peace, effective
third world aid and more.</span> An understanding of the nature of
economic rent and rent-seeking behaviour would assist the appreciation
of some points made here, but an explanation of this extends beyond the
immediate ambit of this paper. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This
succinct summary, however, may assist: </span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"For the failure to make people pay
rent for access, or possession of, natural resources is at the heart of
all major environmental problems, and is the cause of some of the most
fractious geo-political problems .... <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">There are no remedies for the
ecocrises that do not include a heightened awareness of the value of
economic rent and the process of the land market"</span><small><span

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="II._The_problem_of_sprawl"></a>II.
The problem of sprawl</span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">While taxes on labour and
capital act as a deterrent to production and employment, the unique
qualities of land are such that a tax on land values encourages land to
be put to its optimal use. Simply put, land holders cannot afford to
hold land unused or underused, for they are compelled to pay the full
LVT whether they use this scarce resource or not. </span>The resulting
<span style="font-weight: bold;">compact cityscape</span> would consume
far less resources (in terms of land, infrastructure and ongoing energy
costs) and would be more amenable to the provision of public transport,
walking and riding.<br>
<br>
Note that advocates of LVT, often nowadays called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Geoists</span>, call for the full
collection of the LVT and not the partial and misapplied (with all
manner of exemptions and thresholds) forms collected by some local,
state and federal governments in Australia and elsewhere. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">When the land occupier is repaying his/her
full dues (which is only just, as they represent the value of the
amenities of the land), then land will have no market price. </span>The
improvements on the land (buildings etc.) retain their market value as
they are not being taxed, so production is not penalised or
discouraged. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The social justice
implications of having land with no market price (i.e. all humanity
having their very birthright) are profound, but are again outside the
domain of this paper.</span><br>
<br>
While all landholders will be encouraged to put their land to its
optimal use, land speculators will be particularly affected by LVT. The
former head of the Town Planning Department of the University of
Queensland, Philip Day, characterises the current lure of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">windfall </span>increases in land value
operating as a standing invitation to "develop" land by seeking
approval for a change of use, irrespective of its environmental
significance and regardless of how such rezoning repeatedly leads to
the environmentally destructive process of urban sprawl.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[4]<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">While, at first sight, the prospect of
sprawling cities with lots of open space and possible greenery might be
appealing from an environmental perspective, a closer examination
should lead to a different conclusion.</span> The inducement to collect
windfall profits (resulting from the failure of society to apply LVT)
encourages some landholders to withhold vacant land from the market and
forces new development to "leapfrog" this land and move further out.
Hence there is an unnecessary outlay in roads, pipelines, power
supplies and other infrastructure which must service a greater area.
Commuting journeys, similarly, must now consume greater resources.
Financially inducing land to be put to its optimal use is not
"flogging" the land, but is rather ensuring land is carefully used and
that we only exploit as much as we properly need.<br>
<br>
That LVT deters urban sprawl is now becoming widely accepted even in
mainstream economics, with endorsements being expressed by such
luminaries as Ralph Nader<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[5]</span></small> and
Nobel prize-winning economist William Vickery<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[6] </span></small>.<br>

<br>
It should be noted that environmentally-harmful sprawl also occurs as
suburbs sprawl over farmland, and underused farmland sprawls over what
should be left as national parks or wilderness. As Gaffney stresses,
"Sprawl in the urban environment is the kind most publicised, but there
is analogous sprawl in agriculture, forestry, mining, recreation and
other land uses and industries."<small><span

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="III._Affordable_and_efficient_public"></a>III. Affordable and
efficient public transport</span><br>
<br>
But LVT has much more to contribute to the question of low-impact urban
function, in the form of affordable and efficient public transport and
other desirable infrastructure. The principle reason why public
transport options are presently so limited is because the
taxpayer-funded investment in this and other forms of infrastructure
effectively disappears, in an almost unseen manner, into the "Black
Hole" of landowners' pockets.<br>
<br>
That is, <span style="font-weight: bold;">not only is the resulting
compact cityscape more amenable to the provision of public transport
(not to mention walking and riding), but LVT makes the investment in
such infrastructure affordable because the resulting enhanced land
values are "recycled" back into public coffers.</span> The extension of
<span style="font-weight: bold;">London's Jubilee line</span>
underground network, which opened in 1999, provides a good case in
point of how desirable infrastructure can be self-funding if land
values are recaptured. An independent study was performed which
assessed the increase in land values extending to 800 yards from each
of the 10 stations. The accumulated gain (to private landowners) was
estimated to be around &pound;13 billion, courtesy of the &pound;3.5
billion of taxpayers funds it took to build the line!<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[8]<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>8 Riley, Don, Taken for a Ride,
Centre for Land Policy Studies, London, 2001, pp.23-7</small></font></div>
<br>
It is the fact that such infrastructure has always been potentially
affordable that has led the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements
(Habitat) to include support of it in the 1996, as well as the 1976,
declarations. The 1996 Habitat agenda states and recommends:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Apply transparent, comprehensive and
equitable fiscal incentive mechanisms, as appropriate, to stimulate the
efficient, accessible and environmentally sound use of land, and
utilize land based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial
resources for service provision by local authorities"<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[9]&nbsp; </span><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">9 Paragraph 76(h) of 1996 U.N.
Habitat agenda</font></small></div>
</div>
<br>
Furthermore, in 1976, Australia, along with other nations, endorsed the
so-called Vancouver Plan, being the recommendations of the United
Nations Habitat Conference on Human Settlements, which called for the
unearned increment in land values resulting from changes in land use to
be recouped by communities and applied to the provision of urban
infrastructure and services. However, as Day laments, "Nowhere in the
western world has this obligation to recoup betterment been fully
implemented".<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[10]<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">10 Day, op.cit., p.4</font></small></div>
<br>
Nor does LVT merely hold open the possibility of partially offsetting
some of the investment costs. The impressive aforementioned estimates
relating to London's Jubilee line extension speak for themselves, and
William Vickrey made similar estimates for New York which conclude that
the collection of land rents as public revenue would generate
sufficient revenue to completely defray the capital costs of investment
in infrastructure.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]<br>
</span></small>

<br>
A simple model will serve to illustrate. Presently, rail/metro
infrastructure is almost prohibitively expensive because the windfall
benefits are effectively handed over to landowners. To partially recoup
the outlay, authorities are forced to set fares so high as to act as a
disincentive to potential low-impact commuters.<br>
<br>
Enter LVT. Land values enhanced by the infrastructure are "recycled" by
LVT back into the public purse. This enables fares to be reduced, which
makes the adjacent land more valuable because it now has access to
cheaper public transport. These resulting enhanced land values are
again recycled back to the community coffers, which again allows low
fares which allow more recycled enhanced land values, which allow lower
fares which allow..... While illustrating the process, in practice such
iterations would be bypassed as authorities would cut to the chase and
set the most economically and environmentally desirable fare structure,
which equals the marginal cost of traveling, and not have to dig into
scarce public funds to finance such projects. A further example of
self-funding is given in the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="IV._Agricultural_benefits"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">IV.
Agricultural benefits</span><br>
<br>
The application of LVT to agricultural land, with the assessment being
based on "maximum sustainable yield," forces farmers to think long-term
and provides much-needed financial incentives for organic farming. That
is, farmers will be saddled with the same annual LVT dues whatever
their yield (in addition to climatic considerations in assessing LVT)
and will now have a powerful incentive to farm with a long-term
perspective. If, for example, the land is degraded and yields
consequently drop, then the financial consequences will properly be
borne by the farmer. This is merely the briefest of explanations of an
important adaptation of LVT, which calls for other measures such as the
requirement for any user of the Global Commons to pay an appropriate <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ecological Security Deposit</span> and a
transition period to allow farmers to unhook themselves from the
conventional chemical circuit.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>12 Hardy, Shirley-Anne, The Land
Question, self-published, Malvern, Scotland, 1981, p.8<br>
</small></font></div>
The LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from monitoring
human activity, onto our use and abuse of natural resources, as any
responsible form of stewardship should. The potential effect of such a
focus on everyday attitudes is inestimable.<br>
<br>
The process of monitoring and assessing LVT itself leads to a more
subtle, more environmentally-appreciative understanding of how best to
prioritise conflicting demands on land. Should a tract of land best be
used for green space for local residents, a light rail corridor or
employment providing development? LVT assessment inherently weighs the
pros and cons of a whole range of intangible costs and benefits for the
wider community now and into the future, and eliminates corrupting
"NIMBY" motives and rent-seeking behaviour that influence existing
planning and development decisions. In response to the accusation that
LVT assessment is little more than a best guess at quantifying values
that are inherently unquantifiable, LVT advocates respond "Guilty as
charged!" However, they then add, "Our good guesses are based on solid,
objective methodology and are better than wild guesses, and even most
wild guesses are better than the decisions made today." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Currently, many natural resources are
almost assigned a worthless value because, not entering the mainstream
marketplace, they usually have no $ tags hanging off them - hence the
existence of externalities whereby the environment is plundered as near
worthless.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">So even
wild guesses at the value of land and other natural resources are
better than the present situation, in which the "no guess" decision
effectively assigns natural and community resources a zero value.</span><br>
<br>
One way or another, it is necessary to quantify and prioritise the real
value (in a broad sense) of natural resources to better account for
economic externalities. In the end, only if a prospective resource user
is prepared to pay the full cost of utilising land and other natural
resources will resource extraction or development go ahead. The
intrinsic nature of the LVT assessment process considerably assists in
such cost estimation.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">LVT's foundation of detailed land use
assessments will also help expose the true costs of subsidies for
natural resources, which effectively amount to negative eco-taxes.</span>
Subsidies come in all shapes and sizes, often barely visible, and
urgently need to be exposed and evaluated. Even some harmful subsidies
which are labeled land taxes have nothing to do with genuine LVT. Banks
gives the example of a Brazilian tax which was levied on unimproved
land but was reduced by up to 90% on land used for crops or pasture.
Forests were classified as unimproved land and were therefore taxed at
the full rate, which induced settlers to chop down the trees to reduce
their tax liability."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[13]<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>13 Banks, op.cit., p.28</small></font></div>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The major dynamic behind such
over-exploitation of parts of the environment is the process by which
hundreds of millions of people are displaced onto marginal land by
current tax-and-tenure systems. </span>In desperation they overwork
resources that ought to be carefully nurtured. Yet the practices of
such desperate peasants can be largely halted when the principles of
LVT are implemented and made clear. Daly makes the case that taking
away by taxation the value added by individuals from applying their own
labor and capital creates resentment but "taxing away value that no one
added, scarcity rents on nature's contribution, does not create
resentment. In fact, failing to tax away the scarcity rents to nature

</small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For reasons similar to those
we've seen with the example of landowners benefiting from investment in
infrastructure, much aid to developing countries does little to
alleviate the plight and environmentally-destructive practices of the
desperate landless, who can only work on the conditions demanded by the
landowners because of the aforementioned monopolistic qualities of
land. </span>Improvements to infrastructure simply boost land values
and the rents demanded of the landless. Furthermore, as Banks notes,
"Canceling part of the debt amounts to the infusion of billions of
dollars into these less developed countries which, under the existing
tenure and tax regimes, would benefit the price of land rather than
provide work for the landless."<small><span

Financial concerns</span><br>
<br>
That public finance can be raised is a way that doesn't undervalue
natural resources is, of course, a principle of all eco-taxes. But the
amount of revenue that can be raised, while still sending these strong
price signals, is also important to build infrastructure, social
welfare, education, environmental rehabilitation etc. The funds that
can be raised (or have been forgone thus far) from LVT are colossal by
any estimate. Beck notes the Worldwatch Institute claim that if
property taxes in North America and Japan were replaced with pure land
value taxes and if land value taxes reached the same level in the rest
of the world, they could generate 12 percent of global tax revenue, or
$900 billion a year.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[16]<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>16 Beck, Hanno T., in Wenzer,
Kenneth C. Land Value Taxation, M.E. Sharpe, New York, 1999, p.222</small></font></div>
<br>
A more detailed estimate of potential LVT has been made for Australia -
an estimated A$132.7 billion for Australia in 1998-99<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[17]</span></small> .
One could argue that, in terms of potential revenue alone, LVT deserves
resolute investigation.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>17 Dwyer, Terry The Taxable
Capacity of Australian Land and Resources, Land Values Research Group,
Canberra, 2001, p.18</small></font></div>
<br>
The whole field of eco-taxes cannot be viewed in isolation of the
fiscal imperatives to raise sufficient public finance, and here we see
another of the virtues of LVT. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If people were required to pay the
rental value of most natural resources they used (as many, in fact,
already do - to private owners) an adjustment in patterns of
consumption would follow. The environmental goals would be achieved -
at the cost of fiscal goals.</span><br>
<br>
However, under our present fiscal regime, governments are locked into a
dependency on revenue from socially-harmful sources such as tobacco and
gambling, and cannot raise the taxes on them to levels that would "kill
the golden goose". Would such political realities change with
eco-taxes? Because of the inherent problem with most eco-taxes that
they reduce consumption of natural resources and therefore the tax
base, they give rise to a financial inducement to hold the tax rate at
a low enough rate so that a degree of pollution and wasteful
consumption can continue.<br>
<br>
The effects of conventional eco-taxes sharply contrast with LVT which
instead is a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">renewable
and naturally-escalating source of revenue</span> which arises when
people are willing to pay for the use of land the value of which is
enhanced by natural resources which sustain healthy lives. In other
words, the success of a cleaner and more secure environment would feed
through to the land market, which measures the attraction of the
natural environment for living and working. Because people are willing
to pay higher rents for such benefits LVT, instead of eroding revenue, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">expands the public's
revenue base so that everybody enjoys the benefits of cleaning up and
conserving the natural environment.</span> Under the current system of
land tenure, the financial benefits of a cleaner environment accrue to
landowners.<br>

LVT and its 19th-century champion, <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Henry George</a>, achieved huge
acclaim before being buried by the "purpose-built" body of neoclassical
economics financed largely by rent-seeking American plutocrats.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[18]</span></small> In
one form or another, Henry George's writings on the need to tax land
values was preceded or endorsed by various biblical prophets, and by
Carlyle, Churchill, Einstein, Franklin, Aldous Huxley, Jefferson,
Lincoln, Locke, J.S. Mill, Paine, Penn, Rousseau, Bertrand Russell,
Adam Smith, Spencer, Spinoza, Sun Yat Sen, James Tobin, Tolstoy, Twain,
Voltaire, Winstanley, Frank Lloyd Wright and many more.<small><span

Just how this wisdom has been lost sight of is a long - too long for
this paper - and tragic story.<br>

<br>
Here, for this conference, is the quirk - <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">environmental considerations played almost
no part in the compelling endorsements lavished on LVT! The main bill,
then and now, is its powerful explanation of the great causes of social
injustice, with the second billing going to an exposure of a whole
range of economic inefficiencies and deadweight losses of our present
economic system, which should more accurately be termed land-monopoly
capitalism.</span> Support acts include 
<ul>
  <li>libertarian ideals (non-intrusive tax systems),  </li>
  <li>effective Third World Aid,  </li>
  <li>an end to tax evasion,  </li>
  <li>contributions to world peace, and  </li>
  <li>an end to boom &amp; bust cycles.</li>
</ul>
The appeal of LVT to some others is more its philosophical basis and
how its implementation must turn the economy the right way up, such
that the cause of the "madness" (because completely unnecessary) of
involuntary unemployment is eliminated, which of necessity then leads
to the range of benefits just mentioned.<br>
<br>
This is not a meandering departure from the subject of this conference.
No significant, effectual solutions can be made to our environment if
the all-embracing economic system is only nibbled at, piecemeal, from
the angle of taxation alone.<br>
<br>
LVT is not a mere taxation solution, but an integrated economic
solution, impacting on land management and cutting at the heart of
privilege and injustice. Yes, environmental tax reformers must indeed
address the looting of undervalued natural resources driven by
bourgeois habits of overconsumption. Let us not, however, overlook the
destruction resulting from short-term perspectives driven by poverty
and desperation. LVT deals with both worlds.<br>

CAPITALISM</span>" - A CASE STUDY IN BLINDNESS TO LAND VALUE TAXATION</span><br>
<br>
This book by Hawken &amp; Lovins is meticulously researched,
well-argued and rather deserving of its best-selling status, yet it
completely misses the need for LVT. As such, it is illustrative of how
so many major advantages of LVT can be momentarily grasped and then
mislaid.<br>
<br>
At the very beginning<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[20]</span></small> the
authors make a exhaustive list of natural resources (which they term <span
 style="font-style: italic;">natural capital</span>) used by humankind,
yet fail to mention the one on which we all need to stand! In the
wide-ranging review which follows, the authors appear to come
tantalizingly close to grasping many of the direct benefits of LVT,
only to lose the thread and conclude the book, no closer to a
realisation of the monumental impact LVT would bring about.<br>

<br>
The authors devote a full 17 pages<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[21]</span></small> to
the Brazilian city of Curitiba, holding it up as emblematic of an
enlightened municipality which has overcome a whole raft of economic,
social and environmental problems. Yet, even though the authors
explicitly state that "The city runs mainly on property taxes"<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[22]</span></small> and
acknowledge how property taxpayers are intimately involved in the
decision-making process<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[23]</span></small> ,
they investigate these matters no further. Had they understood how LVT
allows environmental custodianship to be self-funding by recycling
enhanced land values, they would have seized the significance of LVT in
their account of Curitiba's green renewal which concludes "And green
begets green; land values around the new parks have risen sharply, and
with them tax revenues."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[24]</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">21 ibid., pp.288-305</font></small><font size="-1"><br>

    <small>23 ibid., p.299</small><br>
    <small>24 ibid., p.297</small></font>
</div>
<br>
Elsewhere, they see the small picture, but not the big. A solid case is
mounted to make driving and parking vehicles bear their true costs<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[25]</span></small>
(this is, of course, LVT in the form of renting of temporary or
"moving" parcels of land), but cannot see the wood for the trees.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">25 ibid., p.40-2</font></small></div>
<br>
Urban sprawl deservedly receives much attention, yet the powerful
impetus LVT gives to put land to its optimal use and bring about a more
compact cityscape remains unnoticed. Toronto's inducement to clustering
around urban corridors is praised, but no inquiry is made into its
"density bonuses and penalties".<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[26] </span></small>Also
left tantalizingly unexplained is the statement "Mortgage and tax rules
that subsidize dispersed suburbs are another long-standing cause of
sprawl."<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[27]<br>
</span></small>

<br>
Geoism eliminates the curse of land speculation by making it
economically unaffordable to hold onto land that is not put to its
optimal use. In the study of Curitiba, the authors recognise the ills
of speculation<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[28]</span></small> ,
but demonstrate their limited vision by stating "A good start to
correcting these costly distortions would be to make developers bear
the expenses they impose on the community."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[29]</span></small> Of
course, we ALL should pay for costs we impose on the community, just as
the authors rightly say elsewhere that we should all pay for costs
imposed on the environment. In terms of LVT, "in proportion to what we
take from the community (in terms of the exclusive use we make of
land), we should repay." Or, in more general terms, "Pay for what we
take, not what we make." On this point (the present practice of taxing
production), the authors have clearly seen the inequity and economic
disadvantages of such punitive taxes<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[30] </span></small>,
as well as the folly of subsidising the use of natural resources
(surely such subsidies should be seen as negative eco-taxes?!)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[31]</span></small> .<br>

The authors' otherwise first-rate survey and set of proposals ends on a
disappointing and baffling note when take the conventional approach of
viewing the Earth as a speculative commodity and bemoan plummeting real
estate prices in Southern California<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[32]</span></small> .
While the case for adopting a wide range of technical innovations has
been convincingly argued, until the Geoist perspective has been taken,
there is little to substantiate the authors claim that this a
"revolutionary paradigm for the industrial economy".<small><span
