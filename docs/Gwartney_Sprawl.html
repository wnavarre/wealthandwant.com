<p><small><a name="Unused" id="Unused"></a><small><b>Unused
land is far more abundant than we realize.</b></small> </small></p>
<p>We utilize less than 5% of the total land area in the United
States for urban purposes, including housing, commerce, and
manufacturing. As you fly across the country all you see is farm,
timber, desert and an occasional small community. While less than 5%
of our nation's land area is needed for urban purposes, much vacant
land within existing cities is bypassed because it is cheaper to
build further out than pay the high prices demanded for the more
efficient, better located, land. The result is urban sprawl. Why do
we choose to utilize land distant from employment, social, and civic
needs while bypassing superior land? Why do many of us choose to
spend two hours each day commuting to work? Why do our older cities
fail to renew or rebuild obsolete buildings? Sprawl is not just about
the density of land use. In many cities only one half of the land is
devoted to housing and commercial uses while the other half is vacant
or under-improved. Could it be that there are inefficient
requirements built into some public policies? Smart growth should not
be constrained by archaic patterns that impede or misappropriate free
and open urban land usage. Local ordinances and practices within
cities that force accelerated suburban sprawl should be abolished. We
don't need more regulation, we need greater freedom to act
responsibly. Individuals should have the opportunity to decide
whether they want to live in the suburbs or in the city. This should
not be a coerced decision because of a public policy that impedes
growth within the city. Simple tax reform can help to achieve some of
the goals and objectives of smart growth without government
intervention and wasteful subsidies.</p>
<p><small><a name="End" id="End"></a><small><b>End
the Public Subsidy of Land Speculation and Sprawl</b></small></small></p>
<p>If land holders can produce a higher return on investment by not
using land for productive purposes but rather hold it for a higher
price from those willing and able to pay the higher price in the
future, there is a flaw in public policy. Public policy thereby gives
speculative, nonproductive investment a higher return than productive
investment. Sprawl is subsidized by taxes on production and
distribution and the failure to recapture the benefits resulting from
public improvements. If we choose to end this subsidy, we would
reduce sprawl.</p>
<p>One example that I know is that of a friend who bought land within
the city but did nothing with it. I asked him why he put good money
into an investment that had no visible return? He replied that, by
holding the land for future sale or development, his long term
return, in capital gains would exceed 18% annually. If he built a
building on the site now, his long term return would only be 12%
annually, including both net income plus capital gains. Why should he
use his land now when it would be more profitable for him to not use
it, but to hold it for a larger future gain?</p>
<p>Most major cities have a substantial amount of fully serviced but
unused or underused land sites. It is estimated that 38% of the land
area in Los Angeles is unused, 30% in New York City and 25% in
Washington, D.C. Intercity sites are bypassed because land
speculators receive a greater benefit by ignoring the highest and
best use of land sites. A greater profit is made when development is
delayed and the land price increases to higher levels. But building
within existing developed areas uses the existing and underused
infrastructure, roads, transit, public facilities, and services.
Sprawl requires new expenditures on public goods and services, more
government, more taxes, more dislocation. </p>
<p><a name="Counterproductive" id="Counterproductive"></a><b>Counterproductive
growth limitations and regulations should be abolished.</b></p>
<p>Property
taxes should not be levied on new construction or existing
improvements, when the revenue needed could be obtained from the land
values created and maintained by the community.</p>
<p>The property tax could be shifted to reduce the incentives for
sprawl. If the property tax were taken off urban buildings and
focused on the land itself, this would penalize land speculation and
would reward people who build on their land. Thus land speculation,
which promotes a "leap frog" development out of the city and into the
surrounding countryside, would decrease. The proposed shift from
traditional property tax to a "land value tax" would penalize land
speculation and encourage urban redevelopment. Removing the tax on
buildings makes them cheaper to construct, renovate and operate, and
more affordable to buy or rent. Urban construction creates urban
jobs. Capital and labor both benefit.</p>
<p><a name="renewal" id="renewal"></a><b>A Strategy for Urban
Renewal</b></p>
<p>Established cities could adopt some very practical long-term
measures that will make the city a place where people can and will
want to live, work, and play in safety. What few city leaders
understand is the destructive role that taxation has played in the
out-migration of people and business.</p>
<p>What is needed is a continuously self-renewing city and a public
policy that can work effectively. Buildings have a limited useful
life. Continuous maintenance and frequent retrofitting sometimes
extends this life span. Other buildings reach a point where they
should be replaced. Some buildings sit vacant for decades even in the
city's central business district. Valuable parcels of land are left
undeveloped or paved over and used as surface parking lots. The
result is a lower tax base and an eyesore.</p>
<p>As urban buildings deteriorate, owners often don't renovate,
remodel or make repairs because their property tax may rise. Thus the
typical property tax creates suburban sprawl and urban decay.
Shifting the property tax off buildings and onto land reverses these
processes. Taxing land more than buildings usually reduces taxes for
homeowners.</p>
<p>One means that has long been available but not brought into
general use is to exempt buildings from the real estate tax and begin
to impose an annual tax on land sites that makes holding land off the
market for speculation a costly proposition. An annual fee on land
should be set near what the land site alone would yield if rented by
the owner to the highest bidder. Think of how this would change the
behavior of land owners. If I owned a parcel of land with a rental
value of $6,000 a year and that was near what the city charged me as
my annual fee, my return on investment as a land speculator would be
greatly reduced. In order to generate positive cash flow I would
either develop the land myself or put it on the market so that
someone else would develop it. At the same time, if my tax rate on
the building I constructed on the land was zero, my incentive is to
construct a building that maximizes my cash flow (i.e., to develop
the parcel to its highest and best use in the market). At minimum,
land prices would stabilize and the increase in land brought onto the
market would be somewhat offset by increased demand. Land prices to
builders would tend to begin to fall over time.</p>
<p>This is where the anti-sprawl component appears. As the city
begins to renew itself -- as property owners are no longer penalized
when they renovate or build new structures -- businesses and people
will increasingly see the city as a more desirable place and not just
in a few neighborhoods that now benefit by abatement programs and
public subsidies.</p>
<p>Exempting property improvements from taxation and collecting all
of the property tax from land values (which are created by the
community as a whole and not by individuals) is the cornerstone to
continuous self-renewal and the reduction of urban sprawl. Community
leaders, residents and business owners can discuss how this renewal
will take place, to ensure that neighborhoods retain existing
amenities and create new ones that will make every neighborhood vital
and attractive. By correcting this serious structural flaw in tax
policy that has existed for so long, people will gradually return to
city, contributing to its self-renewal.</p>
<p>By utilizing land within cities efficiently and in response to the
demand for its use, open space and natural habitats outside the city
will be conserved. If urban land is used to its highest and best use,
farm land and environmentally sensitive land will not be required for
inappropriate uses. Builders and developers would not have to bypass
serviced but vacant land to construct housing at a further distance
from where it is needed or wanted.</p>
<p><a name="Development" id="Development"></a><b>A Strategy for
Economic Development</b></p>
<p>Economic theory recognizes that when government places taxes on
production and on commerce the net result is a reduction in those
activities. The reason this occurs is that these taxes add to the
cost of production and to the cost of doing business. The ideal
public policy would be to reduce taxes on production and commerce and
raise public revenue from non-distorting revenue sources.</p>
<p>That non-distorting revenue source is land and natural resources.
The central problem which limits the operational success of the
economy is the failure to procure the public value which is created
by the community. </p>
<p>This value ought to be reserved for the community to pay for
public improvements. However, this value is to a large extent
diverted into private pockets by speculation in land and natural
resource values. The correct approach is to create a system in which
no-one, except the citizenry as a whole, is rewarded by the
collection of publicly created values.</p>
<p>Economists can agree that the economically efficient public
finance system is one in which revenue is drawn from the rent that
people pay for the use of land and natural resources. These payments
do not distort economic activity. Land rent, because it is pure
surplus, could be taken and used for any purpose and there would be
no negative consequences for the allocation of labor and capital, or
in the use of land and natural resources. If this surplus is invested
in needed infrastructure and other public services, it will in turn
increase land values for future public investment.</p>
<p><a name="Public" id="Public"></a><b>Public Finance by
Self-Financing</b></p>
<p>In the public sector, capital investment in infrastructure
projects would no longer be a debt burden, because the projects would
become self-financing. User charges for the public services, when
combined with the rental income created by these projects, would
cover the cost of creating and running a public service.</p>
<p>It was estimated that the BART transportation system in San
Francisco produced two times more land value than it cost to build.
The public recaptured only a small part of the cost from benefits
provided by land taxes and user fees. Most of the cost came from
external sources, unrelated sales and income taxes. Most of the
profits went into only a few pockets.</p>
<p>Thus, the claim that a community is short of capital is
misleading. In fact, a community could become self-sufficient in the
supply of capital from internal sources. But a precondition for this
is the reduction of taxes on productive capital and labor. Examine,
for example, what would happen as a result of the elimination of
taxation of buildings. This decision, not to penalize people who
invest their savings in new buildings, leads to the stimulation of a
higher level of national income, higher saving, and the creation of
new capital. According to the study made by Tideman and Plassmann
(1998, The Losses of Nations, Fred Harrison, editor, Orthila Press),
shifting taxes off buildings, production and distribution, and onto
land and natural resources, could increase the gross national product
by 25%, or one <span style="font-style: italic;">trillion </span>1998
dollars
($1,000,000,000,000).</p>
<p>The Land Value Tax Shift from labor and capital is not only a key
to reversing suburban sprawl and protecting rural environments &#8212; it
is a key to realizing the dream and fulfilling promises of a truly
free market &#8212;  with liberty, prosperity, and justice for all.</p>
