<center><b>Being Just While Conceptions of Justice are
Changing:
7 Cases
</b>
</center>
<p style="text-align: center;">T. Nicolaus Tideman</p>
<p>A conception of justice is a framework for resolving questions of
what liberties people ought to have. The smooth functioning of
society requires substantial consensus about conceptions of justice,
because without such consensus, people will take actions and make
claims on resources that others regard as intrusions upon what is
properly theirs. This can be expected to lead, at a minimum, to
disharmony and possibly to violent conflict. On the other hand, when
people agree on a conception of justice and who is competent to
interpret it, conflicts will be less likely to arise, and those that
do arise can be settled more easily. Thus there is strong impetus
toward stability in any society's conception of justice: Any doubts
about a shared conception of justice may be suppressed or hidden to
preserve the advantages of consensus.</p>
<p>Moral evolution, however, can require conceptions of justice to
change, as when the world came to recognize that slavery could not be
just, or that women must be accorded the same civil rights as men.
When, as with the abolition of slavery, a new conception of justice
entails the elimination of the sale value of what had previously been
assets, there will be calls for compensation, on the ground that, as
provided in the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the U.S.
Constitution, governments should not take property without
compensation.</p>
<p>Advocates of the new understanding, on the other hand, will argue
against compensation on the ground that citizens who knew better
should not be obliged to bail out those who had sought to enrich
themselves through the perpetuation of old injustices. When slavery
was ended in the U.S., not only was there no compensation for the
previous "owners" of slaves, but the thirteenth amendment to the U.S.
Constitution explicitly forbade any state from paying compensation.
Why should the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the U.S.
Constitution require compensation in general while the thirteenth
amendment forbids it for losses sustained from the end of slavery?
Ackerman (1984) points out the importance of the distinction between
ordinary legislation, where it must be accepted that self-interest
will be rife, and constitutional law-making, where something much
closer to consensus is achieved. It was not inconsistent for the
thirteenth amendment to depart from the general principle that
compensation must be provided, because the constitutional process
attenuated the self-interested forces that the requirement of
compensation was designed to check.</p>
<p>This paper analyzes the issue of compensation in connection with
the possible emergence of an understanding that land is the common
heritage of citizens, and that therefore the rental value of land
should be collected for public purposes or for a guaranteed income.
The impetus toward the understanding that land is the common heritage
of citizens comes from the combination of the Lockean view that
claims of rights to exclude others must be rooted in productive
effort (Locke, 1965, Second Treatise, para. 27), the recognition of
the substantial elements of force and fraud in the origins of land
titles (Alfred N. Chandler, 1945), and the recognition that parcels
of land have value that is independent of human effort expended on
them. If such an understanding is implemented by a constitutional
amendment, there would be no necessity of compensation. Would it
nevertheless be appropriate?</p>
<p>The paper argues that there are a variety of factors that
attenuate claims for compensation and make a justifiable system of
compensation so complex that it may be unworkable. But if there is to
be a system of compensation, the one justifiable source of funds to
finance it is assets that have been acquired by appropriating or
buying land and then selling it.</p>
<p>One possible way of avoiding the conflict over compensation is to
focus on potential practical problems with the understanding that
land is the common heritage of citizens:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it really possible to
identify the rental value of land, apart from improvements that have
been made to the land?  </li>
  <li>Is there a principled answer to the question
of how rent should be divided among levels of government?  </li>
  <li>Would
recognition of equal claims to land result in population growth that
would threaten the habitability of the planet?</li>
</ul>
I have addressed these
questions in other papers (T. Nicolaus Tideman, 1990, 1991). Here it
is assumed that any such concerns would not be serious enough to
block implementation if the basic principle is accepted.
<p>The issue of compensation will be examined by considering some
idealized cases, identifying the principles they exhibit, and then
asking how those principles apply to the circumstances in which
modern societies are likely to find themselves.</p>
<p><a name="Case 1"></a><b>Case 1</b>. A republic of the former
Soviet Union privatizes land by selling it to the highest bidders.
Six months later the republic decides that the proper treatment of
land is to require every possessor to pay the rental value of land to
the public treasury.</p>
<blockquote>This is an easy case for compensation. Without
compensation, the case has all the hallmarks of deliberate deception of
buyers to fleece them. Since the government treasury is the sole
beneficiary of the initial use of the wrong rule, it has an obligation
to repay the purchase price to every purchaser or to that person's
successor in title before the rental value of the land can respectably
be collected.</blockquote>
<p><a name="Case 2."></a><b>Case 2.</b> There is an agricultural
society that has been using a rule that whoever plants on land first
in any year owns the harvest of that land that year. They notice that
this rule leads to premature and excessive planting, so they divide
the available land equally among all families. Then a few years later
a new family is formed, and this couple argues that they should not
be deprived of an equal share of land just because they were children
at the time that the division of land occurred. Recognizing that this
is going to be a recurring problem, the society adopts a rule that
the rental value of land will be collected and divided equally among
all adults. No trades in land have occurred between the initial
division and the decision to collect the rental value of the
land.</p>
<blockquote>This is an easy case for no compensation. The mistake is
recognized in time to give everyone what he or she would have gotten if
the right rule had been implemented from the beginning.</blockquote>
<p><a name="Case 3."></a><b>Case 3.</b> This is a variation on Case
2. First the land is divided equally among existing families, with an
understanding that land rights will be tradable. Land trades occur
for ten years, and then under pressure from young persons who did not
receive allocations, at a time when it is possible to identify all
the trades in land that have occurred, a decision is made to collect
the rental value of all land and divide it among all adults in the
society.</p>
<blockquote>Compensation is plausible in this case because it is
possible to identify who should compensate whom. If the recognition
that the rental value of the land should be collected socially had
occurred earlier, then past transactions in unimproved land would have
involved only nominal amounts of money. The initial choice of the wrong
allocation rule can be corrected by giving every purchaser of land a
claim on the person from whom the land was purchased, for the amount of
the purchase price.</blockquote>
<p><b>Case 4.</b> There is an agricultural society in which land is
initially redivided equally each year among all adults. Then a band
of marauders invades and claims ownership of all land by right of
conquest. The marauders form a ruling oligarchy and create tradable
land titles, which they parcel out equally among themselves. The
original inhabitants are allowed to continue to use most of the land
in exchange for payments of rent. They are also allowed to buy land.
Two generations later, the softer descendants of the marauders
succumb to pressures to implement a democracy. At a time when 90% of
the land is in the hands of descendants of the marauders, a
democratically elected parliament implements a tax of 100% of the
rental value of land.</p>
<blockquote>For this case, the descendants of the marauders have no
claims to compensation. Those who bought land from the marauders or
their descendants have respectable claims against the sellers, as in
Case 3. But such claims cannot always be satisfied. A profligate son of
a marauder may have sold all the land he inherited, spent the proceeds
on high living and died penniless, leaving nothing to his heirs. If
there is no reason why some buyers of land should be compensated but
not others, and if there are substantial fortunes that can be
identified as the products of land sales, then it may be sensible to
have an aggregate compensation scheme, in which all persons who sold
land, and their heirs, are required to compensate all persons who had
purchased land.</blockquote>
<p><b>Case 5.</b> Land has been privately owned and rather equally
distributed since time immemorial. One day people suddenly realize
that land should be regarded as the heritage of all citizens. </p>
<blockquote>The new realization entails redistribution from current
citizens to future ones. It cannot be achieved without making current
citizens worse off. Virtually all current citizens have participated in
the past legitimization of private ownership of land by buying and
selling land titles. But there is no realistic possibility of
identifying how much of the assets of any person were derived from
appropriations and sales of land.
  <p>In these circumstances, there may be no class of individuals who
can reasonably be called upon to finance compensation. Financing
compensation by either a tax on wages or a capital levy could only be
justified by a high correlation between the tax base and unjust
enrichment under the previous order. It may be most appropriate to
simply allow losses from the new understanding to lie where they fall
and handle any resulting case of true distress by whatever system is
used to care for other persons who are not able to provide for
themselves.</p>
  <p>If, despite the difficulties, a compensation scheme were
implemented, it would at least be possible to reduce claims for
compensation by the amounts of claimants' past gains from rises in the
price of land. A person who has been the beneficiary of a rise in land
values because of population growth and expansion of public services
cannot reasonably complain if subsequent moral development eliminates
those gains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="Case 6."></a><b>Case 6. </b>This is a variation on case
5, where the recognition that equal access to land should be a
birthright occurs gradually, over decades. As the recognition
develops momentum, the price of land begins to fall because people
believe that if it succeeds, land may have no sale value and there
may be no compensation. After 30 years of public debate, the movement
has achieved the degree of acceptance necessary to implement a
constitutional amendment that will cement the new understanding. The
only question that remains to be decided is what compensation, if
any, will be granted to people for the loss of sale value of their
land.</p>
<blockquote>Here, whatever strength there may have been to the claim
for compensation is attenuated by the discounted transactions. Anyone
who knows that the price of an asset that he or she buys is lower
because of the possibility that a new understanding of justice will
prevail has a hard time arguing for compensation once it does prevail.
It should be noted that in this case the attenuation does not apply to
the claims of those who hold land throughout the period of discounting.</blockquote>
<p><a name="Case 7."></a><b>Case 7.</b> This is a variation on case
6, where there are initially substantial taxes on labor and capital.
The proposal that is put forward entails removing from labor and
capital taxes that yield revenue equal to the revenue that can be
raised by collecting the full rental value of land. </p>
<blockquote>For this case, compensation has all the difficulties of
Case 6. But if there is to be a compensation scheme, the magnitude of
any claim for compensation can be reduced by the claimant's expected
savings in future taxes on labor and capital. </blockquote>
<p><b>Having considered these seven idealized cases, one can now
summarize the principles they embody</b>. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Case 1 and 2 both embody the principle that when a mistake in
social rules is corrected, it is reasonable to require people to
relinquish the expectations that the mistaken rules gave them. In one
case this implied that compensation for the loss of sale value of land
titles should be provided, in the other case that it should not be
provided. </li>
  <li>Case 3 embodies the principle that it is sometimes appropriate to
restructure past private transactions on the basis of new
understandings of the requirements of justice. </li>
  <li>Case 4 embodies the principle that the perpetrators of injustice
and their heirs are particularly responsible for providing compensation
when the claims they appropriated are overturned. </li>
  <li>Case 5 embodies three principles:
    <ul>
      <li>first, that there can be circumstances in which the costs of
a new moral understanding must be left where they fall, because there
is no one to whom they can properly be shifted; </li>
      <li>second, that compensation financed by taxation should be
supported by a finding that those who are taxed are, as a class,
particularly responsible for, or have been beneficiaries of, the
discredited understanding; </li>
      <li>third, that if compensation is provided, a person's past
gains from the discredited understanding offset claims for losses from
the new understanding. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Case 6 embodies the principle that public moral debate puts
people on notice that a future political decision might eliminate the
value of their acquisitions without compensation. </li>
  <li>Case 7 embodies the principle that if compensation is provided, a
person's past benefits from the new understanding offset claims for
losses from the new understanding.</li>
</ul>
<p>One can now ask what lessons these principles hold for the
situations in which actual societies are likely to find themselves.
The conquest of Case 4 is highly relevant to the histories of Latin
America, the Philippines, Britain and probably many other countries
as well. It also has relevance to the U.S., in view of the existence
of slavery in the South until all the good land was claimed, the
extensive royal land grants in the original colonies and in the
Southwest, and miscellaneous skullduggery in numerous places (Alfred
N. Chandler, 1945). Thus if social collection of the full rental
value of land comes to the U.S., there should be no compensation for
persons whose holdings of land derive directly, or by inheritance,
from disproportionate land appropriation. Furthermore, any remaining
wealth that can be traced to these activities is a particularly
appropriate source of compensation for "innocent buyers," if such a
scheme is to be implemented.</p>
<p>If there is to be a compensation scheme, claims can be reduced by
the claimants' past income and inheritances from rises in land
values, as suggested by Case 5. It is likely that the recognition
would come slowly rather than suddenly, so that the attenuating
effects of Case 6 would be present. It is likely that social
collection of the rent of land in the U.S. would be a substitute for
other taxes, as in Case 7. Thus claims for compensation could be
reduced by the claimants' expected future savings in other taxes.
</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, any justified compensation scheme would
be relatively small.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> But there would
be so many complications in
administering a justified compensation scheme that it would probably
be more appropriate to let the losses lie where they fell and handle
any cases of true distress by whatever system is used to care for
other persons who are not able to provide for themselves.</span></p>
<p>A more general lesson that may be taken from this exercise in
analyzing compensation is that, while there are advantages to the
durable consensus that comes from regarding a conception of justice
as immutable, it is sometimes attractive to acknowledge the
possibility of improvement, so that tensions that strain a conception
of justice can be dealt with in an evolutionary rather than a
revolutionary manner. When principles appear to conflict, an
examination of the purposes behind the principles can lead to the
identification of restructured principles that resolve the apparent
conflict.</p>
