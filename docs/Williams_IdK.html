You are about to experience a new way of thinking. It concerns a
single, simple economic reform that will improve almost every facet of
our lives.<br>
<br>
It's an idea that's so simple, so timeless and so natural that you will
probably be amazed that it is not already in place. At its very heart
lies the basic fact that none of us, rich or poor, corporation or
individual, indigenous or otherwise has the right to own land.<br>

Land and the rest of the Global Commons belongs to all of us - now and
in the future. Use the Global Commons as we may, but as surely as no
person ever created a mountain range or a river system, the idea that
we can own - in perpetuity - natural resources, however large or small,
is frankly outrageous. Furthermore, we believe that it is also the root
cause of a great deal of social, economic and political injustice.<br>
<br>
This is the basic belief at the heart of our group. It is the glue that
binds us and the platform from which springs an amazing array of
possibilities for a better, fairer future.<br>
<br>
This is not communism, anarchism, tribalism or any other grand vision
which imposes all sorts of ideas about how we should behave or think -
in fact, personal liberty is its very core. Yes, there are many details
of this new economy and its way of caring for our natural environment,
but <span style="font-weight: bold;">everything flows logically and
consistently from a simple fact. That is, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">land and natural resources are
ours only to use and to be passed on to future generations</span>. By
an elegantly simple but profound change in our relationship with the
land itself, we believe we can improve not only the natural
environment, but the social and economic environment as well.</span><br>
<br>
Much of what you'll discover will sound refreshingly new but, in fact,
the details of this have been around for over a hundred years, and the
outline for thousands! Some of the greatest philosophers, social
reformers, philanthropists, scientists and economists in history have
heartily endorsed what you are about to read, from biblical prophets up
until modern giants such as Einstein. Supporters have come from all
cultures, from each side of politics and from every religious
persuasion.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So why hasn't such a strong and simple
idea been adopted around the world? The history of these proposals is
varied and fascinating, but the basic cause boils down to the greed of
a few with vested interests.</span> But now technology, a growing
social conscience and other opportunities mean that this idea has
reemerged for good, and now we shall lay before you some pretty
exciting possibilities.<br>
<br>
But there's a catch. We have to warn you that, once you understand what
we're talking about, the world will appear very different. And you'll
be hard pressed to see much justice in the way we presently do things.
This is an old idea whose time has finally come.<br>

You are about to face the unravelling of what most people consider a
mystery - not because this riddle is itself unfathomable, but because
the general ignorance of the past has turned it into one. The mystery
is our world of plenty and poverty, of billionaires and squatters, of
mansions and slums. What brought about this economic and social maze of
paradoxes?<br>
<br>
How is it that fewer and fewer people and corporations in the developed
world have more and more money and power?<br>
<br>
Why is it that the "prosperous middle class" is shrinking year by year,
despite greater levels of education and women in the workforce?<br>
<br>
In the most basic form we believe that the root of all economic and
social injustice lies in our flawed relationship with the land. This is
hard to grapple with because "land ownership" is a fundamental part of
our "free western" culture. We grow up with the idea that ownership of
land = security.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SOME ANSWERS</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Geonomics"></a>Geonomics</span>
(<span style="font-style: italic;">geo</span>- earth, -<span
 style="font-style: italic;">onomy </span>law) is the alternative. It
represents the most radical and breathtaking examination of human
rights you'll ever come across, backed up with detailed economic
solutions. But isn't something drastic to be expected, for an economic
and social system like our current one that is so flawed surely
requires a radical remedy? If it's busted big time, it surely needs to
be fixed big time.<br>
<br>
Let's approach it from a number of different angles to try and try to
shed light on its many facets. 
<ul>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">philosophical </span>appeal
could be embodied as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Land
and natural resources - the Global Commons - should be the equal and
common birthright of all humanity."</span>  </li>
  <li>From an <span style="font-weight: bold;">economic </span>perspective,
we could characterise our standpoint as a radical reform of the tax
system and our form of land tenure.  </li>
  <li>Coming from a <span style="font-weight: bold;">social justice</span>
angle, we could be seen as striving to abolish all forms of privilege
(including some massive injustices which are presently almost
completely concealed).  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Environmentally</span>, we are
monitoring and conserving a whole range of natural resources, rather
than selling them off forever to the highest cash bidder.  </li>
  <li>From <span style="font-weight: bold;">libertarian </span>eyes,
Geonomics restores a number of basic human liberties which are
particularly violated through our current tax system.</li>
  <li>Putting on our <span style="font-weight: bold;">visionary </span>spectacles,
we see a possible world of almost unimaginable prosperity - not in
merely material terms, but with regard to leisure time, our natural
environment, human relations, and personal &amp; spiritual growth.</li>
</ul>
If we appear to be dreamers, then you should know that the solutions
underlying these grand declarations are expressed in detailed economic
policies rather than vague principles and motherhood statements.
Furthermore, these policies have been put to the test in many parts of
the Western world. While Geonomists are agreed on important issues,
some still disagree on a number of minor aspects - but it will be some
time before we need to get to this level of detail.<br>
<br>
Essentially, the basis of our proposals is the replacement of nearly
all forms of taxation with a system of rentals or taxes on the Global
Commons, in particular on land values.<br>
<br>
<a name="THE_TWO_GREAT_VIOLATIONS"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE
TWO GREAT VIOLATIONS</span><br>
<br>
Let's take a simple starting point. Throughout history, innumerable
philosophers and social reformers have tried to remedy two great forms
of human rights violations:
<ol>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land and natural resources, the
gift of Nature/God/The Universe, have been privately misappropriated by
a small and privileged sector of the populatio</span>n (formerly kings
and warlords, nowadays speculators and corporate powers). So ordinary
"disinherited" citizens have to render service in order to use what
should be theirs by birthright.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nearly all forms of taxation are
violations of human rights. </span>But, you surely protest, if we
don't have taxation then how can governments afford education, public
infrastructure, welfare for the underprivileged etc.? The answer lies
in the solution to no. 1 above. As will be elaborated later, land and
natural resources can be most equitably shared by a system of rentals,
in particular through land value taxation (LVT). Land values are
essentially created by the community, and therefore those occupying
more valuable land should rightly reimburse society proportionally
more. To encapsulate it: "What I owe to the community should be in
accordance with what the community does for me, which is reflected in
the value of the piece of Our One Earth that I exclusively occupy." Or
even simpler: "Pay for what you take, not what you make." By numerous
calculations (and some historical experience), the revenue raised will
be enough to completely replace the robbery that is taxation! For, to
return to our point, we maintain that taxation based on one's own
honest and unprivileged earnings is nothing less than legalised theft.
But because of governments' failure to collect LVT, we have become
conditioned to accept our present form of taxation.</li>
</ol>
From this tax shift, we'll later see how so many far-reaching outcomes
arise. But here it's important to see the economic boost that must
inevitably follow, for we're not just talking about justice, but about
prosperity.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="TAXES_-_A_BIG_TURNOFF"></a>TAXES
- A BIG TURNOFF</span><br>
<br>
Ordinary taxes stifle honest endeavour. If you work, you get "fined"
through income tax. If you want to put other people to work by
purchasing their goods or services, there's another disincentive in the
form of the GST. Company taxes, bank taxes, payroll taxes, import taxes
- they all penalise production and thereby suppress employment.<br>
<br>
But here's a very important point, rarely noticed by professional
economists since the advent of so-called neoclassical economics. A tax
on land values does not suppress activity on land, but does just the
opposite! Land has unique characteristics that work thus: when
landholders are assessed for LVT, they are financially compelled to put
that land to its optimum use. For, whether landowners do put the land
to its optimum use or not, they are still saddled with the same LVT. So
landholders must use it productively or pass it on to those who will
use it so.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="ECONOMIC_INSANITY"></a>ECONOMIC
INSANITY</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Here it's appropriate to introduce
another grand claim - that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unemployment
is simply unnecessary</span>.</span> We hold that the mass of idle
unemployed should complement (and mutually satisfy) all the many needs
for more work - building better housing, looking after pre-schoolers
and the elderly, cleaning up the environment, developing better
infrastructure etc. etc. But why can't they obviously come together?
Unemployment is unnecessary - it's economic insanity! This insanity
only reveals itself in rare situations, such as a national crisis (a
war or natural disaster), when suddenly the whole country can be
"mysteriously" mobilised. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The main
reason we have unemployment is because we have a system of taxation and
land tenure which encourages speculation and discourages the production
of real wealth.</span><br>
<br>
Now, we don't expect that this brief explanation of unemployment is
enough to satisfy anyone. But here we want to make the point that the
detailed solution to the riddle of unemployment will be given after the
general overview that is this Introductory Kit. Recognising the unique
qualities of land and its tax implications turns the economic system
the right way up, providing dynamic incentive rather than suffocation.
This is just a sketch of an important piece of the Geonomic puzzle, but
there's much more - particularly concerning social justice, the
environment, civil liberties, reducing great wastage, the ending of tax
evasion, booms &amp; busts, and even world peace.<br>

Prosper Australia (also known as EarthSharing) and its far-flung sister
organisations are brought together by a social conscience underpinned
by a belief that there really is a practical way to a much more just,
green and prosperous society. Because our proposals are so radical,
far-reaching and thereby so difficult to briefly describe, perhaps it's
no surprise that it goes under so <a name="many_names"></a>many names,
such as:
<ul>
  <li>Geonomics - this is the term mainly used here</li>
  <li>Land Value Taxation</li>
  <li>Georgist Economics or Georgism</li>
  <li>Community Ground Rent</li>
  <li>Site Value Rating &middot; EarthSharing</li>
  <li>Ground Rent Collection</li>
  <li>Land Value Recapture</li>
  <li>Resource Rentals</li>
</ul>
Prosper Australia is the new name for an organisation that is over 100
years old. It is an educational body set up to advance the cause of
Geonomics, in particular through the ideas of Henry George. Presently,
while we are expanding our numbers, we are an educational rather than a
political organisation. There are allied organisations all over the
world, mainly in English-speaking countries.<br>
<br>
<a name="GOOD_GUYS"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">GOOD GUYS</span><br>
<br>
We are philanthropists of a sort, all working for the love of a great
cause except for our office manager who receives a very modest
allowance. We see ourselves striving to bring about a vision of an
immeasurably-improved world seen through our studies of a radical
economic and social system.<br>
<br>
Our main activities at present are the production of a magazine and
other promotional literature, the holding of classes (through the
Melbourne School of Economics), various forms of lobbying, and liaising
with other like-minded organisations (especially, in recent years,
environmental groups).<br>
<br>
Some of us consider ourselves followers of the 19th century American
social philosopher and economist, Henry George, and hence call
ourselves Georgists. Henry George didn't "invent" Geonomics or
Georgism, but he did rediscover it and elaborate its finer details and
full consequences more than anyone else to date. Unbeknown to George,
some of the world's greatest thinkers had already independently
proposed much the same thing - Rousseau, Spinoza, Voltaire, the French
Physiocrats, Paine, Jefferson, Cobden, Carlyle and Mill are just a few.
And since George the long list of endorsements has lengthened, many of
which you'll find as you read the three kits of which this is the first.<br>
<br>
<a name="NO_PIGEON-HOLES_FOR_US"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">NO
PIGEON-HOLES FOR US!</span><br>
<br>
Where do we fit on the left-right political spectrum? We don't! -
Geonomics can well be called the Third Way, something which defies
conventional analysis. It reconciles the justice of socialism along
with the prosperity and personal freedom of capitalism, as well as
adding its own unique contributions. When Georgists have entered
politics it has been on both sides, usually as mavericks.<br>
<br>
We are organised in fairly conventional ways, with chairpersons,
committees, voting systems, constitutions etc. We are not at all
secretive, but rather welcome attendance and involvement from inquirers
and new members. Studies have led many of us to believe that nations
can only be as democratic as their voting system allows, and that
proportional representation, preferential voting and multi-member
electorates are essential ingredients for a true democracy.<br>
<br>
We are most fortunate to have been funded by generous bequests, which
have provided premises and resources for our activities. No-one is
asked or pressured to donate money - in fact, our annual membership fee
is only $30, including subscription to our magazine Progress.<br>
<br>
Some of us are religious, some not. We hold no doctrines or dogmas,
save a general belief that the economic rent from land and natural
resources belongs to all society.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
land, the earth, God gave to man for his home, sustenance and support,
should never be the possession of any man, corporation, society or

</div>
<br>
An intriguing question still remains unanswered: "How can such an
intrinsically-natural economic and social system remain virtually
unknown to the world?" By being acquainted with some extraordinary and
little-known episodes in history, things might become much clearer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="TRULY_TIMELESS"></a>TRULY

<br>
Geonomics is nothing new - indeed, can anything so fundamental as
sharing land and natural resources be novel? Biblical prophets made
pronouncements such as "The profit of the earth is for all" (Eccles.
5:9) as well as "The land shall not be sold forever; for the land is
Mine" (Leviticus 25:23) - hence the biblical "Jubilee Year".<br>
<br>
In Western Europe, there was no concept of unemployment or vagrancy
until the 14th century. Then began the notorious enclosures of the
commons when royal favours and fund-raising brought about the fencing
off of common land, the prior use of which had been every free man's
right.<br>
<br>
But even feudalism can be seen as a rough form of land value taxation
(LVT). When a king or feudal lord took a proportion of each person's
agricultural yield as a tax, there was an approximate degree of justice
in that those with larger or more fertile lands would probably pay more
tax. Of course, the tax taken by the ruler was often ripped off to
enrich himself rather than being given back to the community as
infrastructure or military protection.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="THE_BIRTH_OF_ECONOMICS"></a>THE
BIRTH OF ECONOMICS</span><br>
<br>
But economics as a formal discipline or social science really only came
about with Adam Smith (1723 - 1790) and his landmark "<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Wealth of Nations</span>."
He and most economists over the next hundred years (including Henry
George) were later termed classical economists, in contrast to the
succeeding school of so-called neoclassical economists in the late 19th
century.<br>
<br>
From the advent of neoclassical economics, great theoretical divisions
begin to appear, as we'll outline. A useful, more complete account to
be found in "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The
Corruption of Economics</span>" by Prof. Mason Gaffney and Fred
Harrison.<br>
<br>
In the 1880's and 1890's Henry George had captivated much of the
English-speaking world with his "<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress
and Poverty</a>", still the highest-selling popular economics book of
all time. He championed the efficiency of LVT (Land Value Taxation) so
well and identified the underlying cause of social injustice so
successfully that he had to be stopped. Neo-classical economics was the
result, bankrolled by vested interests.<br>
<br>
<a name="WHATS_MISSING_YOURE_STANDING_ON_IT"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT'S MISSING? YOU'RE STANDING ON IT!</span><br>
<br>
Basically, neo-classical economics leaves out land and natural
resources from any proper philosophical discussion. In economic
equations land is bundled in with capital, ignoring the different
nature and economic behaviour of land, and setting the scene for the
impossibly complex and warped "economic paradigm" with which we are
burdened today.<br>
<br>
Our birthright has been sold or given to those who got in before us,
with economic ramifications that are not obvious (so thorough has been
the indoctrination of neoclassical economics). Yet those who study it
today often shake their heads in despair, as the assumptions made to
get its models to work often assume away any connection with reality.
One could equally well come up with an aerodynamic equation for flying
pigs &#8230;&#8230; assuming, of course, 'sufficient thrust'!<br>
<br>
Who were the perpetrators? In the U.S.A., homeland of George, they were
principally the railroad barons, bankers and plutocrats. In the late
1800s, universities there were mainly funded by wealthy benefactors
including many with a lot to lose from Georgist reforms. The academic
system was coerced by its paymasters, who protested against the
"revolutionary" ideas of George and withdrew funding from a number of
academics who kept Georgist economics on their curricula. The others
soon got the message.<br>
<br>
In Britain, which three times had a majority of Georgist sympathisers
in the democratically-elected House of Commons in the early 20th
century, the opposition was the "nobility" - the Lords, Dukes, Earls
and Barons who comprised the landed class. Controlling the House of
Lords, they fought tooth and nail to prevent structural reform. This
point marks the introduction of a degree of socialism, when the
populace was placated by palliative social welfare. Then along came
World War I and the Georgist movement, having lost its momentum, began
its slide from public view.<br>
<br>
Many other factors contributed to the fall of Georgist popularity (and
therefore the ascendancy of today's neoclassical economics). Those who
support the politics and wealth of The Vatican will not be pleased to
be reminded that in 1891 Pope Leo XIII issued a papal encyclical, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Rerum Novarum</span>, which was a
thinly-disguised attack on Georgist economics.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT'S MISSING? YOU'RE STANDING ON IT!</span><br>
<br>
Geonomics has actually been partially implemented in a few places such
as Taiwan and parts of Pennsylvania. Most fully and notably, Denmark in
the late 1950s and early 1960s achieved the outstanding results that
had been forecast. There - among a host of other positive economic
indicators - sizeable unemployment was replaced by almost full
employment, a big deficit was turned into a surplus, inflation was
reduced to barely 1% while real increases in wages rose to record
levels. After a massive misinformation publicity campaign eventually
led to the repeal of LVT legislation, Denmark's remarkable new
prosperity disappeared as quickly as it arose.<br>
<br>
This illustrates the political handicap of Geonomics - it is so foreign
and thus so hard to understand that it is easily misrepresented. It is
condemned by the right for being communist and by the left for being
capitalist, whereas it resembles neither. The huge Danish propaganda
campaign mentioned above had posters showing a happy family standing
outside their house while the monstrous black glove of Geonomics was
descending from above, poised to steal their family home!<br>
<br>
Australia has the remnants of Geonomic policies in the form of
miniscule, misapplied and misunderstood state land taxes and local
rates. Canberra, during the Geonomic heyday, was actually set up as a
Geonomic enclave (Walter Burley Griffin was a Georgist) to prevent land
speculators from cashing in on either Melbourne or Sydney being chosen
as the nation's capital. There have been Georgists in both the ALP and
Liberal Party, but today it is the Australian Democrats and The Greens
who best understand and support LVT.<br>

</div>
<br>
In broadening one's understanding of Geonomics, the newcomer repeatedly
encounters the name of Henry George. Since George did not discover
Geonomics (but rather rediscovered it quite independently), why is his
name so prominent?<br>
<br>
Firstly, George's writings enlarged Geonomics - its details and full
consequences - far more than any single person before or since.
Secondly, his persuasiveness and sheer character popularised these
reforms enormously, building up a sweeping tide of millions in the late
1800s. Thirdly, George's concepts were clearly a living, integral part
of his being, and his writings are better understood with the
understanding of his peculiar personal surroundings.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A REMARKABLE LIFE</span><br>
<br>
But there's one more reason - George's remarkable life. The singular
uniqueness of George's life and training, bizarre as compared to the
biographies of other thinkers, must be grasped by anyone interested in
his ideas. It is certainly unusual for a noted philosopher to have been
a sailor and a printer, a journalist, tramp, worldwide lecturer and
political candidate.<br>
<br>
In the goldfields of California and British Columbia, George had the
unique opportunity of studying the formation of a civilization - the
change of an encampment into a thriving metropolis. He saw towns of
tents and mud change into fine cities of paved streets and decent
housing, with tramways and buses. And as he saw the appearance of
wealth, he noted the first appearance of real poverty. He saw human
degradation forming as an integral part of the rise of leisure and
prosperity, and he felt compelled to discover the cause of this awful
paradox.<br>
<br>
Born in Philadelphia in 1839, George broke away from his restrictive
family at the earliest opportunity, sailing the world at the age of 16.
His restless and ever-inquisitive nature took him to the west coast
where, after a spell in the goldfields of Canada, he based himself in
San Francisco. From a type-setter he became a newspaper editor, and was
soon churning out fierce condemnations of the social problems of his
day. In particular he became a strong critic of mining interests,
political corruption and land speculation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE PROSPERITY PARADOX</span><br>
<br>
But it was a visit to New York which really galvanised his reformist
resolve, where he was shocked by the co-existence of wealth and
poverty. The result was the book <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>
in 1879, which is the all-time bestseller on economics and, in its day,
was the most widely-read English book in the world after the bible. In
a nutshell, his fundamental remedy for poverty was a tax/rental levied
on the value of land exclusive of improvements, and the simultaneous
abolition of all taxes which fall upon industry and thrift.<br>
<br>
Despite his growing public profile and his reputation as a magnetic
public speaker, George never had (or cared for) personal wealth. In
fact, his early years of dire poverty - to the point of starvation for
himself and his young family - were major character-builders. Even
during the height of his much-acclaimed world lecture tours, he never
forgot his roots and what he saw as his calling. A passage from a poem
by Louis Untermeyer has been said to well reflect George's sentiments:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open my ears to music; let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me thrill with Spring's first flutes and drums -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But never let me dare forget<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bitter ballads of the slums.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open my eyes to visions girt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With beauty, and with wonder lit -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me always see the dirt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all that spawn and die in it. <br>
<br>
George ran for mayor of New York in 1886 and was nearly elected. He
died in 1897 at the height of his second campaign for mayor of New
York. During his lifetime, he became the third most famous man in the
United States, only surpassed in public acclaim by Thomas Edison and
Mark Twain (himself an outspoken supporter of Georgist economics). Leo
Tolstoy's appreciation stressed the logic of George's exposition: "The
chief weapon against the teaching of Henry George was that which is
always used against irrefutable and self-evident truths. This method,
which is still being applied in relation to George, was that of hushing
up."<br>
<br>
His ideas stand: he who makes should have; he who saves should enjoy;
what the community produces belongs to the community for communal uses;
and God's earth, all of it, is the right of the people who inhabit the
earth.<br>

How do you react to this scenario? You are star-trekking through space
and come upon a planet with many promising conditions which might
support life. And there is life down there - intelligent life at that!
And the planetary inhabitants possess a physical form not unlike
humans, and are grouped into organised communities.<br>
<br>
But then you discover something curious. A small minority of these ET's
claim that the very surface of the planets is theirs, and either charge
the other helpless inhabitants rent for its use or extortionate prices
for the outright purchase of certain parts.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHOSE PLANET?</span><br>
<br>
What a planet, eh?! Here we are with an arrangement somehow foisted on
us whereby land, which should be our equal and common inheritance, has
been privately misappropriated. Or put it this way: we're born on to a
planet where "all the seats are taken", and we have to pay someone else
for permission to live! There's no way of escaping it for, as long as
the Law of Gravity holds, we need something to stand on. And to
compound the land problem - they're not making any more of it !<br>
<br>
And this most important part of the Global Commons, land, usually
"belongs" to somebody in perpetuity, so that they can pass on this
"commodity" of theirs to their descendants ad infinitum, no matter how
much this all-too-scarce resource might appreciate in value over time.
And how did they come to own the Earth in the first place?<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BLOODY BLOODLINES</span><br>
<br>
There's an amusing story of a Georgist who challenged a land baron as
to the baron's right to his vast tracts. The baron knew the history of
the estate of his noble bloodlines, and told how one of his ancestors
had paid good money for the land, rather than gaining it by some royal
grant. To this the Georgist replied, "But how did the previous owner
obtain it?" Again the baron explained how that person had also once
paid good money for it. Yet again and again, the Georgist persisted
with, "But how did that owner obtain it?" Finally, the baron said, "He
fought for it in battle, and won it". To which the Georgist said,
"Good! I'll fight you for it!"<br>
<br>
To those interested readers we can make available copies of the moving
speech attributed to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chief Seattle</span>,
which explains his bewilderment at 19th century American laws of land
ownership. Chief Seattle compares land ownership to the ownership of
air and water, and even to the possession of the songs of birds. This
short speech perhaps conveys the Georgist philosophy better than
lengthy volumes.<br>
<br>
And here we have a fitting end point. The year is 2050, and Kerry
Packer III has again increased every Australian's monthly air levies.
Some whingeing malcontents start to question our Airlord's right to
privately own what was once considered to be the natural birthright of
every person, but they are soon convinced that Kerry's grandfather
worked extremely hard for the billions with which he bought the
Southern Pacific Air License in 2020. In return for his contractual
obligations to maintain a specified level of air cleanliness, Kerry won
the "right" to extract an annual usage fee from every air-breathing
human residing in his territory.<br>

PRACTICALITIES</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
single tax is so simple, so fundamental, and so easy to carry into
effect that I have no doubt that it will be about the last land reform

prominent US lawyer<br>
</div>
<br>
It's fine to know of lofty philosophical considerations, and comforting
to know that both social justice and prosperity can be thereby
reconciled, but what of ordinary everyday practicalities?<br>
<br>
Firstly, in a Geonomic society, the experience of real liberty would
pervade everything. For citizens would not be beholden to the
government to supply it all sorts of financial and personal information
demanded by the tax system. Instead of having to abide by a multitude
of tax requirements, the land you occupy would simply be assessed by
professional assessors. This would only occur once a year, and the
assessors would not even need to step onto your property because it
would only be your land and not the improvements that would be assessed.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BEGONE!</span><br>
<br>
Gone are the armies of tax accountants, tax lawyers and tax department
bureaucrats. Gone are the inefficiencies of speculation, the black
economy and its attendant criminal elements. Gone is the pool of
unemployed and the cost of supporting it (much more on this later).
Gone are many of the social problems arising from unemployment,
poverty, despair arising from hopelessness, and resentment resulting
from great inequities of wealth. And because of LVT and other eco-taxes
apply to all of the Global Commons, we'll live on a much healthier
planet - and so will our children.<br>
<br>
Instead, in steps an inconceivable prosperity resulting from a dynamic
economy that encourages productivity, discourages speculation, is not
hampered by high welfare needs, abolishes privilege, and doesn't
undersell our natural environment. It is estimated that a typical
household will have a true disposable income (after all taxes) often
double that of the current system, and that the average business will
earn trading profits after tax/rent considerably greater (refer to the
section "<a href="#WHATS_IN_IT_FOR_ME">What's in it for me?</a>").<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TOWARDS MATERIALISM?</span><br>
<br>
Will this lead to a Singaporean-style society hell-bent on the
accumulation of material wealth? It should be said that there will
undoubtedly be some who will strive for affluence, and if they wish to
live in big houses, drive big cars and have huge bank accounts then
good luck to 'em! Remember, in this free and fair society, anyone this
wealthy has become so by their own efforts and not by exploiting others
nor the Global Commons.<br>
<br>
But might our whole mentality be unimaginably different in this new
world? No longer threatened by the dead hand of joblessness and the
miserably low wages inflicted on workers "lucky enough" to have a job,
a new sense of security might well infuse all. And the energetic
productivity of Geonomics would enable all, if they wish, to work far
fewer hours to provide their basic needs. What is difficult to imagine
is the use to which this sudden availability of leisure time will be
put - the arts, travel, exercise, personal &amp; spiritual growth, or
maybe just lying around in bed eating junk food?<br>
<br>
Things will be a lot different outside the suburbs, too. Gone is the
opportunity to loot natural resources, and perhaps the predatory
attitude towards nature that went with it. With LVT encouraging land to
be put to its best possible use, no longer will cities sprawl over what
should be farmland. Similarly, barely-productive farmland won't sprawl
over what should remain as forest, national park or wilderness. We deal
more fully with environmental benefits in the second kit.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT JUST TINKERING</span><br>
<br>
Businesses will truly be unchained by real tax reform. No longer will
they have to keep endless financial records to satisfy tax
requirements, nor will they be burdened by the huge compliance costs of
frequent tax returns. You, the shopper, will see the savings passed on
- and, of course, there will be no GST.<br>
<br>
With economic policies no longer being so contentious, politics would
take on a different dimension. The political issues of the day would
rightly return to the great social questions dealing with education,
global and personal peace, cultural enrichment, human rights, national
goals etc.<br>
<br>
LVT and other eco-taxes (perhaps supplemented by a few remaining taxes
on damaging social undesirables such as on tobacco and alcohol) will,
by many calculations, be more than enough to replace current taxes.
This is only one half of the equation - the revenue side - so how
should a government spend this revenue? Geonomics doesn't deal with the
spending issues, as priorities understandably vary greatly from culture
to culture. Each society must decide for itself whether it wants to
give spending priorities to education, defence (?!), social welfare,
environmental repair, mosques, infrastructure etc. Or perhaps it might
decide not to spend everything, and instead to distribute much of it as
a Citizens' Dividend.<br>

<br>
Under the current system, public expenditure enriches private
landowners courtesy of unwitting taxpayers. For example, if a
government invests $millions in a new railway line, the value of land
near the railway line is enormously enhanced. Because the value of this
public investment has effectively disappeared into the "Black Hole" of
private land values, prohibitive rail fares must be charged. But
imagine this: what if we collected some of the boosted land values
through Land Value Taxation (LVT) - couldn't we could lower the fares?
And if we lowered the fares, this would enhance the land values now
that the accessible train service is cheaper to use. Enhanced land
values means more LVT to collect which could lead to lower fares and so
on and so on.<br>
<br>
While these iterations wouldn't need to be done in practice, the above
scenario illustrates how enhanced land values (created by the
community) are recaptured or recycled back to the community. Whether we
build a bridge, a park, a bike track, a community centre or
rehabilitate creekside vegetation - all these sort of life-enhancing
investments also enhance land values, which can be fully recouped for
further projects. This is just one aspect of Geonomics and one more
piece of the unemployment puzzle, but let's now take a peek at how this
tax shift can improve our neighbourhood and lifestyle.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">? IMAGINE ?</span><br>
<br>
When you look out of your window in the morning you see your
immaculately maintained local botanical garden, a feature now of every
neighborhood. Houses and gardens are noticeably more attractive, now
that local ratings aren't based on a property's improvements. All can
afford to beautify their homes and gardens, as unemployment and job
insecurity is a thing of the past.<br>
<br>
In this much more productive society, working hours have been
drastically reduced. And today's another free day so, after breakfast,
you stroll to your local cultural centre. En route, you bless the fact
that LVT penalises underused land and has thereby brought about a much
more compact cityscape, which is much more amenable to public
transport, cyclists and pedestrians.<br>
<br>
The sense of real community is palpable, a downline benefit of the
recovery of public expenditure. With the retention and "recycling" of
publicly-created land values by the community, there are now endless
opportunities to invest in community infrastructure and amenities. This
has resulted in the buzzing local piazza through which you stroll, the
Mediterranean-style public square and marketplace so popular in some
Australian neighbourhoods of late. Who needs drugs and mindless poker
machines to while away the hours? Your community piazza is full of
activity, and resident artists are now putting the final decorative
touches to the wildly-decorated lookout towers and giant slides which
have been commissioned by your local council. It's a great meeting
point, always having a festive atmosphere, and a place where old people
like to sit and chat. Affordable community-building infrastructure like
this has ended much social alienation and despair of youth, and
graffiti and vandalism is conspicuous by its absence.<br>
<br>
Add to all of this an unimaginable level of prosperity, as the dynamic
economy has removed so many of the barriers and disincentives to
productive endeavor, and we are a part of a much saner society. But
will this lead to a headlong rush for the shopping malls, as people can
afford to indulge their materialism? Well, Geonomics isn't a panacea
but maybe even here it can help out. With greater security against
unemployment and against the larger "boom-bust" economic cycles,
perhaps people wouldn't feel the need to be so acquisitive. And the
competitiveness and status-seeking of modern "culture" could
conceivably wither within The Good Society.<br>
<br>
Back at the piazza, you spot an old friend sitting in the shade under a
gazebo by one of the many fountain complexes. He's a visitor from an
old style land-monopoly capitalist nation, and is amazed by what he's
seeing in ordinary suburban Australia. He does have one doubt, however
- how can anybody afford to purchase land in such highly desirable
locations?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT FOR SALE!</span><br>
<br>
You smile to yourself before you begin to explain, "Haven't you got it?
Land price is capitalised land rent which has been misappropriated into
private hands! Or put it this way: as the collection of LVT is phased
in, land prices will fall with the rising obligation on a land occupier
to pay one's LVT to society.<br>
<br>
"So, at the point where we've phased in the full collection of LVT, the
effective purchase price of land would have fallen to around zero!!!
Here in Oz, we pay LVT but no punitive taxes, and no-one will ever have
to save to buy land again. So your concerns about the affordability of
purchasing land here is no longer a worry to us here. Land costs
nothing to buy!"<br>
<br>
The thought of land being "free" here was a bit beyond the visitor,
surrounded as he was by the sounds coming from an enormous adventure
playground complex, the community music auditorium, the traffic from
the network of dedicated bicycle paths, and the crowd assembled to
watch the daily performances of local theatre groups in the piazza.<br>

Geonomics represents far more than justice and a noble philosophy.
We've been introduced to a number of major economic benefits, such as a
tax system which gives incentive for production rather than
speculation, and which is also not hampered by huge amounts of needless
waste. Believe it or not, we've only introduced a fraction of the
benefits of Geonomics!<br>
<br>
But right now we should drive home the point that, in plain financial
terms, almost everybody will be greatly better off in a Geonomic world.
Our sister organisations around the world have been gathering data to
support such claims, and here in Melbourne our own Land Values Research
Group has, for decades, been responsible for many first class
statistical studies. We're talking about rigorous, quantitative data
which we are happy to share with anyone. Some of these studies form the
basis for what you're about to read. You've every right to know how
much you'll benefit in dollar terms, so here's a glimpse!<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A LOAD OFF OUR BACKS</span><br>
<br>
We currently pay income and indirect taxes and compliance costs ranging
from 40% of income for the poorest twenty percent of the population up
to 60% for the wealthiest twenty percent. Within a Geonomic community,
such a huge burden would be lifted from us. Instead, we would pay the
Land Value Taxation (LVT) and other eco-taxes, which are really fair
charges for one's exclusive use of the Global Commons.<br>
<br>
Even without accounting for many of the dynamic downline effects on our
economy, our calculations show that our disposable income after
eco-taxes is still far ahead of what we are left with today. What are
these eco-taxes, and how have we calculated them?<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NATURE'S "GIFTS" SHOULDN'T BE "FREE"!</span><br>
<br>
We all need to be responsible (and financially accountable) for the
consequences of our purchasing decisions. If the goods and services we
buy have been produced by drawing on more of the Global Commons than
others, then we'll be paying more eco-taxes. Some obvious examples of
the activities whose costs we, the consumers, would have to bear are:
<ul>
  <li>polluting industries (which draw on clean air and water) &middot;
the extraction of minerals (using up finite resources)</li>
  <li>the cutting of non-plantation timber (effecting our biodiversity
and weather)</li>
  <li>fishing (drawing on our oceans' resources).</li>
  <li>The amount of eco-taxes that will be paid by us is difficult to
estimate because our consumption patterns will necessarily greatly
change - and so they should! For example, if Australia's conventional,
non-sustainable agricultural practices currently consume 7 kg. of
topsoil to produce 1 kg. of wheat (as has been estimated), then the
eventual consumer should pay for the full consequences of the damage
their purchases effectively cause. If non-organic wheat will be much
more expensive, then Australian-grown cotton and wet rice will be
prohibitively expensive. With punitive eco-taxes imposed on
agricultural practices which require vast quantities of precious water
(not to mention pollution of our streams), many such crops would be
rendered unaffordable. This is the straightforward, non-legislative
means of bringing about economic and environmental sanity, for it's
clear that crops like cotton and wet rice should not be grown in this
country.</li>
</ul>
So, at this stage, the eco-taxes noted in the tables below are but
estimates that are being continually refined as the dynamic green boost
that Geonomics brings about are more accurately calculated.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">AND PROSPERITY, TOO!</span><br>
<br>
But, in contrast to the short-term thinking which gives rise to
expectations that we can't "afford" a sustainable economy, the
eco-taxes introduced would still be far less than the taxes on
production that are eliminated. In other words, almost everyone would
be better off as sales taxes, company taxes, compliance costs, import
duties and other imposts will disappear.<br>
<br>
But we mustn't forget that LVT is a unique type of eco-tax, not just
because it ensures our precious land is not wasted but also because it
will raise enormous revenues - enough to replace the robbery of
taxation on honest work!<br>
<br>
Some points should be made concerning the tables:
<ul>
  <li>Part of the stunning difference in true disposable income is due
to the near-elimination of compliance costs! Whether it's the cost of
record-keeping, Business Activity Statements, the black economy and all
its attendant inefficiencies, or the army of tax department officials
&amp; accountants &amp; tax lawyers - consumers effectively have to pay
enormous compliance costs under the present system.</li>
  <li>The first site rent cheque for site occupiers will be due at the
end of the first month. Our research suggests that it will cost you
around one twelfth of 7% of your present site value monthly. For the
average household occupying a $150,000 house located on a block of land
with a value of around $100,000, the monthly site rent would amount to
around $600.</li>
  <li>Based on estimates of consumption patterns of typical adults and
children, annual eco-taxes other than LVT would be - in broad terms -
$2700 and $1800 respectively. Presently, such eco-taxes (many of them
buried in other charges and sales taxes) are around $1200 and $800.</li>
</ul>

We gave you big expectations at the start, so how does it now square
up? But we're promising a lot more in a wide sweep of various
interests, such as human rights, economics, philosophy and
environmental benefits.<br>
<br>
But we won't have to hold your hand the whole way. With the keys given
here, you can make your own observations and discover how the economic
world really goes around. So perhaps our role is more about assisting
than teaching you. In any case, we are very willing to provide you with
more material in the graduated fashion we suggest. Here, then, are some
of our offerings:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Importantly, when you contact our office (details
below) you can order your free <a href="Williams_ImK.html">Intermediate Kit</a>, which builds on this
kit and is in a similar format. It covers:<br>
