<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bathroom
Policy</span><br>
by Hanno Beck</div>
<br>
We were four college sophomores. And we were not going to live in a
dorm, no sir, we figured that we were smart, mature fellows and so we
arranged to rent a house. Each person would have his own private
bedroom and we would share the bathroom. Four guys, one bathroom. That
sounds reasonable, right?<br>
<br>
But let me tell you about Edward. Nobody wanted to use the bathroom
after Edward, because something would be finished, gone, used up. No
toilet paper? No soap? Edward somehow seemed always to be the last
person to use these things. It reduced the value of the bathroom for
the rest of us, yet we got no compensation. Edward was a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">taker</span>. That felt unfair.<br>
<br>
How about Charlie? Well, he had a problem too &#8212;  shaving. It was always
a disappointment to see Charlie walk into the bathroom, because by the
time he was done, you would find shaving cream on the mirror, on the
sink, on the floor. Lots of shaving cream all over the place. And if it
doesn't get cleaned up, it looks bad and becomes unsanitary. The rest
of us picked up after Charlie, but we got no compensation for doing so.
Charlie was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">polluter</span>. That
felt unfair.<br>
<br>
Andrew was a nice fellow. He was thrifty and neat. But there was a
difficulty. Once inside the bathroom, he wouldn't come out! The rest of
us would be waiting around to use the bathroom, pleading, urging,
begging. It did no good. Andrew took long stretches of time in the
bathroom. That restricted access for the rest of us, and yet we got no
compensation. Andrew was a <span style="font-weight: bold;">monopolizer</span>.
That felt unfair.<br>
<br>
The fourth person? That was me. I had no bad habits, and treated the
bathroom perfectly and with fairness to everyone. Or at least you'll
have to believe that, because I am not going to give you the current
address of Edward, Charlie or Andrew.<br>
<br>
The four of us felt unhappy and dissatisfied that year. We had a
"bathroom policy" problem and we did not find a way to solve it.<br>
<br>
Now let's talk about you and everyone on Earth. We don't have to share
a single bathroom. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But we do
all share one planet.</span><br>
<br>
Our planet's natural resources are a common heritage for all humanity,
just as the bathroom was a common resource for the four of us in
college.<br>
<br>
Look what happens to our planet.
<ul>
  <li>We see people or corporations like Edward, taking more than their
fair share of oil, fresh water, minerals, without compensating the rest
of us.</li>
  <li>We see people or corporations like Charlie, polluting the land,
water and air with toxic wastes, chemicals, carbon in the atmosphere,
making the world less safe, forcing others to clean up, and they are
not compensating the rest of us.</li>
  <li>We see people or corporations like Andrew, monopolizing resources
such as land &#8211; an urban land speculator who holds an acre out of use,
anticipating a price rise, is displacing the rest of us, forcing
development out into the countryside. A single acre of downtown land
brought into use would save a dozen outside acres from premature sprawl
development.</li>
</ul>
Those who take, monopolize, and pollute, are imposing costs on the rest
of us and on the economy in general. We are forced to be less
efficient, or forced to endure hardships, so that the takers,
monopolizers and polluters can benefit. That is not fair.<br>
<br>
Is there a solution? Of course there is. It's a simple solution. To
respect our common interest in our planet's resources, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">those who <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">take</span> or <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">monopolize </span>or <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">pollute</span> more than their
fair share of our planet should compensate those of us who they are
taking from.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
You will find this idea, and others like it, in the economic program of
the Green Party of Ontario Canada and many other Green parties around
the world.<br>
<br>
If you've ever experienced a crisis similar to mine at college, you
know how important it can be to have a good bathroom policy. Or a good
planet policy.<br>
