<p>NYT 5/8/1909</p>
<p>An international movement to raise a large fund to revive the agitation for
  the Henry George system of a single tax on land values has been started in
  England and the United States simultaneously by Joseph Fels of Philadelphia,
  who is now in London at work on the plan. Single taxers in this city and throughout
  the country received the printed plan of the movement in the mails last week.</p>
<p>To organize the work and continue and broaden the agitation, Mr. Fels, who
  is a wealthy manufacturer, has pledged to a commission organized in this country
  $25,000 annual for five years. He has duplicated this pledge in England in
  support of the English movement for the taxation of land values there. His
  only condition here, as there, is that as much more be raised. He has agreed
  to match every dollar raised in England or the United States.</p>
<p>The movement to co-operate with the Fels fund plan is in charge of a newly
  organized body, known as the Joseph Fels Fund of America, of which Mayor Tom
  L. Johnson of Cleveland is Treasurer. The Advisory Committee for this year
  is composed of William Lloyd Garrison of Massachusetts, son of the abolitionist;
  George Foster Peabody of this city, Bolton Hall, Bishop Charles D. Williams,
  ex-Senator James W. Bucklin of Colorado, Judge E. C. Brown of Chicago, Louis
  F. Post of Chicago, Dr. Mary D. Hussey, H. F. Ring of Texas, F. C. Leubuscher
  of New York City, Joseph Dana Miller, Henry George, Jr., Fenton Lawson, and
  Mrs. Jennie L. Munroe of Washington, D. C. On the Executive Committee are Daniel
  Kiefer of Cincinnati, Chairman; Lincoln Steffens of Boston, Jackson Ralston
  of Maryland, Frederick C. Howe of Cleveland, and George A. Briggs of Elkhart,
  Ind. The fund committee has begun work in this city and elsewhere, and has
  sent circulars to those who have been interested in the single tax or Henry
  George theories, asking for contributions.</p>
<p>The Fels Commission, in outlining the work for the year, says it believes
  that the agitation for the single tax has got out of the experimental stage.
  The committee points out that Oregon, which now enjoys the initiative and referendum,
  came within a few thousand votes at the last election of a complete victory
  for land-value taxation, and that there is a fine field in that State for continuing
  the campaign under the auspices of the Fels fund. In Rhode Island also, where
  the single taxers elected a single tax Governor a few years ago in the face
  of a bitter fight against him by Senator Aldrich and the high-tariff Republicans
  of the State, the field is said to be equally inviting. The committee says
  that as 75 per cent of the population of Rhode Island lives within a radius
  of ten miles of the State House, an educational campaign can be promoted which
  will involve comparatively little expense. There is no constitutional bar in
  Rhode Island to the single tax should it obtain a majority vote in the Legislature,
  and personal property is already exempt from taxation. Ex-Gov. Garvin , who
  was twice elected Governor of the State, will be in charge of the campaign
  in his state.</p>
<p>The committee will also agitate the subject in Oklahoma and Missouri, where
  a great deal of interest is said to have been manifested. <strong>One of the most significant
  developments in the matter of land reform, it is stated, is the attitude assumed
  by ex-President Roosevelt in the matter of the conservation of natural resources.
  Mr. Roosevelt while in office established the principle that no grant of land
  would be made to any railroad or corporation, and that a system of leaseholds
  would be followed by him. He vetoed a bill giving such a grant to a Western
  road, and in his veto declared for the leasehold system.</strong></p>
<p>This system has also been accepted as the policy of the Taft Administration
  both in this country and in the Philippines, and Gov. Hughes in this State
  has repeatedly declared himself in favor of the conservation of &quot;natural
  opportunities.&quot; There are in fact some who declare that Gov. Hughes is
  a pretty good single taxer, having obtained some light on the subject from
  the late Thomas G. Shearman, years ago. <strong>Mr. Roosevelt is said to have
  obtained what knowledge he has on the subject from &quot;Bucky&quot; O'Neill, the Rough
  Rider, who fought with Roosevelt in this campaign before Santiago in the Spanish-American
  war. &quot;Bucky&quot; O'Neill had been a single taxer for many years.</strong></p>
<p>The plan of the Fels committee is eventually to call a National conference
  of single taxers and after that an international conference. The reports received
  by the committee from abroad are that the plan is meeting with success in England
  and Scotland. The present British Government is already committed, in the budget
  recently introduced, to land value taxation, which it is believed will result
  in breaking up many of the great landed estates in Great Britain and getting
  the workers &quot;back to the land&quot; and away from the cities, where the
  question of the unemployed is a growing menace to the country.</p>

  NYT September 19, 1898</p>
<p>The late Capt. O'Neil, of Troop A, First United States Volunteer Cavalry,
  was one of the most striking among the many odd characters from all walks of
  life which went to make up the famous regiment of Rough Riders. A plainsman,
  a legislator, a notorious gambler, an able economist, and a man devoid of fear,
  he earned a distinction in the combination of traits which it may be said none
  of his comrades reached. The account of his death was related the other day
  by a member of his troop, who passed through Long Island City on his way South
  after being mustered out.</p>
<p>This was William Pulsing, a German-American business man of New Orleans, who
  was accepted into the regiment largely on account of his regular army experience.
  Mr. Pulsing was found at the Red Cross Hospital at Long Island City, where
  he was staying over night, though little the worse for his campaign experiences. &quot;Bucky
  O'Neill,&quot; said he, &quot;won his nickname from the fact that he was always
  given to 'bucking' every gambling game in sight. He was noted through a large
  part of the West for his gambling propensities.</p>
<p>&quot;Troop A, of which he was Captain, was not engaged at El Caney, but took
  part in the general advance on Santiago. He lost his life at the battle of
  San Juan Hill. The troop was deployed along the creeek, and the fire was hot.
  I asked Capt. O'Neill if he would allow me to go ahead and reconoitre, and
  on receiving permission I started out and ran into a road, a short distance
  ahead, which had been sunk by the use of troops and wagons, about a foot below
  the surrounding soil. I reported to Capt. O'Neill that this would be a good
  place for the troop to find temporary shelter, and we all went forward. The
  members of the troop lay down in this road.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mauser bullets were whizzing rapidly over us, but Capt. O'Neill,
  who was always accustomed to explose himself recklessly to fire, stood upright,
  apparently unconscious of danger. He was talking to an Adjutant General, though
  who the General was I don't know. Suddenly a Mauser bullet struck him squarely
  in the mouth, going in so evenly that his teeth weren't injured. He fell to
  the ground at once, and I and a man named Boyle, who was afterward killed in
  battle, picked him up and carried his body to the rear. He died there in a
  few seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;Capt. O'Neill was noted for his writings on political economy besides
  his gambling tendencies. He was the Mayor of Phoenix, Ariz., when he enlisted,
  and was the first man to introduce the theories of Henry George into that
  town. He never preached single tax in the regiment, however.&quot; </p>
<p>[other sources say he was the mayor of Prescott, Arizona.]</p>
