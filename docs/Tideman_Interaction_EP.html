<center><b>The Interaction of Moral and Economic Approaches to
Ecological Protection</b>
</center>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<blockquote>[Abstract of a paper given at a conference on morality and
ecology, <br>
Kaliningrad, Russia, Fall 1997]<br>

</div>
<p>When human actions cause ecological consequences that harm humans
or other species, the propriety of those actions is a moral question.
But when, either because of limited resources or because of
conflicting purposes, people cannot do all that they wish to protect
the environment, then environmental protection is a matter of
economics as well as morality.</p>
<p>Harm to humans differs from harm to other species, for three
reasons. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, we recognize greater obligations to humans than to other
species. We recognize obligations to each human individual, while our
obligations to other species tend to be seen as obligations to the
species as a whole. </li>
  <li>Second, because of the possibility of communication with humans
through language, we can have information about the adequacy of
compensation to humans in a way not possible when seeking to compensate
other species. </li>
  <li>Third, humans are ordinarily concerned with the well-being of
other species, not just because other species are required for the
advancement of their selfish interests, but also because humans
acknowledge an obligation to all species for their own sakes. Thus any
harm to other species is a harm to humans as well, while we ordinarily
do not think of other species as being harmed by harm to humans. </li>
</ul>
<p>As beings with awareness of right and wrong, humans have potential
moral obligations to all species. There are at least three types of
effort to protect other species that a person can make out of his own
moral convictions, while asserting at most a minimal right to impose
his morality on others. For each type of effort, two levels can be
identified:</p>
<blockquote>1. He can adopt personal rules of conduct. He can apply
these rules first to his own direct conduct, and then to others, as a
condition for cooperating with them, as through trade.
  <p>2. He can engage in moral dialogue with others, seeking to
persuade them to voluntarily adopt his practices of respect for other
species, first with respect to their own conduct, and then as a
condition for cooperating with others.</p>
  <p>3. He can persuade his community to adopt a standard of behavior
that will be required of members of the community. Anyone with a
contrary opinion can join another community. In this way, for example,
communities outlaw cock fights. Because there are always some costs of
relocating, there will be some harm to those who disagree. Such
standards are least likely to infringe on the rights of dissenting
individuals when they are most local. At the second level, a person can
persuade his community to require a standard of behavior of its trading
partners. Such action is likely to be most persuasive when the
proscribed action is directly related to a traded commodity, as when
the Unites States outlawed the importation of tuna caught with nets
that killed large numbers of dolphins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the absence of perfect universal divine revelation, it is
virtually inevitable that people will disagree about the extent of
their obligations to other species. Thus, in addition to seeking a
common understanding of our obligations to other species, we must
seek ways to justly accommodate disagreements about these
obligations. This is where theories of economic justice enter.</p>
<p>In addition to the efforts listed above, which a person can pursue
on the basis of personal moral conviction, with almost no
interference with the rights of others who do not share his moral
conviction, a person can also advance a theory of justice that
permits him to limit the harm to nature that others cause. In my
view, the best basis for claiming a right to limit the harm that
others do to nature is a classical liberal theory of justice, similar
to that developed by Henry George in <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and
Poverty</a></i></b> (1879) or by Bruce Ackerman in <b><i>Social Justice
in the Liberal State</i></b> (1980). A classical liberal theory of
justice recognizes the rights of all persons to equal shares of
natural opportunities (that is, everything outside of human beings
and the value created by human effort) and the right of each
individual to pursue his personal conception of the good. Thus under
a classical liberal theory of justice, any individual can assert a
right to protect his share of the environment.</p>
<p>The idea that all natural opportunities belong equally to all
humanity is a radical idea with profound implications for many areas
of human activity, from public finance without coercive taxes to
world peace to the meaning of human freedom. The management of the
environment under such a liberal theory, with each person potentially
having a different conception of the protection that other species
deserve, provides a challenge for economic theory but not an
insurmountable one.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the protection of whales. If whales are not
persons (which they might become if we found ourselves in moral
dialogue with them), then hunting whales may be allowed but limited,
either because some humans wish to exercise their rights to nature by
protecting whales, or because a reduction in the number of whales
impoverishes the world for this generation and for future
generations. If the fraction <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">f</span> of the world's
population wishes to
protect whales, then that fraction of whales is off limits to whale
hunters. For the fraction of whales that may be hunted, if hunting
causes a loss to other potential hunters in this generation, then
those who kill whales should be charged a fee for the economic losses
that their behavior causes, with the proceeds shared equally among
all potential hunters. If the level of hunting is so great as to
cause the number of whales per capita that are available to the next
generation of humans to fall below the number available to this
generation, then the hunting fee should be the larger of the value of
the loss to other potential hunters in this generation and the value
of the loss of environmental quality to the next generation.</p>
