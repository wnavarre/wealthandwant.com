  <b>Affordable Housing and the Land Value Tax Perspective:<br>
a letter to Asheville, North Carolina</b>
<p>by Albert S. Hartheimer </p>
</center>
<p>Webster defines "afford" in this way: to have enough or the means
for, or to bear the cost of, without serious inconvenience; it
defines "housing" in this way: to provide, or serve as, a house or
lodgings for. So we are talking about providing places to live, the
cost of which can be borne without serious inconvenience.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<a name="What We Did and Where It Got Us"></a><b>What We Did and
Where It Got Us</b>
<p>I spent all of my working life in Albany, New York. Albany is a
more than 300-year-old river-front city on the west bank of the
Hudson River. As you go west from the Hudson the land rises gently,
then sharply, then gently again. The first housing in Albany was on
the bank of the river. Next, those who could afford to moved west, up
the first gentle incline. There today you will find "Grand Street," a
street lined with what were originally very lovely three and four
story single family row houses. After a while people moved further
west to a section called "The Pine Hills." I lived in a modest house
in the Pine Hills when I was first married and then, along with many
others, I built a house in the suburbs. As people moved to the
suburbs, the houses no longer suitable for the avant-garde in the
Pine Hills became the affordable housing of those less wealthy, and
the housing on Grand Street was converted to apartments and used as
affordable housing for the poor. And that's the way it is today. </p>
<p>In addition, more recently, in the Fifties, new high-rise housing
was built for the poor. Those buildings were destroyed by the tenants
and for a long time stood as empty shells, then the government spent
more millions rehabilitating them, and today they do house some of
the poor. It would have been better and cheaper if the "Pruitt-Igoe"
solution had been used, that is, blow up the buildings and get rid of
them entirely. </p>
<p>More recently, having learned that the poor do not want to be
housed in high-rise buildings, the government has financed low-rise
row houses, garden apartments and single-family houses. These have
been more successful, but they all have what to me is a great
disadvantage: <span style="font-weight: bold;">they ghetto-ize the poor</span>.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There have been many other
programs, with which you are undoubtedly more familiar than I am,
for providing affordable housing. But the supply has never been able
to catch up with the demand, and that's where we are now.</span> </p>
<p>After World War II there was great demand for housing for
returning veterans and others. Builders were anxious to satisfy this
demand, but the banks were reluctant to take the risk of lending
money to develop land in what was then the clean and green
countryside. The government solved this problem with VA and FHA loan
guarantees. Now, with the return of their money guaranteed, the banks
were willing to lend. And lend they did, with a vengeance! People
were housed, but along with the housing came the need for new roads,
new schools, new water lines, sewers, and electric and telephone
lines, and now, fifty years later, we are dealing with the very
considerable problems of urban sprawl. </p>
<p>Because of the low density of population in the suburbs and the
lack of people in the cities, mass transit is no longer economically
feasible, so it is subsidized by the government or not available at
all. We spend unconscionable amounts of time and money commuting to
everything. The social fabric of the cities is being destroyed and
not being replaced, in the main, and there are other problems. Now we
are being bombarded with "solutions" to the problems of urban sprawl.
</p>
<p>After expending billions of our tax dollars on an unending variety
of programs, we still have the problem that there is not enough
"affordable housing". Why is that? It is because all of the solutions
for the problem have been topical. If you don't have enough housing,
build houses! If the banks won't lend money, guarantee the loans! And
so it goes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">None of the solutions
have recognized the economic root
cause of the problem.</span> And that's what we're going to discuss.
Now,
however, I want to describe the typical small American city today.
Usually there is a "downtown," usually consisting of the City Hall,
some banks, some office buildings, some museums, some institutional
buildings like the YMCA, and a regional hospital. There are also some
stores, but the big department stores have gone to the suburbs and
the "big-box" stores, Wal-Mart, Home Depot and the rest, are nowhere
to be seen. There are also some residences, most likely for the poor
and some for the wealthy, but the middle class has fled. And then
there is vacant land, lots of it. </p>
<a name="The Materials at Hand"></a><b>The Materials at
Hand</b>
<p>In Asheville, there are about 4000 parcels of residential vacant
land out of about 25,000 parcels -- that's 16% of the total number of
parcels, and that represents about 13% of the total residential land
value. There are also 500 parcels of commercial and industrial vacant
land out of a total of 3500 parcels, or about 14% of the total number
of parcels, which represents 8% of the total non-residential land
value. <span style="font-weight: bold;">That's a lot of vacant land.
Why does it remain vacant in the
face of the need for affordable housing?<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Probably the biggest factor
is the low carrying cost of a vacant lot.</span> </span>In Asheville,
on average,
the annual tax on a vacant residential lot is about $200. With a
carrying cost so low, the incentive is to hold on to the lot with the
hope that the city will recover and the value of the lot will
increase. </p>
<p>Let us now consider the components in the cost of housing. There
are three: labor, materials and land. According to <a
 href="../auth/Rybeck.html">Walter Rybeck</a>
(Affordable Housing &#8212; A Missing Link, Center for Public Dialogue, 1988)
"Building materials in 1987 cost about 2.1 times what they did in
1970, but the inflation rate for the same period raised prices to
about 2.9 times their 1970 level. Similarly, wages for construction
workers rose 2.4 times between 1970 and 1987." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But the price of land
in the same period rose about 5.7 times. This is one result of a low
carrying cost and, according to Rybeck. "This is why the price of a
home has grown out of reach for so many Americans, particularly young
families seeking their first house. </span>Soaring land values are
locking
all but the very wealthiest out of the housing market." And in the
publication Incentive Taxation (Incentive Taxation, June, 1990,
Columbia, MD ) I read: "A just released study by the Urban Land
Institute reveals that the nationwide average price increase for
residential land during the past five years was 51% while consumer
prices increased only 26%". </p>
<p>The property tax is the principal tax levied by cities on real
estate. It is a tax on land and buildings. These two taxes are
totally different and work against each other. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A tax on buildings
discourages building. A tax on land encourages building.</span> In
Asheville, the tax on buildings is 78% of the total property tax, and
the tax on land is 22%. If you build a nice home in the city, one of
your first visitors will be the tax assessor. The tax you will have
to pay is the penalty for improving the city. The nicer the house,
the higher the penalty. </p>
<p>A 1991 report to the President by the Advisory Committee or
Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing ("<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Not In My
Backyard</span>"--Removing Barriers to Affordable Housing, Report to
President Bush and Secretary Kemp by the Advisory Committee on
Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, Thomas A. Kean, Chairman,
Thomas Ludlow Ashley, Vice-Chairman, Washington, 1991) said the
following: </p>
<blockquote> "In most places, the real property tax is a tax imposed on
the combined market value and improvements of both land and buildings.
The tax, however, discourages land development and rehabilitation,
because they increase the value of the property and the tax that must
be paid.
  <p>"An alternate solution for communities is to impose low tax rates
on structures and high tax rates on land. This approach will raise the
cost of holding land vacant (or leaving structures on the land
unrehabilitated), will not penalize land development, and can result in
more efficient land use, including increased affordable housing
opportunities." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The combination of the high cost of land and the punitive nature
of the present property tax are the root causes of the lack of
"affordable housing." No wonder the cities are in the shape they are
today. No wonder there is not enough affordable housing. </p>
<br>
<a name="One Thing We Can Do About it"></a><b>One Thing We Can Do
About it</b>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To make housing more affordable we
advocate the reduction of the
tax on buildings and a simultaneous rise of the tax on land to yield
the same or more revenue. This is called Land Value Taxation. It is
also called the two-rate tax, incentive taxation and the split-rate
tax.</span> </p>
<p>We know, from studies of the twenty Pennsylvania taxing
jurisdictions that use LVT, that every time the tax on buildings is
reduced, and simultaneously the tax on land is increased, that there
is a spurt of construction. According to Plassmann and Tideman (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">A
Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Effects of Two-Rate Property
Taxes in Pennsylvania</span>, Florenz Plassmann and T. Nicholas
Tideman,
September 1997, p19), "This means that, for an average municipality,
an increase in the adjusted tax differential of 1 mil will yield an
expected increase in the total value of construction of 1.58%". Much
of this increase in construction comes from people improving their
homes with the knowledge that the penalty for making improvements is
being reduced. </p>
<p>Does this provide more affordable housing? Pittsburgh has used the
two-rate tax since 1915, 85 years. Recently, Lew Sichelman (The
Housing Scene, by Lew Sichelman, the Los Angeles Times, Sunday, June
4, 2000) said "According to the federal government's latest
tabulation, the average of both new and existing houses sold in 31
key markets nationwide reached $200,300 during the first three months
of this year&#8230;. The San Francisco Bay Area&#8230;remains the most
expensive place in the country in which to buy a house. The average
price there is now $384,700. &#8230;At the other end of the price
spectrum, the average remains under $150,000 in only two places:
Pittsburgh at $143,300&#8230;.and St. Louis at $145,100." So
Pittsburgh, the only sizeable city in the United States to use the
two-rate tax, has the lowest cost housing in the country. A
coincidence? Perhaps not. </p>
<p>An interesting and amazing thing about the Pittsburgh experience
is that the two-rate tax in Pittsburgh applies only to the city tax,
not to the school tax and not to the county tax. It's impressive to
say that for the city tax the tax rate on land is six times higher
than the tax rate on buildings, but because of the much higher value
of buildings, only about 57% of the city tax is from land. When you
add the school tax and the county tax, less than 40% of the tax yield
is from land. </p>
<p>So a modest land tax applied over a long time (85 years) results
in the lowest average cost of housing in the country. Imagine what
would happen if the tax on buildings were eliminated and all of the
city revenue came from the land tax. It boggles the mind to think
about it. </p>
<p>David Roodman (<span style="font-style: italic;">The Natural Wealth
of Nations</span>, David Malin Roodman,
1998, p.123) wrote "<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the twentieth
century, Melbourne, Australia,
has been one of the best laboratories for the study of shifts toward
land value taxation.</span> Half of the 56 local governments within the
metropolitan area eliminated the building tax between 1919 and 1986
and increased the land tax. Today, not surprisingly, districts that
do not tax buildings have more of them. In fact, they have population
and housing densities half again as high as those with conventional
property taxes, even after controlling for distance from the city
center, amount of industry, and other relevant factors; the
difference is greatest for districts that switched earliest. And more
construction within the city limits has reduced pressure for
expansion beyond." </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Johannesburg, South Africa has no
tax on buildings.</span> The entire
property tax is on land. <a href="../auth/Gaffney.html">Mason Gaffney</a>,
a highly respected land
economist and Professor of Economics at UC Riverside, visited
Johannesburg. This is what he said about it. </p>
<blockquote>"The miracle of Johannesburg: Jo-burg is a Bootstrap City.
It should have died when its gold mines played out, like a proper
mining boomtown; instead it remains as the economic capital of its
nation and half a continent.
  <p>"Johannesburg defies most laws of urban economics, e.g. that mines
create no great cities. Explainers still cite the mines, but its mines
have played out; it should now be a ghost town. It has no harbor, no
water transportation, nor even any gravity water supply. It is, in
fact, on a ridge top, the Rand or "reef," at an elevation of 5,000 ft.
Unlike Chicago or Boston, it has no sunburst of rail lines, except
perhaps what it has attracted itself. It is "on the main rail line,"
Explainers say, but so are 1000 miles of other sites. The natural site
lacks outstanding amenities, and certainly can't hold a candle to Cape
Town. Jo-burg has no governmental economic base. Surrounding farmland
is poor. Why Johannesburg? Why is it the largest city, the center of
finance, industry, commerce, and international air travel? As a public
finance economist I may overvalue incentive taxation, but Jo-burg has
it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The property tax is on site value
only, and at a high rate: they tell me it is 4%. This is what makes
Jo-burg distinctive. Challenge and response: Jo-burg had to do
something right in order to survive, and that is what it did. </span>It
not only survived, it became and remains Number One. Give me a better
explanation and I'll back off. I haven't heard one yet." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="The Case of Harrisburg"></a><b>The Case of
Harrisburg</b></p>
<p>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania started using the two-rate tax in 1975
with a very modest shift of tax off buildings, onto land. At that
time it was known as a municipal "basket case," with over 4000 vacant
structures. Since then it has shifted more tax off buildings on to
land in several steps. Today the tax rate on land is 4.89%, the tax
rate on buildings is 0.9618%. Today there are less than 500 vacant
structures and Harrisburg is considered an up and coming city. </p>
<p>Mayor Reed in a 1994 letter to Patrick J. Toomey said the
following. "The City of Harrisburg continues in the view that such a
land value taxation system, which places a much higher tax on land
than on improvements, is an important incentive for the highest and
best use of land in already developed communities, such as cities.
[&#8230;] Moreover, the same two-rate system tends to
discourage real estate speculators and others who would be inclined
under normal conditions to tie up land tracts that could otherwise be
used for development purposes. [&#8230;] </p>
<p>With over 90% of the property owners in the City of Harrisburg,
the two-tiered tax system actually saves money over what would be
otherwise a single rate system that is currently in use in nearly all
municipalities in Pennsylvania. [&#8230;] I should note that
the City of Harrisburg was considered the second most distressed in
the United States twelve years ago [&#8230;] Since then, over
$1.2 billion in new investment has occurred here, reversing nearly
three decades of very serious decline." A coincidence? Perhaps not.
</p>
<p>Asheville would be a much more livable, alive city if it had no
tax on buildings and taxed only land. There would be fewer vacant
lots and more affordable housing. In order to reach this goal it is
important that there not only be a good end result, but that it be
politically feasible at every step along the way to reaching the
goal. </p>
<p>The study made by the Center for the Study of Economics, entitled
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing in Asheville, N.
C.: Can a Land value Tax be an
Answer?</span>," lays it out plainly. It says that in a shift of tax
off
buildings and on to land, 70% of residential parcels would see a
reduction in tax or no change. It also states that residential
properties now pay about $11,000,000 in property taxes. With no tax
on buildings this drops to $8,744,000, a reduction of $2,256,000 or
20% -- that is a very significant overall reduction for residential
properties. Since these people are the voters and since the majority
will pay less tax, their support will be forthcoming and it is
politically feasable to shift to a land tax in Asheville. </p>
<a name="How to Do It in Asheville"></a><b>How to Do It in
Asheville</b>
<p>What are the steps to be taken to implement land value taxation in
Asheville? First, there has to be broad support for this idea at the
grass roots. The public must understand the theory and practice of
land value taxation. At the same time the city government, the Mayor
and Council, must understand and support the proposed change. Then, a
state law must be enacted giving Asheville the option of shifting to
a two-rate tax, and then the Council must pass a local ordinance
adopting the two-rate tax and setting the rates. </p>
<p>Easier said than done, but not impossible. The single biggest
problem will be inertia, simple resistance to change. Everyone favors
change when it applies to others. That's a given, but this is a
common sense idea which, when properly introduced and explained, can
generate public support. The experience in Allentown, Pennsylvania,
where there were two referenda on this question, both of which won
the support of the majority, gives us confidence that it can be done
here. There's lots of support available to help you on your way. </p>
<a name="It's So Good, You've Got to Try"></a><b>It's So Good,
You've Got to Try It!</b>
<p>There are many advantages to land value taxation other than the
ones already stated: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">No State or Federal aid is
needed to implement this idea.</span> After the necessary legislation
is passed, only a change in computer programming is needed to change
the tax bills. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is a very progressive tax. </span>We
believe, in taxation, that the rich should pay more than the poor. The
poor own or use very little land and will pay very little land tax. The
middle class owns only the land under their homes and will pay modest
amounts of land tax. <span style="font-weight: bold;">All large and
valuable tracts of land are owned by corporations or wealthy
individuals, they will pay the most land tax.</span> </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is an easy tax to collect
and a difficult tax to avoid. </span>Land is there for everyone to
see. You can't put it in a Swiss bank account. You can't burn it down
and you can't move it. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land has no element of labor in
it, land is just what is found in nature and, therefore, in taxing land
we are not taking the bread from anyone's mouth.</span> </li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Every time the tax on buildings is
reduced, somebody builds. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Every time the tax on land is
raised, somebody builds.</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>We know that in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in the 12 years since
the introduction of the two-rate tax, the number of vacant structures
was reduced from over 4000 to under 500. </p>
<p>We know that in Pittsburgh, with just a modest land tax over 85
years, the cost of housing there is now the lowest in the country.
</p>
<p>We know that in Melbourne, Australia, the parts of the city that
use the land tax have housing and population densities higher than
those parts that use the conventional property tax. </p>
<p>And finally, we know that Johannesburg, South Africa, one of the
cities in the world that does not tax buildings at all, has grown and
prospered without any of the natural advantages that such large
cities usually have. </p>
<p><a name="Will It Work for Asheville?"></a><b>Will It Work for
Asheville?</b></p>
<p><b><i>Will this idea solve Asheville's affordable housing problems
overnight?</i></b> No it won't, but it took a long time to create the
problems and it will take time to solve them. </p>
<p><b><i>Will it be easy for Asheville to change from a conventional
property tax to a two-rate tax. </i></b>No, it won't, but it can be
done </p>
<p><b><i>Will it work in Asheville? Will it help create affordable
housing in Asheville?</i></b> Yes it will.&nbsp;
