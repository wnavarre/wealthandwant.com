  <p align="center"><strong>Some Background on the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation</strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>2004</strong>    </p>
  <p align="left">Pat Aller has kindly written this background to one of our most
    influential sister organisations. It is a few years old, but will give you a
    sense of one of the foundations that was created to promote Henry George's social
    philosophy.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Robert Schalkenbach Foundation</span>,
incorporated in 1925, is the second oldest United States Georgist
group; the Henry George Foundation of America was established a year
earlier.<br>
<br>
Robert Schalkenbach rose from poverty in New York to become a printing
executive and was introduced to <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George_P&amp;P.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a> by
his wife, who heard about it from her riding instructor. Schalkenbach read the
book and immediately became George's friend.
Before Schalkenbach died in 1924, he bequeathed about $200,000, the
bulk of his estate, to create an organization dedicated to "teaching,
expounding and propagating the ideas of Henry George as set forth in
[<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>], and in
his other books."<br>
<br>
Among the 21 men named by Schalkenbach as directors were <a href="Post_STC.html">Louis
Post</a>,
assistant Secretary of Labor under President Woodrow Wilson, and James
Brown, the riding instructor who, like Schalkenbach, had been active in
the Manhattan Single Tax Club. Charles O'Connor Hennessey, second
president, addressed Georgists in Copenhagen in 1926, when the
International Union for Land Value Taxation and Free Trade was created,
and later became IU president too. Interest in George's ideas had waned
after his death, with introduction of the US income tax in 1913, and
with the onset of World War I. His books were going out of print.
Therefore the foundation's first goals were to reprint and publicize
them. <br>
<br>
In 1929 it became a publisher, issuing a 50th anniversary edition of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span> on new
plates. Philosopher <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/PandP/Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html">John
Dewey</a>, who admired
George, was then persuaded to write the foreword to <a
 style="font-style: italic;"
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/PandP/sig_parag/Brown_preface.html">Significant
Paragraphs from Progress and Poverty</a>, which increased sales,
especially in universities. Praise from other important individuals was
used to advertise George's works. During The Depression, foundation
assets fell but the organization nevertheless contributed to
establishment of the Henry George School in 1932 and has had a close
relationship with it since, especially during the many years it was
housed in the school's building, until 1988. <br>
<br>
In 1941 Will Lissner, a New York Times editor, established more regular
contact with academics by founding<span style="font-style: italic;">
The American Journal of Economics
and Sociology</span>, with Dewey and other major scholars on its first
board.
One article in each issue of the refereed periodical is about George,
land value taxation, free trade, or relevant topics. When Lissner
retired in 1989, he and his wife Dorothy (AJES assistant editor)
compiled the George Studies, books containing many of those articles.
As its finances improved, the foundation published works by other
authors on Georgist themes, helped fund Henry George schools, Henry
George Foundation, Center for the Study of Economics, Land and Liberty,
and others, and also made grants for research, including municipal tax
studies, to students, scholars, activists, and nonprofit groups. Two
films were produced. In the 1960s the <a
 href="tred.html">Committee on
Taxation, Resources, and Economic Development (TRED)</a> was
established, holding nearly annual conferences at the University of
Wisconsin, subsequently published as books by the university. They are
still invaluable references. <br>
<br>
In the 1970s, P. I. (Perry) Prentice, vice-president of Time, Inc., and
editor of <em>House &amp; Home</em> and <em>Architectural Forum</em>, was elected
Schalkenbach president. He attracted high-profile Americans to the idea
of land value taxation, created the National Council for Property Tax
Reform, spoke all over the country, and held roundtables on tax issues,
published highlights of which later became Schalkenbach pamphlets. In
the 1980s the foundation endowed four universities (Pace University and St.
John's University, NY; the University of Scranton, Pennsylvania; and Williams
College,
Massachusetts).&nbsp; Each holds annual or biennial Georgist lectures
or programs, often published. Several lecturers have been Nobel prize
winners. <br>
<br>
In 1990 the foundation invited USSR economists (two from the Duma, the
chief legislative body) to meet in NY to discuss the feasibility of a
land value tax in the USSR. This initiated a series of visits by US
Georgist economists to the USSR and the nations that replaced it. A
<a href="Tideman_et_al_Gorbachev.htm">letter</a> to top US economists, asking them to endorse LVT, enlisted 30
supporters, including three Nobelists. In the late 90s the foundation
reformed bylaws, limiting directors to three three-year terms,
resulting in a nearly total turnover. The foundation continues to
publish, though that is now contracted to a major academic press. Its
grant program, which includes book proposals, outreach, and LVT and
free trade topics, has expanded. Last year the foundation emphasized
research by creating the Association for Geonomic Studies.<br>
<br>
Mary Cleveland, PhD, is the current president. The entire board, which
at present includes three Canadians, meets in NY each June, while
committees meet by telephone during the year. Mark Sullivan, acting
executive director, heads the small staff, which handles administration
and correspondence, as well as worldwide orders for books and pamphlets
and requests for, or exchanges of, Georgist ideas and news, especially
on Henry George or LVT. The foundation maintains a library; its LVT
holdings are the best in the US, according to scholars who have used
it. There are no members except the board, but the foundation reports
on current activities to its many correspondents with an annual fund
appeal in November. <br>
<br>
A painting of Carcassonne, France, hangs in the Schalkenbach Foundation
office, dedicated to that organization because its publishing kept
George's works from perishing, just as the French city kept Europe from
succumbing to invasion.<br>
