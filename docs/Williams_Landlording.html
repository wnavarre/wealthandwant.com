It Over Us</span><br>
Karl Williams</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If we&#8217;re spending decades of our life
trying to purchase what should be our common birthright &#8211; land, the
Common Wealth &#8211; then just who is it who&#8217;s riding on our backs? Here
your Mr. Ed exposes the extent by which the great landowners &#8211; in
Britain, particularly &#8211; &#8220;get rich in their sleep.&#8221;<br>
<br>
</div>
The hope is that newcomers to the Geoist world view will soon &#8220;<a href="../themes/The_Cat.html">see
the
cat</a>&#8221; &#8211; that is, grasp the big economic picture and see the various ways
by which a few gain while so many remain the working poor.<br>
<br>
Geoism holds that there&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with being rich &#8211;
indeed, an economic system exists whereby we could ALL be rich (in
wealth, education or leisure time). The justification for riches all
depends on whether a wealthy person has become so through <em>creating</em> wealth
(in the form of goods and services that people willingly buy in a free and fair
market) or through <em>living off the wealth really created
by others</em>. Earned wealth might arise through talented or arduous
inventing, writing, sports ability,
entertaining, entrepreneurialship or whatever. Such examples of fairly
earned wealth should not be subject to any (confiscatory) taxation,
which would be legalised robbery. There is, of course, a natural form
of public finance, in the form of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural
Resource Charges.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Geoism seeks to expose the many forms of unearned wealth, or privilege,
that exist in our monstrous economic system. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Monopoly rights are the more obvious
examples of economic privilege, but less noticeable is the massive
wealth to be gained by using the Global Commons (especially land)
without reimbursing the rest of us. </span>Where such wealth is purely
misappropriated (as opposed to created), Geoism maintains that the
whole lot be given over to community coffers through natural resource
charges (such as land value taxation or <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Williams_Overlooked_Eco-Tax.html">eco-taxes</a>).<br>
<br>
Here we&#8217;re going to look at one of the most obvious examples of
unearned wealth &#8211; the massive riches accumulated by the great
landowners of Britain. Remember, it&#8217;s not the acreage of land that is
important, but the value of the land. Australia doesn&#8217;t have quite the
disparities of land wealth of Britain, being a newly-settled/colonised
country, but each so-called property &#8220;boom&#8221; in Australia is widening
the gulf between the haves and the havenots. <br>
<br>
Some of the following quotes and statistics were taken from &#8220;Who Owns
Britain&#8221; by Kevin Cahill, and from Alexander Garrett&#8217;s article &#8220;Coming
Into Land&#8221; in the April 2003 issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">Business
Life</span> magazine. Due to the lasting privilege of royalty, Britain
is different from other European countries in the sheer size of its
private estates. Thierry de L&#8217;Escaille, secretary-general of the
Brussels-based European Landowners Organisation says, &#8220;There are large
estates in most countries, but what we call large is usually 1,000,
2,000 or 3,000 hectares [a hectare being about 2&frac12; acres]. They
are never as large as in the UK.&#8221; However, Spain is an exception, where
there are around 150 estates that are more than 10,000 hectares in size
&#8211; due, perhaps, to the perpetuation of royal privileges and power
through the Franco regime. <br>
<br>
Why is Europe different? De l&#8217;Escaille says the main reason is the
adoption of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Napoleonic code</span>
across Europe. This determined that an
estate must always be divided between the children &#8211; although one could
have a larger share &#8211; and the effect has been to steadily reduce the
size of individual landholdings over the ensuing two centuries. Estates
are still held in most European countries by aristocratic families and
even royal families, but examples are elusive, due to a reluctance
among the ranks of the landowners to receive publicity. <br>
<br>
Nowadays, the ranks of established landowners are being joined by a new
wave of owners for whom land is the ultimate status symbol, of whom De
l&#8217;Escaille says, &#8220;These are entrepreneurs who have been very successful
in their business who
are buying estates everywhere across Europe.&#8221;<br>
<br>
But the rewards of land go far beyond status, evidenced by how, over
the centuries, the land-owning elite has pulled the levers of power in
society, politics and the world of commerce. The Earl of Derby&#8217;s 1881
candid analysis of the benefits of owning land perhaps says it best, 
<ul>
  <li>&#8220;One, political influence;  </li>
  <li>two, social importance;  </li>
  <li>three, power exercised over tenantry;</li>
  <li>four, residential enjoyment including what is called sport;  </li>
  <li>five, the money return &#8211; the rent.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
Since then, the reform of the House of Lords has dented the political
influence that was previously wielded by the landowning class (titles
and land were once synonymous). But who needs status? &#8211; let&#8217;s get crass
and just go for the cash. The great windfall profits which are dropped
into landowners&#8217; laps (which rightly belongs to the community) occurs
with <span style="font-weight: bold;">rezoning </span>and the growth
in residential/industrial values. In the
UK between 1991 and 2001, the total return by this measure (including
capital growth and rental income) averaged a healthy 12.6% per year.<br>
<br>
The gross injustice of handing over community-created values to
landowners is revealed by cold, hard figures. According to Yolande
Barnes, head of research at FPD Savills, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the <em>average</em> UK building plot &#8211;
at &pound;709,650 for a greenfield acre &#8211; is worth around 403 times the
equivalent agricultural land. </span>Nationwide, through this form of
rezoning, around &pound;5bn. windfall profit is handed over to UK
landowners each year.<br>
<br>
Barnes explains further, &#8220;In many parts of the South and Southeast, it
is certainly true that prices are paid for agricultural land that
wouldn&#8217;t be justified by its agricultural value.&#8221; She said further that
it is impossible to know how much of this differential is accounted for
by a "hope" factor &#8211; a speculative play on future change of use &#8211; and
how
much represents the premium for land&#8217;s amenity value when it is in such
short supply. But she adds: &#8220;There has certainly been a deal of
strategic holding and buying on
city and town fringes by agricultural owners and farmers. New
development land is usually designated in &#8220;fill-ins&#8221; and close to
existing developments.&#8221;&nbsp; She added further that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">farmers buy around
towns because they can&#8217;t lose. They&#8217;ll farm the land anyway, and if
permission is given to build, they&#8217;ve won the lottery. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A great way to run a casino, but what
sort of way to run an economy and
a society? </span>It makes you wonder how someone who realises the
scale of
these windfall profits can accept them so unquestioningly. But, then
again, we had the example of a young Melbourne Geoist a few years ago
who did the ultimate sellout: he quit working for The Cause to use his
knowledge of the great land rip-off in order to set up his own
get-rich-quick property seminars!<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 80%; height: 6px;"><br>
Britains' wealthiest man gets rich the easy way -- he has his
underlings collect and bank his rent. And if the rents from his vast
land holdings weren&#8217;t enough, soaring property prices have escalated
his net worth sky high &#8211; to be exact, UK&pound;11.5 billion. To give
him his full title, he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">His Grace,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerald Grosvenor</span>, OBE,
Sixth Duke of Westminster</span>.<br>
<br>
Forget the vast tracts of rural land, including a 100,000-acre estate
in Scotland which contains no less than three mountains. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">300 acres
the duke owns in central London,</span> comprising Mayfair and
Belgravia, are
today one of the most valuable patches of ground on the planet.</span><br>
<br>
It was a handy marriage which brought this fortune into the Grosvenor
family&#8217;s hands &#8211; in 1677, Sir Richard Grosvenor married Mary Davies,
heir to the hundred acres north of Piccadilly and the &#8220;Five Fields&#8221;
south of Knightsbridge. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Mayfair and
Belgravia were built up as residential areas for London&#8217;s wealthy
classes, a position they have occupied ever since. Unlike many other
great landowners who have cashed in, the Grosvenors held on and have
benefited enormously from the latest boom in London property prices.<br>
<br>
The duke has nowadays diversified his land portfolio. His commercial
property company, Grosvenor, has become a serious player, with a vast
array of investments and developments around the world. These include
office blocks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco</span>,
business parks in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vancouver</span>,
luxury
apartments in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hong Kong</span> and
shopping centres in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spain </span>and
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Portugal</span>. In
the UK, Grosvenor has developed Festival Place shopping centre in
Basingstoke and is set to undertake a &pound;700m. mixed-use
redevelopment in the centre of Liverpool. Back in his tract of Mayfair,
land values are in the stratosphere: in 2001, BP&#8217;s pension fund sold
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ten acres of Mayfair for a cool
&pound;335m.</span><br>
<br>
Is it any wonder that, given how there is little or no land value
taxation, the duke has all his many eggs in the land investment basket?
But it&#8217;s not just for economic considerations that he could never
contemplate selling his vast acreage, for he has a philosophical reason
for not selling. (Have a bucket ready before reading the following!) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">&#8220;This is part of my
heritage, my birthright. It is not to do with anything materialistic,
but is deeply ingrained.&#8221;</span><br>
