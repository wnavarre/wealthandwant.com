<center><b>Well being and being well off<br>
</b>by Fred E. Foldvary<br>
Senior Editor, <a href="http://www.progress.org/">The Progress Report</a></center>
<p> In the <a href="http://www.progress.org/cgi-bin/webbbs/config.pl">Economic
Justice Discussion Room</a> of <a
 href="http://www.progress.org/cgi-bin/webbbs/config.pl">The Progress
Report</a>
there has been a conversation on the meaning and measurement of being
"well off." It has been noted that being well off is both relative
and absolute.</p>
<p> I see three ways in which one can define "well off." <b>First,
one is better or worse off relative to the distribution of wealth or
income in a particular society.</b> Economists often measure the
distribution of income by dividing society into quintals, or five
divisions, from the poorest fifth to the richest fifth (see&nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.foldvary.net/works/ineq.html">http://www.foldvary.net/works/ineq.html</a>
). Those in the highest quintal are relatively best
off. In terms of the categories of income, if much of the income of
an economy is going to land rent, then landowners are relatively well
off compared to laborers, as indeed they are in many countries.</p>
<p> <b> Secondly, being well off can be thought of as relative to
the typical person in the economy.</b> In the USA, for example, a
typical person has a dwelling to live in, a car, furniture, and goods
such as a television set, telephone, stove, refrigerator, and a
computer. The typical person has enough human capital (education and
skills) to be able to communicate with others and know how to handle
money and goods and avoid trouble with the authorities.</p>
<p> Being well off relative to what is typical also means that one
has some confidence that one will continue to have such goods, that
they will not be arbitrarily confiscated, and that one has insurance
against disasters and theft. Well being also requires security of
one's person, that one is reasonably safe from attack. The typical
person who is well off also has reasonably satisfactory relationships
with people and animals, and also the liberty that is typical for the
majority; he is not a persecuted minority.</p>
<p> One can have all this and still not be happy, so well being is
not a synonym for happiness. It just means that one has the material
goods, security, liberty, and relationships typical for the average
person in a society, or better than typical.<br>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td
 style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 153);"><p>This
  is interesting.&nbsp; Some of the Heritage Foundation papers which seek
  to convince us that America doesn't have a poverty problem make the
  argument that people toward the bottom of the income and/or wealth
  spectrums can't possibly be poor because so many of them have color
  TV's, something which only the wealthy had 50 or so years ago. <br>
        <br>
  Such arguments ignore time and technological progress, among other
  things.</p>
        <p>Henry George spoke to this issue directly in the beginning of Progress
          &amp; Poverty.</p></td>

<p> <b>Third, one can define "well off" in absolute terms.</b> The
opposite of "well off" is "ill off," with synonyms "bad off" and
"unwell off." One is ill off if one's income is at subsistence or
worse, subsistence being a level of income that provides just enough
for basic survival: basic food such as rice and beans, minimal
shelter, and basic, inexpensive medical care.</p>
<p> Being absolutely well off means, </p>
<ul>
  <li>first, that one is able to rise substantially above subsistence
through peaceful and honest means, whether from one's labor, from one's
rightful share of natural and contractual benefits, or from gifts.</li>
  <li>Secondly, to be absolutely well off requires complete <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">liberty</span>, so that the only legal
restriction is the prohibition of coercive harm to others. Liberty
includes security against attack, either by government or by private
persons, since one is not really free if one is under substantial
threats of death and theft against which one is helpless.</li>
</ul>
<p> With liberty, one is free to establish whatever relationships
one wishes, so long as others are also willing. With liberty and the
ability to obtain wealth, one can obtain assurance of future wealth
both because one is able to earn it and also because one is able to
store wealth and insure oneself against risk.</p>
<p> My Dictionary of Free-Market Economics defines "well-being" as
"The amount and degree to which individuals in an economy are able to
pursue and attain their ends." <b>The only requirement for absolute
well being, for someone who is mentally and physically able to
produce wealth, is liberty.</b> With liberty, one can obtain wealth,
friends, and future security, express oneself as one pleases, and
enjoy life in accord with one's values and lifestyle preference.</p>
<p> Being absolutely well off does not involve any particular
level of wealth beyond subsistence, since this depends on personal
preference. An artist may prefer to live at subsistence and devote
her time to art, and that person is absolutely well off because she
is pursuing happiness in her own way. As with relative well being,
one can be well off in the absolute sense without being happy, as for
example a person who has much wealth but has lost love or has a
serious illness.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> What is required for there to be
complete liberty? </span>There must
be a basic law such that any act that does not invade the domain of
others is not prohibited or taxed. In liberty, there are only
prohibitions if there are victims who are coercively harmed, and
there is restitution for damages to others. In liberty, people have
equal rights and no special legal privileges. In a free society,
nobody starves, because one is able to save for the future, because
on obtains one's equal share of natural and civic benefits, and
because the sympathy of society will not let people starve.</p>
<p> The economic policy of liberty has four rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To the creator belongs the creation.</li>
  <li>The profit of nature's creation belongs equally to all.</li>
  <li>The benefit of what is created by government belongs to all the
people in its jurisdiction.</li>
  <li>When the initial distribution is just, the outcomes of free
exchange are just and should not be hampered. </li>
</ol>
<p> Follow these rules, and everyone in the society will be
absolutely well off.</p>
