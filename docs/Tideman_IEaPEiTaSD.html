<div align="center"><small><small><b>Improving Efficiency and Preventing
  Exploitation in Taxing and Spending Decisions</b></small></small>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Nicolaus Tideman</p>
<p>Fundamental tax reform is on the agenda these days. There are a
variety of proposals for a flatter federal income tax. There are
proposals to replace the federal income tax with a national sales
tax. I would like to suggest that discussion of fundamental tax
reform should be preceded by a discussion of what constitutes a good
system of taxing and spending. When principles of good taxing and
spending have been examined, what emerges as attractive is greater
reliance on local decision-making and, for federal revenue, an
allocation of financial obligation to states rather than direct
federal taxation of individuals or corporations.</p>
<p>Two of the most troublesome features of taxation and public
spending are that taxation relies on coercion, and that the
combination of taxing and public spending generates substantially
haphazard redistribution. People must pay their taxes on penalty of
having their property confiscated, or of going to jail. And we cannot
say that this process is for everyone's good.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe, though we do not have the basis to say
for sure, that some people receive much less in benefits from public
spending than they pay in taxes. How do we justify the harm that is
thereby done to some persons by the combination of taxing and public
spending? I would like to address this question by first discussing
some possible justifications that might seem attractive, but should
be rejected.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One possible justification is <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservatism</span>:
Things have always been done this way. Our institutions have evolved to
solve social problems that we may not even be aware of. Who knows what
terrible things might happen if we did things differently?
    <p>There is an element of validity to the conservative position,
but not an adequate basis for making conservatism the primary principle
of social organization. If we had adopted conservatism as the primary
principle of social organization centuries ago, there would have been
no end to slavery, no women's suffrage, nor any of the numerous other
changes in social organization in response to improvements in our moral
understanding. It would be foolhardy to assert that we will never
experience further improvements in our moral understanding that will
call for changes in social organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A second possible justification of public spending is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarianism</span>: Once we have voted
we know the right thing to do. The possibility of majority-rule cycles
undermines the simple-minded version of majoritarianism that says that
the majority is always right. Still, it would be possible to assert
that majorities should have their way when cycles are not observed, and
that when they are observed, some device for cutting through cycles can
restore the viability of majoritarianism. However, that would give free
rein to any majority to exploit any minority. That makes no sense as a
theory of justice. One could assert that voters, acting as judges of
what is best rather than as self-interested advocates, have a claim to
determine in a majoritarian fashion what a collectivity ought to do.
But then one still needs a theory of the principles by which the voters
ought to judge. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A third possible justification of public spending is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>: People should be
required to provide as much for others as they have themselves. This
theory suffers from the difficulties of vagueness and questionable
operationality. As much what? There is no way to ensure that all
persons will have equal quantities of such valued things as affection,
talent or self-confidence. It is possible to imagine a crude
egalitarianism of goods, but only by eliminating all incentives to be
productive. If equality is traded off against some other goal, then
egalitarianism is no longer the first principle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rawls manages to retain the primacy of egalitarianism without
destroying all incentives to be productive by the maximin rule:
<b>Laws should be designed to maximize the well-being of the least
advantaged person.</b> This formulation, however, generates such
anomalies as the following: If there are three persons, and the
choice is either a distribution of $10,000, $12,000 and $50,0000, or
a distribution of $10,001, $10,002 and $80,000, the <i>maximin</i>
rule will select the latter, despite the fact that it makes the
middle income person, who is already relatively poor, even poorer
while making the richest person noticeably richer. In Rawls's
particular formulation there is a further difficulty. He makes the
<i>maximin</i> rule lexically subordinate to the rule that all
persons should have the maximum individual liberty that all can have.
However, he does not deal with the following problem: My individual
liberty will be unnecessarily restricted if I am not allowed to sing
you a song in exchange for a haircut (without being taxed), but if I
am allowed to do so without being taxed, the maximin rule is not
satisfied. If Rawls really does mean to put individual liberty
lexically first, no redistributive income taxes would be
permitted.</p>
<p>Rawls sets his proposals in the framework of a fourth possible
principle of public action, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">contractarian
</span>suggestion that it is
just to coerce people to abide by the rules that they would have
agreed to if they had had a chance, before they knew their individual
circumstances. One difficulty with this rule is that it is so hard to
know what it is that people would have agreed to in these
circumstances. Rawls is convinced that people would have agreed to a
lexical ordering of maximum individual liberty and the maximin
principle. John Harsanyi offers a strong argument for the proposition
that they would have agreed to the rules that would maximize total
(or, equivalently, average) utility. This has some strange
implications. For example, if it is possible to separate individuals
into ascetics and sybarites, then the maximization of total utility
requires that the ascetics be forced to work very hard, with the
resulting output used for the benefit of the sybarites. And if one of
your kidneys (or your eyes) would provide me with more utility than
it provides you, then the state is justified in extracting it from
you and giving it to me. Utilitarianism does not accommodate
individual rights.</p>
<p>The disagreements among contractarians about what contractarianism
implies provide a hint of a difficulty that Bruce Ackerman elaborates
in <b><i>Social Justice in the Liberal State</i></b>:
Contractarianism offers so little defense against people with power
who delude themselves about the undeniability of their beliefs about
what people would agree to before they knew their personal
circumstances. The person who feels oppressed says "I never would
have agreed to these rules before I knew my personal circumstances."
Those with power reply, "It's obvious to us that you would have. Stop
your griping." The scope for further dialogue is small, and the
potential for abuse is great.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Another possible framework for the
justification of government
action is that those with power are simply elitists: They may believe
that their exercise of power is justified by their superior
understanding of the nature of the good. </span>While it is not
unreasonable
to suggest that there are some persons who do have superior
understanding of the nature of the good, it is extremely dangerous
for people to justify the exercise of political power by self
identification as members of the elite who have superior
understanding of the nature of the good. It was thinking of that sort
that gave the world Stalinism. The general thrust of Western
political thinking has been that elitism is simply unacceptable as a
justification for the exercise of political power.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On the basis of the arguments
given, I reject conservatism,
majoritarianism, egalitarianism, contractarianism, and elitism as
justifications for coercive taxing and spending.</span> A framework for
just
social arrangements that does make sense to me is classical
liberalism, which asserts that it is just to coerce people to accord
others the maximum individual liberty that all can have. This means
that people have rights to their bodies, their talents, the products
of their labor, and the returns to their savings. Anything produced
by human effort belong to the producer, or to the producer's
successor in title through gift and exchange.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The principle of maximum individual
liberty does not address the
question of how the rights to natural opportunities (land, water,
ocean fish, minerals, the frequency spectrum, etc.) should be
assigned.</span> There are at least three approaches within the
classical
liberal tradition as to how these returns should be divided.</p>
<p>George Reisman advocates what might be called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">conservative
classical liberalism</span>." This position is that certainty in
property
rights is so valuable that one should never ask whether unjustifiable
violence was used in establishing the existing pattern of control
over natural opportunities.</p>
<p>Every natural opportunity belongs to whoever most recently
succeeded in establishing control over it.</p>
<p>Murray Rothbard, by contrast, took what might be called the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarian</span>"
position. This is the position that when
we can know who first used a natural opportunity, it belongs to that
person, or to his or her successor in title through gift and
exchange. All thefts from victims with identifiable successors should
be undone. When we cannot identify the proper successor of the first
user, the a thing belongs to whoever is using it now, unless that
person stole it, in which case it properly belongs to whoever brings
the thief to justice.</p>
<p>The third position, which might be called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geoliberalism</span>" emerges
from the work of Henry George. This is the position that all persons
have equal rights to natural opportunities, which rights should be
secured by having the public treasury collect the rental value of
exclusive access to land and other natural opportunities, with the
revenue used for public purposes and guaranteed incomes.</p>
<p>Of these three approaches, I find geoliberalism most attractive.
It fits my sense of justice that all persons should have equal rights
to natural opportunities. In addition, by providing funding for
guaranteed incomes, geoliberalism offers a greater prospect for
removing more of the distorting taxes that finance the welfare
state.</p>
<p>A possible difficulty with classical liberalism as a justification
for government action is that it may justify little if any government
action. Taxes intrude upon individual liberty. How is this intrusion
to be justified? One way to try to get around this difficulty is by
the claim that some expenditures on protecting individual rights are
so valuable that anyone would understand that, for these
expenditures, the reduction in individual liberty from taxation is
less than the addition to individual liberty from the protection of
individual rights that is possible with taxation. However, if
improving the well-being of all citizens is the justification, then
one should ask whether there is adequate justification for even these
government actions if they do not have unanimous support.</p>
<p>Supporters of government action might argue that if unanimous
support were required, then the problem of selfish individuals
holding out for greater shares of the surplus would raise
transactions costs to the point where nothing could be done, even if
there were things that would make everyone better off. But that
justification carries the risk of justifying nearly anything. If
those in power have an excuse to ignore what citizens say about what
they value, what limits to power are there?</p>
<p>Geoliberalism offers a different way of justifying public spending
and the taxation that finances it. If people are perfectly mobile,
and if there are enough people who value a local public good to fill
the area that benefits from it, then the provision of a local public
good will raise land rents by enough to pay for the public good. In
collecting the rental value of land, governments will collect enough
to pay for any worthwhile local public goods that they provide.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Under the conservative or homesteading
libertarian versions of
classical liberalism, the possessor of land might say, "This is my
land. I didn't ask for these public goods. You have no right to tax
me to pay for them." Under geoliberalism, on the other hand, the
community can reply, "You have as much right to the use of land and
other natural opportunities as anyone else. If you want to exercise
your rights in this community, these are the taxes you must pay. If
you don't like it, claim your share of natural opportunities
somewhere else."</p>
<p>If people are perfectly mobile and have an unlimited range of
communities to choose among, then they cannot be exploited and need
not tolerate inefficiency. They will move. Competing communities will
find that the utility-maximizing public sector equilibrium involves
providing all local public goods with benefits greater than costs,
financing them by a combination of fees equal to marginal costs and
taxes on the land that benefits from differential access to the local
public goods. There will be no taxes on labor or capital except to
internalize externalities.</p>
<p>If tastes vary so much that a community cannot be filled with
people with the same taste for local public goods, then it will not
be possible to finance all worthwhile local public goods by the
increase in rent that they generate.</p>
<p>The community will either have to leave some worthwhile local
public goods unprovided, or finance them from some other source. But
in either case the residents are treated fairly if they are free to
move elsewhere and choose not to do so.</p>
<p>If people are not perfectly mobile, then minorities can be
exploited by being taxed without receiving corresponding benefits. If
they could move freely they would, but if they can't, they may find
it less painful to accept exploitation by the majority than to pay
the costs of moving.</p>
<p>The efficiency of the competitive equilibrium requires that the
sharing of the pre-development rental value of land (that part of the
rental value of land that is not accounted for by local public goods)
and the value of other natural opportunities be unaffected by
migration or political competition. If the distribution of the
returns to natural opportunities depends on where people live or on
political competition, then efficiency will fall because of
inefficient location decisions and rent seeking losses. For example,
if the returns to oil in Alaska are divided among the people who live
in Alaska, then people will move to Alaska inefficiently to share in
the bounty. If the distribution of the returns to natural
opportunities depends on political competition, then there will be
rent-seeking losses from such competition. A non-exploitive and
reasonably efficient local public sector is thus possible through
competition among communities.</p>
<p>What, then, about public goods that have benefits over greater
areas? If only a few localities are involved, one might expect them
to negotiate voluntary compacts with reasonable efficiency. "Pork
barrel" projects--all projects with benefits for only a small region
of the country--should not be paid for with national taxes. The
practice leads to the approval of inefficient projects as a result of
the politicking of those who benefit, and it unjustly exploits those
who do not benefit.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">For truly national public goods,
other ideas must be explored.</span> One
of the major national public goods is defense. In a perfectly just
world, everyone would be so respectful of the rights of others, and
everyone would feel so safe that no defense spending would be
desired. In a less perfect world, many people, but not all, want
public defense expenditures. How can they be provided justly?</p>
<p>Some financing of <span style="font-weight: bold;">defense </span>expenditures
can be provided by a
Pigouvian tax on the externality of accumulating capital, which makes
a nation a more attractive target of aggression. If the U.S. requires
a greater defense budget than Canada, which is larger in area, it is
because the greater value of the assets in the U.S. makes the U.S. a
more attractive target of aggression. Thus anyone who owns capital
might reasonably be charged for the increase in the defense budget
that is needed to make other citizens as safe as they would be if
that one person's capital were not adding to the attractiveness of
nation as a target. It would be interesting to know how much of the
defense budget could be covered by such charges. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I propose a
self-assessed tax of, perhaps, 1% per year on the value of all assets
and contractual rights, to pay the costs of defense. The owner
assesses the value and pays a corresponding tax, and if anyone wants
to buy the asset at the assessed value, it is sold.</span> There could
be a
personal exemption of perhaps $50,000 per year, and an exemption for
personal papers. There could be a local add-on to pay the costs of
local police and courts.</p>
<p>An even greater share of the federal budget is used for various
programs that provide help for people with special needs--welfare,
Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, unemployment insurance, disaster
assistance, etc. Some of these programs (social security, Medicare,
and unemployment compensation) are funded in part by payments by
prospective beneficiaries. But all incorporate substantial elements
of deliberate redistribution.</p>
<p>In a world that adhered to a classical liberal understanding of
justice, there would be three sources of funding for people with
special needs:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1) insurance that those with special
needs had bought for
themselves prior to the onset of their special needs,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2) donations from family, friends and
other compassionate persons,
and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3) local public expenditures that would
be non-coercively
financed, because anyone who objected to the financing could leave
the locality.</p>
<p>In a just would, people would ensure, prior to conceiving
children, that any expensive special needs that their children might
have would be paid for, either by insurance that the parents would
buy, or by voluntary conventions in their communities that the
community would pay the costs of such needs.</p>
<p>Perhaps you object that some people would not be able to afford
such insurance for all their children. If this is true, it implies
one of two things.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Either the parents of such children are behaving
unjustly by conceiving those children, who will either lack what they
ought to have or will be able to receive it only by the imposition of
unjust taxes.  </li>
  <li>Or else the parents have been treated unjustly by
having started life without enough resources to provide for the
children that they ought to have had the chance to bring into the
world. I would guess that sometimes the first is true, sometimes the
second, and sometimes both.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The possibility that prospective
parents might be unable to afford
to provide for the children that they ought to have the chance to
bring into the world highlights the possible need for a one-time
redistribution that would give everyone a fair starting point. </span>This
does not mean equality for ever. It does not necessarily even mean
equality at the starting time. What it means is allocating initial
rights in such a way that we do not mind requiring people to pay the
costs of their choices, including the choice of conceiving children
(unless they belong to communities that agree to pay the costs of
some of their choices).
<p>Whenever a one-time redistribution is proposed, a reaction of many
economists is, "Yeah, right. Why would anyone one believe that it
would be only one time?" What would make it reasonable to believe
that such a redistribution would be a one-time event is its
rationale: The recognition that some persons have had unfairly
inadequate starting positions in life, and the determination to end
that. If the purpose is achieved, there is no rationale for further
redistribution, unless, at some future time, our society attains a
new moral insight that implies that further redistribution is
required.</p>
<p>With transfers replaced by private insurance and local action, and
defense pad for substantially by Pigouvian taxes on capital, not much
is left for federal taxes to support. Perhaps some international
relations, perhaps some research (though in view of the possibility
of a conflict of interest on my part, one should not take my word for
it.) If I could have my way, the little that would be needed in
national spending would be paid for by voluntary subscription by
lower levels of government, as the UN is financed.</p>
<p>Of course, we are very far from public acceptance of geoliberal
principles. So <span style="font-weight: bold;">the question arises of
what might be done within
current political understandings to reduce inefficiency and
exploitation in taxing and spending.</span> It is hard to know how much
more
than what is being done might be done. Let me be on the imaginative
side.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a proposal that tax
increases be allowed only with a
two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress.</span> That has some
merit,
but it carries a risk of excessive deficits. It also allows the
existing level of taxation to go unquestioned. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It would
probably be
better to have a rule that every spending proposal must be approved
by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to be enacted.
Maybe three-fourths. If spending is truly worthwhile, then, as
Wicksell said, there is a way of financing it that will secure the
approval of nearly everyone.</span></p>
<p>The current trend toward returning functions to the states is a
step in the right direction. But it encounters understandable
objections that poor states cannot afford to do what they ought to
do. Some form of revenue sharing is needed. But it is important to
have the right definition of which states are rich and which are
poor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The level of well-being in a
state is determined in part by the
wisdom of its public policies. </span>States should not be penalized
for
adopting productive policies.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Revenue
sharing should equalize per
capita levels of natural opportunities (mineral revenues, fishing
rights, pre-development land rents, etc.) </span>Replacing the
personal and
corporate income taxes with either a flat income tax or a national
sales or value added tax would greatly reduce the excess burden of
federal taxes. (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Excess burden is
roughly proportional to the square
of the typical marginal tax rate.</span>) But almost all the gains go
to the
rich. Perhaps the flat tax could be combined with a guaranteed
income.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Even better than a flat tax or a
national sales tax, in my view,
would be a return to the revenue system that was apparently
envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution in 1787. I mean a rule
that the federal revenue requirement would be allocated to the states
in proportion to their populations.</span> The use of population as the
allocation device seems anachronistic in this era of concern for
impoverished regions. But the allocation could be corrected by an
expenditure that equalized per capita access to natural
opportunities.</p>
<p>I see three important virtues in allocating the revenue obligation
to the states.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, it gets rid of the IRS and its intrusions. (A national
sales or value added tax would do most of this, leaving only firms
subject to the tax man's scrutiny.)</li>
  <li>Second, it requires the states to compete in seeking ways of
raising revenue that do not reduce the productivity of their economies.
The competitive equilibrium is to raise as much revenue as possible
from charges for exclusive use of land and other natural opportunities,
and to tax labor and capital only as a last resort.</li>
  <li>The third virtue is the likelihood that placing the revenue
obligation on states rather than on individuals would lead to more
careful scrutiny of the value of proposed expenditures.</li>
</ul>
<p>With only fifty states and each state aware of exactly how much
each spending proposal will cost its treasury, I believe that it
would be much harder to secure approval for inefficient or
special-interest spending.</p>
