<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Three Keys to Containing Sprawl</span><br>
by Hanno T. Beck<br>
</div>
The successful solution to sprawl is not some formula. Rather, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">succeeding against sprawl means having a
variety of tools at your disposal, so that you can shape the best
solution for your particular situation.</span><br>
<br>
I baked a birthday cake for my wife a few weeks ago. White cake, with
pink icing. To serve it, I used a knife to cut the cake, then a sort of
spatula to lift the slice of cake, then a fork to eat the cake. It was
just a simple piece of cake, for crying out loud, but we used three
tools to serve it. Three tools, just to control a piece of cake!<br>
<br>
Do you think that sprawl is less complex than a piece of cake? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Do you think that all sprawl is caused by
one simple factor, has one set of characteristics, and always has the
same solution? Of course not. There are lots of causes of sprawl, and
lots of types of sprawl. Sprawl is more complicated than a piece of
cake.</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So how many anti-sprawl tools do we
need? We need as many as possible. Right now I am going to put three
tools in your anti-sprawl toolkit. </span>They are three general
tools, you can use them in many ways and in many combinations.<br>
<br>
Traffic lights have three colors. Red, yellow, green. If you can
remember that then you can remember the three tools I will present
here, because they are a red light, a yellow light, and a green light.<br>
<br>
Here is what I mean.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The first tool against sprawl is the
red light.</span> Red light means STOP! Stop sprawl directly. 
<ul>
  <li>You are using the red light when you resist a new WalMart store
that wants to locate on the outskirts of town.  </li>
  <li>You are using the red light when you propose a law to protect
wilderness areas from development.</li>
</ul>
Sometimes the red light wins! But it's just one tool, and not always
the best. Suppose you're trying to stop an inefficient, unneeded
shopping center from locating near your community &#8212; then the red light
is all there is. You simply try not to allow the new development.<br>
<br>
But in many other cases when we work against sprawl, the red light does
not make so much sense. Most of you are aware that in Portland Oregon
they have a development boundary, a ring around the city. Beyond that
boundary you are not allowed to develop land.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">That's a classic red-light approach to
sprawl -- just ban it.</span> But what are the results? For one thing,
all the land speculators who hold lands outside the boundary will
lobby, every year, for that boundary to be extended to include their
sites. You will have to fight with them over and over again, every year.<br>
<br>
And inside the city, where development is allowed, urban land
speculators see their sites skyrocket in value. But let's use common
sense -- when people want to build housing or start businesses in a
city, they need the land to be cheap, not expensive. If the land costs
a lot, they will simply have to go to some other city, and build new
housing and new businesses there. The local economy might be choked.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">My point is, the
red light is a great tool against sprawl in some cases, like when you
have a local fight against a WalMart, but it is not a great tool in
other cases.</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">And yet, many
anti-sprawl activists have been trying to win their war using just this
one tool.</span><br>
<br>
That's a recipe for failure! To be successful, you must have more tools
in your toolkit.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So let's talk about the yellow light
now.</span> Yellow light means proceed with caution, proceed at your
own risk.<br>
<br>
If you want to stop sprawl, how about forcing the sprawlers to proceed
at their own risk?<br>
<br>
Right now you and I spend a lot of tax money subsidizing sprawl. We pay
taxes to government, which turns around and builds roads, sewers,
offers tax breaks and all sorts of free goodies to sprawl development.
We cover developers' risks for them.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The yellow light says, just stop
subsidizing sprawl.</span> Stop paying people to make sprawl, and by
that alone you will have taken a huge step to stop it. After all, you
and I know that development only takes place because the developer
expects to make money. If the developer could not count on taxpayer
subsidies for roads, sewers, new schools and so on, would the developer
be as likely to make a profit?<br>
<br>
Those of us who live in areas where the infrastructure is already built
in, like in a city, are paying taxes that help cover the cost of new
developments. To phrase it harshly, the inner-city taxpayers are making
welfare payments to the wealthy suburban developers.<br>
<br>
What if we stopped giving government assistance to suburban developers?
Let's take them off welfare and see if they can survive in a free
market economy!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Here's a perfect example -- If
developers want to build in a flood plain area, make them buy their own
flood insurance. That's just common sense. But today the government
insures them at our expense!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
We have mentioned the red light, and the yellow light. What is the
green light tool against sprawl?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Red means stop, yellow means caution,
green must mean ... Go!</span><br>
<br>
We fight against sprawl, but does that mean we don't want people to
live in decent housing? Does that mean we don't want people to be able
to find jobs? Of course we want jobs and housing.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Well then,
the green light says, if you want to cut down the pressure for sprawl,
help point the way to areas that really need jobs and housing; let's
give urban redevelopment a chance; let's recycle our cities.</span><ul>
  <li>Cities are already paved over; recycle our cities before we pave
over the clean and green countryside.  </li>
  <li>The cities have the infrastructure already; and it is not being
used to anywhere near its full capacity.  </li>
  <li>Cities already have electricity, roads, water and sewer service,
police, fire and emergency medical protection; mass transit, school
buildings.  </li>
  <li>And get this -- Cities want housing and they want jobs. They want
development</li>
  </ul>
<p>So team up with the urban activists, the church groups, the housing
    task forces. They are not enemies, they are your best friends. Join
    with them and instead of just working to block the pressure for
    development, you can work to channel it in a direction where it will
    help the community.<br>
  <br>
  One great specific tactic -- work to cut the city's property tax on
    housing and other buildings, while raising the property tax on land
    value. Same revenue as before. You'll make taxes higher for land
    holders who do not develop in the city, and make lower taxes for those
    who do develop "infill". That simple change in the property tax law can
    turn a city into a magnet for development, and every quarter acre of
    the city that gets recycled, is several acres of countryside preserved.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">To summarize:</span><br>
  <br>
  Sprawl is complex, so you can't expect to fight it with the same tool
    or the same strategy over and over. I can't even serve a piece of cake
    without three tools, so you deserve at least three tools in your
    anti-sprawl toolkit.<br>
  <br>
  Those three tools are the red light, the yellow light, and the green
    light.<br>
  <br>
  Red light means stop the sprawl. Fight it directly, try to ban it.<br>
  Yellow light means stop subsidizing sprawl, stop giving sprawl special
    privileges.<br>
  Green light means encourage recycling of cities, channel sprawl
    pressures into places where they help the community.<br>
  <br>
  Red light, yellow light, green light. Those are your three tools
    against sprawl. I hope that each of you will go forward and try them
    out, and invent additional tools of your own as you go along.<br>
