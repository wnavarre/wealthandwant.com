<p><a name="Introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Both for reasons of social justice and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>The case for site value rating in terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </p>
<p>While there may someday be institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</p>
<p>The case for site value rating in terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</p>
<p>What makes a tax efficient is that the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</p>
<p>Subsequent sections explain in more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit.</p>
<p><a name="Social" id="Social"></a><b>The Social
Justice of Site Value Rating</b></p>
<p>In primitive societies, land is generally regarded as not ownable.
No one made the land, so how can anyone own it? Ownership generally
originates in conquest. In England, titles to land originated in the
claim of William the Conqueror to own all the land because he was
king. He granted to dukes, earls, etc. the right to collect rent from
designated territories in exchange for their promises to fulfill
various obligations to him. In the seventeenth century the nobility
succeeded in removing all of their obligations to the crown, but they
retained their rights to land. A substantial part of the great
inequality in wealth in the United Kingdom can be traced to ancient
patents of nobility that granted rights to collect rent.</p>
<p>One highly visible consequence of allowing land rents to be
privately appropriated is that young people find it nearly impossible
to buy houses. The price of a "house," in the Southeast of Britain at
least, is primarily the price of land. If the rent of land were
collected publicly, the price of land would be inconsequential, and
the price of a house would be the cost of the materials and labour
that went into building it. It should be recognized that if the site
value of land were taxed, the payment of such taxes would make it
more expensive to live in large cities than in small towns, but young
people would be better able to afford it because other taxes would be
reduced, and the mortgages to which people would need to commit
themselves would not be nearly as great.</p>
<p>The justice of collecting the rent of land can be generalized to
the justice of collecting a fee for any privilege that governments
grant to some individuals and not others. The value of the special
privilege for a few that is entailed in planning permission would be
recouped automatically in collecting the rental value of land. A
version of <b>social collection of the value of privilege</b> occurs
in the present government's auctioning of ten-year broadcast
licenses. For the same reason that people are justly required to pay
for broadcast licenses,</p>
<ul>
  <li>individuals who have the exclusive use of
desirable number plates should pay annually for that privilege.  </li>
  <li>Airline companies with exclusive landing rights should pay
annually
what other airlines would be willing to pay for such rights.  </li>
  <li>People
who have fishing rights that are denied to others should pay annually
according to the value of those rights.  </li>
</ul>
The general principle
involved in all of these examples is that whenever a government
grants a right to some and not to others, those who are granted such
rights should pay annually, to the government, the value of those
rights, measured by what others who do not have them would be willing
to pay to have them.
<p>Private appropriation of rent and other privileges makes it
necessary for governments to look elsewhere for revenue, with the
consequence that even persons with very low incomes are required to
turn over part of what little they earn to the state. In justice we
ought to allow everyone, but especially those whose earnings are
lowest, to allocate what they produce as they themselves choose.</p>
<p><b>The three sources of land rent, the gift of nature, public
services and community development, lead logically to the justice of
three distinct taxes on land.</b> The gift of nature is primarily the
agricultural value of land, but also the value of natural resources
and the extra value of land near rivers and harbors that arises
because such land represents good places to put cities whether or not
cities are presently there. This component of the rental value of
land should be collected <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">nationally </span>and
used to support a guaranteed
income for all citizens. The part of land value that arises from
public services is justly the income of the community that provides
those services. When private individuals and firms undertake
activities that raise the rental value of surrounding land, the value
thereby created should justly be awarded to those whose actions
create it.</p>
<p>If site value rating is used only to finance local public services
and to reward private activities that raise the rental value of land,
the resulting reductions in other taxes on commerce and housing can
be expected to raise the rental value of land by enough that land
will retain most of its present sale value, and there will be no
issue of compensating the existing owners of land. On the other hand,
if the full rental value of land is collected through site value
rating, then the sale value of unimproved land will fall to
approximately zero. The sale value of houses will fall to the value
of the houses themselves. Do the owners of land deserve compensation
for these reductions in the market value of their wealth?</p>
<p>First, it should be pointed out that the average taxpayer will pay
the same tax as before, but in a different form. Site value rating
will be substituted for some combination of income taxes, excise
taxes, community charges, property value rates, and other taxes. A
person should not complain about a change in the form of the taxes he
pays if the total is the same. The above argument would be sufficient
if every individual paid the same total tax after the change, but of
course this will not occur. To some extent, increases in the sale
value of capital will offset decreases in the sale value of land.
This occurs because, by a removal of taxes from capital, site value
rating will greatly increase the private returns to capital. This
will generate a massive flow of capital toward any nation or region
that reduces its taxes on capital. But such flows cannot occur
instantaneously, and before they are completed the reductions in
taxes on capital will raise the value of capital. In general, young
persons will benefit more than older persons from a move to site
value rating, because they tend to own less expensive plots of land
if they own land at all, and they have many years ahead of them to
benefit from reduction in other taxes. Those who are yet unborn will
benefit most of all, because their birthrights to equal shares of the
provenance of nature, as well as to the product of their labour, will
be recognized. Net financial losses will tend to be greatest for
older persons. Their houses will fall in sale value. They will be
required to pay annually the rental value of the land on which their
houses sit, without as much in reductions of their income taxes, and
with fewer years ahead of them to reap tax savings. On the other
hand, they will have less concern about providing for their children,
because houses will be much easier for their children to acquire.
Further offsetting any claim to compensation would be any past
unearned profits that potential claimants had made on ownership of
land.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, a claim for compensation would have merit.
If a person had purchased a title to land from the government just
before the introduction of site value rating, that person could
reasonably claim compensation from government action that eliminated
the value of his purchase. Even if a substantial amount of time has
passed, it can be argued that a government should not be permitted to
eliminate by legislation the value of an asset that it has sold. On
this basis, anyone who owned land that was at one time purchased from
the government would have a reasonable claim on a return of the
(inflation adjusted) price for which the land was purchased from the
government. A claim for interest on the purchase price could not be
sustained, however. The use of the land since the time of purchase
offsets the interest that could otherwise be claimed.</p>
<p>What of land that was at one time granted by the crown without
payment for the title, and land that has risen substantially in value
since it was purchased from the government? The government is not
obliged to provide compensation for these losses from general tax
revenues, because the source of these losses is the mistaken belief
that private appropriation of the rent of land can be just. It
cannot. The present generation of taxpayers should not be required to
pay for this mistaken belief on the part of their forbearers. On the
other hand, every person who has sold land in the past has fostered,
to his profit, the mistaken belief that the rent of land can justly
be privately appropriated. On this basis, all past profits from the
sale of land, and all inheritances based on such profits, with
accumulated interest, can be appropriated to provide compensation for
those whose land falls in value to less than they paid for it, upon
introduction of site value rating.</p>
<p>It is possible that the administrative cost of such an undertaking
would be so great as to make it infeasible, while at the same time
its moral justice was recognized. On this basis one can justify a
"capital levy," a one-time charge on all capital in the nation, to
provide compensation for those who lose from the introduction of site
value rating. The justification of the capital levy would be that the
amount of capital that a person owned was the best readily available
indicator of past gains that a person had made from the sale of
land.</p>
<p><b>One activity that is sometimes thought to be unfairly affected
by site value rating is farming. </b>To a substantial extent, this
concern reflects a misperception of the relation between urban and
rural rents. The vast preponderance of land rents are urban. Also, it
is important to remember that the basis of site value rating is the
unimproved value of land. Much of what farmers do increases the value
of land in ways less obvious than buildings. Site value rating of
agricultural land should be applied on the basis of what the rental
value of the land would be in a completely overgrown condition. But
there is an important element of validity in the argument of farmers
that they are treated unfairly by site value rating. When site value
rating is used to finance public services, farmers can justly say
that their land does not benefit from public services in the way that
urban land does. Indeed, it has been said above that public services
should be financed from the increase in land rents above their value
in the absence of economic development. Site value rating of
agricultural land, and of the pre-development value of urban land,
has as its basis the idea that provenance of nature is the common
heritage of all citizens. If we wish only to finance local public
services and to reward activities that increase surrounding land
rents, then the agricultural value of land, and the pre-development
value of urban land should be excluded from the tax base. These
should be taxed only when the nation is prepared to accept, and be
bound by the consequences of, the principle that the provenance of
nature is the common heritage of all citizens.</p>
<p><a name="Efficiency" id="Efficiency"></a><b>The Efficiency of
Site Value Rating</b></p>
<p>Where justice requires that the value generated by land be shared
equally among citizens, efficiency requires that land be managed by
persons, individually or in firms, who receive the benefits and bear
the losses of the management decisions that they make. Thus
efficiency requires secure private titles to land. But secure private
titles are consistent with requiring title holders to pay the rental
value of land to the public treasury on an annual basis. That is,
secure private titles are consistent with site value rating. Site
value rating is economically efficient because it is not, like other
taxes, a public appropriation of a part of what is produced, but
rather social collection of the value in alternative activities of
naturally or socially generated resources that are appropriated by
individuals. Site value is not produced by the owners of sites. It is
what is there before they begin to use sites.</p>
<p>Site value rating embodies the principle that people are allowed
to keep what they produce and must pay annually for the value of the
naturally occurring and socially created resources they use. This
principle can be extended to take account of individual actions that
have noticeable effects on the rental value of land surrounding that
which individuals use themselves. When land is used in such a way as
to raise the rental value of surrounding land, as by providing
parking near a commercial center or by providing improvements that
are beautiful to see, the person who creates that value should
receive it. Correspondingly, when people use land in such a way as to
lower the value of surrounding land, by generating noise, noxious
smells, air pollution, or unsightly views, they should be charged
according to the reduction in the rental value of the surrounding
land that results from their activity. The opportunity to be paid for
adding to the value of surrounding land will generally make land more
valuable. And the requirement to pay for harmful consequences of land
use will tend to inhibit such uses of land.</p>
<p>The whole practice of planning should be replaced by a system of
charges for harmful consequences of land use and payments for
beneficial ones. Planning is motivated by a concern for the harmful
consequences that can result from land development. But the resulting
restriction in land development makes planning permission all the
more valuable to the few who receive it, with the result that vast
fortunes are made by contriving to appear to have, in one's person or
in one's projects, whatever attributes are regarded as attractive by
those who grant planning permission. With so much money at stake, it
is virtually impossible to avoid bias. A recognition of the
impropriety of the large gains from receiving planning permission
leads planning bodies to be ever more strict about granting it, and
the result is ever higher prices of homes, to the detriment of
first-time buyers.</p>
<p>When there are harmful consequences of land development, these are
generally manifest in lower rental values of land near the land that
is developed. The effort that is now devoted to determining whether
to grant planning permission should be spent instead on identifying
the magnitudes of the harmful consequences of development. Then
everyone who wishes to develop land, and everyone who has title to
land that is already developed, should be charged those costs. Those
who have land that is adversely affected by development would be
compensated automatically through the reduction in the rates on their
land.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been alleged that if site value rentals were
taxed, the owners of sites would simply pass the taxes on to the
users of sites. Such assertions generally come from a serious
misunderstanding of economics. An economic understanding of payments
for the use of land presumes that negotiations between owners of land
and potential users, over the terms on which land is to be used, are
conducted on the basis of each side doing as well for itself
financially as its position permits. Owners rent land for the most
they can get, and if one potential user is not prepared to pay what
the land is worth, then the owner will find someone else who is
prepared to pay that much. There are, nevertheless, two ways in which
site value rating could result in higher payments for the use of
land.</p>
<ul>
  <li> One way is that there could be individuals who rent land for
amounts less than what the market will bear. If there are such
individuals, they would be able to raise the rents they charged, to at
least some extent, when they were required to pay site value ratings. </li>
  <li>The second way in which higher payments for the use of land could
come about from site value rating is that if site value rating is
accompanied by reductions in other taxes, as it ought to be, then these
tax reductions would make land more valuable. Where this occurred,
rents paid for the use of land would rise. But this does not constitute
"passing a tax on." There is no guarantee that the amounts by which
rental values would rise would correspond to the site value ratings.
And in any case, if land were taxed according to its full rental value,
all of what owners of land now collect in rents would be collected by
the government.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another objection sometimes raised against site value rating is
that it would make leisure uses of land, such as golf courses,
impossibly expensive. There are two parts to the answer to this
objection. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, people who wish to devote land to golf courses do not
deserve special privileges and the expense of other members of society.
Any person or group that wishes to use land for a golf course should be
free to do so, provided that they are willing to compensate the rest of
society for the smaller amounts of land that will be available to
everyone else because they want a golf course. And the rental value of
the land that is used for the golf course measures what is owed to the
rest of society. </li>
  <li>The second part of the answer is that to the extent that golf
courses raise the value of surrounding land, it qualifies for receipt
of the increase in the rental value of surrounding land that results
from the use of the land as a golf course.</li>
</ul>
<p>The extraction of minerals requires special treatment under site
value rating, because this activity reduces the value of the heritage
of future generations. For mineral deposits that can be expected to
be fully depleted within a few years, the sensible thing to do is to
auction the right to deplete the resource fully, subject to rules
about restoration of the site when extraction is complete. Future
generations should be compensated by investing the proceeds in such a
way that all generations share equally in the value of the extracted
resource.</p>
<p>For deposits that can be expected to last a generation or more,
one must be concerned about whether future generations will be
content with the financial arrangements that are made. For these
cases, it is best to have deposits developed by joint public-private
enterprises, where costs are shared in the same proportions as
benefits, so that future generations cannot complain about their
heritage having been sold for a song.</p>
<p>In the same way that mineral extractions reduce the value of land
for future generations, so can the subdivision of land into small
parcels. Once land has been subdivided, it is extremely expensive, if
it is possible at all, to reassemble it for projects that require
large sites. Reassembly, and the economic growth that it permits, can
be facilitated by a "self-assessed property tax." Under such a tax,
each owner of property is required to specify a price at which he or
she would be willing to sell the property, and anyone who wishes can
buy the property at that price. A person who was required to sell
would be permitted to remove anything he or she wished, so that
compulsory sales would be initiated only by persons or public bodies
that wished to redevelop land. The appropriate tax rate would be a
fraction of a per cent per year, so that people would find it
financially feasible to assess their land a prices that would fully
compensate them for being required to relinquish it.</p>
<p>The general principle that is applied in site value rating is that
everyone pays for the naturally created and publicly created
resources they use. There are a number of ways in which this
principle can be extended. Where driving in crowded cities adds
noticeably to the travel costs of others, there should be charges
corresponding to those costs, provided that the administrative costs
of implementing such a system are not so great as to outweigh the
benefits of resulting improvements in traffic flows. Activities such
as the consumption of alcohol that have socially adverse consequences
should be taxed according to the costs of those consequences. Public
services--gas, electricity, telephone, water, sewerage,
transportation, etc.--whether publicly or privately owned, are best
financed by a combination of charges on users and charges on land.
Each user should be required to pay the addition to costs that
results from serving him or her. The component of costs that is not
covered by such charges on users can be recovered by collecting the
increase in land values that comes from provision of public
services.</p>
<p><a name="How" id="How"></a><b>How Valuations would
be Made</b></p>
<p>Before describing the valuation process, which employs auctions,
it is useful to discuss the concept of a "second-price auction." <b>A
second price auction is one in which each bidder submits a single
sealed bid, and the object is sold to the highest bidder at a price
equal to the second highest bid.</b> Second-price auctions have the
advantage of making bidding simpler and more straight-forward. In an
ordinary sealed-bid auction, in which the highest bidder pays what he
or she bids, bidders are induced to under-bid strategically, not
revealing the full value to them of the auctioned item, so that they
can obtain it at a more advantageous price. This incentive for
strategic underbidding is eliminated by a second-price auction. With
a second price auction, a bidder who bids less than the object is
worth saves no money as long as he or she is the highest bidder, and
if the bid is low enough not to be the highest bid, the object is
lost to another bidder. Nor is over-bidding beneficial. Either it
makes no difference, or it results in the object being bought at a
price of more that it is worth to the bidder. Thus honest statements
of the value of the thing being auctioned are in the self-interest of
bidders in second-price auctions. By a similar line of reasoning,
when a contract is to be let to the lowest bidder, honest statements
of the lowest price at which a party is willing to do the work can be
obtained by letting the contract to the lowest bidder at a price
equal to the second-lowest bid. There are two efficiency advantages
to second-price auctions. Bidders do not have to spend resources
trying to compute their strategically most advantageous bids, and
because bids represent accurate valuations, the winning bidder is the
person who values the object most, or can truly do the work at the
lowest cost. It might seem that the amount received by the seller
would be smaller in a second-price auction. However, the higher bids
that result from removing the incentive for strategic under-bidding
approximately offset the reduced returns from charging only the
second-highest bid.</p>
<p>In the proposed system of site value rating, valuations would be
made by property market professionals, who would be rewarded
according to the accuracy of their valuations, as revealed by
occasional auctions. An administrative agency would divide territory
into blocks of a convenient size and take bids for valuation of all
sites in a block, with the valuation contract going to the lowest
bidder, at a price equal to the second-lowest bid. The valuer would
provide a formula that could be used to compute the value of any site
in the block, taking into account such features as size, proximity to
shops and transportation, width of the street on which the property
was located, and any other objectively measurable attributes that
were thought to be related to site values. The actual payment to the
valuer would be reduced in proportion to the average inaccuracy of
the valuations, as revealed by subsequent auctions of some of the
sites.</p>
<p>When a site was auctioned, it would be under a rule that bids
would represent offers of payment for use for the first year. The
person who obtained the site would have the option of using the site
into the indefinite future, upon payment of future rent, which would
be determined by the results of future auctions of similar sites. The
site would go to the highest bidder, at a price equal to the second
highest bid. An administrative agency would purchase property with
obsolete structures, demolish the structures and auction the vacant
sites to determine the accuracy of the rating formulas.</p>
<p>When those who rated sites included in their formulas proximity to
particular privately owned sites, that would be evidence that the
activities on those sites had positive or negative effects on the
rental value of surrounding sites. The effects of the activities on
those sites could then be computed, and appropriate subsidies or
charged placed on the activities that generated the effects.</p>
<p>A separate valuation process would be used to estimate the value
of all land in the nation in the absence of economic development.
These estimates would be checked by occasional auctions of unimproved
agricultural land far from cities. The results of this process would
be used to implement a redistribution of pre-development rent among
localities, based on the principle that predevelopment rent should be
shared on an equal per capita basis. The implementation would occur
through a clearinghouse, where each locality received a credit equal
to the product of its population and the national per capita
predevelopment rent, and each was debited for the pre-development
rent within its boundaries.</p>
<p><a name="Conclusion"></a><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Site value rating must be the foundation of any system of public
finance that is to be fair and efficient. The virtues of site value
rating come from adherence to the principle that before we consider
