<p>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">EARTH'S GOD</span><br>
  <br>
The Living God stands forth in human birth! <br>
In fearlessness no power His Will can girth<br>
&nbsp; To hasten evolution's toiling way,<br>
Release the millions, paradise the earth!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
MAN'S GOD</span><br>
<br>
When sundered chains release the prisoned mind; <br>
When hearts their secret dungeon Prisoner find<br>
&nbsp; And free! &#8212; 'Tis He; 'tis only He who can<br>
Raze prison walls and fear-bound man unbind!<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SELF RESPECT<br>
<br>
</span>No man is better than I am,<br>
This I affirm, and dare you to prove <br>
That any man<br>
Is better than I am.<br>
<br>
No man is worse than I am, <br>
This I admit<br>
And challenge you to show <br>
A baser man than I am.<br>
<br>
All crimes I have thought <br>
All virtues I have felt.<br>
I am greedy, voluptous, deceitful,<br>
I am generous, true, and courageous.<br>
<br>
We are different shallowly,<br>
Not better or worse underneath.<br>
We are what circumstance makes us,<br>
None is better than I am, and no one worse.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE UNKNOWN<br>
<br>
</span>Life is greater than philosophy,<br>
Than all the schools<br>
And systems of thought,<br>
Than all the logicians<br>
Dead or living.<br>
<br>
I like to think<br>
No child will ever be born<br>
On a day when<br>
All the secrets of nature<br>
Are known<br>
And men can read<br>
All knowledge<br>
In a printed book.<br>
<br>
Such a little universe<br>
Would stifle me<br>
Who find the zest<br>
The urge and the joy Of Life<br>
In the vastness of the Unknown.<br>
<br>
Life is vaster than all<br>
The creeds, doctrines, theologies,<br>
Moralities, religions<br>
And philosophies &#8212;<br>
Than all the saviors,<br>
Saints, gods, sages,<br>
Wise men and fools,<br>
Dead, living,<br>
Or yet to be born.<br>
<br>
Life has had a billion<br>
Times a billion Interpreters<br>
On this little planet alone<br>
And remains &#8212; Unknown!<br>
<br>
Every sentient creature.<br>
Is an interpreter of Life<br>
And everyone interprets<br>
A little differently.<br>
<br>
In this lies not despair<br>
Or even sadness.<br>
In this lurks the lure of Life<br>
And the Why thereof.<br>
<br>
The deeper, truer, bigger <br>
Joys of Life<br>
Accrue from its<br>
Fearless exploration.<br>
<br>
Life would be a prison cell<br>
For the human mind<br>
Shut in by the printed page.<br>
<br>
Every soul brings<br>
New problems to Life &#8212;<br>
Multiplies its wonderful mysteries.<br>
<br>
Life would be a dungeon <br>
To the human soul<br>
Could the printed page <br>
Lessen the vastness <br>
Of the Unknown.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ONLY REVOLUTIONARY</span><br>
Love is the only<br>
Revolutionary.<br>
Not a supine submissive love &#8212;<br>
A bold audacious Love<br>
That dares anything, everything,<br>
Even the loss of Dollars! !<br>
To gain its darling end.<br>
<br>
A Love that lays Profit,<br>
Stocks, bonds and dividends<br>
On the altar of its heart's desire.<br>
Its own stocks, and bonds,<br>
And Profit &#8212;<br>
On the altar of Human Welfare!<br>
<br>
Such a Love there is in life;<br>
Millions of men feel it,<br>
And daily it shapes<br>
The course of their lives &#8212;<br>
Only in little ineffectual ways<br>
Because &#8212;<br>
<br>
Our aimless, thoughtless<br>
Way of land hogging<br>
Denies Love at the base<br>
And beginning of life,<br>
Bringing to naught,<br>
Turning to ashes<br>
<br>
Turning to fear,<br>
To unfaith, cruelty<br>
And self-righteous littleness<br>
All the fruit that ripens<br>
From our fondest, boldest,<br>
Broadest human love<br>
<br>
Where human life begins<br>
We will carry our Love<br>
And end the shameless,<br>
Heartless barter<br>
Of human flesh and soul<br>
For bread or dividends.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">AS TO HATE<br>
<br>
</span>I don't hate the spider that I kill,<br>
But hate the narrow life I lead<br>
In which there isn't room enough<br>
For a spider and myself.<br>
<br>
The soldier doesn't hate the foe he also kills,<br>
Nor the lion hate the lamb he eats,<br>
I will not hate the men whose tenure of the earth<br>
Has pauperized the millions &#8212;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE NATIVITY<br>
<br>
</span>Plead not with heaven's alien Gods to bless <br>
&nbsp; Some Holy Babe and Mother far away.<br>
&nbsp; Be thou thyself the God whose power shall stay <br>
With human sympathy and love's access<br>
Whom never Gods bend earthward to caress &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; The Hungry Babes and Mothers of Today! <br>
&nbsp; Seek thou the Lowly Mothers first, for they<br>
Need most the touch of manhood's tenderness.<br>
<br>
Round every Infant brow an aureole gleams <br>
&nbsp; However starved by Greed's brutality.<br>
The holy Mother in each Mother dreams <br>
&nbsp; Above the Infant cradled on her knee.<br>
Sing: not of ancient Gods and ancient themes &#8212; <br>
&nbsp; All Babes enshrine whatever Gods there be!<br>

    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ONLY DANGER </span><br>
    <br>
  Fear is the World Lust!<br>
&nbsp; Obsessing human life &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Poisoning its springs of desire, <br>
&nbsp; Glooming its sunlight of love, <br>
&nbsp; Trailing its shadows<br>
&nbsp; Over every natural joy that bursts <br>
&nbsp; The heavy bonds of superstition. <br>
&nbsp; Sans Fear life is worth while.<br>
  <br>
  Fear is the Serpent in the Garden! <br>
&nbsp; Fascinating the soul<br>
&nbsp; To weakness and despair, <br>
&nbsp; Drawing the feet<br>
&nbsp; Always in lessening arcs <br>
&nbsp; To the tomb's embrace.<br>
&nbsp; Death were cheated but for Fear.<br>
  <br>
  Fear is the Mother of Sin! <br>
&nbsp; Dashing to the mud<br>
&nbsp; The soul's reach starward; <br>
&nbsp; Defiling the Garden's <br>
&nbsp; Rose-laden air<br>
&nbsp; With stench of the Puritan.<br>
&nbsp; On the warp of Fear is woven <br>
&nbsp; All that swineherds call sin.<br>
  <br>
  Fear dethrones the true God!<br>
&nbsp; Robs man of faith in &#8212; Himself! <br>
&nbsp; Skulking Fear<br>
&nbsp; Of pain, of death, of loss &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Ignoble Fear to stand alone! <br>
&nbsp; Sans Fear of tomorrow<br>
&nbsp; Man will reach his Godhood.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ONLY VIRTUE<br>
  <br>
  </span>That pluck abide with kindness, <br>
  Courage stay with thought,<br>
  Daring and decency be friends, <br>
  Intelligence evade mushiness,<br>
  Sympathy sidestep impotence, <br>
  Love remain virile to the end.<br>
  <br>
  That the strength and the hardness of steel <br>
  In the hour for action<br>
  Come from the deeps of Men <br>
  Who can think and feel!<br>
  <br>
  That brutality, sentimentality, <br>
  Aimlessness, stupidity, froth,<br>
  With cunning, greed and gluttony, <br>
  Be not the sole possessors<br>
  Of manhood's only virtue &#8212;<br>
  Courage!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">TO KEEP THE IDEAL<br>
  <br>
  </span>Have you a love that you would keep?<br>
  Pour it out into a larger love.<br>
  Have you a friendship you would hold?<br>
  Share it with the world.<br>
  Have you an ideal you would not lose? <br>
  Lay it on the Altar to Man.<br>
  <br>
  Nothing is an end in itself.<br>
  Everything is only a means to something else. <br>
  Satiety is the only sin.<br>
  Only what is given can be kept. <br>
  What is hoarded turns to Ashes.<br>
  <br>
  Nothing is stationary.<br>
  Treasure grows or lessens.<br>
  This is true of a love, a friendship, or an ideal.<br>
  To keep it, share it.<br>
  Love is not an end in itself,<br>
  But a means of human growth.<br>
  <br>
  Everything is for use, <br>
  Nothing is "for keeps."<br>
  Things, qualities, thoughts, feelings &#8212;<br>
  The world and its contents<br>
  Tangible and imponderable &#8212;<br>
  Are for the growth of Man.<br>
  <br>
  You have heard this before<br>
  And gushed over it, no doubt.<br>
  Now stop the gush and get it into your system <br>
  Live it! Save your love, <br>
  Hold your friendship, <br>
  Keep your ideal<br>
  By use!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">ANTINOMIES<br>
  <br>
  </span>I will not ask of Life <br>
  More than I am<br>
  Willing to pay for.<br>
  <br>
  I will not seek<br>
  To be drunk and sober<br>
  At the same moment &#8212;<br>
  Drunk of wine, women, thought, music, poetry, of the wild splendors of nature,
  or the beautiful creations of art.<br>
  <br>
  I will not ask of Life <br>
  Joy without effort,<br>
  Health without care,<br>
  Wealth without work,<br>
  The approval of my neighbors <br>
  Without consideration <br>
  For their welfare.<br>
  <br>
  I will not seek in Life<br>
  For the blending of opposites, <br>
  Nor an ultimate God.<br>
  <br>
  I will not expect<br>
  Gluttony without satiety, <br>
  Drink without remorse,<br>
  Excess without lassitude, <br>
  Anger without regret, <br>
  Hate without grief.<br>
  <br>
  I will seek no thornless Rose, <br>
  Nor curse heaven <br>
  At the scratches.<br>
  <br>
  I will seek the essence <br>
  Of the Rose<br>
  And avoid its thorns &#8212;<br>
  When I can.<br>
  <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">A MAN'S PRAYER</span><br>
  <br>
  O distant God<br>
  If Thou art in heaven<br>
  Or anywhere &#8212;<br>
  I don't know.<br>
  Thou hast not revealed <br>
  Thyself to me &#8212;<br>
  Yet hopefully,<br>
  Anxious to miss no point &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  O alien God<br>
  If Thou art outside of man <br>
  Give me power to combat <br>
  The bigotry hate envy<br>
  Of Thy devotees,<br>
  The tortures crimes cruelties <br>
  Perpetrated<br>
  For Thy glory.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE OLD ART</span><br>
  The old art makes man <br>
  The scapegoat<br>
  Of creeds, conventions, moralities, <br>
  Gloats over the soul's efforts <br>
  To disentangle itself<br>
  From artificial codes.<br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE NEW ART </span><br>
  The new art leaves man <br>
  Above moralities,<br>
  And seeks its unities<br>
  In the human struggle <br>
  Out of the web<br>
  Of the exploiter's conventions.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">LIFE LURES </span><br>
  Life lures<br>
  To fresh endeavors. <br>
  Is it only a lure?<br>
  <br>
  Life beckons <br>
  To new adventures. <br>
  Must all fail?<br>
  <br>
  Life reveals<br>
  Higher aspirations. <br>
  Shall none satisfy?<br>
  <br>
  Life shows<br>
  Another peak &#8212;<br>
  Yes, the peaks are endless.<br>
  <br>
  Mountains pile<br>
  On mountains &#8212;<br>
  Still a higher summit.<br>
  <br>
  Life leads<br>
  Upward, upward &#8212;<br>
  If one be unafraid!<br>
  <br>
  Life &#8212; halts<br>
  The climber and says<br>
  Take the crowd along!<br>
  <br>
  What a lonely <br>
  Heaven, with<br>
  Only one soul in it!<br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE BLIND GODDESS</span><br>
  Symbol of a darker age &#8212;<br>
  Hewn by men who feared the gods;<br>
  Nor sensed the Silver Thread<br>
  Nor knew the bond of kinship.<br>
&nbsp; She holds the scales of Shylock<br>
&nbsp; To weigh a pound of human flesh.<br>
  <br>
  Symbol of the Jealous God &#8212;<br>
  Conceived by Envy<br>
  That hoards its own and counts<br>
  The crumbs eaten by another.<br>
&nbsp; Scales weigh only gold and goods,<br>
&nbsp; Scales weigh never motive.<br>
  <br>
  Symbol of the tradesman's age &#8212;<br>
  When things count more than humans<br>
  And children's flesh balances dividends<br>
  And property weighs more than life or hope.<br>
&nbsp; Lust and hate alone are blind.<br>
&nbsp; Love sees with a million eyes.<br>
  <br>
  Symbol of superstition&#8212;<br>
  Born in the night of man's great fear,<br>
  Sponsored by monk and mercenary,<br>
  Dipped in the blood of heretics.<br>
&nbsp; There is no justice without mercy,<br>
&nbsp; Care, thought, understanding, and love.<br>
  <br>
  Symbol of materiality &#8212;<br>
  Chiseled by bound slaves<br>
  To weigh surfaces and appearances;<br>
  Blind &#8212; all blind &#8212; to the Inner God.<br>
&nbsp; Sign of slave and tyrant &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Give us the emblem of Democracy.<br>
  <br>
  Symbol of submission &#8212;<br>
  Fashioned by men afraid to love;<br>
  Denial of man's divinity. Serving<br>
  The ancient Greed and the modern Privilege.<br>
&nbsp; Give us a marble cut by free men.<br>
&nbsp; Give us a symbol with a Soul!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">HUMILITY<br>
  <br>
  </span>Humility is the crowning virtue.<br>
  Dare slaves assume it?<br>
  The attribute of gods, kings, rulers &#8212; even of one who might rule self!<br>
  On the brow of the mighty having power over all. Humility is the brightest jewel
  in the last and<br>
  most resplendent sceptre.<br>
  Dare slaves reach for it?<br>
  <br>
  Humility &#8212; so large a jewel &#8212;<br>
  Would bow the head of God Almighty<br>
  So he could see the chains of slaves <br>
  And strike them off.<br>
  By this sign ye shall know the True God &#8212;<br>
  That having all power he ask nothing <br>
  And raise all men to his stature!<br>
  <br>
  Humility never graced the life of slave or underling:<br>
  Servility bows them.<br>
  Subaltern and slave whose breasts burnt not<br>
  With hot flames of unceasing Rebellion &#8212;<br>
  Who patiently wait, submit, and argue<br>
  While children toil and women starve <br>
  Amid plenty &#8212;<br>
  Know not humility, but Cowardice!<br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">WANTED &#8212; MEN</span><br>
  <br>
  Wanted &#8212; Men!<br>
  Able-bodied men,<br>
  Bold-hearted men,<br>
  To enlist in a holy war<br>
  Against poverty.<br>
  <br>
  Wanted &#8212; Men!<br>
  To fight for<br>
  Women and children<br>
  As bravely as<br>
  For kings and queens.<br>
  <br>
  Wanted &#8212; Men! A million men<br>
  To brave death and torture <br>
  Gallows and prisons &#8212;<br>
  To dethrone Privilege.<br>
  <br>
  Wanted &#8212; Men!<br>
  To dare as much for human beings in America<br>
  As for property "rights"<br>
  In Europe.<br>
  <br>
  Wanted &#8212; Men!<br>
  To wrest from<br>
  Greed and monopoly<br>
  The unused land of America &#8212;<br>
  Men unafraid.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">NO MAN'S KEEPER</span><br>
  I am no man's keeper. No jail keys<br>
  Rattle in my head <br>
  Or heart.<br>
  <br>
  If I am not<br>
  My brother's helper <br>
  When I may be<br>
  The loss is equally my own.<br>
  <br>
  I will keep no one &#8212;<br>
  His conscience <br>
  His judgment<br>
  Or his earnings.<br>
  <br>
  Keepers bring jails <br>
  And gallows.<br>
  Keepers are tyrants <br>
  In hate or in love.<br>
  <br>
  Not your way, but mine <br>
  Would I go &#8212; kindly.<br>
  The soul hungers most <br>
  For Self expression.<br>
  <br>
  The urge of life<br>
  Is to Individual difference.<br>
  Keepers, in love or hate, <br>
  Make the discord &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  Sad confusion of thought <br>
  That harbors the exploiter! <br>
  Man is his brother's helper, <br>
  Not his keeper.<br>
  <br>
  To help is love's way: <br>
  Anon to bind a wound; <br>
  Usually not to rob<br>
  And never to hinder.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THAT I MAY STRIVE</span><br>
  That I may die in strife <br>
  'Gainst slavery!<br>
  Teeth set, hands clenched <br>
  To every static bond <br>
  In christendom.<br>
  <br>
  That death find me<br>
  Far out from the ranks,<br>
  Strike quick<br>
  And fell me face forward,<br>
  Hating all that limits man.<br>
  <br>
  Life's joy is its strife,<br>
  The battle 'gainst odds<br>
  Its oil, its wine, and its bread:<br>
  O! to fall under fire<br>
  And escape a smug death in bed!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">A NEW VALOR<br>
  <br>
  </span>A new valor stirs the blood Of Men.<br>
  They shall despoil<br>
  The strong, the rich, the mighty, <br>
  Whoever hath overmuch <br>
  Where many starve.<br>
  Boldly, with conscious dignity<br>
  Men shall rob the over-rich.<br>
  <br>
  It is taught that<br>
  Love shall be slavish <br>
  And kindness meek. <br>
  On this is founded<br>
  The christian cruelties. <br>
  But the new valor<br>
  Brings power to Love, <br>
  And daring to kindness.<br>
  <br>
  The old valor saith<br>
  That from those who have not <br>
  Shall be taken<br>
  And to those who have <br>
  Shall be given more.<br>
  Thus do the christians<br>
  As told in their books &#8212;<br>
  The creed of cravens.<br>
  <br>
  Thus is it written in ink &#8212;<br>
  By long-dead hands <br>
  Palsied with fear, <br>
  In tomes rotten<br>
  Of the centuries' dust.<br>
  The moving Finger writes<br>
  In blood<br>
  From the heart of Men.<br>
  <br>
  And it says:<br>
  Kindness shall be <br>
  Bolder than hate!<br>
  It stirs a new valor <br>
  In men unafraid<br>
  Who shall despoil the rich <br>
  And unseat Profit<br>
  That all may have enough.<br>
  <br>
  The new valor stirs <br>
  To action!<br>
  The weak, the ignorant <br>
  Shall not be robbed <br>
  By the cunning.<br>
  Kindness shall thunder <br>
  To lust: You alone <br>
  Shall be robbed.<br>
  <br>
  And the voice will <br>
  Be heard!<br>
  The lowly and the poor <br>
  Shall not be coddled &#8212;<br>
  Thus do the christians <br>
  In charity &#8212;<br>
  But hear ye the<br>
  Thunder of Kindness:<br>
  They shall not be robbed!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">HATE IS FORCE<br>
  <br>
  </span>Hate is a strong force.<br>
  I will hate the chains of men &#8212;<br>
  The institutions, superstitions, <br>
  And conditions that bind them.<br>
  <br>
  A good hater is a strong man &#8212;<br>
  But I will not hate myself,<br>
  Which is part of all other selves. <br>
  I will hate things, not men.<br>
  <br>
  I will hate gods, creeds, states, <br>
  And all that belittles Man. <br>
  I will hate words and ideas <br>
  That enslave men.<br>
  <br>
  Who hate men have little hate <br>
  For the chains that bind them, <br>
  And little force or care <br>
  To break the chains <br>
  At whatever cost.<br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">BE STRONG FIRST<br>
  <br>
  </span>Masters teach their slaves <br>
  To "turn the other cheek" <br>
  When they are beaten. <br>
  But the new valor<br>
  Will brook no blow.<br>
  <br>
  Masters teach their slaves <br>
  To be long-suffering <br>
  Under oppression. <br>
  But the new valor<br>
  Will slay the oppressor.<br>
  <br>
  Masters teach their slaves <br>
  Be good, be moral, <br>
  And you shall have<br>
  First choice of the crumbs <br>
  From our table.<br>
  <br>
  But the new valor says <br>
  Be strong, be bold,<br>
  And rout your masters &#8212;<br>
  Only strength is good, <br>
  And weakness sin.<br>
  <br>
  Only strength can win. <br>
  Be strong first!<br>
  Life and the world <br>
  And all their good <br>
  Are for the strong.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE NEW POWER</span><br>
  <br>
  O then to Think<br>
  Means not to Feel?<br>
  The Head must not<br>
  Take counsel of the Heart?<br>
  Thus teach the christians.<br>
  <br>
  Thought in one tank,<br>
  Feeling in another &#8212;<br>
  Ce n'est pas comme il faut<br>
  To mingle thought and feeling<br>
  In a single act.<br>
  <br>
  So do the christians.<br>
  But a new light flashes<br>
  To pierce the christian gloom &#8212;<br>
  A wondrous birth &#8212;<br>
  From the union<br>
  Of Head and Heart.<br>
  <br>
  Lo, the Intellect<br>
  And the Soul are wed!<br>
  Coward Words go tumbling<br>
  To the ash heap,<br>
  And Deeds accomplish!<br>
  <br>
  The new birth is Sympathy.<br>
  Froth of easy sentiment<br>
  And cruelty of intellect<br>
  It banishes: the child <br>
  Of the fusion leads!<br>
  <br>
  The bank wants human feeling, <br>
  Religion's lack is thought.<br>
  The market-place needs poetry.<br>
  Art needs sense and depth and care. <br>
  Slavery lurks in aimlessness!<br>
  <br>
  Lo, the Heart and Head <br>
  Are wedded! <br>
  Come &#8212;<br>
  To Greed a bolder foe,<br>
  To Love a deeper meaning,<br>
  To the Many, at last, Power!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LOVE OF GOLD OR THE LOVE OF MAN<br>
  <br>
  </span>I never knew a man<br>
  Who feared not the alien God<br>
  Nor loved him, but was the kinder<br>
  To his neighbor <br>
  And had a fine, firm<br>
  Faith in Men.<br>
  <br>
  I never knew a thief<br>
  Or forger but feared an alien God <br>
  And loved him &#8212;<br>
  A sneak, a pimp, or<br>
  A detective, but confessed<br>
  A distant God and feared him.<br>
  <br>
  Maybe<br>
  (Tho I have not met one)<br>
  An "atheist" could also <br>
  Be cold and vicious,<br>
  But the million babes in arms <br>
  And playful children'<br>
  Are starved and tortured<br>
  In the name of a heavenly <br>
  God and Jesus.<br>
  <br>
  In the love of the alien God <br>
  Lies the hate of man <br>
  And full extenuation<br>
  For all the bloody murder<br>
  The weeping, christian world <br>
  Has ever seen.<br>
  <br>
  The "love of God"<br>
  Means the love of Gold<br>
  And ever has, by far and large, <br>
  And ever must.<br>
  The "love of God';<br>
  Brings the love of Gold.<br>
  <br>
  For man cannot<br>
  Love an Abstraction.<br>
  The human heart impinges<br>
  Seeks the Tangible.<br>
  <br>
  In God the heart is cheated, <br>
  And the cheated heart <br>
  Turns to Gold.<br>
  <br>
  I announce a new faith, <br>
  A new hope,<br>
  A new religion<br>
  (Older than the hills) &#8212;<br>
  The love of Men!<br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">HATE GODS, LOVE MEN </span><br>
  <br>
  Ye are taught to love gods &#8212;<br>
  The creed of slaves.<br>
  Ye shall be masters of self<br>
  And of none other than self, <br>
  When ye shall cease to<br>
  Love any god and center<br>
  Hope and thought and love <br>
  And interest on Man.<br>
  <br>
  Ye are taught to fear gods &#8212;<br>
  Dogmas of cowardice.<br>
  Those who fear neither <br>
  God nor Satan<br>
  Are your masters and exploiters. <br>
  Ye shall fear nothing. <br>
  Ye shall cease to fear <br>
  And dare all.<br>
  <br>
  Ye shall find Self<br>
  Each man himself &#8212;<br>
  When all gods under all aliases <br>
  Shall be dethroned.<br>
  Not law, evolution, the state, <br>
  Prosperity, posterity,<br>
  Progress, or providence &#8212;<br>
  But Man (each to himself) <br>
  Shall be first. <br>
  <br>
  Ye shall hate gods and love Men. <br>
  Ye shall love even Self<br>
  And seek self-interest first; <br>
  Not behind lying cant <br>
  As do the christians,<br>
  But openly and with<br>
  Much pains to discover<br>
  The real interests of Self.<br>
  <br>
  Ye shall know Self <br>
  The true Self<br>
  The whole Self<br>
  The body, mind, and soul<br>
  Of self &#8212; when gods are forgotten <br>
  And care and thought <br>
  Are centered On Man!<br>
  <br>
  In the love of gods<br>
  Lies the hate of Man,<br>
  For none serves two masters. <br>
  The hate of Man<br>
  Breeds the needless grief <br>
  And pain unutterable <br>
  Of christendom &#8212;<br>
  Hate gods and love Men.<br>
  <br>
  In the fear of gods<br>
  Lie sin and weakness. <br>
  Here is true valor:<br>
  That ye fear not the Unknown. <br>
  Fearless of which ye shall be <br>
  Strong for the tortures <br>
  And prisons of Greed<br>
  And attain &#8212; Comradeship.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE MASTER MOTIVE<br>
  <br>
  </span>Superficial appeals to the human crowd <br>
  Its pocket-book and its cupidity<br>
  Its business interests, personal advantage, <br>
  Will bring superficial results<br>
  A million of which multiplied by a million <br>
  Will not produce a profundity &#8212;<br>
  Nor a tangible inch of freedom.<br>
  <br>
  Human freedom is the profoundest thing <br>
  The heart and mind can reach<br>
  Or has any decent right to try to reach <br>
  While human lives are wrecked by Greed <br>
  Every day and hour before our eyes &#8212;<br>
  While the mortality and destitution of Profit <br>
  Exceeds the death roll of the world war.<br>
  <br>
  When the primal passions<br>
  Are stirred the mass will Act, <br>
  Unitedly and spontaneously<br>
  To compass great and vital issues <br>
  For good or for ill<br>
  For construction or destruction<br>
  For Death or for Life!<br>
  So moves the human mass<br>
  So is it moved toward the Ideal<br>
  By the inextinguishable human Urge<br>
  For Something &#8212; something Better<br>
  Than the personal end &#8212;<br>
  It knows not what <br>
  But is spurred ever by the Ideal.<br>
  <br>
  So is the human mass.&nbsp; <br>
  Would you moved it<br>
  To its own unfoldment &#8212;<br>
  From the damned death psychology<br>
  Of Profits' world war?<br>
  Touch its heart.<br>
  <br>
  The greatest, strongest, deepest<br>
  Primal instinct of every being<br>
  The "master motive of human action"<br>
  The "force of forces"<br>
  That alone can reach freedom<br>
  Is the impulse of expansion &#8212;<br>
  We call it Love.<br>
  <br>
  Not the servile patient<br>
  Slave "love" of christian theology. <br>
  By that rules the Exploiter.<br>
  The deep unfearing audacious Love <br>
  That sees the Goal alone<br>
  Leaps the chasm blindly<br>
  Fells like fire the Foe.<br>
  <br>
  Nothing less will break the war spell<br>
  Or stem the wave of slaughter<br>
  For greed of wealth,<br>
  Or turn the mass thought<br>
  From Death machines<br>
  To welfare &#8212;<br>
  To life and hope and growth.<br>
  <br>
  Nothing less will gain <br>
  An inch of human freedom<br>
  Or strike the chains from wage slaves<br>
  Or turn the children<br>
  And the nursing mothers from the alleys<br>
  To a free and open earth.<br>
  Nothing less!<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
  THE STATE</span><br>
  <br>
  The strength of the State<br>
  Is the weakness of the People &#8212;<br>
  Its wealth is their poverty<br>
  Its dignity is their degradation.<br>
  <br>
  Mighty State &#8212;<br>
  Little Manhood!<br>
  Rome reared its splendor<br>
  On sixty million slaves.<br>
  <br>
  The pomp of the State <br>
  Is the servility of the People &#8212;<br>
  Its pride is their shame<br>
  Its glitter is their gloom.<br>
  <br>
  The State is a superstition,<br>
  Heartless, bloodless, beingless<br>
  Save as it draws sustenance<br>
  From living creatures.<br>
  <br>
  The palaces of the State<br>
  Are the hovels, the slums, <br>
  And the mortgaged homes<br>
  Of the People.<br>
  <br>
  The richest State<br>
  Means the poorest People<br>
  And the greatest cruelty<br>
  Of the few to the many.</p>
