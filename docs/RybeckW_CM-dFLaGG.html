<hr> <font size="+0"> </font>
<p><font size="+0">Calling
for "a modern equivalent of Jubilee," signers of a proposal
fundamentally to revise the property tax structure petitioned the
endorsement of the 1984 General Conference of the United Methodist
Church. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The proposal, which the
conference did endorse, sought to shift
taxes from labor to land values. Combining good biblical theology with
public policy insight, the plan offers a simple but critical tax change
as a way of dealing with "poverty, joblessness, slums, urban decay,
farmland destruction, the erosion of public services and facilities and
social justice."</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+0">The current property tax combines land and building
taxes; recently, it has become a tax mostly on buildings. As a result,
owner-made building improvements are overtaxed, while land is
under-taxed. And <span style="font-weight: bold;">undertaxing land
encourages its disuse</span>. The Methodist
petitioners&#8217; simple proposal was to tax land, not buildings. The
possibilities are great for achieving social justice through this
easily implemented change in the property tax.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">These Methodists were echoing early Americans who
had the Liberty Bell inscribed to read: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"Proclaim liberty throughout all
the land unto all the inhabitants thereof</span>," quoting Leviticus
25:10
which proclaims the Jubilee year. Every 50th year -- the Jubilee year
-- the Jewish people were to return the land to the original owners&#8217;
heirs.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biblical justice in
this instance, as Walter
Brueggemann asserts, "is to sort out what belongs to whom, and return
it to them."</span> That is the focus of the Old Testament&#8217;s Jubilee
proclamation, a policy designed to reduce the excesses of greed and to
avoid splitting society into landed and landless factions. The
Methodists&#8217; proposal is an example of the type of plan needed to
address the inequities that characterize use and ownership of the land.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">The generally held belief that ours is a nation of
small landholders is a myth. According to Gene Wunderlich, quoted in a
1979 <i>Harper&#8217;s </i>article,<span style="font-weight: bold;">
"about 3 percent of the population owns 55 percent of all American
land." And that same 3 per cent holds "95 percent of the private land."</span>
Furthermore, while 64 per cent of families own or are in the process of
buying their residences, the residential sector occupies only 2 per
cent of the 1.3 billion acres of privately held land.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">Feudalism, it seems, is still with us; its new face
is the landlordism that lets a few benefit from what belongs to
society. This lopsided arrangement denies the Bible&#8217;s insistence that
an equitable share of the Lord&#8217;s resources is the birthright of all
humans. While the U.S. is infinitely better off than the countries of
Latin America, Asia and Africa, our situation is worsening. Consider
these facts:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+0"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226; Poor people pay inordinate rents. </span>While
in 1970,
25 per cent of income generally went for rent, today, according to
National Low-Income Housing Coalition reports, that percentage for many
renters, especially the poor, has doubled.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+0">Early in the century,
poor immigrants in New York
City could buy or lease a shop with a fair chance of prospering. Now
many minorities face site costs that almost doom new businesses from
the start. A front foot costs more than the whole lot would have 70
years ago, a startling change even when considering inflation.</font></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+0">&#8226;Large
firms are deserting the cities for cheaper suburban sites, taking with
them employment and badly needed tax revenues.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+0"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226;Large agribusinesses represent only 13 per
cent of
U.S. farms but take in 72 per cent of agricultural sales</span>,
according to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Economic Research Service. At the
other end of the scale, 50 per cent of the farms account for only 3 per
cent of sales.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+0"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226; Land-holding is gaining ascendancy over
land-using.</span> Land speculation -- holding land for its future
worth
rather than putting it into current production -- has become standard
practice for the affluent.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0"><i><span style="font-weight: bold;">What gives value
to land.</span> </i>Any
real estate textbook will explain that the three factors for
determining land value are "location, location and location." And any
property owner will affirm this truth. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But
what generates locational
value? Three phenomena: God, people and public activities.</span></font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="+0">God the creator, Genesis tells us, "looked at
everything he had made, and he found it very good." We recognize this
goodness in the fertility of the soil, natural harbors, scenic beauty,
the availability of water, and the subsurface riches of coal, oil,
gold, iron and other substances. The land has a God-given goodness and
is one of the gifts through which God sustains us.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+0">People create land values simply because they are
social beings, consumers and producers. The more people concentrated on
a piece of land, the higher its value. The press of population
intensifies the demand for homes, jobs and services; this is what makes
Manhattan far more valuable than downtown Richmond, Virginia, and
Richmond more valuable than Anderson, Indiana, and Anderson more
valuable than an uninhabited Utah crossroad.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+0">Finally, the public or government generates land
values by providing streets, schools, police protection and other
infrastructures. Opening a subway system for the District of Columbia
in 1976 gave Washington&#8217;s blighted downtown a new lease on life. The
subway and its riders are stimulating the economy along all of its
corridors. According to a 1981 congressional study, "a minimum of $2
billion in land values has already been added to the existing land
value base." However, it concluded that "only a trickle" of these new
values finds its way back to local government through the property tax.
The biggest share goes to people "lucky enough to own land within easy
access of Metro stations." </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+0"><i style="font-weight: bold;">Private vs. common
property. </i>We
utterly misunderstand the land issue unless we acknowledge the
distinction between the value of the land itself and the value of labor
on the land. The institution of private property has a sound foundation
-- the proposition that people have a right to the fruits of their
labor; that is, to the output of their mental and physical efforts. We
are not questioning the legitimacy of earnings that landholders or
others derive from buildings or production on the land. People who
build homes, factories or offices, or who produce various types of
goods and services, have a solid ethical claim to what they have
created. However, the land itself, as our biblical forbears realized,
does not meet this criterion. "<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Andelson_TEITL.html">The earth
is the Lord&#8217;s and the fullness
thereof</a>" (Ps. 24:1).</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">God&#8217;s gift of the land does not confer absolute
ownership. We are free to use it, enjoy it and benefit from it, but God
retains ownership. We serve as God&#8217;s caretakers, or tenants, on the
land. Jefferson recognized this gift, saying that land belonged in
usufruct -- in trust -- to the living. Sir William Blackstone, the
preeminent authority on English law, wrote in his <i>Commentaries: </i>"The
earth and all things therein are the general property of all mankind,
from the gift of the creator."</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">This idea of the land belonging to all humanity, to
the community as a whole, is not entirely inoperative today. National
parks, school grounds, public building sites, many wilderness areas,
lakes and ocean fronts are recognized as the common property of all.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0"><i><span style="font-weight: bold;">The immorality
of landlordism.</span> </i>An
increasingly small elite is taking possession of the nation&#8217;s land,
enabling them to squeeze more and more from the landless. This is
runaway landlordism, and current public policy fuels its progress.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">On the federal level, while the wages of ordinary
workers find no shelter from the Internal Revenue Service, exemptions
and special preferences for landowners whittle down their taxes or turn
real estate losses into profits. The 1986 Tax Reform Act aims to reduce
these privileges, but landowners&#8217; past ingenuity in avoiding taxation
warrants continued vigilance over tax structures. At the local level,
the property tax rises for owners who build or improve their homes,
rental apartments or commercial buildings, while it is reduced for
those who let their land go fallow. Compare the following situation of
the Joneses, the Smiths and the Greens.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="+0"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Joneses have
a well-maintained home. </span>The local
tax office, seeing that they have has added air conditioning, a
recreation room and a new roof, raises their assessment. Never mind
that the Joneses improved their neighborhood and generated jobs and
business. The result will be higher taxes not only this year, but as
long as they keep the house in good condition.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+0"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Smiths&#8217; home
of the same size and age is an
eyesore. </span>The yard is full of junk, gutters are rusted, screens
are
torn, paint is peeling. The tax office says it is worth less than last
year. The Smiths&#8217; taxes are reduced, a "reward" for blighting the
community.</font></li>
  <li><font size="+0"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Greens do
not use their lot at all. </span>They offer
no production or housing on it. For wasting the site&#8217;s potential, they
enjoy the lowest tax bill of the three.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="+0">Overtaxing good land use while under-taxing blight
and empty lots invites slumlords and encourages land speculators. This
type of landlordism -- or modern feudalism -- is an injustice. It
allows individual landowners to siphon off the lion&#8217;s share of land
values.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0"><i style="font-weight: bold;">The ethical
foundations of land value taxation. </i>The
biblical Jubilee prescription -- redividing the land every half century
-- may have been feasible for a people practicing crude agriculture.
However, a modern civilization cannot reshuffle the land without
confiscating unmovable property or discouraging economic progress. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
land value plan suggested here -- increasing land taxes, while
decreasing taxes on labor, production and buildings -- achieves the
same Jubilee goal without negative effects. It lets everyone share the
economic value of the land rather than the land itself, just as a
corporation, instead of carving up physical portions of itself each
year, lets shareholders enjoy portions of the profit.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="+0">The proposed change in the property tax would enable
the community to recapture community-created land values. Those who
hold land retain undisturbed possession of it so long as they pay back
their fair share of land tax to the community each year. Those with
prized sites pay most; holders of poor locations pay least.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">Society suffers a loss when speculators hold highly
productive sites out of use. A land value tax usually persuades owners
to use land or to sell it to others who wish to do so. If not, the
higher tax compensates society for the land privileges it grants. This
approach permits the elimination or major reduction of other taxes that
weigh too heavily on wages, while it contributes to increases in local
productivity.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">Seven Pennsylvania cities have independently
increased tax rates on land while imposing much lower tax rates on
buildings. Scranton, with a population of 87,000, has had a modest
two-rate tax for 70 years. When federal funding was cut in 1980, it
raised the tax rate on land to four times that on buildings. In the
next two years, the value of private construction in Scranton rose 22
per cent. In contrast, Wilkes-Barre, 18 miles away, kept its old tax
system, and construction dropped 44 per cent during the same period. </font></p>
<p><font size="+0">Strapped for funds in 1974, Harrisburg twice dropped
tax rates on buildings and twice increased rates on land. Almost every
homeowner got a tax break. McKeesport adopted the two-rate tax in 1980,
raising revenues 50 per cent and getting the town out of debt. More
remarkably, building investment rose 36 per cent, while falling 14 per
cent in neighboring Duquesne and more than twice that in nearby
Clairton. Since then, Duquesne, along with New Castle and Washington,
has adopted a two-rate tax. </font></p>
<p><font size="+0">The largest American city using the two-rate tax is
Pittsburgh. After the city raised its land-tax rate to four times its
building-tax rate in 1979, new construction rose a healthy 14 per cent.
In 1980, the land-tax rate rose to five times the building rate, and
the value of construction shot up 212 per cent. When in 1982 the city
widened the gap to six times the building rate, the value of new
building permits rose 600 per cent.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">In all these cities, despite a national recession
and a severe steel crisis in their region, changes in the property tax
structure produced results that were nothing short of startling. As
detailed in a <i>Fortune </i>article ("Higher Taxes That Promote
Development," August 8, 1983), housing and downtown buildings
increased in numbers and dollar value. Homeowners enjoyed tax
reductions, and housing costs were kept low. New construction jobs
eased losses in the industrial sector.</font></p>
<p><font size="+0">Poverty, joblessness and homelessness have been
central concerns of religious social-action groups. There is a growing
awareness that neither private nor public charity is sufficient in
dealing with these problems. Shifting property taxes offers an
effective way to encourage public policy to be responsive to blighted
cities, farm dislocation, declining industries, chronic unemployment
and growing poverty. The need to infuse biblical principles into
solutions for these problems seems imperative. Acknowledgment of this
necessity is already evident in the Catholic bishops&#8217; pastoral letter
on the economy and parallel works by the Presbyterians, United
Methodists and the United Church of Christ. The need to address
poverty&#8217;s basic causes, including the unhealthy concentration of
America&#8217;s land and resources in the hands of so few owners -- who have
tended to misappropriate land values -- ought to be high on our
religious and public policy agendas.</font></p>
