<p>    Tax reform proposals, not surprisingly, are popular among voters and
    the politicians who represent them. President George W. Bush created an
    advisory panel on tax reform. Some economists and institutes have
    proposed reforms to flatten and simplify the income tax, or to replace
    it entirely with a national sales or consumption tax or value-added
    tax. <br>
    <br>
    These would be an improvement, but if we seek to reform taxes, we
    should consider all the possibilities and choose, as <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Milton
    Friedman</a>    puts it, the &#8220;least bad&#8221; tax. <br>
    <br>
    Even a relatively flat income tax imposes what economists call a &#8220;deadweight loss&#8221; or &#8220;excess burden&#8221; on
    society. Taxes on productive activity increase the price of labor or goods
    beyond economic costs,
    and so reduce the quantity provided. This reduction in production,
    income, and investment is a misallocation of resources. Resources are
    wasted because they do not go to where they are most wanted. We can
    reduce this excess burden by reducing taxes, but changing the type of
    tax can also reduce this deadweight loss. Economists recognize that if
    we tap for public revenue a resource whose quantity is fixed, the
    excess burden disappears. The tax does not reduce the supply and does
    not increase prices.</p>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
economist Henry George </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">analyzed taxing land value and </span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">untaxing labor and capital </span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">in his book, </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">.</span><br>
</div>
This might seem too good to be true, but in fact, such a resource
exists everywhere and is indispensable for human action. That resource
is land. The supply is fixed, immobile, and inherently visible. If land
value is taxed, the land will not flee, shrink, or hide. A tax on land
value has no deadweight loss. If the purpose of tax reform is to reduce
the extra costs imposed on the economy, a tax on land value does this
far better than any tax on income or goods.<br>
<br>
If you currently pay property taxes on a home or business, you may be
shaking your head at this point. You are not eager to read about a
proposal that would make your taxes even more onerous. But the proposal
here is not to increase taxes but to <span style="font-style: italic;">shift
and reduce</span> taxation. Unless you own a valuable vacant lot, the
proposal presented below would most likely <span
 style="font-style: italic;">reduce </span>your total tax bill, since
if fully implemented it abolishes taxes on your earnings and spending,
and it also eliminates the portion of real property taxes that falls on
buildings and other improvements.<br>
<br>
The tax reform presented here is not new. It has been working to some
degree in many cities and countries around the world. The idea probably
obtained its greatest popularity in the U.S. in the late 1800s, when
the economist Henry George analyzed taxing land value and untaxing
labor and capital in his book, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>.<br>
<br>
Many economists have since then expanded on George&#8217;s writing, examining
both the theory and the evidence. There is even a &#8220;Henry George
Theorem,&#8221; which proves that in a community with optimal population, the
land rent equals the value of the community&#8217;s public goods. Modern
economics thus affirms George&#8217;s theory in a more comprehensive and more
rigorous form, although the empirical question of how much revenue
could be obtained from rent would benefit from more research.<br>
<br>
An advance on George made by Spencer Heath, Spencer MacCallum, myself,
and others has been to apply the economic concept of rent-based public
revenue to private communities, showing that proprietary communities
such as hotels, as well as associations such as condominiums, in effect
use site rentals for their revenue, with the implication that most
government programs could be shifted to private communities, where the
rentals would be collected by contract. Examining this application
would take us away from the focus of tax reform and the analysis of
land rent for government revenue, but it is useful to point out that
economic actors in a competitive market use rentals to pay for public
goods because that is most efficient.<br>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
&#8220;least bad&#8221; tax policy is one that <br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">does not violate a citizen&#8217;s

<p>The use of land value or land rent for public revenue thus has
          proponents today, but their voices have not been widely heard in the
          debate over tax reform, and there are also opponents. The purpose of
          this report is to give greater voice to land value taxation and to
          better inform those interested in tax reform about this alternative. We
          can best judge among options when we consider the whole range of

the Least-Bad Tax Policy</span><br>
<br>
Taxes, while ostensibly payments made for the services of government,
are quite unlike payments made in the marketplace. The prominent
libertarian economist Murray Rothbard was among those who emphasized
taxation as a &#8220;coerced exchange,&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> in
that few would freely choose to pay taxes if not for the penalties
imposed on those who refuse to do so. But taxes are also different from
market prices in that the tax usually has no relation to any specific
benefit. Income and spending are taxed because of &#8220;ability to pay,&#8221;
meaning there is a flow of funds from which money can be siphoned, to
put it politely.<br>
<br>
In contrast, user fees (truly voluntary fees, not excise taxes
disguised as fees) are somewhat like market prices, as the user pays
for a specific and wanted benefit, such as entrance to a park. Land
value taxation, too, is based on the benefit principle and on market
prices. A landowner receives extra land value or land rental from the
government infrastructure, security, schooling, transit, fire
protection, and so on. Land rent, priced by the market, reflects the
neighborhood amenities.<br>
<br>
What qualities make for the best (or least-bad) tax system? Public
finance economists identify simplicity, efficiency, fairness, and
revenue sufficiency as the proper objectives of tax policy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> In his
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Wealth of Nations</span>,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5</span></small> Adam
Smith identified equality, certainty (clear manner and quantity),
convenience, and economy in collection. Transparency is also an
important criterion; visible taxes are better than hidden taxes.<br>
<br>
In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and
Poverty</span> (1879), his most important book, Henry George contended
the ideal tax would most closely conform to the following conditions,
similar to those of Smith:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. That the tax bears as lightly as
possible upon production, minimizing the excess burden or deadweight
loss.<br>
2. That the revenues be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as
directly as may be upon the ultimate payers  &#8212;  so as to take from the
people as little as possible in addition to what it yields the
government.<br>
3. That it be certain and visible, so as to give the least opportunity
for tyranny or corruption on the part of officials, and the least
temptation to lawbreaking and evasion on the part of the taxpayers.<br>
4. That it be equitable, giving no citizen an arbitrary advantage or
privilege, and in being consistent with moral principles.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6</span></small></div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
two things most people want from</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

</div>
The two things most people want from the economy and from public
revenue are efficiency and equity. As to efficiency, as the
world-famous free-market economist <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a> stated, &#8220;the least
bad tax is the property tax on the unimproved value of land, the Henry
George argument of many, many years ago.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small> We
will see how Friedman is right, why land value taxation best fits the
criteria of Smith and George and modern economics.<br>

<br>
&#8220;Land,&#8221; in the language of economics, includes all natural resources:
the three-dimensional space on the surface of the Earth (including
space in and on water); material land such as minerals, water, and oil;
the electromagnetic spectrum; wildlife (including wild animals and
forests); and satellite orbits.<br style="font-style: italic;">
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
&#8220;economic rent&#8221; ... refers to the</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">maximum that a tenant would bid for</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">the use of the site.</span><br>
</div>
The most important potential source of public revenue from land is real
estate sites. The income from land has been called &#8220;ground rent,&#8221;
&#8220;economic rent,&#8221; or just &#8220;rent.&#8221; The term &#8220;rent&#8221; here will refer to the
income only from the land, excluding what is paid for the use of the
improvements. The &#8220;economic rent&#8221; with respect to land refers to the
maximum that a tenant would bid for the use of the site. I have called
this &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">geo-rent</span>&#8221;
to differentiate it from &#8220;rent&#8221; as a payment for any resource or from
the actual amount a tenant may pay, which could be less than what the
market could bear.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">8</span></small><br>
<br>
Land value taxation taps the geo-rent. Like today&#8217;s real property tax,
a land value tax would have some tax rate that would tap some
percentage of the land value or rent. I suggest 80 percent of the
geo-rent be used for public revenue. The landowner would pay it from
the rental he collects from the tenant, or if owner-occupied, from the
implicit rental value he obtains from the site. The 80 percent rate
would leave some of the land rent with the landowner to have a margin
for assessment error and also to maintain a positive price for the land
to facilitate its sale.<br>
<br>
There are several methods of assessing land value or rent. One way is
to calculate the replacement value of the existing improvements (unless
they are historic), and then subtract the depreciation of the
buildings. Then subtract the building value from the total property
value. What is left is land value. For commercial property, one also
can take the net income and subtract the return on the improvements
(using some interest rate), the remainder being land rent. In some
places there is vacant or bare land that has a market price, and
sometimes there are separate owners for the land and the improvements,
for which data can be derived from leases and sales. The assessors then
smooth out the neighborhood land values, using computerized maps. It is
not necessary to individually assess the values of most of the
buildings in a neighborhood, since most lots in a locality will have a
similar value per lot.<br>
<br>
Assessors enter this data into computers, which generate neighborhood
maps. The assessors interpolate or smooth out the prices of lots
between those for which they have recent sales or rental data, since
land values tend to be similar in a neighborhood unless there is some
special feature such as corner lots or odd-sized lots.<br>
<br>
It does not matter whether the tax is based on the land value or the
land rent. I suggest basing it on the land value, similar to current
real property taxes. The price of land is related to the rent by a
formula, where p is the price, r the annual rent (assuming constant
rents), i the real interest rate (after subtracting the inflation
rate), and t the tax rate on the price (so if t = .1, the tax is 10
percent of p):<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+1"><strong>p = r / (i+t).</strong></font><br>
</div>
The fraction f of the rent taken is<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+1"><strong>f = t / (t+i)</strong></font></div>
<br>
Alternatively, given the fraction of the rent that is taxed, the tax
rate on the land price p, given interest rate i, is<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="+1"><strong>t = fi / (1-f)</strong>,</font></div>
<br>
i.e. the (fraction of rent) times (the real interest rate) divided by
(one minus the fraction).<br>
<br>
For example, suppose we want to tax 80 percent of the geo-rent, hence
f=.8. Suppose the real interest rate is 5 percent, hence i=.05. Then
the tax rate on land value is:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font size="+1">t = .80 * .05 / .20 = .04/.20 = 20
percent.<br>
</font></strong></div>
A tax of 20 percent of land value taps 80 percent of the economic rent.
Note that the land price falls as either the interest rate or the tax
rate rises. The approximate ratio of the price of taxed land to
non-taxed land is:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong><font size="+1">i / (i + t)</font></strong><br>
</div>
So if t is 20 percent and i is 5 percent, then the price of the taxed
land would be about one-fifth of the price of the untaxed land.<br>
<br>
The rental value of oil, minerals, and water is more complex.
Government often subsidizes water, especially to agriculture, selling
below cost, whereas efficient provision would base the price on the
market price, often above cost, the extra amount being rent. Offshore
oil leases are commonly bid on by companies, and the bids are basically
the rent they pay for the leases. There can also be extraction fees
that take the rent as the raw material is taken out. Such fees can be
paid for taking natural resources such as timber and wildlife.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum also can be taxed as a
type of natural resource. The market for the frequencies will set the
rent. If an active market does not exist, then the current users can
self-assess, subject to having to sell if another user wishes to buy it
at that assessment plus some set premium.<br>
<br>
Some may wonder why anyone would own land if most of the rent is taxed
away. One would own land for the same reason people rent land: in order
to use it. Ownership also gives the title holder rights of possession,
the ability to control the use of the site indefinitely.<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">With
a lower price of land, funds that</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">now go to buy land would instead go</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">to build more capital goods, hire more</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">labor, or provide better training.</span></div>
<br>
Today there is also a speculative motive for owning land, to profit
from the increase in its price. With most of the geo-rent tapped for
public revenue, the speculative motive would be dampened. That would
benefit the economy, since with a lower price of land, funds that now
go to buy land would instead go to build more capital goods, hire more
labor, or provide better training.<br>
<br>
The tax on the geo-rent would be borne by the owner, not the tenant. If
a landlord, who was already charging what the market could bear, tried
to pass on the tax, he would face vacancies. Some say that since the
tax would be invisible to renters, the link between using public
services and paying for them would be broken. But productive public
services increase the geo-rent, so that link is there. If government
revenue is wasted, then indeed this does not generate rent, and a land
value tax without corresponding benefits would reduce land value.
Pressure for a productive use of public revenue would come from the
landowners more than from the tenants. But that is no different than
the situation today; poor folks pay little or no income tax and no
property tax, and typically they get government assistance. This is an
argument not against the use of rent, but in favor of privatizing
government programs. In the private sector, the link between ownership
and control is stronger.<br>

 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">development that used land value taxes</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">to finance public works.</span></div>
<p>The concept of taxing land values for public finance is ancient. The
  Bible declares &#8220;the profit of the Earth is for all&#8221; (Ecclesiastes
  5:9). Land rent financed government in England during the Middle Ages.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">9</span></small> During
  the 1700s, some French economists proposed an <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;imp&ouml;t unique</span>&#8221; or single tax
  on land value. Calling their theory &#8220;physiocracy&#8221; (the rule of natural
  law), they outlined a model of economic development that used land
  value taxes to finance public works, which increased the value of the
  land (and thus increased taxes paid to the treasury), resulting in an
  upward spiral of development and prosperity. The principal physiocratic
  economist, Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay, wrote</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Taxes
... should be laid directly on the net product of landed property</span>,
and not on men&#8217;s wages, or on produce, where they would increase the
cost of collection, operate to the detriment of trade, and destroy
every year a portion of the nation&#8217;s wealth. [Emphasis in the original.]<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10</span></small><br>
</div>
John Locke, the natural-law philosopher whose thought is reflected in
the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights, wrote, &#8220;the things
of nature are given in common&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11 </span></small>and
&#8220;no man could ever have a just power over the life of another by right
of property in land ...&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">12</span></small> Locke
recognized the benefits of private ownership of land and the right of
individuals to possess land  &#8212;  a right he contended came about when an
individual mixed his labor with the land. But Locke, in his famous
&#8220;proviso,&#8221; stipulated that such private ownership would be held on the
condition &#8220;where there is enough and as good left in common for others.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">13</span></small>
Though Locke did not explicitly state how that condition could be met,
the payment to a community of the rent, which measures the extra
productivity of superior relative to inferior land, would seem to
satisfy the condition, since this would keep in common the benefits of
holding the better lands.<br>
<br>
Land value taxation was viewed favorably by the classical economists,
starting with Adam Smith, who wrote, &#8220;Ground-rents, and the ordinary
rent of land, are, therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can
best bear to have a particular tax imposed upon them. Ground-rents
seem, in this respect, a more proper subject of particular taxation
than even the ordinary rent of land.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span></small><br>
<br>
In the late 1700s, Thomas Spence proposed communities made up of
leaseholds, thus financing community expenses from the rent, an idea
advanced later by Ebenezer Howard, who influenced the design of
residential associations in the twentieth century.<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br>
</span>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Thomas
Paine wrote, &#8220;it is the value of</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">the improvements only, and not the</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Earth itself, that is individual</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">property.&#8221;</span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Land value taxation and
  the founding fathers</span></p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson believed &#8220;the Earth is given
    as a common stock for men to labour and live on.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span></small> In
    1797, he suggested &#8220;a land tax supply the means by which the individual
    States were to contribute their quotas of revenue to the Federal
    Government.&#8221;<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small><br>
    <br>
    From 1778 to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution in 1789, the United
    States was governed by the Articles of Confederation. Article VII
    stated the expenses of the Confederation    <br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">shall be defrayed out of a common
treasury, which shall be supplied by the several states, in proportion
to the value of all land within each state, granted to or surveyed for
any person, as such land and the buildings and improvements thereon
shall be estimated according to such mode as the United States in
Congress assembled, shall from time to time direct and appoint. The
taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the
authority and direction of the legislatures of the several states
within the time agreed upon by the United States in Congress assembled.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small><br>
</div>
Thus, the states would levy taxes and each would pass on a share of the
federal budget based on its land value. Individuals would pay taxes
only to their state and local governments.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">18<br>
<br>
</span></small>Thomas Paine, the eighteenth century political
philosopher and activist known for his important role in the American
Revolution, advocated in Agrarian Justice that land rent is the proper
source of public revenue.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small> Paine
wrote, &#8220;it is the value of the improvements only, and not the Earth
itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor, therefore, of
cultivated land owes to the community a ground-rent, for I know no
better term to express the idea by, for the land which he holds ...&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small> <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">An idea widely
held, yet little known!<br>
<br>
</span>Land value taxation is often ignored in policy discussions. For
example, the publication <span style="font-style: italic;">Towards
Fundamental Tax Reform</span>, analyzing various proposals to reform
the U.S. tax system, discusses taxes on income, sales, and value added.
The editors recognize &#8220;Government should seek to raise sufficient funds
to finance the desired level of spending in a manner that does the
least amount of damage possible, while distributing the tax burden
equitably.&#8221;21 Yet the book has no mention of taxes on land value or
rent, even though, as argued in this study, land value taxation best
fits those criteria and resolves the alleged trade-off between
efficiency and equity.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, many economists have recognized and supported land value
taxation for public finance. L&eacute;on Walras, known for his
development of general-equilibrium theory, wrote land rent provides the
best means for funding a state.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small> Knut
Wicksell, a Swedish economist who integrated classical, neoclassical,
and Austrian economic thought, wrote, &#8220;the general economic development
of the community&#8221; increased the value of its land, and he proposed
taxing such increases.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">23</span></small>
Contemporary economists who have written favorably about land value
taxation include Kris Feder, Mason Gaffney, C. Lowell Harris, Fred
Harrison, Nicolaus Tideman, the late William Vickrey (winner of the
1996 Nobel Prize in economics), and myself.<br style="font-style: italic;">
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Several
prominent libertarians have</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">recognized land value or rent as the</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">source of public finance most</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">compatible with liberty.</span></div>
<p>Other economists have opposed the public collection of rent. William
  Fischel (1998) accuses land value taxation of high administrative costs
  in &#8220;the knife-edge goal&#8221; of &#8220;getting almost all land rent.&#8221; He does not
  say why there has to be such an impossible &#8220;knife-edge goal.&#8221; Others
  claim the administrative costs of property taxes are greater than for
  income taxes. But even if this is so, real property taxes already
  exist, so eliminating income and sales taxes can only reduce total
  tax-collecting costs, not increase them.<br>
  <br>
  Some economists agree taxing rent is efficient, but they claim the
  amount of revenue would be trivial. Salvatore and Diulio (1996), for
  example, have an exercise in their textbook: &#8220;What are the criticisms
  of the single-tax movement?&#8221; This was the movement for a single tax on
  land value, by the followers of Henry George. One criticism offered in
  that book is the assertion, provided with no evidence or citation, that
&#8220;rents in the United States today amount to just about 1% of GNP,&#8221; ignoring
the fact that the U.S. housing stock alone amounts to $15 trillion<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">24</span></small>
  and research that indicates geo-rent is about 20 percent of GDP.<br>
  <br>
  There will always be critics who concoct a huge cost in getting
  assessments correct down to the last penny, or claim, without any
  evidence, that real estate is a trivial portion of the economy. Such
  critics date back to the days of Henry George, when the landed
  interests felt threatened by his ideas. Those opponents have been
  thoroughly rebutted in the book, <span style="font-style: italic;">Critics
  of Henry George</span> (the latest edition edited in 2004 by Robert
  Andelson). The reasons for such attempts to falsify and trivialize
  rent-based public finance, and even to eliminate the land factor from
  economics, are chronicled and analyzed in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Corruption of Economics</span>,
  especially in the chapter by Mason Gaffney, &#8220;Neo-classical Economics as
  a Stratagem against Henry George.&#8221; This negative viewpoint is
  perpetuated by academics who learn of land value taxation from
  misleading secondary sources, not bothering to dig any further.<br>
  <br>
  Those who argue it is impossible to assess the value of land apart from
  improvements need to answer why this is in practice accomplished well
  in Arden, Delaware, a community established by Georgists in 1900
  explicitly to demonstrate its practicality. They also need to explain
  how cities such as Sidney, Australia have a real property tax only on
  the land value, and how Japan, Taiwan, Denmark, and many other
  countries had successful land taxes (see Andelson, Robert V., ed.,
  Land-Value Taxation Around the World). Also, thousands of condominiums
  assess their owners independently of their personal property. If this
  is said to be impossible in theory, yet it is done in common practice,
  one wonders about a scholar who ignores the widespread practice in
  favor of the alleged doctrine.<br>
  <br>
  Several prominent libertarians have recognized land value or rent as
  the source of public finance most compatible with liberty. Albert Jay
  Nock, for example, distinguished between the improper political means
  of obtaining wealth, such as from arbitrary taxation, and the proper
  economic means, from enterprise. He regarded public revenue from land
  rent as within the economic means, since the &#8220;monopoly of economic
  rent, on the other hand, gives exclusive rights to values accruing from
  the desire of other persons to possess that property; values which take
  their rise irrespective of any exercise of the economic means on the
  part of the holder.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">25</span></small> (He
  used the term &#8220;monopoly&#8221; in its classical meaning, in which a new
  entrant cannot increase the supply, hence together, the landowners have
  a monopoly.)</p>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Chodorov
regarded a tax on land value</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">as not a true tax but a &#8220;payment for
the</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">use of a location, determined by the</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">higgling and haggling of the market.&#8221;</span><br>
</div>
<div align="right">
  <p align="left">Frank Chodorov, a fervent individualist and founding editor of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Freeman</span>, published by the
    Foundation for Economic Education and still a leading libertarian
    journal of ideas, became in 1937 director of the Henry George School of
    Social Science in New York City, serving until 1942. Like most
    followers of Henry George, Chodorov regarded a charge on land value as
    not a true tax, which arbitrarily extracts wealth, but a &#8220;payment for
    the use of a location, determined by the higgling and haggling of the
    market, and it makes no difference to the land user whether he pays
    rent to the city fathers or to a private owner.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">26</span></small> Explaining
    the value of a location derives to a great extent from community services,
    rather than the efforts of the landowner as such,
    Chodorov noted &#8220;it would seem logical that this value &#8212; which we call
    land rent &#8212; should go to defray the expenses of these common services.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small><br>
    <br>
    Friedrich Hayek was ambivalent about using rent for public finance.
    Hayek was first inspired to study economics after being exposed to
    Georgist ideas. He thought using rent for public finances is a good
    idea if the land value could be separated from the value of the
    improvements, which in practice can be and is done by professional
    assessors and appraisers, as discussed above.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> Hayek
    regarded any tax as inherently socialist, but he regarded a tax on rent
    as the least-bad &#8220;socialist&#8221; tax.<br>
    <br>
    The libertarian thinker Murray Rothbard thought it was impossible to
    tax rent, since doing so would drive land prices to zero, also
    eradicating rent. But that proposition would apply equally to private
    rent collection by landlords of mobile homes, who would by that logic
    be unable to collect rent. Rent in fact does not get reduced when
    taxed. (See the book Critics of Henry George (ed. Robert Andelson) for
    an analysis of how Murray Rothbard, Spencer Heath, Friedrich Hayek,
    Ludwig von Mises, and other libertarians viewed and criticized public
    revenue from land rent.) My suggestion to tap 80 percent of the rent
    would avoid the Rothbard criticism. Even Henry George proposed the
    owner keep some of the rent. The accusation that land value must drop
    to zero is not an argument against taxing some or even most of the
    geo-rent. </p>

  <p align="left">      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PART 4<a name="PART4"></a>: A Comparative Analysis of Land
      Value Taxation</span><br>
      <br>
      We now analyze the criteria for taxation, discussed above, to see how
      tapping geo-rent for public revenue compares with taxing income, value
      added, consumption, and sales.      </p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: right;"></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Impact on
production<br>
<br>
</span>It is widely understood that when something is taxed, we get
less of it. As discussed above, this reduction in labor, production,
and investment is called the &#8220;excess burden&#8221; or &#8220;deadweight loss&#8221; of
taxation. Income taxation discourages work, sales and value-added taxes
discourage consumption, capital gains taxes discourage investment, and
real property taxes discourage building and improving property. Those
taxes make the asset or activity more costly, which then reduces the
quantity bought of the thing being taxed. <br>
<br>
What makes land different is that its supply is fixed, and it is
independent of human action. When land value or rent is tapped for
public revenue, the land does not shrink, flee, or hide.<br>
<br>
Recall the definition above, that land means natural resources. Real
estate sites consist of the three dimensional space within some
boundary of title or jurisdiction. We cannot import land to expand the
amount of space. There can be no land factories to produce more space.
Chopping down trees, leveling inclined slopes, and draining and filling
in water only change the material contents of the space, not the extent
or location of the space. Building taller just makes more space usable;
the three-dimensional space does not expand.<br>
<br>
Some critics of this proposition claim the supply of land is not fixed,
because all resources are subjective. Extreme subjectivists seem to
think that if there is a boundary line between your land and my land,
that is not an objective fact, since I may subjectively think the
boundary line is different from what you think. The line is in the
mind, not on the ground. In my judgment, such views would take us out
of the realm of common-sense economics into rarified philosophical
areas of metaphysics, ontology, and epistemology. Ordinary folks
believe that if I draw a line in the sand, it is an objective enough
fact for practical purposes, because there is an intersubjective
agreement on phenomena such as boundary lines.<br>
<br>
Some economists of the Austrian school reject the distinction between
land and capital goods. They think improvements such as buildings are
also land, so the supply is not fixed. But that is a semantic quibble
and a refusal to face the issue. The common-sense fact is that the
space in a plot of land cannot be increased or decreased. Whatever one
wants to call it, we can distinguish stuff we construct on a site from
the site itself.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
&#8220;supply of land&#8221; does not refer to</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">the size of an individual&#8217;s title,
but to</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">the total amount in some market area.</span><br>
</div>
Another objection is that landowners can change the boundary line and
so expand the amount of land. But the &#8220;supply of land&#8221; does not refer
to the size of an individual&#8217;s title, but to the total amount in some
market area. If Roy buys Jane&#8217;s land that is adjacent to his, his
increase in land is exactly offset by the decrease in the land she
owns. The tax on the combined lot will be the same as the sum of the
land taxes on the previously separate lots.<br>
<br>
Another source of confusion is the claim that since the rent of land
depends on demand, which is done by human beings, this makes the supply
of land variable. This view confuses supply with demand. Demand is the
willingness of buyers to pay. This is independent of the quantity that
is available. If there are three specimens of a rare stamp, the bids of
those wanting to buy it do not change the number of stamps in existence.<br>
<br>
Another error made even by academic economists is to confuse the supply
of land for a particular use, such as housing, with the overall supply
of land. Of course the supply for a particular use can vary, since, for
example, we can convert farmland to housing land. But the total area
available for all uses does not change, and that is the relevant supply.<br>
<br>
The relevance for taxation is that if a plot of land used for a factory
is taxed, the owner will not suddenly want to convert it into a farm
unless its use as a factory was suboptimal. If the plot was already
being used to maximize the rent, taxing it will not change the use.
Taxing the site will also not make the boundary lines move to the west.
Taxing the site will also not affect the demand by tenants to use the
site.<br>
<br>
Another objection to taxing land value, which some find compelling, is
that when the owner bought the land, he already paid the present value
of all future rents, so taxing the land would be a double payment. But
many who bought their lands in the past have enjoyed gains, often
large, in the real estate value. Moreover, this is only a transition
problem; once the tax is in place, a new buyer&#8217;s tax is offset by a
lower price for land and lower mortgage interest payments. Such an
argument would prevent the liberation of slaves, since slave owners
also pay the value of future labor when they buy a slave.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Impact on behavior<br>
<br>
</span>Income taxes impose on the economy a large administrative cost
by government and a cost to payers of filling out forms, paying lawyers
and accountants, and trying to comprehend the complex requirements. The
compliance cost of lost time in the U.S. is 5 billion hours per year,
the equivalent of two million people working full time just to process
the income tax. In dollar terms, the compliance cost is estimated to be
more than $200 billion per year.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small><br>
<br>
Reformers who want to impose a national retail sales tax are well aware
of the substantial impact taxes have on human behavior. That, indeed,
is often why such reforms are proposed: The reformer wishes to
discourage borrowing, reduce consumption, or encourage savings, for
example. But moving to a national retail sales tax results in little
improvement.<br>
<br>
Most people use their wage income to pay for goods and services and
sales taxes. Switching from an income to a sales tax is like taxing you
when you leave a room instead of when you enter the room.<br>
<br>
Income taxes punish savings, but sales taxes punish borrowing. If you
borrow $10,000 to buy a car and there is a 20 percent sales tax, you
need to borrow an extra $2,000 to pay the tax. Some folks might decide
to not buy the car, spending the $10,000 on something else, without
borrowing $2,000.<br>
<br>
There is no good economic reason to tax-punish consumption or
borrowing. The purpose of production is consumption! If we punish
consumption, we punish production. Consumption is not an evil to be
thwarted, but the very benefit we get from the economy. We may as well
also tax fun and joy! Those seeking to tax consumption act as though
they have a Puritan streak that considers enjoying goods to be evil and
working and saving to be good for their own sake.<br>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There
would no longer be any tax </span><span style="font-style: italic;">audits. <br>
There would be no
recordkeeping</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">for taxes.</span><br>
</div>
Tapping rent or land value, by contrast, avoids the manipulation of an
individual&#8217;s choice to save or borrow, consume or invest. A
well-constructed land value levy has no distortive effect at all on
human action or decisions, since it taps a pure surplus, what is left
over after paying for the economic costs of production. The effect of
shifting public revenue from labor and capital to land would be to
liberate human action from the disincentives currently imposed by other
taxes.<br>
<br>
As Henry George noted,<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The advantages which would be gained by
substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are
now raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear
more and more important the more they are considered ... With all the
burdens removed which now oppress industry and hamper exchange, the
production of wealth would go on with a rapidity undreamed of ... [It
would be] like removing an immense weight from a powerful spring.30</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Costs of
collection and administration<br>
<br>
</span>Consider the effect of abolishing income taxes and sales taxes,
replacing them with a land value tax. There would no longer be any tax
audits. There would be no record-keeping for taxes. You, the landowner,
would instead get a monthly bill, like you get for utilities. You would
simply pay the bill or have it automatically deducted from some
financial account. At the same time, government would avoid the high
cost of processing complex accounts and keeping individual tax records.
It would only need to keep real estate records and assess the land
values, both of which it already does for property tax purposes.<br>
<br>
Those who are retired or temporarily have little cash income would be
able to defer taxes by accumulating liens on the real estate until they
die or sell the property, as is commonly done today with real estate
taxes.<br>
<br>
If you thought the assessment of the land value was too high, you could
appeal, as one can today&#8217;s real estate taxes. The land value
assessments would be public records available on the Internet, unlike
income tax records, which are quite properly hidden from public view.
You could easily compare your assessment with those of your neighbors.
If the appeals board rejected your claim, the assessment could be
appealed to a jury, if you were willing to pay the cost of the jury&#8217;s
decision.<br>
<br>
Nobody would be sent to prison for tax evasion, because there would be
no tax evasion. A non-payer would lose title to his land or lose the
protective services of government, depending on the local enforcement
practice. Property taxes are already being assessed and collected by
counties in the U.S. A complete shift to the taxation of land values
would not increase these costs, but would eliminate the expenses
involved in collecting sales and income taxes.<br>
<div style="text-align: right;">
  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Land
  value taxation also involves less</span>   <span style="font-style: italic;">invasion
  of privacy <br>
  than taxing the</span> 
  <span style="font-style: italic;">whole property, since land value</span> 
  <span style="font-style: italic;">assessors<br> 
  do not need to enter the</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">property
  to assess it. <br>
  </span><span style="font-style: italic;">They don&#8217;t
    assess</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">the new pipes, the expanded wiring,</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">the renovated kitchen, or the new</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">cottage
    in the back.</span></p>
  </div>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Least opportunity for tyranny and evasion<br>
</span><br>
Without audits, bank account seizures, and fear-inspiring letters from
the IRS requesting information or additional payments or imposing
interest and penalties, the opportunity for tyranny would greatly
diminish, if not entirely disappear. Evasion being impossible, there
would be no need or excuse for any inquisitive state investigators of
fraud. Land value taxation also involves less invasion of privacy than
taxing the whole property, since land value assessors do not need to
enter the property to assess it. They don&#8217;t assess the new pipes, the
expanded wiring, the renovated kitchen, or the new cottage in the back.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br>
Justice, fairness, equity</span><br>
<br>
We still need to judge whether it is fair for only landowners to pay
the taxes, rather than to spread the burden on all who get income or
spend money or have wealth.<br>
<br>
Natural-law philosophers such as John Locke have reasoned that all
human beings have a natural ownership right to their labor and the
products of that labor. The fundamental equality of humanity means it
is fundamentally wrong for some to take away the labor done by others.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">31</span></small> That
notion is almost universally recognized today with respect to slavery,
and some folks are beginning to recognize that the current tax
system &#8212; which taxes our earnings and taxes how we invest or spend those
earnings &#8212; also violates man&#8217;s natural right to the fruits of his labor.<br>

 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">that can be tapped by the community.</span><br>
</div>
If taking the fruit of one&#8217;s labor is fundamentally unjust, how can a
community raise the monies needed to build essential infrastructure and
provide public services? Land value taxation takes into account not
only the value of the land due to nature, such as soil and climate, but
also the great increase in land values that result from population,
commerce, security and other civic services, and public works &#8212; elements
beyond the activity of the property owner. The windfall increase in the
rental or land value of the land, contended Henry George and others, is
a surplus that can be tapped by the community.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">32</span></small><br>
<br>
Those suggesting positive consequences of shifting taxation to rent
have been accused of exaggerating its beneficial effects.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">33</span></small>
Freedom from punitive taxation is not a panacea, but the infliction of
arbitrary costs on enterprise and the skewing of market signals such as
prices and profits is indeed a universal and major cause of economic
woes. It is not an exaggeration to propose that removing these would
have many beneficial results, just as one&#8217;s health improves
considerably if one stops taking poison.<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br>

      </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Land value taxation
    in history</span></p>
</div>
Significant land value taxation was adopted in several countries. In
Japan, after a revolution in the 1860s, the government transferred
agricultural lands to farmers, who then paid a tax on its value. The
Japanese government used this tax to finance public works and
education, which further increased land values and thus the proceeds
from the land value tax. This created a powerful upward spiral that
turned Japan into a major industrial power. (Japan later switched to
taxing income due to political pressure from landowners.)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">34</span></small><br>
<br>
The German colony of Kiaochow, China, established in 1898, had a single
tax on land value set at 6 percent.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">35</span></small> Its
principal city, Tsing-tao, developed into a fine modern city. The
Germans lost the colony in 1914 at the outbreak of World War I, but
their experience influenced the Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, who
became head of the government of China. He and his successors in the
Nationalist Party were not able to implement land value taxation in
that country, but when they moved to Taiwan in 1950 after the
communists took the mainland, Chiang-kai shek implemented a
land-to-the-tiller reform accompanied by a tax on land value. Taiwan
has since developed into a major industrial power. Hong Kong and
Singapore became major commercial centers in large part because much of
their public finance is based on taxing land values, or in the case of
Hong Kong, from selling land leases, with low taxes on trade and
commerce.<br>
<br>
Of course there are many reasons for the success of economies such as
Hong Kong&#8217;s, but the evidence is that more economic freedom is widely
associated with greater growth and per-capita income, in accord with
the economic theory that the deadweight loss caused by restricting and
taxing production leads to lower production.<br>
<br>
Many cities worldwide, including Johannesburg, South Africa and Sydney,
Australia, have levied real estate taxes on land values only. Some
cities in Pennsylvania have had a two-rate system, where land values
are taxed at a rate higher than the tax on improvements.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36<br>
<br>
</span></small>Followers of Henry George established several model
communities. In one of them, Arden, Delaware, all residential land is
owned by a trust. It leases the land to the residents, who pay rent
only on their leaseholds. The trust itself pays property taxes to the
county. Arden has prospered as a community with fine houses and lively
community activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small><br>
<br>
Many private communities implement the single tax on land in effect,
collected as a fee or assessment. A condominium owner, for example,
owns his unit and a share of the &#8220;common elements&#8221; such as building
exteriors, landscaping, and recreation facilities. The unit owner pays
an assessment often calculated as a &#8220;percentage interest,&#8221; based on the
market value of the unit relative to other units. In effect, the unit
owner is paying rent for use of the common elements.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38 </span></small><br>
<br>
Guests in a hotel pay a rental for one room and receive hotel amenities
such as transportation (elevators), the lobby, hallways, and swimming
pool. Owners of mobile homes pay rent for sites along with services,
and boat owners similarly pay for a space along with amenities. All are
examples of paying rent for the use of private community services and
location amenities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">39</span></small> In
the private sector, rent is viewed as an efficient form of financing
community services, while governments tend instead to levy taxes on
sales or income or wealth, with little or no direct relationship to
services.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">How much revenue?</span><br>
<br>
Total land values or land rents are not reported in national
statistics. The U.S. national income accounts have a number only for
the &#8220;rental income of persons,&#8221; which excludes rent obtained by
corporations and the rental value of government land. This &#8220;rental
income&#8221; is after all expenses, including property taxes, and so
includes only a tiny fraction of the geo-rent.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">40 <br>
<br>
</span></small>The national rent in the United Kingdom has been
estimated at 22 percent of national income, which exceeds the amount
raised in that&nbsp; country by the income tax.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">41 </span></small>Steven
Cord<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small>
estimated the annual economic rent of land in the U.S. in 1986 at $680
billion, 20 percent of national income, while Mike Miles (1990) arrived
at a similar figure using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small> The
totals include government lands but do not include the increase in
geo-rent that would occur with the elimination of market-hampering
taxes.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Land
value taxation would result in a</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">substantial reduction in the cost of</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">government.</span><br>
</div>
Making up about one-fifth of national income, land value taxation would
provide about 60 percent of current U.S. federal, state, and local
government revenue, which would be more than adequate for government
spending if it did not include transfer payments. The taxable value of
the land in the economy would increase over time for two reasons. 
<ul>
  <li>First, a shift from taxing production to taxing land values would
eliminate the lost output due to taxes  &#8212;  about $1 trillion per year.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">44 </span></small>One-fifth
of that would be rent, thus increasing rent by $300 billion. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Secondly, the economy would grow faster, which also would
increase rent over time.</li>
</ul>
Tideman et al. (2002, 17) &#8220;estimate that the net gain (measured in real
dollars of 2000), from shifting as much taxation to land as could be
financed by collecting 90% of the land rent, would be $1308 billion or
14% of NDP in 2002 and $4,799 billion or 26.6% of NDP in 2042.&#8221; Even if
only a fraction of government revenue shifted from the types of taxes
we know today to a geo-rent tax, the efficiency gains could be
substantial. Some critics simply do not believe these results, without
bothering to read them. I have not seen a rebuttal of Tideman&#8217;s
calculation.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">A
complete tax shift, away from taxing</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">production to taxing land values, is
the</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">ultimate supply-side policy, since it</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">removes the excess economic burden </span><span style="font-style: italic;">of taxation.</span></div>
Even if land value taxation does not yield the revenue that is desired,
this is no argument against shifting as much public revenue as possible
to rent-based sources. Public revenue from land values is the most
complete application of &#8220;supply-side&#8221; economic policy. Supply-side
policy attempts to increase production and the supply of goods by
decreasing costs, such as by lowering taxes and eliminating excessive
regulations and barriers to trade. A complete tax shift, away from
taxing production to taxing land values, is the ultimate supply-side
policy, since it removes the excess economic burden of taxation. The
public collection of land rent is thus the ultimate in tax reform.<br>
<br>
Land value taxation would also result in a substantial reduction in the
cost of government. The administrative cost of land value taxes would
be less than that of existing property taxes (which require a greater
inspection of buildings and improvements), and the cost of enforcing
income and sales taxes would be eliminated. By improving economic
growth and allowing workers to keep all the money they earn, land value
taxation would result in higher incomes, reducing the demand for
government welfare programs. Decentralization, privatization, and the
elimination of wasteful government programs would further reduce the
amount needed to fund government.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">How to make the
transition<br>
<br>
</span>The switch to land value taxation will affect most significantly
those who own land at the time of the transition. These are the persons
who have been subsidized, receiving site rental and land value from
civic works paid for mostly by taxes on wages when earned or spent. But
even many landowners would not see their total tax burden rise. Their
wages, profits, interest, and consumption would all become untaxed, and
taxes on their buildings and other improvements would be eliminated.<br>
<br>
As shown by the equations earlier in this report, the land value tax is
not even any burden on future owners of the land, since the tax on the
land reduces its purchase price. What the owner pays in a tax on his
geo-rent, he saves in not having to pay that amount as mortgage
interest. There are two ways of addressing any net burden that might
fall on current landowners during a shift to land value taxes. 
<ul>
  <li>First, landowners could be compensated. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Second, the shift could be implemented gradually, allowing land
values to fall to accommodate the expected and gradually implemented
tax shift.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Over
a period of years ... the tax on</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">improvements is reduced, while the tax</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">on land values is increased.</span></div>
<p>As a concrete example, the transition to land value taxation can be
  accomplished in these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li> Each county expands its register of all real estate and the title
              holders to include all lands owned by governments and previously
              non-registered entities.</li>
    <li> Local real estate taxes are split into two taxes, one on land value
                and one on improvements.</li>
    <li> The county real estate assessment function is transferred to land
                  value assessment boards, comprised of representatives from
      the federal, state, county, and municipal governments as well as real estate
                  professionals and scholars. These boards appoint assessors
      and
                  establish an appeals process, similar to current real estate
      tax appeals.</li>
    <li> All land is assessed at its current market value. </li>
    <li> Over a period of years, depending on how much land values already
                      have fallen in anticipation of the tax shift, the tax on
      improvements is reduced, while the tax on land values is increased. (An
            immediate tax shift to geo-rent, with other taxes reduced or abolished,
            could be compensated, for those with net losses, with special bonds
      whose
                      face-value interest payments would decrease over time;
      this would
                      have
                      an effect similar to the gradual increase in the geo-rent
      tax rate.)</li>
    <li> Sales taxes, tariffs, and excise taxes are reduced and eventually
                        eliminated.</li>
    <li> The personal exemption in federal income taxes is raised
                          each year, until it eventually includes all income,
      at which time
                          all state and
                          federal personal income taxes are abolished. The taxation
                          of corporate profits is also phased out.</li>
    <li> The value of material land (minerals, oil, water, etc.),
                            the electromagnetic spectrum, naturally growing forests,
                            and other
                            natural resources is taxed at gradually increasing
      rates up to a substantial
                            amount, if not all, of the unimproved rental value.</li>
    <li>An amendment to the Constitution is enacted prohibiting
                              any taxation of wages, sales, profits, value-added,
            or produced wealth
                              and
                              establishing the taxation of the value of land
      and other natural resources, along with voluntary user fees and
                              charges for pollution
                              and congestion, as the only sources of public revenues.
                              The amendment also
                              establishes a land value tax commission with representatives
                              from the federal, state, local, territorial, and
      Indian-nation governments
                              to
                              divide the taxes raised. Generally, taxes raised
      from off-shore oil and water, atmospheric pollution, airline
                              routes, and
                              other continental
                              uses would be allocated to the federal government,
            and the rest would be allocated to the state (or provincial,
                              in Canada),
                              local,
                              territorial, and Indian-nation governments. If
      the national government needs additional revenue, it is obtained from
                              the state or territorial
                              governments in proportion to their land value,
      as was specified in
                              the
                              Articles of Confederation that preceded the U.S.
      Constitution.</li>
    <li> Top-down revenue sharing from federal to state
                                and from state to local government stops. Many
      services, functions, and agencies
                                are
                                transferred from the central government to the
      state/provincial and local governments.</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p>Critics of land value taxation claim that over time, there would be
          popular pressure to bring back the income and sales taxes. It is true
          that those owning valuable commercial land will always seek to lower
          the tax on land and shift taxes to labor and capital. It is also true
          that governments can ignore constitutional rules, and governments get
          overthrown. By this argument, the slaves should never have been freed,
          because slavery can always be restored. Women should not have been
          given the opportunity to vote, because that could be reversed. This is
          an argument against any reform and indeed against any action to improve
          your condition. (Why bother to work? You might lose your money, and it
          will have been for nothing.) This is ultimately a philosophical
      argument for the futility of any human action.        </p>
<div style="text-align: right;">
  <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Once
  there is a shift in public attitudes</span><br

  <span style="font-style: italic;">about taxing wages, the view that it

wages, the view that it is morally wrong to tax labor could be just as

The United States is a federation of states (and Indian-nation
reservations), with many government functions such as criminal law,
education, and local services provided by the states.&nbsp; Since the
federal income tax was enacted in 1913, taxation and authority have
shifted increasingly to the federal government.<br>
<br>
In 1902, federal taxes represented 37 percent of total revenue to
governments at all levels.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> By
2002, federal taxes represented 67 percent of the government revenue
pie.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">46</span></small>
The share taken by state governments rose from 11.4 percent in 1902 to
21.5 percent in 1986. Local governments&#8217; share fell from 51.3 percent
in 1902 to 13.7 percent in 1986. <br>
<br>
The change in the share of tax revenues taken by each level of
government has occurred in large part because of the relative ease of
increasing income taxes at the federal level, and the relative
difficulty of increasing local and state taxes. Taxpayers find it much
easier to respond to changes in state and local taxes, by moving to
lower-tax communities. It is far more difficult to avoid taxes imposed
by the federal government  &#8212;  especially since U.S. citizens are taxed
even if they are abroad.<br>
<br>
Revenue-sharing from the federal government to the states is, in
effect, a tax cartel among the states, collusion to tax the population
and then divide the funds among the states. Taxation at the federal
level also encourages spending by the federal government instead of the
states, so now we have federal departments and agencies for education,
housing, health and welfare, energy, and other fields that once were
local, state, or private-sector matters.<br>
<br>
Local and state governments, once willing to go along with the federal
government&#8217;s tax-and-revenue-sharing scheme, are beginning to realize
centralized taxing brings with it centralized authority, dramatically
reducing local control. Revenue-sharing comes with strings attached:
Local and state governments must abide by federal government mandates
in order to obtain the funds, taken from their residents in the first
place. Revenue-sharing allows the federal government to sidestep the
Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that powers not
specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the
people and the states.<br>
<br>
Land value taxation would shift economic power back to state and local
governments. Land is suited to local taxation because  &#8212;  unlike
enterprise, capital, and labor  &#8212;  it cannot be moved. Land is also the
logical source of local public finance because it does not burden
enterprise, so that entrepreneurs don&#8217;t even <span
 style="font-style: italic;">want </span>to run from it. Indeed,
entrepreneurs welcome a shift to land value taxation, not only because
their economic profits are not taxed if all taxation is on land values,
but also because land value taxation reduces the price of land, so they
do not need to borrow so much when they invest funds in an enterprise.<br>
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When
public finance is based on land </span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">value taxation, government revenues</span><br

<span style="font-style: italic;">from the federal government to the</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">states and then to local governments.</span><br>
</div>
When public finance is based on land value taxation, government
revenues flow up, instead of trickling down from the federal government
to the states and then to local governments. Real estate taxes today
are assessed and collected primarily by county governments; under a
system of land value taxation, funds raised would flow up from the
counties to the states, and only then to the federal government.<br>
<br>
Land value taxation would create a decentralizing force, shifting or
&#8220;devolving&#8221; power down to local government in accord with the principle
of subsidiarity: that which can be most efficiently done by individuals
or smaller jurisdictions should not be done by larger or higher-level
jurisdictions. Government functions would then come under more
observation and control by the voters, who can monitor and alter local
governments much more easily than remote federal agencies.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">and does not induce dishonesty.</span></div>
An ideal public revenue policy respects a person&#8217;s right to privacy,
does not discourage work or savings, and does not induce dishonesty.
While income, sales, and value-added taxes fall woefully short of this
ideal, land value taxation meets each requirement.<br>
<br>
Imagine the increased prosperity and opportunities for advancement that
would exist if people could keep all of the money they earn; if
billions of dollars wasted on efforts to avoid high income taxes were
suddenly turned to productive endeavors; and if the growth of
government were constrained by a tax system that would raise only
enough to pay for services actually provided. <br>
<br>
Land value taxation is central to the political philosophy of the
founding fathers of the United States. Far from being a new idea, or
the idea of a small group of thinkers, it is a concept embraced by many
of the most important figures from our history: <a href="../themes/Locke.html">John
Locke</a>, Adam Smith,
Thomas Paine, <a href="../themes/Jeffersonian_Ideals.html">Thomas Jefferson</a>, and today, <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Milton
Friedman</a>. Land value
taxation is part of America&#8217;s proud and distinguished tradition of
political philosophy. Surely it belongs in the national debate over how
best to reform the nation&#8217;s tax system.<br>
<br>
The shift from taxing productive human action to collecting the
economic rent generated by nature and communities is more than a fiscal
reform. There is a philosophical and even spiritual side to this reform.<br>
<br>
One of the ongoing problems of social philosophy is the relationship of
the individual to society. In conventional tax policy, there is an
inherent conflict between the individual and government as the agent of
society. Individuals want to benefit from the collective services
provided by government, but the mechanisms for financing those services
typically have used force against individuals and invaded their private
lives.<br>
<br>
The collection of land rent for public revenue reconciles the
individual and the community. The community and its government no
longer intrude into the individual&#8217;s private life and stifle his or her
pursuit of economic well being. The tax on land value is not a tax in
substance, but only in the form of payments to government. In
substance, the payment is a sharing of the benefits provided by
community and nature, and a payment for the services that generate the
value of the land. If this payment is not made by the landholder, the
services become a subsidy, producing a value not returned to the
community.<br>
<br>
The public collection of land rent can induce an efficient use of land.
Land value taxation gives land a &#8220;carrying cost,&#8221; inducing title
holders to put their land to its most productive current use, rather
than hold it awaiting higher prices. With the price of land thus kept
low, banks would lend for productive investments rather than to buy
land.<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Once
citizens, taxpayers, consumers,</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">and voters understand the option of</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">obtaining public revenue from land</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">value or rent, then the logic of
getting</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">both greater efficiency and greater</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">justice may well prevail.</span></div>
<br>
Public revenue from land rent is a necessary element of true free trade
and a genuinely free market. Even a small and flat income tax, sales
tax, or tariff grants government the power to intrude into
transactions, adding friction that reduces the flexibility of an
economy. The elimination of this friction and deadweight loss is made
possible by land value taxation.<br>
<br>
The obstacles to land value taxation are political. The current system
benefits certain vested interests that will resist reform. But since
the public at large will benefit from a shift to land value taxation,
and since they greatly outnumber those obtaining privileges from the
current system, the greater reason why this tax reform has not taken
place is that the public has not been informed. Once citizens,
taxpayers, consumers, and voters understand the option of obtaining
public revenue from land value or rent, then the logic of getting both
greater efficiency and greater justice may well prevail.<br>

18. The U.S. Constitution expanded the powers of the federal government
to include indirect taxes (which technically include income taxes,
including taxes on the activity of generating rent) and changed the
basis of direct taxes paid by the states from land value to population.
The federal government abandoned direct taxes on real estate,
apportioned by population, in 1861, because representatives of the
western states objected they had much less wealth per capita than did
the northeastern states.<br>
