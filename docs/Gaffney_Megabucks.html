<center><b>Megabucks for Negabucks: Solving the Water
Crisis</b></center>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mason Gaffney<br>
February 18, 2004</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more than one way to skin a cat. When Henry George
wrote &#8220;We must make land common property&#8221; it was in a place
and at a time when most land in sight had been privatized only
recently, using crude methods. &#8220;Force and fraud&#8221; were not
dim memories in 1879, but a living presence. So George&#8217;s phrase
did not strike people then as being any more shocking than it is
today to remind them that the public domain, with its pasturelands,
waters, rights of way, the air, radio spectrum, fish, mineral riches
and timber, belongs to us all in common. Today, to replicate
George&#8217;s impact, we would do well to train our sights on the
public domain that is currently being privatized.</p>
<p>The public soon forgot about force and fraud, aided by apologists
like crafty old Richard T. Ely. As early as 1890 he wrote to deplore
taxing Wisconsin landowners because they had owned &#8220;since time
immemorial.&#8221; That sounds like a long time, but it was barely a
generation after the Blackhawk War had wrested the lands from the
Sauk and Fox Indians, (who left their traces in place-names
containing a &#8220;wau&#8221; or &#8220;woc&#8221; syllable).</p>
<p>Today, landowners and their agents have built up strong legal,
political, semantic and sentimental barriers against taxing
fee-simple lands. We may advance faster by probing for resources
with weaker defenses. This month we write of water, a resource of
paramount value.</p>
<p>The California Constitution and Water Code, like those of most
states, are explicit that &#8220;The waters of California belong to
the people of California.&#8221; Water is not private property,
evidenced by its not being taxed as such (except indirectly, as it
adds to the value of fee simple land). Water is not, therefore,
subject to the limits that Prop. 13 (and cognate laws in other
states) impose on property tax rates. The State, as owner, can
presumably charge whatever the legislature decides, without its being
considered a tax at all. Water claimants would of course resist
strenuously, with all the lawyers and pawns and media that money can
buy, and social pressure sway, but the public has a strong case.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just water <i>per se</i>, but also the lands under
what were originally <b>shallow waters</b>. Most coastal cities have
increased their areas greatly by filling in shallow waters. The
surface of San Francisco Bay is about half of what it was before
filling began. Boston has doubled its area by filling. Just who
owns the original seabed is a complex legal tangle, but in many areas
the public has basic ownership rights for which it usually fails to
claim market rents. The &#8220;<b>Public Trust Doctrine</b>&#8221;
applies to some shallow waters. In 1983 the California Supreme Court
resurrected it from the dead letter office (Mono Lake Case), and many
cities, with a little positive thinking, could enhance their
shriveled revenues greatly by moving aggressively on these rents.</p>
<p>There are four major ways that individuals and corporations
acquire the use of waters. <b> One is by riparian rights</b>. To own
the bank of a lake or stream is to have a right to the water,
theoretically &#8220;undiminished and unpolluted,&#8221; that nature
put there - subject to the equal rights of other riparians, but not
of anyone else. When waters must be prorated it is in proportion to
the area of backlying land in the smallest undivided parcel that has
ever existed - a penalty for selling off any land. Some riparians
have succeeded in dominating large areas by virtue of owning the
banks of streams. The Miller and Lux empire on the lower San Joaquin
River was a classic case of the 19th and early 20th Centuries.</p>
<p><i>Consiglieri</i> for riparians encourage us to believe that
these rights are &#8220;part and parcel&#8221; of the land title, hence
untouchable, but in fact voters have breached and limited them
severely when they became too obnoxious. In 1928 Californians
amended their Constitution to limit riparians to &#8220;reasonable
use&#8221; (now article 2 of section 10). Oh, yes, it was a big
monopoly power company, Southern Cal Edison, that financed the
amendment, to abet its own heist of a power drop, but still the legal
point was made. When thieves fall out, the public has an
entr&eacute;e.</p>
<p><b>A second way to claim water is by owning land overlying ground
water, and the aquifers that store it. </b> For generations,
overlying landowners could pump at will (usually with subsidized
power). Most of them still may, and do, heedless of overdrafts and
falling water tables. When pumping costs rise, the common answer has
been to photograph a wilted field or dying grove for publicity, and
get state or federal governments to pay for &#8220;rescue
projects,&#8221; importing water to recharge the aquifers, as in the
Coachella Valley and the southern San Joaquin Valley. These in turn
lead to more pumping and another rescue project: a &#8220;treadmill
effect&#8221; of long standing. It worked in the San Fernando Valley
in 1913, and it keeps working. The Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California (MWDSC), its Board dominated by land speculators,
is now a big agent.</p>
<p>In a leading case of 1949 (Pasadena v. Alhambra) the California
Supreme Court did limit pumping from the Raymond Basin. It based
allocations on histories of past use. This led to a statewide
&#8220;race to the pump house&#8221; to establish histories of waste as
bases for future prorationing. It is hard to devise anything so
counterproductive, but that&#8217;s what the judges did (and then some
people blame overpopulation and natural scarcity). <i>The point is,
though, that the State can manage aquifers, and what the State can
manage it can tax.</i></p>
<p>With the current movement toward water marketing, landowners may
now &#8220;export&#8221; water from lands overlying the basin being
pumped. This has moved some giant speculators to buy up vast areas
with a view to exporting the groundwater and renting out space in the
aquifers. Some publicized examples are PG&amp;E Properties in
northern California, Peter Hensen and John Huston near Denver, BCE
(Bell Canada), Cadiz Land in Riverside County, Tenneco in Kern
County, a few major oil firms, and the Maurice Strong consortium in
New Mexico. Where natural resources are on the auction block, and
taxes are zero, big money rushes in.</p>
<p><b>A third way to claim water is by &#8220;prior
appropriation.&#8221; </b> The key rules are &#8220;first in time,
first in right&#8221;; &#8220;due diligence&#8221;; &#8220;beneficial
use&#8221;; and &#8220;history of use.&#8221; The precondition for
putting water to &#8220;beneficial use&#8221; is owning land on which
to spread it. The &#8220;beneficial&#8221; part is a joke. &#8220;Use&#8221; is what counts,
and &#8220;use&#8221; in practice means
&#8220;taking&#8221; (by withdrawing or diverting). The State charges
nothing for taking its water, and often subsidizes the appropriators.
So the scarce and priceless waters of the west have been allocated
mainly in proportion to prior ownership of land.</p>
<p>Part of appropriating water is securing sites for dams and
reservoirs and rights of way, either from public domain or from
private owners by use of eminent domain. A major case is San
Francisco&#8217;s seizure of the site of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
inside Yosemite National Park. This scenic site on the Tuolumne
River once rivaled Yosemite Valley itself, on the neighboring Merced
River.<i> Rent has been $30,000 a year, fixed since the 1920s. The
Administration is now proposing $8 million a year. However this case
goes, the charge is for the site alone, not for the water or the
power drop. </i> <b><i>San Francisco seized so much more than its own
needs that it sells 2/3 of what it takes to other cities, for a fat
profit that helps keep land values in San Francisco nearly the
highest in the U.S.A., and its housing the least
affordable.</i></b></p>
<p><b>A fourth way to claim water is by getting
&#8220;sweetheart&#8221; contracts from large supply systems: Federal
water from the Bureau of Reclamation; State water from the State
Department of Water Resources; and mixed-source waters from the giant
MWDSC.</b> No sooner are these contracts inked than learned
counselors go to work to convert them into perpetual obligations of
the taxpayers and other ratepayers. The original 40-year contracts
that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation executed on the 1950s at giveaway
prices came up for renegotiation in the 1990s, and only a few old
timers even remembered their origins. <b>Meantime the once-surplus
water had multiplied many times in value, and the contractors were
busy securing rights to resell water that they buy for some $10 per
acre-foot to coastal cities for $200-$500 per acre foot. </b> A
rather shocking decision by Senior Judge John Wiese, December 31,
2003, requires the Feds to compensate the Tulare Lake Basin Water
Storage District for withholding some of &#8220;their&#8221; water to
comply with the Endangered Species Act to save fish downstream. Said
District is a front for the J.G. Boswell Company, owner of 200,000
(sic) acres in the Basin.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the moral? We can turn &#8220;Negabucks into
Megabucks&#8221; for state and Federal treasuries by charging water
takers a market price for what they get, instead of subsidizing them
to get it, as now. The stakes are huge; the barriers are
surmountable. Besides raising revenues we would institute a regime
of &#8220;demand management,&#8221; promoting water conservation in the
most economical way. We would solve our factitious &#8220;water
crisis&#8221; and &#8220;revenue crisis&#8221; in one stroke.</p>
