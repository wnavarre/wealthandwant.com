<p>  SPRAWL DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATIONS are not natural. Were it not for incentives
    to the contrary, people would choose to live and work in close proximity.
    This has been well documented in studies of every era and place.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[1]</em></strong></font> Only
    when incentives are put in place that induce people to live in other circumstances
    do they choose settlement patterns that are remote, less accessible, and
    alienating. Only in the industrial era and after have outlying areas become
    more attractive. Tracing the history of such developments makes it clear
  that they are a response to less livable conditions of urban life as they have
    evolved &#8212; the pollution of air and water, loss of nature, loss of
    privacy, housing deficiencies, and so on. In more recent years, differentials
    in taxation
    and the quality of services (such as schools) have also played a role in
    making the suburbs more attractive.</p>
<blockquote>

        to the Present (London: Roudedge, 1996); Spiro Kostof, The City Shaped: Urban
        Patterns and Meanings through History (Boston: Little, Brown, 1991).
    </font>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those differentials are explained by public policies that were never understood
  or envisioned by their designers. Lacking an appreciation of land economics
  or the relationship between land value and transportation service, governments
  have put into place a system of taxes and subsidies that amplify and exacerbate
  whatever impulses already exist to escape the pathologies of urban environments.
  The polluting industries of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are
  largely gone, but the impulses to leave cities behind continue, driven now
  by policies for which governments themselves are responsible.</p>
<p>It is important to understand how closely linked transportation costs and
  land costs are. There are fixed costs involved in locating a home or a business
  in either place: the costs of building a home, office, or factory and the costs
  of purchasing a car or a truck. Leaving those costs aside for the moment, consider
  the relationship between the variable operating costs due to locating in an
  urban center versus those in locating at the periphery, expressed conceptually
  in figure 10.1.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 10.1 shows that a household or business is likely to incur costs by
  locating at either site, whether at a city's center or at the city's edge.
  At a center site, the costs will take the form of higher land rent; at the
  city's edge, the costs will be transportation related. If this is not readily
  apparent, it is because society provides subsidies to titleholders and travelers
  beyond what are directly experienced or understood.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Transportation Costs</strong></p>
<p>  Consider first the costs of transportation in remote areas; such costs are
    necessarily higher. The way in which geographers and some land economists
    understand transportation is by using the terms &quot;<strong>accessibility</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>mobility</strong>.&quot; As
    explained in one basic textbook,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Accessibility refers to the number of opportunities, also called activity
    sites, available within a certain distance or travel time. Mobility refers
    to the ability to move between different activity sites (e.g., from home to
    a grocery store).<font size="-1"><strong><em>[2]</em></strong></font> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">2. Susan Hanson, ed., The Geography of Urban Transportation
          (2nd ed.) (New York: Guilford, 1995), 5. See also Elliott Sclar, Access for
          All: Transportation and Urban Growth (New York: Columbia University Press,
    1980).      </font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>American transportation planners have focused excessively on mobility with
  almost total disregard for accessibility. The result is that we are frequently
  hard put to accomplish our transactions for lack of easy access, even though
  it is easy to travel great distances with facility. One old joke will serve
  as a metaphor to better illustrate the dilemma:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> A man ordered a cup of coffee at a lunch counter and shortly then ordered
    a second cup. After quickly drinking that cup, he ordered a third cup, and
    then a fourth, and then a fifth. The waitress, astonished at this man's requests,
    finally said to him, &quot;My Sir! You certainly do like coffee.&quot; &quot;I
    certainly do,&quot; he replied. &quot;Otherwise I wouldn't be drinking all
    this water just to get a little.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The analogy is apparent: Water is to mobility as coffee is to accessibility.
  We do an awful lot of driving just to do what we need to do. This is because
  transportation engineers and land use planners have confused two fundamental
  concepts: access and mobility.</p>
<p>By confusing these two principles, we spend an inordinate amount of money
  on transportation services, most of it on roads and highways. One 1993 study
  calculated that the total costs of motor vehicle transportation to our society
  equal approximately a fourth of our gross domestic product (GDP).<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> The study
  concluded that &quot;when the full range of costs of transportation are tallied,
  passenger ground transportation costs the American public a total of $1.2 to
  $1.6 trillion each year. Just the costs of automobile crashes represents a
  figure equal to 8 percent of the American GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></font> Japan, by way of comparison,
  spends an estimated 10.4 percent to satisfy all its transportation requirements,
  although the figure might be a bit low because not all externalities are included
  in the calculation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5] </em></strong></font>Road user fees in 1991 totaled only about $33 billion,
  whereas the true costs to society were ten times that;<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> put another way,
  drivers pay only 10 percent of the true costs of their motor vehicle use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7] </em></strong></font>The balance is paid by society, effectively subsidizing highway use by paying
  for all but the marginal out-of-pocket operating costs.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">3. Peter Miller and John Moffet, The Price of Mobility: Uncovering
        the Hidden Costs of Transportation (Washington, D.C.: Natural Resources Defense
        Council, 1993). This is somewhat more than the U.S. Department of Transportation's
        own calculation. The latter uses only direct measurable pecuniary costs and
        estimates that the figure was in the neighborhood of $1 trillion for 1992,
        about 17 percent of gross national product (converting to GDP would make
        it somewhat higher). Since it fails to include externalities such as pollution,
        accidents, and other associated costs, it seems a reasonable estimate (U.S.
        Department of Transportation, Transportation Statistics Annual Report, 1994
        [Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation
        Statistics, 1994], 4-5).<br>
    4. In 1988, a study by the Urban Institute calculated that $71 billion were borne
    in out-of-pocket costs, another $46 billion in lost wages and household production,
    and $217 billion in pain, suffering, and lost quality of life. Translated into
    vernacular, this is a total of $334 billion in lost property, work time, and
    injuries and deaths (T. Miller et al., The Costs of Highway Crashes [Washington,
    D.C.: Urban Institute, October 19911).<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The relationship between transportation costs and land values can be made
  even clearer by empirical study of how land values increase as one moves toward
  the center of the city. In an investigation for the Urban Land Institute, the
  author concluded that, for Portland, Oregon, each additional mile [traveled]
  translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in locations
  command a premium, those farther out
  save money. A ten-mile difference, all other things being equal, would amount
  to about $56,000 in new home value.</p>
<p> For a household in which one worker drives downtown (or at least to a more
  central location) to work, that ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles
  annually, assuming 230 days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each
  day. Moreover, if non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled
  that amount, the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could
  mean a higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
  saved/spent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8]</em></strong></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Such are the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles. If
  the urban resident has to rely on a car nonetheless, subtracting some $3,000
  annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again that much (and likely
  more) to own a car. Author James Kunstler put the true costs along with other
  experts at about $6,100 annually seven years ago.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The American Automobile
  Association calculated that a car driven 15,000 miles in 2001 cost 51 cents
  per mile, or $7,650.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[10]</em></strong></font> This figure reflects only direct costs to the driver,
  not the additional costs passed on to society.</p>

    </font><font size="-1">10. See link (accessed January 2001). Driving 10,000 miles

<p>The latter figures include externalities such as pollution and the costs of
  highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their engines
  so  that they pollute less, to inflate tires properly, and to drive more safely
  are not likely to change the reality that people are forgetful and fallible.
  Pollution-free cars are not available; people must drive to participate in
  this society. The consequences of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and ozone
  are no longer a matter of debate; they are scientific fact. Despite frequent
  headlines about replacing the internal combustion engine, all the realistic
  substitutes also ultimately rely on fossil fuel power, solar-powered cars are
  far in the future, if at all, and also fail to deal with any transition. And
  every person driving his or her own car multiplies the probabilities of accidents.
  When people step into a car, they are seldom mindful of such odds. Yet if the
  direct pecuniary costs of driving increase in any substantial way, there will
  surely be significant changes in the trade-offs involved in housing/transportation
  choices. As will be made clear later, making costs visible and linking them
  to private personal behavior is one way to ensure that transportation pays
  its own way.</p>
<p>Sooner than Americans are likely to bear the real burden of global warming's
  environmental consequences, they are likely to experience the onset of price
  rises for petroleum. Experts are divided, but among those best insulated from
  the pressures of bias, there is increasing consensus that the peak of oil extraction
  worldwide will come sometime around 2010 if not sooner.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font> Rising
  prices will not induce greater supply; it will not change the fact that the
  world will
  have passed the point of most easily extracted oil and will enter a long and
  increasingly steep period of declining availability. It is rather a matter
  of physics: When it costs more in energy to bring oil from deep in the earth
  than what can be extracted, it is not worth the investment. Even the greater
  wealth of American society will not insulate it from world competition over
  what is a limited and fungible commodity. How this alters the calculations
  Americans make about where to live and work will increasingly depend on the
  price they are willing to pay for transportation service.</p>

<p>Looking at figure 10.1 once more, it is likely that the slope of the line
  reflecting land rent and transportation costs will become steeper in time,
  making each factor greater relative to the other. The century during which
  motor vehicle transportation was dominant tended to flatten that line, but
  the greater and growing transportation costs will tend to make land values
  at urban centers higher relative to remote locales, much as occurred in pre-industrial
  times or during the railroad and canal eras. George Kennan notes in one of
  his books that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The railway ... was capable of accepting and disgorging its loads, whether
    of passengers or freight, only at fixed points. This being the case, it tended
    to gather together, and to concentrate around its urban terminus and railhead,
    all activity that was in any way related to movements of freight or passengers
    into or out of the city. It was in this quality that it had made major and
    in some ways decisive contributions to the development not only of the great
    railway metropolises of the Victorian age -- particularly of such inland cities
    as Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and Chicago -- but even certain of the great maritime
    turnover ports, such as London and New York.</p>
  <p> The automobile, on the other hand, had precisely the opposite qualities.
    Incapable, in view of its own cumbersomeness and requirements for space, of
    accepting or releasing large loads at any concentrated points anywhere, but
    peculiarly capable of accepting and releasing them at multitudes of unconcentrated
    points anywhere else, the automobile tended to disintegrate and to explode
    all that the railway had brought together. It was, in fact, the enemy of the
    concentrated city. Thus it was destined to destroy the great densely populated
    urban centers of the nineteenth century, with all the glories of economic and
    cultural life that had flowed from their very unity and compactness.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[12]</em></strong></font></p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>  <strong>Land Rent</strong></p>
<p>  From the standpoint of an economic geographer and for some land economists,
    land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land rent is the surplus
    generated by social activity on or in the vicinity of locational sites that
    accrues to titleholders of those parcels. Whether or not it is recaptured
    by public policy, rent is a natural factor deriving from the intensive use
    of natural capital. One must return to nineteenth-century classical economics
    to appreciate the importance of economic rent or land rent; neoclassical
    economic frameworks have largely discarded it.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font> More
    intensive use of high-value land sites leads to site configurations that
    are less dependent
  on transportation
    services. Land rent is highest where the greatest traffic and market exchanges
    occur, that being at the center of large conurbations. Comparing land values
    of urban property parcels, the highest land rent in the urban cores and traffic
    junctures are analogous to the contours of land elevations. Mountain peaks
    gradually slope down to valleys and flatland regions and continue outward
    until at distant points &#8212; perhaps at the poles of the earth &#8212; land
    sites have no market value at all.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">13. Explanation of the Mure to recognize the law of rent,
        as understood by classical economists, is explained in Mason Gaffney
      and Fred Harrison, The Corruption of Economics (London: Shepheard-Walwyn,
      1994).

<p>The differentials in land values are profound, even more than most people
  realize. In 1995, in the small city of Ithaca, New York, the highest quintile
  of land had a value of over $56,000 per acre in the downtown center, whereas
  the lowest quintile only a mile away falls to less than $3,000.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Large
  city centers have far higher site prices. Even in Polk County, Iowa (which
  includes
  Des Moines), in the middle of cornfields where I did a study two years ago,
  the highest urban value land site was $31.3 million per acre, which quickly
  declined to about $20,000 per acre only about a mile away. In the spring of
  1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed) of less than an acre in
  New York  City's Times Square and split in two pieces by Broadway was sold
  by Prudential Life to Disney for roughly $240 million.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> To
  take another instance, a nine-acre tract on the East River in New York City
  occupied by
  an obsolete power plant was purchased by Mort Zuckerman to build high-rise
  condominiums two years ago. The sale price was in the neighborhood of $680
  million and would have been higher were it not for some enormous costs associated
  with the demolition of the old structures.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16]</em></strong></font> It should be noted that the
  overwhelming proportion of land value is in cities; relatively speaking, the
  site values of peripheral lands, typically used for agriculture and timber
  growth, are negligible. Land values are high in urban areas because, over time,
  rent accrues to a site. Each improvement in proximity to a property parcel
  enhances the value of all other parcels. This makes even unimproved sites attractive
  objects for speculation, particularly when land sites surrounding it are to
  be improved by adding either transportation service or new structures. One
  nine-mile stretch of interstate highway in Albany, New York, costing $125 million
  to construct, has yielded $3.8 billion in increased land values (constant dollars)
  within just two miles of its corridor in the forty years of its existence.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font>  This is a thirty-fold return in a time span typically used for bond repayment!
  The Washington Metro created increments in land value along much of the 101-mile
  system completed by 1980 that easily exceeded $3.5 billion, compared with the
  $2.7 billion of federal funds invested in Metro up until that time.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> Any
  major building construction project, private or public, will have a similar
  effect on adjacent land sites. Differentials in land value can have a profound
  effect on decisions made by titleholders, either positively by inducing appropriate
  development in urban cores or negatively by giving monopoly titleholders power
  to hold sites out of use for long-term speculative gain. Such decisions of
  course determine the character of urban configurations and society as well.</p>

<p>  <strong>Stemming Sprawl: Command-and-Control Measures</strong></p>
<p>  Policymakers have two modes of leverage by which to implement public will:
    1) so-called command-and-control approaches that are typically enforced
    by what state and federal constitutions group under &quot;police powers&quot; and
    2) fiscal approaches that typically involve a variety of taxes, fees, fines,
    and other charges that derive constitutionally from either police powers
    or &quot;tax powers.&quot; When governments administer either of these powers,
    they are legitimate and authoritative. Fiscal measures available to governments
    can come from either ground. The charges that the private sector usually
    impose differ in that they usually are responsive to market forces. Prices
    that are established by government, however, are not necessarily responsive
    to market forces, nor are they intended to be. Rather, they are set in order
    to accomplish specific public policy goals.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19] </em></strong></font>They can be no less efficient,
    however, when responsibly instituted.</p>

<p>Governments face the challenge of knowing which of the tools at their
  disposal &#8212; command-and-control approaches or &quot;pricing&quot; approaches &#8212;  will
    best serve effective and efficient achievement of public policies. Only in
    recent
    years, however, has
    there been a renewed interest in fiscal levers to achieve goals that policymakers
    seek to achieve. There is particular interest among students of welfare economics
    in incorporating costs earlier regarded as externalities, especially in designing
    environmental policies. Moreover, the use of pricing approaches to recover
    costs of government services that have a high level of private good about them
    can bring about more attractive and achievable goals than reliance on conventional
    police power approaches. User fees, environmental fees, and other such fiscal
    tools have become more fascinating &#8212; at least to students of public
  policy &#8212; than conventional taxes.</p>
<p>The renewed interest in fiscal approaches comes in recognition of the fact
  that traditional command-and-control approaches have not been successful. Government
  authority is far more effective at prohibiting and controlling than it is inducing
  and channeling.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[20]</em></strong></font> Three illustrations of failed command-and-control approaches
  will demonstrate this: zoning, urban growth boundaries, and altering (usually
  expanding) political jurisdictions.</p>

<p><strong>Zoning</strong></p>
<p>  The largest single and impartial study of zoning, a 1969 report to the National
    Commission on Urban Problems (the Douglas Commission), conceded that zoning
    is of questionable value. A part titled &quot;Fragmentation in Land-Use Planning
    and Control&quot; quoted with approval a (then) recent study that had held
    the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 1) While a great deal has been said about what zoning ought to do, very little
    has been said about what zoning actually does to the city and its inhabitants.</p>
  <p> 2) Although zoning is the most widespread tool of land-use control and urban
    planning in the United States, there is almost no evidence, logical or empirical,
    to indicate whether or not zoning accomplishes the goals and purposes attributed
    to it by planners and other proponents.</p>
  <p> 3) There is almost no evidence to indicate that the unzoned city is substantially
    different from, or substantially similar to, the zoned city.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[21] </em></strong></font></p>

<p>Planners, of course, respond by saying that they have been given too little
  power and that their designs needed to be incorporated more widely, comprehensively,
  and stringently over broader regions. To their way of thinking, it is the balkanization
  of municipal plans, as well as their tepid injunctions, that account for failure.
  Zoning, they argue, needs the even more fundamental support of &quot;master
  plans,&quot; that is, more command-and-control instruments.</p>
<p>Zoning becomes captive of parochial interests &#8212; home owners, speculators,
  the highway industry, and building contractors &#8212; who naturally either
  resist or exploit the inexorable and evolutionary patterns of change. The political
  Right criticizes zoning for interfering with individual choice and rational
  land use,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[22]</em></strong></font> and the Progressive Center criticizes it for being outdated and
  rigid at best, unresponsive and destructive at worst. Alan Ehrenhalt, columnist
  for Governing Magazine, said,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> The postwar zoning codes discouraged the old pedestrian-scale Main Street
    corridors that had flourished before World War II, and encouraged their replacement
    with strip-mall-like businesses that provided large amounts of parking. They
    took the idea of segregated uses and pressed it much further than the original
    versions had dared go. The more distance they could create between residential,
    commercial and industrial uses, planners reasoned, the easier it would be
    to dissuade residents from escaping to greener pastures.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[23]</em></strong></font> </p>

<p>Implicit in all this is an authoritarian approach to land use decisions. It
  arises out of the notion that professionals &#8212; in this case planners
  &#8212; know best and that fragmented land use is an outgrowth of &quot;excessive
  localism&quot; and
  fragmented decision making and an inability to see the &quot;big picture.&quot; The
  report recognized the continuing influence of the classic approach of planners
  first put forth in the (congressional) Standard City Planning Act of 1928 and
  defined in detail in Edward Bassett's classic book <em>The Master Plan</em>.
  In that text, to influence planners for decades to come, three criteria determined
  the scope of a good plan: &quot;Each of the elements of the plan relates to
  land areas; has been stamped on land areas by the community for the community
  use; (and] can be shown on a map.&quot;<em><font size="-1"><strong>[24] </strong></font></em>Particularly
  revealing, and no doubt deliberate, is the use of the word &quot;stamp.&quot; The
  approach is autocratic, static rather than organic, and governmentally expensive.</p>

<p>  <strong>Urban Growth Boundaries</strong></p>
<p>  Urban growth boundaries (<strong>UGBs</strong>) are another panacea receiving
  great attention: the attempt to curtail outward growth by imposing a constraining
  girdle on
    development. Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado, are the exemplars,
    both having instituted their policies decades ago. In Boulder, however, the
    results are more the consequence of factors relating to topography and
  infrastructure service than to prohibition of outward extension.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[25]</em></strong></font> And
    Portland has been pressured to alter its boundary repeatedly as differential
    land values within
    and beyond the boundary induce growth patterns both unnatural and inefficient.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[26]</em></strong></font>  Landholders
    within the city endorsed it because it doubled their site values in a decade,
    which has meant that, relative to local income, housing is now
    more expensive than in any city except San Francisco.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[27] </em></strong></font>Inevitably,
    the economic pressures grew to the point of political crisis, at which time
    the
    policies were relaxed. This is because UGBs deal with symptoms rather than
    the root economic causes of the problem. In 1996, six Bay Area communities &quot;locked
    in&quot; long-term protection for the greenbelt by adopting a UGB covering
    a total of 3.75 million acres.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[28]</em></strong></font> For
    perspective, this translates to 5,860 square miles, an expanse equal to that
    of Connecticut and Rhode Island together.
    But only 731,000 acres, 1,142 square miles, are urbanized <font size="-1"><strong><em>[29]</em></strong></font> at
    the present time, and it could be a century before &quot;build-out&quot; and
    any significant impact from such measures occur. It was politically impossible
    to impose
    any smaller design, which illustrates the difficulty, and indeed the fallacy,
    of using a command-and-control device to constrain an inexorable economic
    force.</p>

    was the nation's 55th most affordable city just six years ago, it now ranks 165th
    out of 179.&quot; He points out that the increased land values have encouraged
    both in-filling and higher densities inside the growth boundary, while the individual
    lot sizes have gone from an average of 13,200 square feet when the growth boundary
    was first established to an average 8,700 square feet in the mid-1990s. This
    increased density has been an attraction to many residents, and it is now possible
    for 40 percent of the workers commuting to work in Portland to rely on public
    transportation (Alan Ehrenhalt, &quot;The Great Wall of Portland,&quot; Governing

  <strong>Elastic City Boundaries</strong></p>
<p>  The former mayor of Albuquerque, New Mexico, David Rusk, has made a name for
    himself promoting what he calls &quot;elastic cities.&quot;<em><font size="-1"><strong>[30]</strong></font></em> His answer
    is for municipalities to expand or combine their political boundaries in
    order to &quot;capture&quot; suburban growth in their tax base. In some cases,
    state laws must be passed to authorize this, overcoming the reluctance of
    suburbs to relinquish their privileged status. In those states where such
    annexation is permissible and has occurred, it might momentarily help address
    a shrinking tax base, but the urban configuration is unaltered and perhaps
    bloated. Consider, for example, the case of Columbus, Ohio, which in 1950
    had an incorporated area of only 39.9 square miles.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[31]</em></strong></font> The total number
    of square miles by 1967 had grown to 114 and in 1996 had almost doubled again
    to 206.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[32] </em></strong></font>One unwelcome consequence, however, is the reduction of farmland,
    which the city is now realizing.</p>

<p>  <strong>Stemming Sprawl: Pricing Measures for Transportation</strong></p>
<p>  From the foregoing, it is clear that insofar as the causes of sprawl development
    are economic, the solution needs to be economic as well. The equilibrium
    of forces can be restored in two ways: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1) by charging the true marginal costs
          of motor vehicle transportation to users and <br>2) by recovering the economic
              rent from urban site owners that is really the socially created
  value. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is easy to distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: capital
  investment, maintenance costs, regulation costs, environmental externalities,
  and congestion costs. Each of these calls for a different treatment with respect
  to revenue design. Capital costs are best recovered by recapturing the land
  rent proximate to the highway corridors. This is socially created value, which
  is better used to honor debt service of infrastructure investment than allowing
  it to be retained as windfall gains by titleholders to property close by.
  User fees, most aptly linked to the purchase of motor fuel and tire wear, serve
  as a proxy for the use of the roads and can be designed to be commensurate
  with use. As the wear and tear of roads as well as police patrol, snow and
  ice control, and signaling all involve operating and maintenance costs, such
  charges are easily linked with benefits received. In the future, still more
  accurate systems of service charges are likely to appear: Singapore, Hong Kong,
  and New Zealand are already reliant on electronic devices that record road
  use by time, place, and vehicle weight.</p>
<p>Ensuring the safety of drivers and vehicles through licenses, registrations,
  and inspections is most appropriately financed by fees commensurate with the
  costs of their administration. This way, if a vehicle is used but seldom, it
  is charged on the basis of its identification rather than assuming any projected
  level of use. Environmental externalities such as pollution costs can be linked
  to the polluting source, such as diesel fuel and gasoline consumption, to the
  full extent necessary to equilibrate air quality and other environmental ambiences.
  Congestion costs, the last of the major components of a pricing design for
  highway use, are partially paid for by the time loss of those caught in traffic.
  The costs of time lost due to highway congestion are enormous: In 2000, the
  average driver spent 62 hours sitting in traffic at a nationwide cost of $68
  billion in gas and time lost In Los Angeles, the average driver spent 136 hours
  stalled in traffic at an average cost of $2,510.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[33]</em></strong></font> Commuting times were also
  20 percent longer than they were a decade ago, about 22 minutes one way nationally
  on average but as high as 32 minutes on average in New York.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[34]</em></strong></font> But not all
  people's time is valued equally, and people themselves value their time differently
  at different times, and it is unfair to require people to impose their congestion
  on others. Therefore, congestion pricing, being explored in several urban regions,
  provides a rationing of limited highway space. In a sense, that payment for
  space usage, in time or money, is a form of land rent.</p>

<p><strong>  Stemming Sprawl Stemming Sprawl: Pricing Measures for Land Use</strong></p>
<p>  Just as recovering the costs of transportation service equilibrates costs
  and benefits on one side of the equation, recovering the economic rent accruing
    to land value facilitates efficient space configurations on the other side.
    Figure 10.2, again conceptually, portrays how the collection of various transportation
    user fees as well as the recovery of land rent corrects the economic distortions
    that today result in sprawl development. The shaded area indicates the pricing
    correctives necessary to ensure that neither urban nor rural land sites are
    disadvantaged in travel or location choices that individuals make for either
    residential or commercial purposes.</p>
<p>As it happens, collecting land rent is a relatively simple operation: It involves
  a small computer adjustment in the assessment base of what is now the local
  real property tax. The real property tax to an economist is really two separate
  taxes: that put on land value and that put on improvement values. A gradual
  phaseout of the tax on the improvement component, shifting totally to a tax
  on the land, recovers economic rent in a way that satisfies all the principles
  of sound tax theory.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[35]</em></strong></font> It
  is efficient, neutral, equitable, administrate, stable, and simple. It is also
  absolutely foolproof: One cannot hide land or
  take it to a remote tax haven. It relieves poor households (who typically own
  no land) of any tax burden and rewards those titleholders who use their sites
  efficiently. High-value sites are induced to construct high-value improvements,
  and low-value sites are left alone. In this way, central locations, where commercial
  enterprises typically locate, pay according to their intensity; home owners,
  who typically locate at the periphery of a neighborhood community, pay moderately;
  and agricultural land and forestlands pay little if anything. By an automatic
  and natural process, the centrifugal forces of sprawl development are reversed,
  and investment is encouraged in core locales. The higher density resulting
  affords the necessary ten to twelve households per acre (or the commercial
  equivalent) that makes public transportation service economically viable, lessening
  the prospect of automobile dependency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[36]</em></strong></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p>In addition, a tax on site value (that is, the collection of economic rent)
  restores moral principle to tax theory. By collecting rent on that value that
  is generated by the collective activity of the community, it offers the opportunity
  to relieve tax burdens on value that is generated by individual effort. Put
  another way, any value that individuals create by their own bodies and minds
  is left for them to keep; that which is socially created value is recovered
  by the community to pay for its collective purposes. &quot;Tax what you take,
  not what you make,&quot; is one way to say it. &quot;Tax bads, not goods,&quot; or &quot;Tax
  waste, not work,&quot; is another way. At the heart of this approach is a very
  profound message: The earth is the common heritage of humanity; it belongs
  to everyone. That which grows out of our own personal efforts and ingenuity
  is ours to keep, and no part of it should be subject to taxation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[37]</em></strong></font> Taxes
  on income, sales, savings, structures, and things that come from the sweat
  of our brow can be replaced by taxes on land rent &#8212; which, when all
  forms of it
  are included, is revenue source that can fully pay for the full services of
  government and is nonetheless essentially burden-less to taxpayers.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[38]</em></strong></font> What
  economists call the &quot;excess burden&quot; or &quot;deadweight loss&quot; of
  the current tax structure &#8212; by many calculations at least 25 percent<font size="-1"><strong><em>[39]</em></strong></font> &#8212;  is
  reduced to zero, thereby increasing our collective productivity by that amount
  That effectively makes us all 20 percent wealthier.</p>
