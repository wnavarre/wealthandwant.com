<b>Leaking Economic Value of
Communities</b>
<p>by Jeffery J. Smith</p>
</center>
<p>Wearing pajamas outdoors in the winter, one wouldn&#8217;t expect
to retain body heat. Yet, people do try to sustain community while
hemorrhaging its commonwealth. Losing it, residents must work more
than necessary.</p>
<p>When residents import food and energy, they deprive others in the
community of income. Yet, the loss pales when compared to paying
mortgages and [income] taxes. A recent
study of Oakland, CA found torrents of dollars pumped out of town
headed for the treasuries of distant capitols and the bank vaults of
distant lenders.</p>
<p>While mortgages and interest elevate an elite elsewhere, they keep
debtors on a treadmill at home. To those anxious over every next
payment, how appealing is an economy no longer expanding its girth?
In addition, what&#8217;s their debt for? Credit? The total savings of
all members of a community should suffice. Local bank "used to" be
the norm.</p>
<p>The other major drain, taxes, at about 40% of the average
worker&#8217;s income, usually total more than the value of government
services received. And who receives them? Corporate loggers, miners,
factory farms, and tractor trailers. Lose such subsidies, leveling
the playing field, and local recyclers, family farmers, and freight
haulers could compete. Their success would plug the visible leaks -
imported food, energy, and materials.</p>
<p>While a community might not be able to command a distant capitol
to turn off the subsidies, a locality may be able to avoid federal
and state taxes. Besides Callenbach&#8217;s ecotopian secession, there
are a host of legalisms for a wanton community to entice a big,
hiring firm - tax breaks like TIFs, Redevelopment Districts,
Enterprise Zones, etc. Why not use them to liberate not just one
company but the entire community from outside taxes?</p>
<p>Cutting out outsiders&#8217; taxes means the locality would have to
take over providing the outsiders&#8217; services: nuclear power
plants, toxic dumps, scarifying freeways, submarines, whatever. To
pay for whatever desired services, from where will the city or county
get the money? From themselves, their commonwealth. It&#8217;s the
money they spend on the nature they use, the prices and rents paid
for sites and resources.</p>
<p>How can communities capture that flow of natural values and keep
it circulating locally? Get local government to charge some kind of
land use fee. Depending on state law, the locality could replace the
property tax with a site value tax, raise the fee for defending
deeds, levy a fee for resource use, and/or resurrect ancient land
dues.</p>
<p>No matter what the mechanism, as the community collects more of
its value, that leaves less for owners to capitalize into price; as
land dues rise, land prices must fall. Cheap land means buyers need
borrow less, shrinking mortgages. Less demand for credit also drops
the lending rate. Deflated profits makes real estate less attractive
to mega-banks, more suitable to local lenders.</p>
<p>Not only would it plug the leaks of loans and outside taxes,
collecting land value would also spur efficient use of land, making
cities compact, less auto-infested (see "Suburbonomics" in the summer
issue of Terrain at www.terrain.org).</p>
<p>Northwest Environmental Watch calls shifting taxes from homes (and
other useful things) to locations "the sprawl tax". The property tax
shift has become the cutting-edge proposal of the Sierra Club,
Friends of the Earth, Sustainable America, and others. Ernest
Callenbach wrote that if he had heard of site-value taxation earlier,
he would have included it in his classic novel, Ecotopia.</p>
<p>Forgoing natural values makes sustaining community tough. Where
communities improve infrastructure - pave a bike path, clear an
amphitheater, recycle gray water, bury their transmission lines -
they attract people. Where people do community well&#8212;vote,
volunteer, host block parties, join neighborhood watch, organize
open-air markets&#8212;they draw people. People moving in push up the
cost to live there. Rising values attract speculators who further
inflate site values.</p>
<p>Inflated land values require heavier mortgages and are afforded by
high-income people paying high taxes. Expanding infrastructure to
accommodate growth forces local government to raise taxes or borrow.
Many people who made their community attractive can no longer afford
to live there.</p>
<p>Were a community to collect its own values, it could not only
afford its public services; most places would also end up with a
surplus that they could disburse as a local dividend (a la
Alaska&#8217;s oil dividend). The author of <i>Steady-State
Economics</i>, Herman Daly, noted this possibility. Receiving this
"rent share," people could live where they love, love where they
live.</p>
<p>Community, where we live, and economy, how we live, cannot be
separated. As long as communities leak economic value, they cannot
sustain themselves in a steady-state, like the skinny guy with a
tapeworm wondering why he&#8217;s always hungry. By reclaiming land
values, a community plugs its leaks so residents can sustain the
lives of nature and neighborhood.</p>
