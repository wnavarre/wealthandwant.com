<p><a name="Introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The &#8216;real world&#8217; in which human society exists is not
confined to natural, physical phenomena. From earliest times, human
beings have interacted socially and economically. As they do so, they
have specialised and traded in goods and services which are the
products of combinations of labour, capital, enterprise and the
fourth &#8211; often forgotten but distinct &#8211; factor of all production:
land.</p>
<p>Land comprises all natural resources, not just &#8216;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">terra
firma</span>.&#8217; It is the universe minus man&#8217;s products. Even the
simplest of human activities, sleep, requires each of us to occupy
exclusively a space, a location, preferably a bed in a home of our
own. But that word &#8216;own&#8217; conjures emotions and political
postures.</p>
<p>As everyone who deals in real estate knows, there are three most
important things about their stock in trade: location, location and
location! Because the market value attached to locations varies over
space and time, our real world conceals a shifting and invisible
&#8216;land-value-scape&#8217;. We can see the roof-tops and admire (or
deplore) the physical view. We can measure the bricks and timber in
three dimensions. We cannot see the fourth dimension, the fourth
factor that comprises 20% to 60% of the market value of our homes:
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8216;v&#8217; or value of land per unit area</span>.
But we know it is
there.</p>
<p>Just as every point on the surface of planet Earth has a
&#8216;z&#8217; that defines its place in the landscape, so every
location has a value in the global economy. This value is a function
of three things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>content (soil, air or water quality; metallic
composition of rock);  </li>
  <li>accessibility (position in relation to human
society); and  </li>
  <li>the wealth of that particular community.</li>
</ul>
Unlike other, natural, phenomena in the real world, the
landvaluescape changes over time and space at a fairly rapid and
often unpredictable rate. Value only has meaning where there is both
human knowledge of the existence of a place and its natural wealth
potential <b>and</b> the possibility of converting that potential
into products that others will wish to buy. Knowledge of places and
utility of resources vary with time, as do the workings of markets:
physical means of exchange of goods.
<p>For example, the discovery of a new continent immediately gives
value to the place in the minds of the crew of the ship that
discovers it &#8211; as does the discovery of the mysteries of the
genetic code in a plant species or the broadcast spectrum. Unless the
ship&#8217;s captain charts the discovery and brings the chart safely
back to port &#8211; with the plants of the continent &#8211; or
transmits the information about it through the air-waves,
&#8216;discovery&#8217; has no value in any market place. Whether we
talk about value in exchange or value in use, the measure of
&#8216;v&#8217; given to a location depends on social context.</p>
<p>The most important difference between measuring &#8216;v&#8217; and
measuring &#8216;z&#8217; is that there is no single objective value of
any location, other than at those somewhat rare points in time when
real estate is traded, when market price is the surrogate for market
value. Even then, transactions that are to form the basis of market
valuations need, in theory, to be made in certain idealised
conditions, such as open competition between buyers and sellers. All
potential parties to the transaction should have perfect information
about other similar contemporaneous transactions &#8211; and be in an
&#8216;arms length&#8217; relationship. Contracting parties are assumed
to be of sound mind! No two transactions in real estate are ever
identical in every respect and the number of factors than can affect
price or value is enormous.</p>
<p>Valuation of real estate is tricky. Separation of the value of
land/location from the value of land-and-buildings combined is even
more tricky. So is it worth the effort involved in replacing
&#8216;z&#8217; with &#8216;v&#8217; in a three-dimensional model of
landvaluescape, in order to visualise what is going on in economies
in the geo-spatial sense? Are value maps valuable?</p>
<p>The unavoidable subjectivity in assigning value to land or
locations is what many geographers, more used to mapping physical
features, find discomforting about value mapping (Dale, 2002).
Mapping things of less importance that can be measured more precisely
and objectively, is preferred to mapping property values (accounting
for at least twenty percent of the global economy) that cannot
objectively be measured at all.</p>
<p>Yet value maps have been attempted for various reasons for about
one hundred years and are becoming a fairly common feature of the
property industry in some advanced countries. The last known
comprehensive survey of global practice in value mapping was over
twenty years ago, before the widespread use of the personal computer
(PC), computer aided mass assessment (CAMA) of property values and
geographic information systems (GIS). The author concluded:-</p>
<blockquote><i>&#8220;Value maps will increasingly play a major part in
research into the causes and effects of changes in land and property
values.</i>&#8221; (Howes, 1980)</blockquote>
<p><a name="The hypothesis"></a><b>The hypothesis</b></p>
<p>This paper describes the background and scope to a research
project which sets out to test the hypothesis that
&#8220;Landvaluescape Visualisation&#8221; is worth developing as a
fusion of GIS and CAMA, in the specific context of the United Kingdom
(UK) but with reference and relevance to global governance. The
project forms the basis of a doctoral degree programme commenced by
the author in 2001, at the invitation of Kingston University School
of Surveying and under the aegis of Progressive Forum International
(PFI), an initiative of the Henry George Foundation of Great Britain
(HGF).</p>
<p><a name="Background"></a><b>Background</b></p>
<p>The author came to this field of work from a career in defence
mapping, where he dealt with a wide range of applications for GIS
using geospatial physical map data of variable quality from/of many
countries and sources. Prior to that he was a construction engineer
and planner with several firms in England generically known as
<b>&#8216;speculative developers&#8217;. Their core business, he
learned from experience, was not necessarily to create homes, office
blocks and factories but to manipulate the property market in order
to profit from the uplift in land values that follows from decisions
by public officials and other entrepreneurs.</b> His on-site
construction management skills were needed to produce a steady
turnover, employ a minimum of labour and capital and minimise
inevitable losses on operations. <b>The real profits were made on
land deals, buying speculatively and holding sites out of use until
&#8216;ripe&#8217; for development.</b></p>
<p>The common thread between these two businesses is their dependence
on land-based information of imperfect quality. Success depends on
being able to obtain, combine and analyse the best available
collections of information about the real world &#8211; whether
physical or not &#8211; and apply them as knowledge more effectively
than competitors. If an army only ever went to war on full, accurate
information about the battlefield, it would never leave barracks!
Similarly if civil society, governments and property market players
only ever made decisions when maps, land registers and valuation
lists were in perfect shape, there would be no property market and no
government! Decision making takes place with less that perfect
&#8216;fit for purpose&#8217; information.</p>
<p><a name="Land Value and Property Taxatio"></a><b>Land Value and
Property Taxation</b></p>
<p>The seeds of this research were sown when the author left military
service in 1995 and embarked upon a career as an independent
consultant, also holding elected office as a local councillor and
member of a planning authority for two years. During this period he
studied the theory and practice of <span style="font-weight: bold;">land
value taxation (LVT)</span>,
co-authored a paper for the World Congress of Surveyors (Connellan,
McCluskey &amp; Vickers, 1998) on the role of surveyors in LVT and
helped review his party&#8217;s local government finance policy (which
includes a form of LVT). In 1998 he was introduced to HGF and invited
to run the Foundation, leaving it last month to concentrate on his
own research.</p>
<p>Property taxes have always been a major source of revenue for
governments, especially local governments. Their relative importance
declined around a hundred years ago, as classical economic theory was
eclipsed by the still ruling neo-liberal or Washington orthodoxy and
&#8211; for some seventy years &#8211; its formidable challenger
Marxist socialism. Both Marxist and neo-liberal economists share the
view that land is neither a factor distinct from capital nor
important in an industrial age.</p>
<p>Land conjures up visions of rolling prairies or Constable
landscapes, not skyscrapers or dark Satanic mills. Land reform was
indeed characterised during the latter half of the nineteenth and
early twentieth century in much of the now developed world by massive
increases in landless rural and urban poor, as economies switched
from subsistence agriculture to industrialised farming and then
manufacturing. It also invariably incorporated calls for
registration, sub-division and taxation of land. Henry George&#8217;s
book<a href="../George_P&P.html"> <b><i>Progress and
Poverty</i></b></a><a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"> </a>massively out-sold Marx&#8217;
<b><i>Das Capital</i></b> and policies based on his Single Tax (on
land values) achieved remarkable results as far apart as China,
Japan, Chile, Australia, Denmark and the USA (Andelson, 2000).
Between 1915 and 1975 the use of LVT was generally in steep decline,
although many local jurisdictions that were given the choice to adopt
it continued to do so. Taxes based on land-and-buildings, typically
like the British rating system, also declined in relative importance.
Nevertheless the vast majority of developed countries continue to
value property for tax purposes and many assess land/site values
separately from building values, even where they do not levy a land
tax at a separate rate. There is some evidence that, with the
collapse of Communism and the globalisation of capitalism, the
importance of land as a source of public revenue may be increasing.
This is because most other taxable entities are mobile and can with
increasing ease escape the grasp of national &#8211; let alone local
&#8211; treasuries. Location is local: it cannot be moved, hence a tax
on the economic rent of land and other fixed natural resources cannot
be evaded. Nor can it be passed on, as are taxes on wages and
profits, to the consumer via the supply chain, thus adding to
inflation.</p>
<p><b>Rent will remain with the owner unless and until recovered for
the community that created it, through taxation. On the other hand,
economies competing for the active agents of production &#8211;
capital and labour &#8211; are engaged in a &#8216;race to the
bottom&#8217; of lower tax rates on corporations and high-paid
individuals.</b> Governments wishing to invest in public services are
finding the most secure source of revenue is the property tax. And
within the range of possible property taxes, studies have shown that
cities which shift taxes off buildings onto land values out-compete
those who do not (Plassman &amp; Tideman, 1999; Hartzok, 1997).</p>
<p>This paper is not the place to make the case for LVT, although it
is often claimed to be a tax that supports better land use (Rogers,
1999; Evans &amp; Bate, 2000; Jacobs, 2000). In the context of this
paper, the point of this section is to emphasise that there is a very
common source of data on property values: the tax assessors&#8217;
office. Even if the Assessor is not actually using land values for
tax purposes, CAMA enables the land element of gross property
assessments to be extracted (Gloudemans, 2001). Where land value data
are available they can be used for purposes other than taxation,
especially when GIS are applied to them and value maps are produced
(German et al, 2000).</p>
<p><a name="Distinguishing land from buildi"></a><b>Distinguishing
land from buildings</b></p>
<p>The Nobel-winning economist William Vickrey said that the property
tax is actually two different taxes (Vickrey 1991). That is because
buildings are capital, not land, in the economic sense &#8211; even
if, in most legal codes, there is no distinction between land and
improvements made to it which are all lumped together as &#8216;landed
property&#8217; or real estate. Buildings and other improvements to
land all depreciate over time unless further capital is expended.
Eventually the market value of such <i>improvements</i> may become
negative, owing to the costs that would need to be incurred by
someone wishing to redevelop the site for an alternative use. But
that does not necessarily take away the rental value of the
<i>site</i>.</p>
<p>Much urban blight is caused by these so-called &#8216;brown
field&#8217; vacant and under-used sites. However they are often in
valuable locations, with good transport connections. It may be that
owners are speculating that land prices will rise and enable them to
sell at greater profit in the future than now, or it may be that
there is genuinely no market for sites in a particular location
unless the cost of remediation is subsidised as a form of public
investment. Such investment, according to Vickrey and other followers
of Henry George, can be entirely funded from LVT. In a lecture given
in 1991, first published last year, Vickrey claimed:</p>
<blockquote><i>&#8220;Cities have the capacity to be fully self-financing
without dependence on either federal assistance or on general taxes
that are unrelated to benefits received.&#8221;</i></blockquote>
<p>The proviso, according to Vickrey, is to replace the tax on
buildings with a tax on land value alone &#8211; LVT:-</p>
<blockquote><i>&#8220;The property tax combines one of the best and one of
the worst taxes we have. The portion that falls on sites or land values
is the only major tax that is reasonably free of distortionary effects
and is not intolerably regressive&#8221;.</i></blockquote>
<p>Taxing buildings and work done to improve them discourages such
work. Un-taxing them and taxing land more highly, irrespective of its
actual state of development but based upon its <i>highest and best
immediate potential use</i>, will encourage owners to maintain their
sites and buildings in such a way as to maximise their income. <i>A
remote site or one with conservation or other restrictions will have
a low site value, hence attract low taxes, whereas a high value city
centre derelict site will very soon be redeveloped.</i> The extra
property tax revenue from extending the tax base to sites that are
currently under-taxed (because the tax is based primarily on
building/rental value not site/owner value), ensures public
infrastructure projects can be funded without resource to general
taxes or excessive borrowing on the financial markets.</p>
<p>Mapping &#8216;roof values&#8217; (combined land-and-building
values) is more difficult and less useful than mapping land values.
It is more difficult because to value buildings each one has to be
physically inspected, which requires skill and time. Adjacent
buildings can be quite different, even where their use is similar: an
old, run-down low-rise office block might be next to a new high-rise
one. The resulting value map will reveal more about the individual
enterprise and stewardship of occupiers of sites than it will reveal
about the state of economic health of the local community.</p>
<p>By contrast, land values can be assessed largely from maps and
documents: a sort of &#8216;remote sensing&#8217;. Especially where the
planning system uses strict zoning, it will be clear what the
potential &#8216;highest and best&#8217; use of each site is.
<b>Assessed site value is the rent which a bare site at that location
(whether actually developed or not) would fetch on the open market if
sold for development at &#8216;highest and best&#8217; use, assuming
adjacent sites were all in their actual state.</b> Not only does the
land value assessor ignore &#8216;improvements&#8217; to the site, he
ignores contamination and other &#8216;negative&#8217; physical
realities. <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Gwartney/gwartneyestimatinglandval.htm">Gwartney
(1999)</a> sets out the basic theory and practice of assessing land
values.</p>
<p>The analogy with remote sensing methods for mapping topography is
useful. Just as a topographic mapper ignores man-made irregularities
that appear on the air photograph or satellite image when seeking to
trace ground contours, so the assessor ignores man-made features when
focusing on the site value of a developed site. The roofscape of a
city or the complex pattern of tree plantings in a commercial forest
can obscure the subtle but more regular shapes on the underlying
land, as well as the economic potential that landvaluescape reveals.
Just as nobody would dream of trying to map the intricate contours of
buildings, tree-tops or limestone pavements, similarly there is no
suggestion that value mapping of gross property values is useful: it
is the land values that we are after.</p>
<p>Assessors seeking to reveal landvaluescape would no more use
direct physical inspection of every property to produce their map
products than land surveyors would abandon remote sensing to return
to antique methods of chain, theodolite and plain-table to produce a
modern contour plot. CAMA produces land value maps that are not only
fit for purpose but far more cost effective than methods used for
gross property values.</p>
<p><a name="Problems with land value mappin"></a><b>Problems with
land value mapping</b></p>
<p>There are perceived to be three main problem areas with mapping
land values:</p>
<ul>
  <li>mathematics</li>
  <li>institutions</li>
  <li>public mind-set</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage, the author has only begun to define the scope of
each of these and to study what might be appropriate methods of
quantifying the scale of the problems.</p>
<p><a name="Mathematics"></a><b>Mathematics</b></p>
<p>The mathematical problems are in three areas: normalisation of
site values; &#8216;fuzziness&#8217; or toleration levels; smoothing
algorithms for surface generation. In simple terms:</p>
<blockquote>1. How do we reduce raw property market data from disparate
sources to a consistent form that can be compared and analysed?
  <p>2. How to we deal with the varying confidence levels that will be
attached to different values, according the quality and density of the
source data and the frequency of observation?</p>
  <p>3. How do we choose the best way to average or smooth out the
bumps in the landvaluescape when forming the model?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost all transactions in real estate are not of land alone but
of sites with buildings, crops or other &#8216;improvements&#8217;
(positive and negative in value). Also, although property taxes are
levied annually, many types of property in most countries are
normally bought and sold and not rented or leased &#8211; or the
leases are quite long. Various types of actual transaction data or
other less reliable sources of raw data about the property market
have to be surveyed. These must then all be reduced to either a
capital or a rental basis, depending on the property tax system in
use. If the tax is based on rental values for one type of property
and capital values for another (as in Britain), one set of data has
to be converted.</p>
<p>Normalisation, as this is called, comes within the skills of
experienced professional valuers, although it is not in everyday use
by the British rating specialists who would be expected to lead any
reforms in the UK towards LVT or CAMA. The three most common methods
of property assessment (comparative sales, construction cost, and
income analysis) are all capable of providing either market or rental
value, although the first two normally produce a capital figure and
the third produces a rental figure. An assumption has to be made in
each case about either depreciation, inflation or interest rate
&#8211; or all three.</p>
<p>Once all available actual transaction data have been normalised,
application of CAMA or a high degree of professional judgement are
necessary to extrapolate from these &#8216;bench mark&#8217; properties
to the remainder.</p>
<p>This is where computers come in. When Howes undertook his survey
of global value mapping in the late 1970s, he found very few
large-scale examples of the art. Value mapping was mainly used for
research or development studies of limited areas: a redevelopment
site, traffic scheme or at most a city centre. <b>Lichfield (1956)
describes the problems of value mapping in the pre-computer age,
while setting out the theoretical benefits of doing it and also
pointing to rating (property tax) lists as the best source of data.
Nowadays not only can computers handle vast quantities of data, they
can easily produce useful &#8216;meta-data&#8217; &#8211; information
about data, both input and output.</b> The products of CAMA are not
just land and property values for each unit of taxable real estate
but estimates of the reliability of each of these values. These can
be tested against subsequent real transactions and the model
landvaluescape continuously adjusted along with market trends.
Information about the quality of assessments is nearly as useful as
the assessments themselves, where costly legal appeal might otherwise
result.</p>
<p>Using methods such as linear or multiple regression analysis, CAMA
empirically resolves the values of dozens &#8211; or even hundreds
&#8211; of variable factors that might be supposed to affect the value
of property and which can be objectively measured. Examples are: type
of construction, usable floor area, number of car spaces, age of
structure, number of floors, has basement, view over water. Having
solved for each of these, it seems to be increasingly accepted that
the residual value is accounted for solely by location. Given just a
few transactions in bare land per thousand properties to
&#8216;ground&#8217; the overall model, an estimate of the current land
value of each site can be deduced. Gloudemans (2001) suggests this
could enable LVT to be successfully introduced in areas with
transparency in property market information, even where is little
direct evidence of land values.</p>
<p>In areas where there is a steep &#8216;gradient&#8217; or complex
&#8216;terrain&#8217; in land values, over either space or time, it is
important to choose the right algorithm for smoothing out the
irregularities that will show in a first pass through CAMA. This is a
problem with GIS generally, where values are associated with
non-regular planimetric shapes. It is known as either the Modifiable
Area Unit or Ecological Fallacy problem and occurs with conventional
landscape mapping as well as with mapping of other socio-economic
phenomena. It is particularly important with property taxation,
because it affects individual finances. Put simply, tax bills can end
up badly wrong unless CAMA uses the right maths. The more that land
values are changing over space and time, and the higher the property
tax rate, the more important this issue will be. Finally, the
generation of isovals or contours from the model involves further
approximation and smoothing. Lichfield (1956) discussed the
theoretical problems long before computers came into use. Now that
the theory can be turned into practice, the mathematics of isoval
generation needs to be addressed in earnest as part of the design of
an effective tool for landvaluescape visualisation. It is worth
noting however, that Lichfield was concerned with the use of land
value maps as an aid to urban planners and not in connection with
property tax administration.</p>
<p><a name="Institutions"></a><b>Institutions</b></p>
<p>Whilst land surveyors world-wide have experienced two or three
wholesale revolutions in technology since the computer was invented,
valuation surveyors in Britain have barely experienced one. The
national rating lists are held on a main-frame computer with a
largely 1970s operating system that has been upgraded rather than
re-engineered. Value maps in the public sector are still almost
unheard of in the UK, whilst GIS has become <i>de rigeur</i> for
local authorities and many other public bodies.</p>
<p>The reason is probably largely to do with the political and
emotional nature of property. Few things are more political than
land, information and tax, so that attempts to reform systems and
laws that enable information about property to be assembled in order
to tax it are bound to be controversial. Countries that exhibit a
stable political and cultural environment seem to find it hard to
give priority to reform of property tax. History seems to show that
the best time to introduce land reform is when there is already a
political transition, e.g. Eastern Europe after Communism and South
Africa after Apartheid.</p>
<p>The last serious riots in Britain accompanied the infamous Poll
Tax in 1989, when a property tax was replaced by a tax based on
head-count. Most commentators agree that the rating system came into
disrepute largely because Governments failed to commission a national
re-valuation: the rating lists were 17 years old by 1988. Similarly
Germany now has property assessments that are between 35 and 60 years
old, which has caused the Federal courts to express concern over
human rights: owners of new homes are taxed on the basis of
up-to-date assessments, while their neighbours pay much lower tax
based on very old assessments (Josten, 2001).</p>

<p>Until 2000 it was impossible in England and
Wales<font size="-2"><b><i>1</i></b></font> to discover the price
paid for a property, even though that information had to be supplied
to the income tax authorities for calculation of capital gains and
inheritance tax liabilities. The ownership of registered land only
became accessible to the general public in 1990 and it is unlikely to
be possible to find out who owns a particular site unless it has been
the subject of a recent transaction, because England &amp; Wales do
not have a complete Land Register. All information about land
ownership has been regarded as private. Laws regulating the use of
land and rights to develop it have similarly &#8211; not just in
Britain &#8211; generally been the subject of hot dispute. Even where
there is much greater transparency in property market information,
the subject of property taxation &#8211; and assessment for taxation
&#8211; has been highly political, in a way that information about the
physical landscape is not.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-1">1 Scotland has had an open Land Register
for much longer.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Devolution is taking place in the UK and may be the catalyst for
tax and other reforms. In England the main databases (land registry,
topographic mapping, valuation lists) are under different ministries,
leading to problems in policy integration for the National Land
Information Service (NLIS) initiative. By contrast all three
functions come under a single minister in Northern Ireland. Dale
(2002) points to the need for joined-up policy making if land
information is to be used effectively. Wales, although not having, as
yet, legislative freedom to change taxes, has already shown since
executive functions were democratically devolved to the Synedd in
Cardiff in 1999, that innovative changes in tax administration are
not difficult. The will to change seems to come from a simple
competitive urge to show that Wales can do better than England, if
given the chance.</p>
<p>Even where there is LVT, the quality of land value information can
be highly questionable because of lack of transparency rather than
innate inability to discover land value. In Taiwan the official
assessment authority is not allowed access to actual property
transaction information (Tsai, 2001), forcing it to rely on
second-best sources to main the valuation lists. In Pittsburgh, LVT
was suspended by the City Council in 2001 after the county sacked all
its local assessors and hired a company with no local knowledge and a
poor understanding of the workings of LVT to undertake revaluation by
CAMA. This revealed systematic under-valuation of land by the
previous tax officials but replaced it with assessments that appeared
to many to have no systematic basis at all (Vickers, 2002).</p>
<p>Ironically it is the very globalisation that many
environmentalists oppose that may help force open information about
land ownership and value and regularise assessment systems. Investors
are demanding more transparency in property market information in
order to reduce risk and global investors have more clout than local
ones. A free market in property can no more exist in the absence of
full information than it can for any commodity. Not only does
information need to be complete and consistent, it must be produced
and presented in a standardised form. Increasingly national valuation
standards and procedures for tax assessment are giving way to - or
having to exist alongside - international standards, where true
market valuations are demanded by investors.</p>
<p>Many tax assessors are politically appointed and their assessments
are influenced significantly by their desire to remain in favour with
local politicians and voter interests. Even the frequency of
reassessments for taxation can be influenced by political
considerations, as happened in Britain. Investors demand impartiality
and expect to be able to compare property values across political
boundaries, which is seldom required of tax assessors, whose concern
is merely local relativity.</p>
<p><a name="Public mind-set"></a><b>Public mind-set</b></p>
<p>Given the political nature of the subject of LVT, this research is
giving high priority to finding out the public perceptions of issues
such as property taxation, sustainable development and value mapping.
If there is to be the political will to reform laws and processes so
that LVT and value mapping are possible, then it is felt that there
must first be public education about the nature of landvaluescape and
the effect that different forms of taxation have on environmental
policy and local economies.</p>
<p>As part of the author&#8217;s David C. Lincoln Fellowship in LVT,
begun in 1999 and ending this year, a series of surveys has been
conducted among property tax stakeholders. Sixteen
&#8216;statements&#8217; were drawn up after consulting representatives
of stakeholder groups such as GIS professionals, local government
officials, property assessors and business taxpayers. A questionnaire
was mailed to over 3000 individuals to elicit their views on matters
relating to the possible introduction of LVT to Britain, replacing
the present business rating system. The results of this postal survey
indicated a strong underlying support for and understanding of many
of the principles of LVT. In particular respondents expressed
overwhelming support for the use of GIS to help them understand how a
property tax was based; they also agreed strongly that LVT was likely
to help achieve urban renewal (Vickers, 2000).</p>
<p>Since the five percent response to the first survey was a
self-selecting sample, the second stage of this Fellowship repeated
the survey using face-to-face interviewing. A hundred business owners
in Liverpool, one of the most economically depressed cities in
Britain, were faced with the same statements, their responses then
compared with those from 25 businesses in a contrasting town of full
employment, Newbury, as control. Liverpool City Council is the only
local authority in the UK to have formally asked Government to be
allowed to pilot LVT. Once again, these interviews showed strong
support for LVT and for the use of value maps as a tool for gaining
understanding of its workings (Vickers, 2002).</p>
<p>A demonstration using data supplied by Lucas County Ohio has been
shown to professional groups throughout the UK, as well as to the
Valuation Office Agency (VOA) in London, which is seeking to improve
the acceptability of the existing business rate system. VOA currently
spends four times as much on contesting appeals against property
assessments as it does on producing the rating lists: it feels that
greater involvement of taxpayers in producing the assessments,
perhaps using value maps, may save money overall.</p>
<p>In this year&#8217;s final Fellowship exercise, a number of
discussion groups will be held in Liverpool, at which the results of
a trial land valuation of part of the city will be revealed using
GIS. The purpose is to make it easier for the implications of LVT to
be understood and aired, as well as to design GIS products that meet
this need. There will be an element of cartographic design needed to
produce contour and chloropleth maps that effectively communicate the
landvaluescape to those who need to understand how it changes and how
that affects them: planners, tax administrators, local politicians
and citizens in general.</p>
<p>It is expected that GIS will help gain acceptance for LVT and
might help improve property tax assessments and reduce appeal rates
where these are currently high. However in Denmark, where appeal
rates are already very low and LVT is established, the decision has
recently been made not to use GIS and value maps as part of the
national tax administration.<b> Denmark seems in many respects to
have a model property tax system: assessments are revised every year
and published in telephone directories</b>; there is no apparent
public dissatisfaction with LVT or the property tax in general;
Danish tax administrators act as consultants to many countries in
political transition. Although Denmark was one of the first countries
to have nation-wide LVT and to use handcompiled land value maps, it
has now ceased to use them just when they would seem to have become
easier than ever to compile (M&uuml;ller, 2000).</p>
<p>The value of value maps in helping to change the public mind-set
and hence apply pressure on politicians and institutions to improve
property taxation is questionable. Without good property assessments
and the use of CAMA, it is likely that land value maps will remain
fairly unconvincing. Yet convincing value maps may be needed to
persuade governments to spend money on improving property assessment.
By focusing resources on one or two pilot areas in the UK, it is
hoped that both LVT and value maps will be proved worthwhile.</p>
<p><a name="Current State of Value Mapping"></a><b>Current State of
Value Mapping</b></p>
<p>With the assistance of the F&eacute;deration Internationale
G&eacute;ometrique (World Congress of Surveyors &#8211; FIG) and the
research department of a British property consultancy, the author has
recently piloted a questionnaire &#8220;Value Maps and Global
Governance&#8221; to establish the current state of global practice in
property assessment and value mapping. Sixteen responses from four
continents have been received. Virtually all respondents&#8217;
countries have computerised national mapping and map-based land
ownership registers. The majority value land separately from
improvements, even though most do not have LVT. About half already
use CAMA and others are considering doing so, all use GIS
extensively.</p>
<p>Among the comments received from those who are actively involved
in the field are these. Rudd Kathmann, of the Netherlands Council for
Real Estate Assessors, states: <i>&#8220;value maps are used for
analysing results of CAMA assessments and market
developments&#8221;</i>. Professor Kauko Viitanen of the Institute of
Real Estate Studies at Helsinki University says: <i>&#8220;We are
using many kinds of value maps in tax, statistics, market analysis,
planning, etc.&#8221; </i>Chan Hak of the Hong Kong Lands Department
claims: <i>&#8220;Value maps would be widely used not just by
government departments but also the private sector&#8221;.</i></p>
<p>Late in 2001 HGF was approached by a consortium of European
bodies, mainly local and regional governments, who had seen from the
Foundation&#8217;s web-site that we were engaged in research on LVT
and value mapping. As a result PFI has participated in two major bids
for European Commission (EC) funding, with the encouragement of the
EC&#8217;s own Land Management Unit at the Institute for Environment
and Sustainability, part of the Joint Research Centre of EC based in
Italy. The first bid, to set up a network of European organisations
to share best practice in - and help develop policies that &#8211;
support sustainable urban development, was not successful because it
was seen as too ambitious in scope. The second bid, submitted
February, is for a project named MURSUS (Monitoring URban
SUStainability) that aims to define the monitoring requirements and
consequent data requirements of a European-wide Urban Monitoring
Information System (UMIS).</p>
<p>The fact that researchers responsible for advising the EC on
sustainable urban development consider that land values are likely to
form part of UMIS seems to show that property tax assessments ought
to be considered as potentially useful beyond the tax assessment
office of public authorities. Value maps are known to be in
commercial use, helping provide competitive advantage to property
consultants assembling market data from clients, governments and
other sources, monitoring the economic landscape for private and
corporate gain.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a year ago the campaigning environmental
organisation Friends of the Earth (FoE) joined PFI, calling for
governments to act together in making a &#8216;green tax shift&#8217;
away from dysfunctional taxes on jobs and enterprise and onto
pollution and natural resource usage. FoE sees LVT as a key
environmental tax and supports the setting up in the UK of a Citizens
Sustainable Taxation Commission. A report was published earlier this
year by PFI that concluded more needs to be done to help politicians
and the public understand the need for more sustainable taxation and
for LVT as part of this (Oshitani, 2002). Value mapping could be part
of this public education. It is not only land values that can be
mapped: there are spatial variations in the value of airspace,
shipping lanes and aircraft landing slots.</p>
<p>It would seem that the time is ripe for governments themselves to
explore the possibilities of value mapping, as a tool for achieving
better land use as well as more equitable and sustainable tax
systems. However there remain formidable problems to be overcome in
most countries, both technical and institutional, if these
possibilities are to be realised. It is hoped that more resources
will be deployed to research the problems outlined in this paper and
that PFI, launched this month here and at FIG in Washington, can be
the catalyst to help co-ordinate and disseminate the results of such
research for public benefit.</p>
