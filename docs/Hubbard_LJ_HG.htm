    include the widest generalizations of political economy.</em></p>
  <p align="right">     &#8212; Henry George</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry George died in 1897. Ten 
  years have passed since men heard his voice, looked on his strong,  lithe,
  active form, saw the gleam of his honest eyes, and felt the  presence of a
man &#8212; a man who wanted nothing and gave everything &#8212; a man who gave
himself. </p>
<p>Ten
  years!</p>
<p>And in those years the world has experienced, and is now passing  through,
  a peaceful revolution such as men have never before seen.  Those years have
given us a new science of religion; a new education; a new penology; a new healing
art; a new method in commerce. </p>
<p>The wisdom of honesty as a business asset is nowhere questioned, and  the
clergy has ceased to call upon men to prepare for death. We are preparing to
live, and the way we are preparing to live is by living.</p>
<p>The remedy Henry George prescribed for economic ills was as simple as 
  it was new, and new things and simple things are ever looked on as
  objectionable. The universality of conservatism proves that it must
  have its use and purpose in the eternal order. It keeps us from going
  too fast; it prevents us from bringing about changes for which mankind
is not prepared. Nature's methods are evolutionary, not revolutionary.</p>
<p>Slaves can not be made free by edict. Moses led his people out of only
  one kind of captivity, and in the wilderness they wandered in bondage
  still. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation did not free the colored
  race, because it is the law of God that he who would be free must free
  himself. A servile people are slaves by habit, and habit is the only  fetter. Freedom, like happiness, is a condition of mind. A whining,
  complaining, pinching, pilfering class that listens for the whistle,
  watches the clock, that works only when under the menacing eye of the
  boss, and stands in eternal fear of the blue envelope here, and
  perdition hereafter, can never be made free by legislative enactment.
  Freedom can not be granted, any more than education can be imparted,
  both must be achieved, or we yammer forever without the pale. A
  simple, strong and honest people are free. People enslaved by
  superstition and ruled by the dead have work at filing fetters ahead
of them, which only they themselves can do. </p>
<p>Henry George did not
  realize this, and his strength lay in the fact that he did not. He did
  not know when men get the crook out of their backs, the hinges out of
  their knees, and the cringe out of their souls, that then they are
  free. Slaves place in the hands of tyrants all the power that tyrants
  possess. </p>
<p>Fortunate it was for Henry George, and for the world, that he
  did not know that any man who labors to help the working man will be
  mobbed by the proletariat for his pains a little later on. Monarchies
  maybe ungrateful, but their attitude is a sweet perfume compared to
  the ingratitude of the laborer. He can be helped only by stealth, and
  his freedom must come from within. </p>
<p>The moral weakness of man is the
  one thing that makes tyranny possible.</p>
<p>Tyranny is a condition in the heart of serfs. Tyrants tyrannize only
  over people of a certain cast of mind. Tyrants are men who have stolen
  power &#8212; convicts who have wrested guns from their guards. Watch them,
  and in a little while they will again shift places. Henry George was a
  very great man &#8212; great in his economic, prophetic insight; great in
  his
  faith, his hope, his love. He gave his message to the world, and
  passed on, scourged, depressed, undone, because the world did not
accept the truths he voiced. </p>
<p>Yet all for which he strived and
  struggled will yet come true &#8212; his prayer will be answered. </p>
<p>And the
    political parties and the men who in his life opposed him, are now
  adopting his opinions, quoting his reasons, and in time will bring
  about the changes he advocated. Of all modern prophets and reformers,
  Henry George is the only one whose arguments are absolutely
  unanswerable and whose forecast was sure.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * </p>
<p>Henry George was that rare, peculiar and strange thing &#8212; an honest
  man.  Whether he had genius or not we can not say, since genius has never  been
  defined twice alike, nor put in the alembic and resolved into its  constituent parts. </p>
<p>All accounts go to show that from very childhood  Henry George was singularly
  direct and true. His ancestry was Welsh,  Scotch and English in about equal
  proportions, and the traits of the  middle class were his, even to a theological
  sturdiness that robbed  his mind of most of its humor. Reformers must needs
  be color-blind,  otherwise they would never get their work done &#8212; they
  see red or purple  and nothing else. </p>
<p>Born in Philadelphia in 1839, on Tenth Street, below Pine, in a
  house still standing, and  which
  should be marked with a bronze plate, but is not, Henry George  took on a good
  many of the moral traits of his Quaker neighbors. </p>
<p>His  father was a clerk in the Custom-House, having graduated from a  position
  as sea-captain on account of an excess of caution and a taste  for penmanship.
  Later the good man went into the publishing business,  backed by the Episcopal
  Church, and issued Sunday-School leaflets,  sermons and prayer-books. In fact,
  he became the official printer of  the denomination. With him was a man named
  Appleton, who finally went  over to New York and started in on his own account,
  founding the firm  of D. Appleton and Company, which forty years thereafter
  was to  publish to the world a book called, &quot;<strong><em>Progress and Poverty</em></strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>The worthy father of Henry George was a good Churchman, but not a  businessman.
  He bought the things he ought not, and left unsold the  things he should have
  worked off. He didn't know the value of time.  Other people did things while
he was getting ready to commence to begin.</p>
<p>And so the whirligig of time sent him back to his desk at the Custom-House,
  on a salary so modest that it meant poverty, and progress crab-fashion.</p>
<p>The children old enough to work got jobs, and Henry of the red hair  and freckles
  found a place as printer's devil at two dollars a week.  College was out of
  the question, and Girard Institute was regarded as  infidelic. However, episcopacy
  did not have quite so strong a hold  on this household as it once had. The
  Georges believed in freedom and  took William Lloyd Garrison's paper, &quot;<em>The
  Liberator</em>,&quot; and the mother  read it aloud by the light of a penny
  dip. Next came &quot;Uncle Tom's  Cabin,&quot; and when, in 1856,
  the Republican Party  was born, the George family, father, mother
  and children, all had  pronounced views on the subject of human rights &#8212; very
different views  from those held by the royal Georges of England. </p>
<p>When Henry George was 
  sixteen, the restlessness of coming manhood found expression, and he  shipped
  before the mast and sailed away to the Antipodes. The boy had  the small, compact
  form, the physical activity and  daring which  make a first-class sailor,
  but happily his brain was too full of ideas  to transform him into a dog of the sea.</p>
<p>A trip to Australia, with salt pork all the time, sea-biscuit every  day,
  lobscouse on Sundays, plum-duff once a month, and a total absence  of mental
stimulus, cured him of the idea that freedom was to be found on the bounding
wave and the rolling deep.</p>
<p>At seventeen he was back at the case, setting type and getting a man's
  pay because he was able to &quot;rastle the dic.,&quot; which means that he
  was
on familiar terms with the dictionary and could correct proof.</p>
<p>Education is a matter of desire, and the printer's case with bad copy
  to revise is better than &quot;English Twenty-two&quot; at Harvard. Henry George
  moused nights at the Quaker Apprentices' Library, and he also read
  Franklin's &quot;Autobiography;&quot; his mind was full of Poor Richard maxims,
  which he sprinkled through his diary; but best of all, with seven
  other printers he formed another &quot;Junta,&quot; and they met twice a week
  to
  discuss &quot;poetry, economics and Mormonism.&quot; It was very sophomoric,
  of
  course, but boys of eighteen who study anything and defend it in
  essays and orations are right out on the highway which leads to
  superiority. The trouble with the 'prentice is that he does not know
  how to spend his evenings; the love of leisure and the wish for a good
  time cause the moments to slip past him, out of his reach forever, out
into the great ocean of time.</p>
<p>Life is a sequence &#8212; the logical, farseeing mind is a cumulative
  consequence. Men who are wise at forty were not idle at twenty. &quot;Read
anything half an hour a day, and in ten years you will be learned,&quot; says
Emerson.</p>
<p>Henry George worked and read, and the &quot;Junta&quot; gave him the first
  taste
  of that intoxicating thing, thinking on one's feet. We grow by
  expression, and never really know a thing until we tell it to somebody
  else. Henry George was getting an education, getting it in the only
way any one ever can, or has, or does &#8212; getting it by doing.</p>
<p>But the wanderlust was again at work; California was calling &#8212; the
  land  of miracle &#8212; and printer's ink began to pall. Henry George was
  a  sailor; every part of a sailing ship was to him familiar &#8212; from bilge-water
  to pennant, from bowsprit to sternpost. He could swab the  mainmast, reef the
  topsail in a squall, preside in the cook's-galley, or if the mate were drunk
  and the captain ashore he could take charge
  of the ship, put for open sea and ride out the storm by scudding
  before the wind.</p>
<p>Ships in need of sailors were lying in the offing. </p>
<p>When young Henry
  George took a walk it was always along the docks. He knew every ship  there
  in the Delaware, and visited with the sailormen, who told of the  happenings
  in far-off climes. News from California much interested  him &#8212; California
  was another America, hopelessly separated from us by  an impassable range of
  forbidding mountains, reinforced with desert  plains, peopled only by hostile
  savages. But the sea was an open  highway to this land of enchantment. California
  called! And finally  Henry George overcame temptation by succumbing to it,
  and sailed away  southward in the staunch little ship &quot;Shubrick,&quot; bound
  for the modern  Eldorado by way of Cape Horn. It was a six months' passage,
  with many  stops and much trading, and time that seem lifted out of the calendar  and thrown away. </p>
<p>Henry George arrived in California penniless. But he
  had health and a willingness to work. He became a farmhand, a tramp
  pedlar, a laborer shoveling gravel into a sluice-way and standing all  day
  knee-deep in water. It was all good, for it taught the youth that
  life was life and wherever you go you carry your mental and spiritual
  assets, as well as your cares, on the crupper. </p>
<p>Then there came a job
  in the composing room of a newspaper, and the life work of Henry
  George was really begun, for his employers had discovered that he
  could &quot;rastle the dic.,&quot; and if copy were scarce he could create
  it.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * </p>
<p>The gold-fever got into the blood of Henry George, and his savings
  became a shining mark for the mining shark. A thousand men lose money
  at mining where one strikes pay-gravel. Henry George was one of the
thousand.</p>
<p>He got good wages and boarded at the best hotel in San Francisco, the  &quot;What Cheer House.&quot; This
  storied hostelry was owned by a man named Woodward, who had a few ideas of
  his own. Woodward not only hated Rum,
  Romanism and Rebellion, but also women. Woodward was a confirmed
  bachelor, having been confirmed by a lady bachelor in some dark,
  mysterious way, years before. So no woman was allowed either to stop
  at the hotel or to work in it. The labor was done by Chinese, and
  Henry George wrote home to his sisters, describing the place as an
immaculate conception.</p>
<p>Next to the fact that no women were allowed in the &quot;What Cheer House,&quot;  was
  the further more astounding proposition that the place was run on absolutely
  temperance principles, thus, for the time. at least,
  silencing that hoary adage of the genus wiseacre that no hotel can
  succeed without a bar. Woodward became rich, and from the proceeds of
his temperance hotel founded Woodward Gardens &#8212; a park beloved by all who
know
their San Francisco.</p>
<p>The third peculiar thing about this hotel was that it had a library of
  a thousand volumes.</p>
<p>It was the only public library in San Francisco at that time, and it
  was the books that led Henry George to spend twice as much for board
as he otherwise would have done.</p>
<p>While Henry George was at the &quot;What Cheer House,&quot; an English traveler
  added a volume to the little library, Buckle's &quot;History of Civilization.&quot; Woodward
  tried to read the book, but failing to become
  interested in it, between serving the soup and the fish, handed it to
  a waiter saying, &quot;Here, give it to that red-headed printer; he can get
something out of it if anybody can.&quot; </p>
<p>Henry George took the book to his
  room, and that night sat reading it until two o'clock in the morning.
  That statement of Buckle's, &quot;Adam Smith's 'Wealth of Nations' has
  influenced civilization more profoundly than any other book ever
  written, save none,&quot; caught the young printer's attention.</p>
<p>The next day he looked in the library for the &quot;Wealth of Nations,&quot; and
  sure enough, it was there! He began to read. He read and reread. And
  whether Buckle's statement is correct or not, this holds: Adam Smith's &quot;Wealth
  of Nations&quot; influenced Henry George more profoundly than any
other book he had ever read.</p>
<p>Henry George was not yet immune from the gold-fever microbe, and
  several times was lured away into the mountains, &quot;grubstaking&quot; a
  man
  with hope plus and secrets as to gold-bearing quartz that would
paralyze the world.</p>
<p>When twenty-one we find our young man one of six printers who bought
  out the &quot;Evening Journal.&quot; Henry George was foreman of the composing
  room, but took a hand anywhere and everywhere. A curious comment on
  the business acumen of the &quot;Journal&quot; men lies in their agreement
  that
  all should have an equal voice in the policy of the paper. Hence we
  infer that all were equally ignorant of the stern fact that in
  business nothing succeeds but one-man power. So the &quot;Journal&quot; went
  drifting on the rocks in financial foggy weather and the hungry waves
devoured her.</p>
<p>When Fate desires a great success she sends her chosen one failure.
  Henry George at twenty-two was ragged, in debt &#8212; and also in love.
  The &quot;What Cheer House&quot; was all right for a man getting good wages,
  but
  when you go into business for yourself it is different, and George
found board with a private family.</p>
<p>The lady in the case was Miss Fox, ward and niece of the landlord with
  whom the impecunious printer boarded.</p>
<p>Annie Fox and our printer read Dana's &quot;Household Book of Poetry,&quot; with
  heads close together.</p>
<p>The inevitable happened &#8212; they decided to pool their poverty in the
  interests of progress. To ask the landlord for his blessing seemed out
  of the question, in view of the fact that the printer was two weeks
  behind in his board. The girl had the proverbial clothes on her back.</p>
<p>Matthew McClosky, the uncle, was a good deal of a man. He showed his
  shrewdness and appreciation of the present order by buying a large
  tract of land near the city, and grew rich on the unearned increment.
  Had his niece and the printer confided in him they might have shared
  in his prosperity, in which case &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; would never
have been written.</p>
<p>It was the memorable year of 1861. The heart of
  Henry George was with the Union &#8212; he had decided to enlist. He told
  the
  girl so behind the kitchen door. Her answer was a flood of tears, and
  a call to arms. The result was that the next night the couple stole
  out, and made their way to a Methodist parsonage, where they were
married.</p>
<p>Henry George was nominally a member of the Methodist Church, but the
  creed of Thomas Paine was more to his liking &#8212; &quot;The world is my
  country; mankind are my friends; to do good is my religion.&quot; The young
  lady was a Catholic, and so the preacher compromised by reading the
  Episcopal service. The only witnesses were the minister's wife and
Henry George's chum, Isaac Trump. &quot;I didn't catch your friend's name,&quot; said
the minister in filling out the marriage certificate. &quot;I. Trump,&quot; was
the reply. &quot;I observe you do,&quot; was the answer,&quot;but oblige me
with the gentleman's name.&quot;</p>
<p>There are three great epochs in life &#8212; birth, death, marriage. The
  first two named you can not avoid. Since life is a sequence, no one  can say
  what would have happened had not this or that occurred. Mrs.  George proved
  an honest, earnest, helpful wife. Her conservatism  curbed the restless spirit
  of her husband and gave his mind time to  ripen, for until his marriage the
  ideals of the French Revolution were  strong in his heart. He saw the evils
  of life and was intent on  changing them. The Catholic faith is an elastic
  one, both esoteric and  exoteric, and those who are able can take the poetic
  view of dogma  instead of the literal, if they prefer. Henry George and his
  wife took  the spiritual or symbolic view, and moved steadily forward in the  middle
  of the road. He was too gentle and considerate to quote  Voltaire and Rousseau
  at inopportune times, and she sustained and  encouraged his mental independence.
  All of which is here voiced with  one foot on the soft pedal, and with no thought
  of putting forth an argument to the effect that young gentlemen with liberal
  views should  marry ladies who belong to the Catholic persuasion.</p>
<p>The day after his marriage the bridegroom found work in a printery at  twelve dollars a week, and thus was the pivotal point safely rounded.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * </p>
<p>Here was a man absolutely honest, with no bad habits, industrious and
  economical, but lacking in that peculiar something that spells
  success. The type is not rare. One trouble was that our Henry George
  stuck to no one place long enough to make himself a necessity. Men of
half his ability made twice as much money.</p>
<p>The days went by, and Henry George wrote to Trump, &quot;I am advance agent
  for the stork.&quot; Now storks bring love and hope &#8212; and care, and
  anxious
  days and sleepless nights. Henry George's domestic affairs had
  steadied his barque, and while his relatives in Philadelphia thought he
  carried an excess of Romish ballast, it was all for the best. He read,
  studied, thought, and wanting little his mind did not list either to
port or to starboard.</p>
<p>Henry George had graduated from the case into the editorial room. He
  worked on all the newspapers, by turn, in San Francisco and
  Sacramento, and had come to be regarded as one of the strongest
  editorial writers on the Coast. The business office was beyond his
  province, and as a newspaper was a business venture, and is run
  neither to educate the public nor for the proprietor's health, the
  manager did not look upon Henry George as exactly &quot;safe.&quot; And hence
  the reason is plain why George was regarded as a sectional bookcase
and not as a fixture.</p>
<p>At thirty he had evolved to a point where the New York &quot;Tribune&quot; asked
  him to write a signed editorial for them on the Chinese question. Then
  he wrote for the &quot;<a href="../HG/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">Overland
  Monthly</a>;&quot; and when a great literary light
  came to San Francisco to appear on the lyceum stage, Henry George was
  asked to introduce him to the audience, especially if the man was
  believed to have heresy secreted on his person, in which case of
  course the local clergy took no risks of contamination, not being
immune.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the death of a certain tramp printer, whose name is
  now lost to us in the hell-box of time, no clergyman being found to
  perform the service, Henry George officiated, and preached a sermon
  which rang through the city like a trumpet call, extolling not what
the man was, but what he might have been.</p>
<p>This custom of the laity taking charge of funerals still exists in the
  West, to a degree not known, say in New England, where in certain
  localities people are not considered legally dead unless both an
orthodox doctor and an orthodox preacher officiate.</p>
<p>The very poor, and the outcasts of society, in San Francisco began to
  look upon Henry George as the Bishop of Outsiders. Often he was called
  upon to go and visit the stricken, the sick and the dying. And there
  was a kind of poetic fitness in all this, for the man possessed that
  superior type of moral and intellectual fiber which makes a great  physician or an excellent priest &#8212; he could &quot;minister.&quot; And
  it was only
division of labor that separated the offices of doctor and priest, and actually
they are and should be one.</p>
<p>In Sacramento now lives a successful merchant, a Jew by birth, and a
  man of great grace of spirit, who has this superior, spiritual quality
  which makes his services sought after, and in response to demand he
  goes all over the state saying the last words over the dust of those
  who in their lives had lost faith in the established order, or had too much
  faith in God.</p>
<p>After his thirty-sixth year Henry George slipped by natural process
  into this semi-religious order &#8212; a priest after the order of
  Melchisedek. He was spokesman for those who had no social standing, a
  voice for the voiceless, a friend to the friendless, even those who
were not friends to themselves.</p>
<p>But at thirty-seven he was up on the mountain-side where he saw to a
  distance that very few men could. He felt his own dignity and knew his
  worth. The president of the University of California, recognizing his
  ability as a thinker and speaker, asked him to give a course of
lectures on economics.</p>
<p>He gave one &#8212; this was all they could digest.</p>
<p>California colleges have had a lot of trouble with economics &#8212; it
  has
  been a theme more fraught for them with danger than theology. How
  Californians make their money and how they spend it is a topic which
  in handling requires great subtlety of intellect, a fine delicacy of
  expression and much diplomacy, otherwise twenty-three petards!</p>
<p>Here is a passage from Henry George's lecture before the University of
  California:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For the study of political economy you need no special knowledge, no
      extensive library, no costly laboratory. You do not even need
      textbooks or teachers if you will but think for yourselves. All that
      you need is care in reducing complex phenomena to their elements, in
      distinguishing the essential from the accidental, and in applying the
      simple laws of human action with which you are familiar. Take
      nobody's opinion for granted; 'try all things; hold fast to that    which is good.' In this way, the opinions of others will help you
      by their suggestions, elucidations and corrections; otherwise they
    will be to you as words to a parrot.</p>
  <p>All this array of professors, all this paraphernalia of learning, can
    not educate a man. They can but help him educate himself. Here you may
    obtain the tools; but they will be useful to him only who can use
    them. A monkey with a microscope, a mule packing a library, are fit
    emblems of the men &#8212; and unfortunately, they are plenty &#8212; who
    pass    through the whole educational machinery, and come out but learned
    fools, crammed with knowledge which they can not use &#8212; all the more pitiable,
    all the more contemptible, all the more in the way of real
  progress, because they pass, with themselves and others, as educated men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>California is a land of extremes &#8212; everything there grows big and fast,
  especially ideas. No country ever saw such wealth and such poverty
  side by side. The mansions on Nob Hill were so grand that their
  magnificence discouraged all the owners and abashed the visitors; at
  receptions, a keg of beer on a saw-buck in the kitchen and champagne in
  a wash-tub, with ham sandwiches in a bushel basket, were all that could
  be assimilated. And yet past the high iron gates of these palaces
  prowled want &#8212; gaunt, hungry and menacing.</p>
<p>Land was never so cheap nor so dear as it has been in California. We  gave
  a railroad company twenty-five thousand acres of land for every
  mile of track it built, and for years a dollar an acre was the ruling
  price at which you could buy to your limit. And yet there were at the  same
  time little half acres for which men pushed a hundred thousand
  dollars in gold-dust over the counter and then crowed about their
bargain.</p>
<p>Henry George studied economics at first hand. The dignified frappe  which
  he received in way of honorarium for his university lecture had  its advantages.
  People in San Francisco wanted to hear what the editor  had to say as well
  as to read his utterances. He was invited to give  the Fourth of July oration
  at the Grand Opera House &#8212; a very great
compliment.</p>
<p>Henry George was a reformer, and reformers have but one theme, and  that theme
  is Liberty. We grow by expression. There is no doubt that  the university lecture
  and the Fourth of July oration added cubits to  the stature of Henry George.
  In these two addresses we find the kernel  of his philosophy &#8212; a kernel
  that was to germinate into a mighty tree  which would extend its welcoming
shade to travellers for many a decadeyet to come.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * </p>
<p><em><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a>, </em>like every other great book (or great man)
  was
  an accident &#8212; a providential accident. The book was ten years in the  incubation.
  It began with a newspaper editorial in 1869, and
  found form in a volume of five hundred pages in 1879.</p>
<p>The editorial merely called attention to the fact that California, in
  spite of her vast wealth, was peopled, for the most part, with people
  desperately poor; and that ground in the vicinity of any city, town or
  place of enterprise was held at so exorbitant a figure that the poor
  were actually <a href="../themes/Slavery.html">enslaved</a> by the men who owned the land. That is to say,
  the men who owned the land, controlled the people who had to live on
  it, for man is a land animal, and can not live apart from land, any
  more than fishes can live at a distance from water. And moreover we
  tax for the improvements on land, thus really placing a penalty on
enterprise.</p>
<p>The article attracted attention, and opened the eyes of one man at
  least &#8212; and that was the man who wrote it. He had written better than
  he knew; and any writer who does not occasionally surprise himself
does not write well.</p>
<p>Henry George had surprised himself, and he wrote another editorial to
  explain the first. These editorials extended themselves into a series,
  and hand-polished and sandpapered, were reprinted in pamphlet form in 1871,
  under the title of &quot;Our Land Policy.&quot;  The temerity which prompted
  the printing of this pamphlet was evolved  through a letter from <a href="../themes/Mill.html">John
  Stuart Mill</a>. Henry George knew he was right  in his conclusions, but he
  felt that he needed the corroboration of a  great mind that had grappled with
  abstruse
problems; so he sent one of his editorials to Mill, the greatest living intellect
of his time.</p>
<p>Mill showed his interest by replying in a long letter, wherein he  addressed
George as a man with a mind equal to his own, not as asophomore trying his wings.</p>
<p>The letter from Mill was to him a white milepost. The corroboration  gave him courage, confidence, poise.</p>
<p>The thousand copies of the pamphlet cost Henry George seventy-five  dollars.
  The retail price was twenty-five cents each. Twenty-one  copies were sold.
  The rest were given away to good people who promised  to read them. Pamphlets
  are for the pamphleteer, but let the fact here  be recorded that new ideas
  have always been issued at the author's  expense &#8212; and also risk. Martin
  Luther, Dean Swift, John Milton, Paine, Voltaire, Sam Adams were all pamphleteers.
  The early Colonial &quot;broadsides&quot; were pamphlets issued by men with thoughts plus, and all
of the men just named fired inky volleys which proved to be shots heard 'round
the world.</p>
<p>As the years passed, Henry George was gathering gear; he was getting  an education.
  Providence was preparing him for his work. All he  expressed by tongue or pen
  had land, labor, production and  distribution in mind. He was getting acquainted
  with every phase of  the subject &#8212; anticipating the objections, meeting the
objectors,opening up side paths.</p>
<p>And so, in 1878, when he sat down to write a  magazine article on &quot;Our
  Government Land Policy,&quot; the air was full
of  reasons. Soon the article stretched itself beyond magazine length, and in
order to cover the theme he set down headings:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1 Wages<br>
      2 Capital<br>
      3 Division of Labor<br>
      4 Population<br>
      5 Subsistence<br>
      6 Rent<br>
      7 Interest<br>
      8 The Remedy for Unequal Distribution</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He wrote all one night &#8212; wrote in a fever. The next day his pulse got
  back to normal, and on talking the matter over with his wife he
  decided to begin it all over and work his philosophy up into a book,
writing as he could, only one or two hours a day.</p>
<p>He was absolutely without capital, dependent on his income from space 
  writing in the daily newspapers, but he began and the work grew.</p>
<p>It was all done on &quot;stolen time,&quot; to use the phrase of Macaulay,
  and
  therefore vital, for things done because you have to do them &#8212; done to
get rid of them &#8212; contain the red corpuscle.</p>
<p>On March 22, 1879, the precious
  bundle of manuscript was shipped to D. Appleton and Company, New York,
  with instructions that if the work was not accepted, to hold subject
to the author's order.</p>
<p>In six weeks came a letter from the Appletons, gracious,
  complimentary, &quot;but&quot; &#8212;, in fact, no work on political economy
  had ever
  sold sufficiently to either make money for the author or  pay the
bare cost of the book to the publisher.</p>
<p>Here was a dampener, and if Henry George had been a trifle more astute
  in the laws of literary supply and demand, he could and would have
  anticipated the result even in spite of the natural prejudice which
an author always feels for the offspring of his brain.</p>
<p>A letter was now sent Thomas George, the author's brother, in
  Philadelphia, requesting him to go over to New York and find a market
for the wares.</p>
<p>Thomas had the work passed on by the Harpers, by Scribner, and all  &quot;much
  regretted.&quot;</p>
<p>The next thing was to interest Professor Swinton and several New York
  friends, and have them go in a body and storm the castle of Barabbas.
  The committee called on D. Appleton and Company, and again laid the
case before them.</p>
<p>Finally the publishers agreed that if the author would advance money
  for the electrotype plates, they would undertake the publication.</p>
<p>But alas, the author was in the proverbial author's condition. On the  offer
  being laid before Henry George by mail, he replied that he could make the electrotype
  plates himself. He was a typesetter and he had
  friends who would give him the use of their printing outfits. The
  offer was satisfactory to the Appletons, provided Prof. Swinton
  would agree to take on his own account a hundred copies of the work on
suspicion.</p>
<p>The Professor agreed. And the MS was sent back to San
  Francisco, a trifle dog-eared and the worse for five months' wear.</p>
<p>The author began his typesetting with the same diligence that he had  brought
  to bear in the writing. This was stolen time, too. He worked an hour in the
  morning and two hours at night. Other printers offered
  to help, and a genial, bum electrotyper, damnably cheerful, offered to  come
  in and lend a hand, provided Henry George would agree to give a  funeral oration
  over the derelict one's grave at the proper time.
Henry George gleefully agreed.</p>
<p>So the work of making the electrotype plates moved on apace. In the
  meantime some of Henry George's political friends had interviewed the
  governor and Henry George was made inspector of gas meters, at fifteen
hundred dollars a year.</p>
<p>It was four months' work to make the plates, but early in the year
  1880, they were shipped to New York, a few proofs of
the book being taken, stitched up and sent out for review.</p>
<p>So far as we know, there was no one in California able to read the
  book and intelligently review it. Leastwise they never did.</p>
<p>The Appletons, however, gradually awoke to the fact that they had a
  prize, and they made efforts to get the work into right reviewing
  hands. Better still, they began to inquire about what manner of man
Henry George was.</p>
<p>Next they wrote to the author suggesting that, if he would come to New
  York and personally present his views, it would help in the sale of
the books.</p>
<p>Fortunately Henry George was not hampered by the ownership of real
  estate, nor an excess of personal property, so he hastily packed up,
  transportation having been secured by John Russell Young, a capitalist
who had faith in his genius from the first.</p>
<p>Henry George arrived in New York penniless, but Prof. Swinton, that excellent
  blind man of great insight E.
  L. Youmans, John Russell
Young and the Appletons gave him a rich reception.</p>
<p>The tide had turned.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * </p>
<p>Henry George received all the recognition that any thinker and writer
  could desire, from August, 1880, to the day of his
  death, October 28, 1897. Men might
  not agree with him in his conclusions, but few indeed dare meet him in
a duel of argument, either by pen or upon the public platform.</p>
<p>He spoke in churches, halls and private parlors. His newspaper and
  magazine articles commanded a price. He met the greatest minds of
America and of Europe on an equal footing.</p>
<p>In England his book was having a sale far beyond what it had met with
  at home.</p>
<p>And when he spoke in London and the chief cities of Great Britain, the
  halls were packed to suffocation. He appealed to the Messianic
  instinct of English workingmen, and they hailed him as the coming man
   &#8212; their deliverer. They stripped doors from their hinges and carried
  him aloft upon the improvised platform. They unhitched the horses from
  his carriage and drew him through the streets in triumphal state. This
  all meant little &#8212; it was only campaign exuberance &#8212; the glare and flare
of smoky kerosene-torches, and the blare of brass.</p>
<p>Henry George was right in the same class with Spencer, Huxley and Tyndall,
  none of whom, happily, was a college man, and  therefore all were free from
  the handicap of dead learning and ossified opinion, and saw things as if they
  were new. Ignorance is a
  very necessary equipment in doing a great and sublime work that is to
eclipse anything heretofore performed.</p>
<p>The mind of Henry George was a flower of slow growth. At thirty-seven  he
  was just reaching mental manhood. According to all reasonable  tables of expectancy,
  he should have rivaled Humboldt and been in his  prime at eighty. His brain
  was the brain of <a href="../themes/Ricardo.html">Ricardo</a>; but instead of  sticking to his books, he got caught
  in the swirl of politics, and was  matched up with the cheap, the selfish,
  the grasping. The people who  snatched Henry George out of his proper sphere
  as a thinker, writer  and lecturer, and flung him into the turmoil of practical
politics,  were of exactly the class who would, if they could, have a little later
ridden him on a rail.</p>
<p>It was all a little like that speech of a man in Indianapolis who
  nominated James Whitcomb Riley for the Presidency of the United  States. The
mob diluted the thought of Henry George and trod his proud and honest heart into
the mire.</p>
<p>Had he been elected mayor of New York, he could have done little or  nothing
  for reform, for a mayor has only the power delegated to him by  the ward boss
  and the genus heeler. Beyond this he can merely apply the emergency brake
  by
the use of the veto.</p>
<p>Henry George was a racehorse hitched by spoilsmen to an overloaded
  jaunting car with a drunken driver, bound for Donnybrook Fair.</p>
<p>And soon men said he was dead.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * </p>
<p>The logic of Henry George's book and its literary style are so  insistent
  that it has been studied closely by economists of note in  every country on
  the globe. Its argument has never been answered, and  those who have sought
  to combat it have rested their case on the  assertion that Henry George was
  a theorist and a dreamer, and so far  as practical affairs were concerned was
  a failure. With equal logic we  might brand the Christian religion as a failure
  because its founder  was not a personal success, either in his social status
or as apolitical leader.</p>
<p>Gradually the thinking men of the world, the statesmen and the doers,  are
  beholding the fact that mankind is an organism, and that a country  is only
  as rich as its poorest citizen; that an athlete with Bright's  disease is not
  worth as much to humanity as a small, lively and  healthy boy of ten with cheek
  of tan and freckles to spare. Health  comes from right living, and living without
useful effort is only existence.</p>
<p>People living on the pavement or in sky-scrapers soon degenerate.</p>
<p>Man can not thrive apart from land. Abject poverty is found only in  great cities, where population is huddled like worms in a knot.</p>
<p>The highest average of intelligence, happiness and prosperity is found  in
villages, where each family owns its home, and the renter is the rare exception.</p>
<p>The word &quot;renter&quot; we used out West as a term of contempt. The
  ownership of an acre of land gives a sense of security which religion
  can not bestow. God's acre, with vegetables, fruits, flowers, a cow  &amp; poultry,
  places a family beyond the reach of famine, even if not
  of avarice. Moreover, this single acre means sound sleep, good
  digestion and resultant good thoughts, all from digging in the dirt
  and mixing with the elements. &quot;All wealth comes from the soil,&quot; says
  Adam Smith, and he might have added, man himself comes from the soil
  and is brother to the trees and the flowers. Men can no more live
  apart from land than can the grass. The ownership of a very small plot
of ground steadies life, lends ballast to existence, and is a bond given to society
for good behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;I am no longer an anarchist &#8212; I have bought a lot and am building a
  house,&quot; advise a Russian refugee to his restless colleagues at
  home 
when they wrote asking him for quotations on dynamite.</p>
<p>It is obvious and easy to say that the people who make city slums
  possible do not want to own houses and would not live upon land and
improve it, if they could.</p>
<p>The worst about this statement is that it is true. They are so sunken
  in fear, superstition and indifference that they lack the squirrel's  thrift
  in providing a home and laying in a stock of provisions; they  are even without
  the ground-hog's ambition to burrow. They are too  sodden to know what they
are missing, and are lacking in the imagination which pictures a better condition.</p>
<p>They are like those pigmy bondsmen who work in the cotton-mills of the
  south, yellow, gaunt, too dead to weep, too hopeless to laugh, too
pained to feel.</p>
<p>From these creatures and creators of slums it is absurd to talk of
  gratitude for the offer of betterment. People who expect gratitude do
  not deserve it. Neither can the slumsters by force be placed on land
  and be expected to till it. A generation, at least, will be required  to work
  a change, and this change will come through educating the children &#8212; through
  the kindergarten and the kindergarten methods &#8212; and  most of all through
  school gardens. The so-called &quot;back districts&quot; are
  fast being annihilated, for quick transportation is bringing city and
  country close together. The time is coming, and shortly, too, when a
fare of one cent a mile will be the universal rule, and a mile a minute will
not be regarded as an unusual speed.</p>
<p>Now here is something which Henry George did not say, and if he knew
  was too diplomatic to mention: The reason the people have not had  possession
  of the land is because they did not want it. The ownership  of the land you
  need to use comes in answer to prayer &#8212; and prayer is  the soul's desire,
  uttered or unexpressed. The will of the people is  supreme. If fraud and rascality
exist in high places, it is because we elect rascals to office.</p>
<p>The will of the people is supreme. When we cease toadying to brainless
  nabobs, and quit imitating them as soon as we get the money, we will  be on
  the road to reformation. As it is, most poor people are just  itching to live
  as the rich do. The average servant-girl who gets  married quits work then
  and there, and is quite content to live the rest of her life as a slave, asking
  her husband for a quarter at a  time and cajoling the money out of him by hook
or crook, or else  explorating his trousers for free coinage when opportunity offers.</p>
<p>  Fresh air is free, but the average individual does not know it; and
  neither would this same person use land if it were given him. Freedom  is a condition of mind.</p>
<p>Yet apart from the &quot;submerged tenth&quot; is a very large class of people
  to whom land and a home would be a positive paradise, and who are
  simply forced into flats and tenements on account of present economic
  conditions &#8212;  the land is monopolized, and held by men who neither  improve
  it themselves, nor will they allow others to. They hold it
awaiting a rise in value.</p>
<p>This increase in value is not on account of anything the owner may do  &#8212; in
  fact, he is usually an absentee and does nothing. The increase  comes from
the enterprise and thrift of people for whom the owner has no interest, beyond
contempt.</p>
<p>If these enterprising people who do the work of the world &#8212; making the  things
  the world needs &#8212; want more land for their business or for  homes, they
  have to pay the absentee for the increased value which  they themselves have
  brought about. When you beautify and enrich the  value of your own lot by improving
it, you are making it impossible to buy the vacant lot next to you without bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Moreover, you are taxed by the state for any improvement you make on  your
  land, and this taxation on improvements must of necessity tend  toward discouragement
  of improvement. It is really a surer way to make money, to hang on to land
  and do nothing, than to improve it.</p>
<p><a href="../themes/The_Remedy.html">The remedy</a> proposed by Henry George is simply <a href="../themes/Single_Tax.html">the
    Single Tax</a>, and this
  tax to be on land values and not on improvements.</p>
<p>That is to say, with the Single Tax, the man who owns the vacant lot  covered
  with briars and brambles would pay the same tax that you pay  on your lot next
door upon which you have built a house, barn and conservatory and planted trees
and flowers.</p>
<p>The immediate tendency of this policy would be to cause the gentleman
  who owned the vacant lot devoted to cockleburs to put up on it a sign, &quot;For
Sale Cheap.&quot;</p>
<p>Even the opponents of the Single Tax agree that its inauguration would  at
  once throw on the market a vast acreage of unimproved land, and  that is just
  the one reason why they oppose it. All those thousands of  acres held by estates,
trustees and idle heirs, in the vicinity of Boston, Philadelphia and up the Hudson,
would be for sale.</p>
<p>The single tax would give the land back to the people, or at least
  make it possible for people who want it to get what they could use.
Those who have the desire to improve land, and improve themselves by improving
it would no longer be blocked.</p>
<p>The fresh blood of the country which makes the enterprise of cities
  possible comes from the boys and the girls who warmed their feet on
  October mornings where the cows lay down; who have been brought up to
  work on land, to plant and hoe and harvest and look after live stock.
  This is all education, and very necessary education. &quot;A sand-pile and
  dirt in which to dig is the divine right of every child,&quot; says Judge
Lindsey.</p>
<p>And if it is the divine right of a child to dig in the dirt, why isn't
  it the divine right of the grown-up? It is, and would be so recognized
  were it not for the fact that we have been obsessed by a fallacy
  called &quot;the divine right of property.&quot; This idea has come down to
  us
  from the Reign of the Barons, when a dozen men owned all of England,
  and plain and unlettered people could not legally own a foot of land.
  All paid tribute to the Barons, who were actually and literally
robbers.</p>
<p>We will grant of course that <a href="../themes/He_Who_Produces.html">what
    a man produces and creates is his</a>,
  but the land to which he may be legal heir and which probably he has
  never seen, and which certainly he does not use or improve, is his
  only through a legal fiction. When the matter of legal fiction was
  explained to Col. Bumble and he was told that legally a husband
  knew the whereabouts of his wife, because the law regarded a man and
  wife as one, Col. Bumble replied with acerbity, &quot;The law is a
hass.&quot;</p>
<p>Comparatively few people have the courage of Col. Bumble, so they
  do not express themselves; but the commonsense of the world is now
  coming to believe that the law was made for man, and not man for the
law.</p>
<p>The only people who oppose the single tax are the holders of land who
  are hanging on to it expecting to grow rich through inertia.</p>
<p>The problem of civilization is to eliminate the parasite. The idle
  person is no better than a dead one and takes up more room. The man
  who lives on the labor of others is a menace to himself and to
society.</p>
<p>The taxes necessary to support the government should be paid by those
who have the funds wherewith to be idle; no longer should the chief burden fall
on the home-maker.</p>
<p>Tax the land, and the man who owns it will have to make it productive
  by labor, or else get out and allow some one else to have a chance.</p>
<p>Do not drive the landlords out &#8212; tax them out.</p>
<p>Let the land gravitate to the people who have the disposition and the
ability to improve it &#8212; and that is just what the Single Tax will do. SO THIS
  THEN IS THE PHILOSOPHY OF HENRY GEORGE.</p>
