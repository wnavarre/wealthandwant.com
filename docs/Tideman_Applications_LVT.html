<p>When economists think about the contribution that land value
taxation might make to economic performance, they are likely to think
in terms of property tax reform. If taxes on structures are reduced
or eliminated, one can expect that more structures will be built, and
cities will be taller, more compact and more
efficient.<font size="-1"><b><i>1</i></b></font> But more efficient
cities are only the beginning of the contribution that land value
taxation can make to improving economic performance. Land value
taxation generalizes into the principle that people should pay for
all of their appropriations of natural opportunities, according to
the opportunity costs of those appropriations, and the resulting
revenue should be shared equally. There are important applications of
this principle to questions of environmental protection, relieving
congestion, efficient resource use, population growth, and general
economic growth. This paper discusses these more varied applications
of the generalized principle of land value taxation.</p>
<p>The paper begins with a discussion of the <a
 href="#I.%20Justifications%20of%20Land%20Value">justifications of land
value taxation</a>. It then applies land value taxation successively to
problems of <a href="#II.%20Applications%20to%20Environment">environmental
protection</a>, <a href="#III.%20Applications%20to%20Congestion">congestion</a>,
<a href="#IV.%20Applications%20to%20Resource%20Us">efficient use of
renewable and nonrenewable natural resources</a>, and <a
 href="#VI.%20Population%20Growth">population growth</a>.
Then it discusses how one might estimate the contribution of land
value taxation to <a href="#VII.%20Economic%20Growth">economic growth</a>.</p>
<p><a name="I. Justifications of Land Value"></a><b>I</b></p>
<p>Land value taxation is sometimes justified on the ground that,
unlike almost all other sources of public revenue, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">a tax on land
value does not impose an excess burden on an economy.</span> This
argument
can be found in the writings of the <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/Physiocrats.html">Physiocrats</a>, Adam Smith, David
Ricardo, and numerous modern writers. It is based on the fact that,
with a properly administered tax on land value (unlike other taxes),
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">it is not
possible for a person to lower the tax that is due by being
unproductive.</span></p>
<p>If people were concerned only with <span style="font-weight: bold;">efficiency</span>,
this would be a
fine reason to use land value taxation. But people are also concerned
with issues of <span style="font-weight: bold;">justice</span>, or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fairness</span>. And so the question arises
of
whether taxing land values is fair. The fairness of taxing land
values is generally defended on the basis of the postulate that
natural opportunities are everyone's common heritage; collecting the
value of exclusive use of these opportunities and using the proceeds
for public purposes is a way of sharing the value of these
opportunities while retaining the efficiency of private control of
resources.</p>
<p>The idea that natural opportunities are everyone's common heritage
is often defended with religious language. John Locke said:</p>
<blockquote>Whether we consider natural reason, which tells us that
men, being once born, have a right to their preservation, and
consequently to meat and drink, and such other things as nature affords
for their sustenance, or revelation, which gives us an account of those
grants God made of the world to Adam, and to Noah, and his sons, 'tis
very clear that God, as King David says, Psal. CXV. xvi. has given the
Earth to the children of men, given it to mankind in common.<font
 size="-1"><b><i>2</i></b></font></blockquote>
<p>John Locke did not advocate land value taxation. Writing in about
1690, he said that there was so much unclaimed land in America that
no one could properly complain about the private appropriation of
land in Europe.<font size="-1"><b><i>3</i></b></font> Writing nearly
200 year later, when it was becoming impossible for people to
appropriate good unclaimed land in America, Henry George said: </p>
<blockquote>If we are all here by the equal permission of the creator,
we are all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his bounty --
with an equal right to the use of all that nature so impartially
offers. This is a right which is natural and inalienable; it is a right
which vests in every human being as he enters the world, and which
during his continuance in the world can be limited only by the equal
rights of others. There is in nature no such thing as a fee simple in
land. There is on earth no power which can rightfully make a grant of
exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men were to unite to grant
away their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those
who follow them.<font size="-1"><b><i>4</i></b></font></blockquote>
<p>George preceded this argument with a psychological and linguistic
one. He said that our conception of property, of a right of exclusive
possession, is based on the idea that each person has a right to his
or her productive powers, and therefore to what he or she produces.
Since no one produced land, no one can properly claim to own
it.<font size="-1"><b><i>5</i></b></font></p>
<p>This psychological and linguistic argument is not entirely
convincing. It seems clear that humans, like other species, have an
impulse toward the appropriation and defense of territory. Natural
selection has worked in favor of those who are skilled in
appropriating natural opportunities and deterring others from
encroaching on them. It seems possible that, as a way of limiting
violence, humans have merged an idea of ownership based on production
with an idea of ownership based on the ability to appropriate
territory and deter encroachment.</p>
<p>If this is the social and biological reality, then there is a
different argument for treating natural opportunities as everyone's
common heritage. Realizing that we are participants in a game of
territorial appropriation and its extension into the politics of
special interest legislation and other manifestation of privilege, we
should also realize that substantial gains are possible from ending
the game of encroachment and appropriation. We might aspire to end
the waste of effort on all forms of rent-seeking and on defense
against rent-seeking. But our efforts to end the game have been based
primarily on enshrining the status quo: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The last successful
appropriator gets to keep what has been appropriated. This deference
to power might be considered simply realistic. However, it has a high
cost.</span> The practice of legitimating successful past
appropriations --
as when the world declines to challenge Indonesia's 1976 annexation
of East Timor, or when any number of dictators become recognized as
the rightful heads of nations -- induces selfish egoists to calculate
that if they can grab something and hang on to it long enough for the
expected furor to subside, then it will be regarded as just as
legitimately theirs as North America is regarded as the legitimate
property of the descendants of European settlers rather than the
previously occupying natives. (And of course, in many cases those
previously occupying natives had forcibly displaced earlier
occupants.) A statement of the form, "No appropriation before year X
will be questioned, but all aggressive appropriations after year X
will be overturned," is not credible. Year X keeps getting moved, and
successful aggression pays.</p>
<p>Much more credible is a statement of the form, "<b>We will share
equally the value of natural opportunities that might be
appropriated</b>." This is the potential of land value taxation: to
provide a framework in which the value of natural opportunities will
be shared equally, both as an expression of the idea that all persons
have equal rights to natural opportunities, and as a formula whose
potential to remove the motive for future aggression is greater than
that of enshrining the status quo of any particular year. And in
addition, land value taxation is one way of achieving allocative
efficiency with respect to a wide variety of public issues.</p>
<p>Land value taxation is usually thought of as a possible source of
revenue for local governments. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But
the ethical principle that
supports it is most coherent when the principal is applied on a
global basis: All persons in the world have equal rights to natural
opportunities. This does not mean that all persons in the world have
equal rights to all land rent. To the extent that the rent of land
arises as a result of the provision of infrastructure, that rent is
the natural income of the polity that provided the infrastructure,
and the logical source for financing it. What all persons in the
world have equal rights to is the "pre-development" rental value of
land, the rental value that land would have to the potential
developer of a new community if there were no community and no
infrastructure. </span>To motivate the application of land value
taxation to
other areas of economic life, I will assume that there is a global
agreement that, because all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities, there will be transfers among nations to equalize per
capita pre-development rent. The principle behind this agreement is
then extended to other issues.</p>
<p><a name="II" id="II"></a><b>II. Applications
to Environmental Protection</b></p>
<p><b>The first problem of environmental protection is management of
the harm that is caused to nearby areas by the discharge of
pollutants into air and water.</b> In the U.S. this problem is often
managed by quantitative controls. Historic polluters are allowed to
continue to pollute at reduced levels, and potential new polluters
are restricted even further or prevented from polluting entirely.</p>
<p>A system of quantitative controls can be efficient if the overall
level of control is appropriate and permission to pollute is
completely transferable. But these conditions are rarely met. It is
particularly difficult to know the optimal level of pollution control
when the costs of pollution are continuous, upward sloping and not
catastrophic. And systems of quantitative controls almost always lack
fairness. They grant permanent privileges to those who have a history
of having caused harm. If a system of quantitative controls provided
that pollution rights would be auctioned, and all the proceeds would
be collected publicly, then it would be in accord with a principle
that all persons have equal rights to natural opportunities. But
there would still be the difficulty of determining the right number
of permits to sell.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A system of managing the harm from
pollution is most likely to be
both efficient and fair if it is conceived in terms of taking account
of effects of pollution on land values. </span>Pollution can also
affect the
value of structures, but these effects are harder to quantify,
because they operate somewhat differently on each structure.
Furthermore, pollution can raise as well as lower the value of
structures. An old structure that would be ready to be demolished in
a clean environment can have continuing economic value in a polluted
environment. Pollution can also have effects on the utility of
individuals apart from its effects on the value of land and
structures. If person A is harmed by pollution more than person B,
who would move in if person A moved out, but person A does not move
because of the costs of moving, then the difference between the costs
of pollution to persons A and B is a pollution cost that is not
reflected in the value of land and structures. Nevertheless,
measuring the cost of pollution by its effects on land values is a
good first approximation.</p>
<p>To manage pollution efficiently and fairly, one would estimate the
effects on land values of various levels of pollution and derive a
"supply schedule" of pollution based on the marginal cost of
pollution at different levels of pollution. One would then ask
polluters how much polluting they would want to do at different
prices of pollution. As long as there were more than a handful of
polluters, their incentives to report anything other than their true
marginal valuations of pollution rights would be inconsequentially
small. Thus one could aggregate the responses into an aggregate
demand schedule for pollution rights and use the intersection of the
supply and demand schedules to determine simultaneously the efficient
quantity of pollution and the price that would achieve the efficient
quantity. The payments that individuals made could be construed as
payments for appropriating for themselves land rent that was
everyone's common heritage.</p>
<p>Pollution sometimes crosses international borders, as when sulfur
dioxide from coal-fired electricity generating plants in the U.S.
Midwest crosses into Canada. While there are unresolved scientific
issues regarding the amount of harm that such international pollution
causes, the economic question of what should be done when the
magnitude of damage is know is straightforward. When one country
sends pollution to another, the resulting decrease in the value of
land in the second country represents an increase in the proportion
of natural opportunities that the first country is appropriating. The
polluting nation owes corresponding compensation.</p>
<p><b>Without a theory of equal rights to natural opportunities, one
could argue that international pollution could be controlled just as
well by identifying the optimal quantity and limiting emissions to
that level. A theory of equal rights to natural opportunities does
not permit such privilege for polluters. </b></p>
<p>When the area affected by a pollutant is very large, as with the
gasses that exacerbate the ozone hole, measuring damage by changes in
land values becomes less attractive. Changes in land value are a
suitable measure of damages when the choices that people make between
land that is affected and unaffected permit the market to reflect the
damages. But if all of Australia is affected by the ozone hole, then
the damage that the ozone hole does to Australia would be measured by
land values only if it affected migration between Australia and the
rest of the world. Such effects happen slowly, and their consequences
for land values are difficult if not impossible to measure. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, one can apply the principle that natural
opportunities are everyone's common heritage. No one has a right to a
disproportionate share of the opportunity to emit the gasses that
increase the ozone hole. We should seek to identify the marginal cost
schedule of emissions of these gasses, and charge a fee that equate
the marginal cost and marginal benefit of emissions. All persons in
the world should share equally in the proceeds of such fees, after
nations such as Australia that bear a disproportionate burden have
been compensated for their costs.</p>
<p>With CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, the issue is yet different.
Particularly cold areas may benefit from the global warming caused by
greenhouse gasses, and no area of planet is immune from the effects
of global warming. Still, the principle of equal rights to natural
opportunities can be applied. All people have equal rights to emit
greenhouse gasses. People have different ideas about what the right
level is. The appropriate way to give expression to the idea that we
all have equal rights to the environment is to use a structured
democratic and market process.</p>
<p>Consider CO2. Start by having every nation propose a quantity of
permitted emissions of CO2 per capita. Weight each nation's proposal
by its population, and take the weighted median of the proposals.
That is an initial entitlement that represents a majority rule
equilibrium, a reasonable expression of equal rights for all. Unlike
the current global climate negotiations, in this entitlement no
preference is given to nations of the basis of their having a history
of high emissions.</p>
<p>Next, ask each nation how much money it would be willing to pay
for reductions in global emissions below the entitlement levels, and
how much money it would regard as adequate compensation for emissions
above the initial entitlement level. (These question presume that
nations want lower emissions. If a nation desires extra global
warming, the questions would be reversed.) </p>
<p>To motivate nations to respond honestly to these questions, the
"demand-revealing" process would be used to charge nations for their
answers. That is, each nation would pay for the cost that it imposed
on other nations (or receive the benefit that it provided to other
nations) by having the preferences that it had instead of the average
of the preferences of other nations.</p>
<p>The next step is to ask each nation for an offer schedule of how
much it is willing to pay for the right to emit CO2 in excess of its
allocation, or how much it would regard as adequate compensation for
emitting less than its allocation. The (vertical) sum of the answers
to the questions about the costs that nations would experience from
emissions provides a "supply schedule" of emission rights. The
(horizontal) sum of the answers to the question of how much nations
would pay to emit more (or accept as compensation for emitting less)
provides a demand schedule for emission rights. The intersection of
the two schedules specifies the efficient level of emissions and the
price that will induce nations to emit the efficient amount of CO2.
This is the price to be paid by nations that want to emit more than
their entitlements, and received by nations that want to emit less
than their entitlements. In addition, all nations pay or receive
something for the net cost to other nations for their having
preferences that deviate from the average of the preferences of
others. These payments ensure that nations are motivated to report
their costs of emissions truthfully.</p>
<p><a name="III" id="III"></a><b>III. Applications
to Congestion</b></p>
<p>The logic of efficient environmental protection applies with few
changes to issues of congestion. <b>Parking meters</b> are simple
example of the application of land value taxation to solving a
problem of congestion. If there is a shortage of parking places (at a
zero price) then the introduction of parking meters (charging rent
for the use of land) can relieve the shortage. Ideally, the price of
a parking meter should vary by time of day to reflect variations in
the demand for parking places. The ideal fee would equate supply and
demand at each time of day, with lanes of streets devoted to parking
only where the revenue generated by the parking fees exceeds the
value of the additional lane in speeding traffic. Perhaps in a few
years we will have parking meters with prices that vary by time of
day. We certainly have the technology. In the meantime, we get by
with meters that charge a single price throughout the part of the day
when demand is greatest.</p>
<p>Charging rent for parking is only a small step from charging rent
for cars that are moving on city streets. The more cars there are on
the streets, the slower everyone goes. The marginal cost of having
one more car on the streets is the value of the extra travel time
that everyone else endures because of the one additional car. In many
places, the congestion cost of traffic is less than the cost of
administering a system of congestion fees. But this is not the case
everywhere. <b><a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William Vickrey</a></b> used to say that his estimate of
the cost in additional delays of having one more car in midtown
Manhattan in the middle of the day was about $20,000 per hour. He
would go on to say that this did not imply that people should be
charged $20,000 per hour for using the streets of midtown Manhattan.
He had estimated marginal cost at the present level of usage. The
efficient charge -- perhaps $25 per hour -- would reduce use of the
streets so greatly that the marginal congestion cost of street usage
would equal the price. Efficient congestion prices for using the
streets of Manhattan (or Boston or other large cities) would not
merely charge for ordinary usage but would also entail special
charges for anyone who double-parked or parked in some other illegal
way that created congestion. If we could keep track of the movements
of vehicles, then for any vehicle that stood still ahead of backed-up
vehicles that wanted to move, there would be a charge for the
resulting congestion cost, which would be quite high. Companies
making deliveries to downtown areas might decide that it was far
better to make deliveries at night than to tie up the streets in the
day. </p>
<p><b>Congestion charges also apply to bottlenecks such as bridges
and tunnels.</b> Whenever such a facility has cars backed up seeking
to use it, efficiency is improved by applying a toll that reduces
demand to capacity. The same output is produced, revenue is
generated, and the waste of queuing is avoided. </p>
<p><b>The efficiency of congestion pricing would also apply to such
public facilities as airports and parks.</b> When airlines want to
have more take-offs and landings than an airport can accommodate, it
is efficient and just to allocate take-off and landing slots by
price. Unfortunately, Congress, at the behest of airlines, has
prohibited airports from doing this, requiring them instead to
allocate take-off and landing slots by non-price means. </p>
<p>In Central Park in New York, there are fewer baseball fields than
are demanded at a zero price. There is a private company that has the
right and responsibility to organize the leagues that are allowed to
use the fields. This company is able to charge fees that implicitly
include the scarcity value of the fields. A recognition that the
parks are the common heritage of everyone in the city would lead
instead to a charge for using the ball fields that equated supply and
demand.</p>
<p>There are also applications of congestion prices at an
international level. For example, <b>there may be congestion in
geosynchronous orbits for satellites</b>. If this should occur, then
the just thing to do is to charge market-clearing rents for
geo-synchronous orbits and share the proceeds among all nations in
proportion to their populations.</p>
<p><a name="IV" id="IV"></a><b>IV. Applications
to Resource Use</b></p>
<p>It is only a small step from charging people for street use and
parks to charging them for renewable and exhaustible resources. <b>If
people who could fish as much as they wanted would deplete fish
stocks excessively, then some form of control over fishing is
beneficial. </b>It is possible in theory to have efficient control
through quotas, though it is difficult to set the quotas properly,
and highly contentious to change them when conditions require a
change. <b>The recognition that the fish are everyone's common
heritage would require that, if there are to be quotas, the quotas be
auctioned, and that if not, then everyone who fishes be required to
pay for fishing according to the loss in the value of fish stocks
that results from fishing.</b> If a fishing resource lies entirely
within a single nation (as in a lake or river), then the recipient of
the fees for fishing should be the polity that includes the resources
(Though the value of the fishing resource would be included in the
calculation of whether the nation was using more than its share of
global natural opportunities.) When the fishing resource is in
international waters, the fees should be shared equally among all
nations in proportion to their populations.</p>
<p>Suppose that fish are caught in a river than flows from one nation
into another. How should resource use be managed and accounted for in
that case? The two nations should set a common price for fishing
(unless fishing on one entails a greater resource cost than fishing
in the other). However they divide the revenue from such charges,
their ability to collect the revenue should be included in the
calculation of how their appropriations of natural opportunities
compare with those of other nations.</p>
<p>What applies to fish applies as well to water that flows from one
country into another, when water is scarce. It is inefficient as well
as unjust for people to use water as if it were free when it is not.
When a river flows from one nation into another, there should be a
common price for extractions of water from the river (unless the
resource cost is greater in one country than in the other), and the
revenue so collected should be included in the calculation of both
nations' appropriations of natural opportunities. </p>
<p><b>The frequency spectrum is another natural opportunity whose use
is analytically equivalent to that of land.</b> When the consequences
of use of a part of the frequency spectrum are confined to a single
nation, then a principle of equal rights to natural opportunities
implies that a right of exclusive spectrum use should be offset by a
payment to the government of that nation, corresponding to the
scarcity value of use. When the use that a nation wishes to make of a
part of the frequency spectrum requires other nations to refrain from
using it, then a recognized right of exclusive use counts as a part
of that nation's appropriation of natural opportunities, and is
incorporated into the calculation of what the nation owes to other
nations.</p>
<p><a name="V" id="V"></a><b>V. Resources with
Issues of Appropriate Use Over Time</b></p>
<p>With resources such as oil, which are depleted over time, new
issues of efficiency and justice arise. Depletable resources ought to
be regarded as part of the heritage to which everyone has equal
rights, though some provision must then be made to provide incentives
for discovery. Equal rights are expressed by requiring everyone who
uses a depletable resource to pay for the resulting depletion.
Efficiency requires that a resource that is to be depleted over time
be sold in such a pattern over time as will maximize the present
value of receipts. This generally means using a lot in early years,
then less and less as time goes by, with the price of resources in
the ground rising at the interest rate. If the receipts were spent as
they were received, more would go to early generations than to later
generations. A principle of equal rights to natural opportunities
means that the receipts should be put into a fund, from which equal
payments are made to all persons in all years. Furthermore, later
generations are disadvantaged by the higher price of oil that they
face. A principle of equal rights for all persons would allocate
additional payments to later generations to compensate them for the
higher price of oil they faced, though this could be offset by later
generations having access to technology that earlier generations did
not have. Thus a nation that provides the rest of the world with
technology that eases the task of providing for future generations
should receive a credit for this, although there will be difficulty
in estimating the contribution of any innovation. (If one person had
not discovered something, the chances are that eventually some else
would have.)</p>
<p><a name="VI" id="VI"></a><b>VI. Population
Growth</b></p>
<p>In a world that does not recognize equal rights to natural
opportunities, having children is a more private decision than when
equal rights to natural opportunities are recognized. If a child
comes into the world with a right only to the product of his or her
labor, then there are few externalities of the decisions people make
about how many children to have. Having more children might reduce
the level of wages, but the consequent harm to sellers of labor
services is offset by the benefit to the buyers of labor
services.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if all persons are recognized as having equal
rights to natural opportunities, then a larger number of children
means less land and natural resources per person for all the people
born previously. This may be offset at least partially by the greater
economies of scale that are available when there are more people, but
there will still be a range of population growth over which each
decision by a couple to have a child reduces the real incomes of
everyone else. Define such a circumstance as a scarcity of parenting
opportunities.</p>
<p>If parenting opportunities are scarce and all nations have
populations that grow at the same rate, then any issues of the cost
of having children are internal to each nation. Each nation is free
to divide the cost of additional children between the parents and the
rest of society in whatever way expresses their sense of community.
On the other hand, when nations have populations that grow at
different rates and parenting opportunities are scarce, issues of
justice among nations arise. The children of a rapidly growing nation
will be able to say, "Our numbers are greater than those of our
parents, so we deserve a greater share of the rent of land and
natural resources than our parents received."</p>
<p>It would not be just for the rest of the world to say, "That's not
our fault. Your parents had too many children. You must now get by
with smaller shares of natural opportunities than the rest of us." It
would not be just because the rights to natural opportunities are
equal rights of persons. They are not contingent on having had
parents who were not excessively prolific. Thus the issue of justice
with respect to population growth arises at the time when different
nations decide to have different populations growth rates.</p>
<p>The people of a nation that is growing more slowly than another
can justly say to the people of the more rapidly growing nation, "By
your decision to have so many children, you are increasing the
resources that we must set aside to ensure that our children have
opportunities at least as satisfying as the ones we enjoy. You owe us
something for your disproportionate appropriation of the world's
scarce parenting opportunities." Thus the cost (or benefit) that one
nation imposes on others by its differential population growth rate
would be included in the calculation of the nation's total
appropriation of natural opportunities, and therefore in the
equalization payment that the nation received or paid.</p>
<p><a name="VII" id="VII"></a><b>VII. Economic Growth</b></p>
<p>Recognition of the equal rights of all to natural opportunities,
through land value taxation and its extension to charges for the use
of other resources, is not only just and efficient, but has the
capacity to make a major contribution to economic growth. This occurs
through a variety of paths.</p>
<p>The most important path is that public collection of the value of
exclusive use of natural opportunities provides revenue that makes it
possible to remove taxes from the earnings of labor and capital. When
people are taxed less, they earn more. Using data that emerged from
changes in U.S. tax rates, Feldstein has estimated that the
elasticity of earnings with respect to the fraction of income not
taken at the margin by federal taxes is at least 1.0 (and more for
workers in higher tax
brackets).<font size="-1"><b><i>6</i></b></font> When the entity that
removes a tax on labor is less than global, this action also attract
labor to the region.</p>
<p>When taxes are removed from capital, the effect is even more
powerful, as long as the entity removing the tax is less than global.
Capital is extremely mobile in response to regional changes in net
returns. It is highly counterproductive for any locality or nation to
tax capital, because there will be virtually no effect on the return
to capital after taxes. Capital will merely be driven from the taxed
region until the return after taxes matches what can be obtained
elsewhere. If the whole world removes taxes from capital, the
resulting increase in the rate of return to capital will increase the
rate of saving, but the adjustment will occur over some years.</p>
<p>Taxing land has an additional effect that increases the stock of
capital. A tax on land represents a redistribution from living adults
to the young and unborn, who will now be born with rights to land.
Unless there is a perfectly offsetting reduction in the desire to
accumulate assets to transfer to the next generation, this
redistribution will induce the living, who now have fewer assets, to
accumulate at a more rapid rate than they would otherwise do. That
is, saving and capital accumulation will increase.</p>
<p>Taxing land also increases the efficiency with which land is used.
This occurs through three paths.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, a tax on land reduces the return to land speculation, and
therefore reduces the quantity of land speculation. </li>
  <li>Second, as taxes on land are capitalized into the selling price
of land, the result is the substitution of a recurring cost (the annual
tax) for a one-time cost (the purchase price). This makes land
relatively more attractive to bidders with high discount rates and
relatively less attractive to bidders with low discount rates. To the
extent that the former are more entrepreneurial and the latter more
passive investors, land will tend to flow into the hands of persons who
will choose to use it more intensively. </li>
  <li>The third path by which a tax on land increases the efficiency
with which land is used is that, for those who are using land
inefficiently, it substitutes an explicit cost (the tax) for an
implicit one (the income foregone by inefficient use). </li>
</ul>
<p>Psychologically, explicit costs tend to be more effective in
motivating efficient behavior than implicit ones.</p>
<p><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a><b>VIII. An Estimate
of the Magnitudes of the Consequences of Taxing Land</b></p>
<p>For all of the above reasons, the substitution of tax on land for
taxes on labor and capital will increase the efficiency of an
economy. To estimate the magnitudes of these consequences, one needs
a model of the economy. Consider the following model. There is a
three-factor CES (constant elasticity of substitution) production
function:</p>
<p>Q = (aT&agrave; + bL&agrave; + cK&agrave;)(1/&agrave;). (1)</p>
<p>where Q is output, T is the quantity of land, L is the quantity of
labor, K is the quantity of capital, a, b and c are coefficients, and
&agrave; is related to the elasticity of substitution, &aring;, by
&agrave; = 1 - 1/&aring;. Land has a completely fixed supply. Labor
is assumed to have an elasticity of supply of 0.8 (adjusting
Feldstein's number for the fact that he was considering only federal
income taxes. Capital is assumed to be supplied perfectly
elastically. Taking the ratio of compensation of employees to Net
Domestic Product in National Income and Product Accounts, I assume
that labor receives two thirds of output. Somewhat arbitrarily, I
assume that the remaining third is divided equally between land and
capital. I estimate that the marginal tax rate on labor is 43% (28%
for the federal income tax, 12% for the combination of state income
taxes indirect taxes, and 3% for the Medicare tax--I treat social
security as having benefits equal to its costs, and therefore not a
tax.) I estimate the marginal tax rate on land and capital at 50%
(28% for the federal income tax, 12% for the combination of state
income taxes and indirect taxes, plus 10% for profits taxes). The
elasticity of substitution is a parameter that I am very unsure of.
But Feldstein has estimated that the marginal welfare cost of
taxation is 1.65, and I get that result with a &aring; of 0.68, so I
assume that &aring; = 0.68.</p>
<p><b>I have a spreadsheet that takes parameters such as the ones
named and determines what would happen (in a comparative static
framework) if all taxes were removed from labor and capital, and 100%
of the rent of land were taxed. Here are the results: 
</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The quantity of
labor would increase by 55%.  </li>
  <li>The quantity of capital would increase
by 145%.  </li>
  <li>Output would increase by 53%.  </li>
  <li>The wage before taxes would
fall by 1.7%, but the wage after taxes would increase by 72%.  </li>
  <li>The
rent of land would increase by 87%, and would provide more than
enough revenue for all existing expenditures of all levels of
government in the U.S., other than social security.  </li>
  <li>The aggregate
improvement in well-being of citizens would be about 12.6% of output,
or about $1 trillion per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to do more work with plausible ranges of parameters.
But the model at least indicates that it is not unreasonable to
expect dramatic improvements in economic growth from land value
taxation, without reducing total government revenue.</p>
<p><a name="IX" id="IX"></a><b>IX. Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Land value taxation generalizes to the principle that all persons
have equal rights to natural opportunities and should therefore pay
for their above-average appropriations of natural opportunities. This
principle has the potential to contribute to the efficiency and
fairness with which a wide variety of economic problems are handled.
This paper considers in particular applications to pollution,
congestion, use of scarce natural resources, and population growth.
The revenue raised by managing these issues efficiently, as well as
by the more traditional application of land value taxation, permits
the removal of taxes on labor and capital, with the potential to
unleash a tremendous increase in economic growth and consequent
improvement in human welfare.</p>
