<p><b>A Bill of Economic Rights and Obligations</b></p>
<p>Nic Tideman</p>
</center>
<p><b><a name="Preamble"></a></b><b>Preamble</b>
  <br>
Our nation was founded on the idea that we are all created equal,
that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights,
and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.</p>
<p>In living, expressing our liberty, and pursuing happiness we
sometimes conflict with one another, so we need a shared
understanding of the extent of the sphere of equal rights given to
every person, and beyond that sphere our obligation to respect the
rights of others. This Bill is concerned with the economic aspects of
these rights and obligations.</p>
<p><a name="Article 1"></a><b>Article 1</b>: Each person has the
right to decide whether and how to use his or her talents. Those who
are self-employed have a right to the full economic product of their
efforts. Those who are employed by others have a right to the full
amount of the compensation that their employers agree to pay them.
Thus Congress and state legislatures shall levy no tax on wages or
interest or spending.</p>
<p><a name="Article 2:"></a><b>Article 2:</b> Each person has an
obligation to abide by governmental regulations that are designed to
prevent an unreasonable risk of uncompensable harm. Each person has
an obligation to compensate others for the compensable harms that are
caused by his or her actions, except when the harm is caused by the
assertion of equal rights or legitimate competition. Congress and
state legislatures shall have the power to enforce this article by
appropriate legislation.</p>
<p><a name="Article 3:"></a><b>Article 3:</b> All persons, in all
generations, have equal rights to natural opportunities, such as the
use of land, natural resources, and the frequency spectrum. Therefore
Congress shall place levies on states to equalize among states the
per capita annual value of access to natural opportunities, and to
compensate for the harmful effects of activities in states on other
states and on future generations. State legislatures shall place
corresponding levies on their subdivisions.</p>
<p><a name="Article 4:"></a><b>Article 4: </b>Congress may place
levies on states to collect from states a portion of the benefits
they receive from national defense, national systems of
infrastructure, research of national significance, or any private
activity that has widespread public benefits. State legislatures may
place corresponding levies on their subdivisions.</p>
<p><a name="Article 5:"></a><b>Article 5:</b> People have the right
to form communities and local governments that express their shared
sense of community, and that provide the public services that they
wish to provide for themselves. Through their local governments,
people have the right to impose upon themselves and their fellow
citizens any regulations and any taxes of their choice. </p>
<p><a name="Article 6:"></a><b>Article 6:</b> People have the right
to trade freely with persons in all other localities, subject only to
restrictions of the localities of the trading persons. Every locality
has an obligation to allow goods to pass freely through its
territory, except that, to the extent that the passage of goods
causes cost, those costs may be recovered. </p>
<p><a name="Article 7"></a><b>Article 7</b>: Congress and state
legislatures shall make no law limiting the right of the people to
use anything they wish as a medium of exchange. </p>
<p><a name="Commentary"></a><b>Commentary</b></p>
<p>This bill of economic rights and obligations is designed to end
the struggle for domination through government policy, and thereby
free to the people from the tyranny of governments. Instead of
fighting for the chance to impose our will on one another, we would
agree that all have equal rights; no one is to be in a position of
privilege. From its Latin origin, a privilege is a "private law," a
law with someone's name on it, a law that permits someone to do what
others may not do. We should agree to eschew privilege. </p>
<p><a href="#Article%201">Article 1</a> says that we have a right to
what we produce: as workers, as entrepreneurs and as savers. Neither
Congress or state legislatures may tax this income, or our
corresponding spending. While they may not levy taxes on these
things, <a href="#Article%203:">Article 3</a> says that Congress and
state legislatures are required to place levies on states and state
subdivisions respectively, to equalize the per capita annual value of
access to natural opportunities, to compensate for the harms that
activities in states cause for other states, and to compensate for
losses to future generations. <a href="#Article%204:">Article 4</a>
permits Congress and state legislature to finance activities that
have benefits beyond a single subdivision, but only by levies on
subdivisions, not by taxes on persons.</p>
<p>Communities are allowed to have whatever taxes and regulations
their citizens choose. Anyone who is dissatisfied can live elsewhere.
While communities would be permitted to tax wages and interest if
they wished, they would find it attractive to do so only if their
citizens were content with such sharing. The primary source of
financing for communities would be the rental value of land and other
natural opportunities. Because the provision of a worthwhile local
public good generally raises rent by enough to pay for the good,
communities would generally be able to finance themselves with only a
fraction of the rent of land. The rest of rent could provide as a
basic income for all.</p>
<p>Support for those who are unable to provide for themselves would
come from this basic income, from the generosity of the fellow
citizens of their community, and from insurance that their parents
might reasonably be expected to provide for them in a world in which
all parents received justice themselves.</p>
<p>While the bill of economic rights and obligations does not address
the issue explicitly, it should be understood that people have a
right to redress for past injustice, no matter how far back in the
past. If some persons have inferior starting positions because they
are the descendants of slaves who, because of that status, were
unable to provide what others provided to their children, then there
should be a levy on the property of the descendants of slave-owners
to rectify that injustice.</p>
<p>In fulfilling its obligation to ensure that future generations had
opportunities at least as great as those of the present generation,
people would want to take account of:</p>
<blockquote>1. The amount of land per capita, adjusted for the quality
of land;<br>
2. The level of technology that will be available;<br>
3. The education and any initial wealth that is provided to all
children;<br>
4. The level of public infrastructure;<br>
5. The level of public debt;<br>
6. Environmental quality;<br>
7. The price of depletable natural resources.</blockquote>
<p>Decreases in some items could be offset by increases in others. If
people wanted to have more children than could be provided with
opportunities equal to those of the present generation, Congress and
state legislatures would have an obligation to tax those who wanted
to have children, so that people would have fewer children, and so
that all children could be provided with an initial endowment upon
attaining maturity, to compensate for reductions in other items on
the list.<br>
