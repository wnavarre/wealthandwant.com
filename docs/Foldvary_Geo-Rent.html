<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span>:
This paper presents an analysis of what is termed &#8220;geo-rent,&#8221; what the
plot-devoid-of-improvements would rent for in an auction. Most of the
public finance literature and current thought has disvalued and
misunderstood the actual and potential role of land and its rent for
public revenue. The qualities of land value that make it a superior
source of revenue &#8212; having little or no deadweight loss, and
capitalizing civic infrastructure and services &#8212; are recognized but
compartmentalized, ignored in the broader policy discussions. That the
&#8220;producer surplus&#8221; is in reality mostly land rent is little recognized.
The &#8220;Henry George Theorem&#8221; that rent can optimally equal the cost of
public goods is not applied to policy issues. Public finance theorists
and economists generally presume that land rent is an insignificant
portion of national income, whereas studies have estimated that a
substantial portion of government revenue could be obtained from
geo-rent. The shunting aside and disparagement of public revenue from
geo-rent has distorted economic analysis and contributes to iatrogenic
economy-hampering fiscal policy. The paper proposes a broader and more
integrated public economics which recognizes the fundamental role of
land in economies and fully incorporates the analysis of public revenue
from land rent.<br>

<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Ground-rents, and the ordinary rent of
land, are, therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can best
bear to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them. . . . The annual produce
of the land and labour of the society, the real wealth and revenue of
the great body of the people, might be the same after such a tax as
before. . . . [A tax of this kind would be] much more proper to be
established as a perpetual and unalterable regulation, or as what is
called a fundamental law of the commonwealth, than any tax which was
always to be levied according to a certain valuation.</span><br>
<div style="text-align: right;">&#9472;Adam Smith ([1776], 844, 834)</div>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
In my opinion, the least bad tax is the property tax on the unimproved
value of land, the Henry George argument of many, many years ago.</span><br>
<div style="text-align: right;">&#9472;Milton <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Friedman</a> (1978, 14)</div>
</div>
<br>
Most of the literature on taxation, in textbooks and articles, is
confined to studying existing forms of taxes, namely income, payroll,
sales, excise, tariff, value-added, estate and property taxes.<br>
<br>
Consider the article by David Altig <span style="font-style: italic;">et
al </span>in the <span style="font-style: italic;">American Economic
Review</span> (2001) entitled "Simulating Fundamental Tax Reform in the
United States." The authors examine "fundamental alternatives" to the
U.S. federal income tax. "Fundamental", they explain, means "the
simplification and integration of the tax code by eliminating tax
preferences and taxing all sources of capital income at the same rate"
(574). It is important to analyze such reforms, but the reforms
simulated are not what I would call fundamental. They are only a
restructuring of the existing income-tax code.<br>
<br>
Here, I plead for more attention to truly fundamental reform. The idea
is to tax the market value of land, exclusive of the value of
improvements.<br>
<br>
Some people might think that the ideas explored here are just a "pet
topic" or "hobby horse," but I proclaim otherwise. 
<ul>
  <li>These ideas are directly and importantly relevant to many aspects
of public economics.  </li>
  <li>The principles are empirically pervasive and compelling; they are
testable and abundantly demonstrated in historical and cross-sectional
studies.  </li>
  <li>Finally, these lines of thinking carry certain lessons and policy
implications that can be pursued incrementally and approached by
practical politics and gradual reform.  </li>
</ul>
There is nothing impractical or "utopian" about the points I wish to
see integrated into public economics. Whether they will ever be <span
 style="font-style: italic;">politically possible</span> is a separate
question, the answer to which is a function of our intellectual
enterprise.<br>
<br>
The large middle part of this article treats a series of mainstream
topics. I develop that series of topics to show that mainstream
literature has a way of dancing around the idea of taxing landing
value. But first the basic ideas call for clarification.<br>
<br>
<a name="LAND_AND_ITS_UNIQUENESS"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">LAND
AND ITS UNIQUENESS</span><br>
<br>
&#8220;Land&#8221; includes all earthly space, not just solid surfaces. Land
includes water areas and the electro-magnetic spectrum, but the most
important potential source of public revenue from land is real estate
sites.<br>
<br>
The characteristics of land are well known. 
<ul>
  <li>Land has a fixed supply. The space within some boundary can be
neither expanded nor contracted.  </li>
  <li>Land is fixed not only in extent but also in mobility, unlike
people, who can migrate, or capital goods, which are more or less
mobile.  </li>
  <li>Land cannot be imported. Even in the case of buildings and other
permanent structures, they differ from land in that they are created by
human enterprise, and in that their creators decide where the structure
will be located.  </li>
  <li>Finally, land is not something to be discovered. Once people
figured out that the earth was a sphere, and its approximate size, they
knew that the land was &#8220;out there.&#8221; Entrepreneurship is vital in
discovering the best routes to land areas, it is vital in discovering
the potential value of those areas, but it is not vital in discovering
that the land is out there. That was known all along.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="GEO-RENT"></a>GEO-RENT<br>
<br>
</span>The term &#8220;rent&#8221; is most generally defined as a payment for the
use of any resource (Alchian, 1991). &#8220;Land rent&#8221; could refer either to
the actual amount paid by tenants or to the potential or economic rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">My analysis here is based on an
assessment or estimate of what the plot-devoid-of-improvements would
rent for in a market or auction.</span> This has been called "ground
rent" or &#8220;economic land rent,&#8221; but those names and others are easily
misunderstood. To ensure against the hazard of reasonable but erroneous
inference, I propose an exotic label, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">geo-rent</span>. &#8220;Geo&#8221; in Latin means
earth or ground, and it also suggests George, as in Henry George.</span><br>
<br>
A site&#8217;s geo-rent is not based on the particular activity at that site.
The geo-rent of a site containing lavish buildings and gardens equals
what the geo-rent would be if, for some strange reason, those
improvements suddenly disintegrated. A fully developed site has about
the same geo-rent (per acre) as an adjacent vacant lot.<br>
<br>
Suppose I own a 50-acre site that is pristine, unimproved. That site
would rent for $100,000. Hence, the geo-rent is $100,000. The next year
I build a large beautiful and successful shopping center on the site.
My geo-rent is still only $100,000 (assuming the amount for which my
site unimproved would rent has not changed). However, if my shopping
center makes neighboring land more valuable, it <span
 style="font-style: italic;">does </span>increase my neighbor&#8217;s
geo-rent.<br>
<br>
The interrelation between one landowner&#8217;s improvements and his
neighbor&#8217;s geo-rent is an interesting matter. Another interesting
matter is a landowner&#8217;s contribution to improvements on neighboring
lands, such as sponsoring a new road. If the new road would increase
his geo-rent tax bill, geo-rent taxation, it would seem, would reduce
his incentive to sponsor such an improvement.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> But
here I leave these tangents aside, with the summary judgment that I do
not think that such issues do much, if anything, to weaken the case for
tapping geo-rent.<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">1 The effect on geo-rent would
be smaller if the road is a toll-road, because then more of the value
added is internalized, i.e., captured by the road owners.</font></small><br>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="ASSESSING_GEO-RENT_IS_EASY_COMPARED_TO"></a>ASSESSING GEO-RENT
IS EASY COMPARED TO ASSESSING SALES, INCOME, OR PROFITS</span></p>
<p>  I concede that geo-rent is a hypothetical. Geo-rent is based on two
  fictions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first is that the site is devoid of improvements.  </li>
  <li>The second is that it is being rented out.  </li>
</ul>
One occasionally hears criticisms of geo-rent taxation like this from
the textbook by McConnell and Brue (2005, 300): &#8220;[I]n practice it would
be difficult to determine how much of any specific income payment
actually amounted to [geo-rent].&#8221;<br>
<br>
Yet, professional real estate appraisers routinely separate a site&#8217;s
ground value and the improvement&#8217;s value. This separation is typically
required for fire insurance. Banks for mortgages also commonly require
it. These parties estimate site value as a residual after the
replacement cost of buildings, adjusted for depreciation. This process
is combined with computerized contour mapping of site value per square
meter, based on actual land-sale and lease data. The computerized
mapping works to smooth out the assessments, and can be done to
emphasize long-term trends rather than year-by-year fluctuations in
land values (as is done today with the assessment of property-tax).
Adam Smith (1776) advocates geo-rent taxation (832 - 844) and explains
that separating out the value of improvements is not that big a deal
(833, 844).<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">2 George carefully rationalized
the single tax in terms of Adam
Smith's "canons of taxation." On the affinity between Smith and George,
see Petrella (1984).</font></small></div>
<br>
Of course this is inexact. Of course there will be judgment calls by
assessors, as well as some politicking in the details. But serious
economics is comparative. All tax rules will involve inexactness,
judgment calls, and politicking. Let&#8217;s ask honestly how serious these
problems are compared to other forms of taxation.<br>
<br>
Sales, incomes, profits, imports, and estates are easily hidden.
Deductions, cost accounting, and expenses are devilishly
particularistic, involving whatever human activities the taxed party <span
 style="font-style: italic;">says </span>are involved in generating
sales, income, or profits. Documentation is a tangle of complex record
keeping, and is very difficult to make accountable. Documentation is
easily fabricated. Enforcement is intrusive and encroaches on civil
liberties. The dimensions of earning sales, income, etc. are myriad,
and all call for particularistic tax rules, each highly subject to
arbitrariness and politicking because of the particularism.<br>
<br>
By contrast, it is impossible to hide land. It is impossible to shrink,
move or disguise land. Moreover, the dimensions of valuing ground space
are relatively few. The government can set general rules that apply
universally. In contrast to income-tax records which are for good
reasons kept from public view, the site-value assessments for geo-rent
would be a public record, as in fact real-estate assessments are today.
In principle, absolutely no record keeping is required, apart from
title to the land. Compared to taxing income, sales, estates, etc.,
taxing geo-rent is objective, transparent, and non-intrusive. These
virtues were emphasized by Adam Smith (1776: 848).<br>
<br>
Those who allege a relative difficulty in separating the value of land
from the value of improvements lose sight of the main policy issue. The
relative efficiency of tapping geo-rent is that doing so imposes no
marginal cost on additional income, sales, or personal property. <a
 name="Condominiums_"></a>Condominiums assign to each unit a fixed
percentage interest in the association, which is also its percentage of
the assessments. This percentage interest is often based on the site
value of the unit relative to the other units, i.e. its location and
size, irrespective of any personal property inside the unit, let alone
the owners&#8217; income or spending.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thousands of condominium
associations are thus accomplishing what some claim is impractical.</span>
They tap the site value of a unit without reducing extra income or
burdening extra spending or possessions. Residential associations,
hotels, and other private communities do likewise with their rental
charges and assessments. Some private communities such as shopping
centers do practice modern <a name="sharecropping"></a>sharecropping,
basing some of their charges on the gross revenue of the tenant shops
as a way of sharing risks, but this is not an essential feature of
private-community financing.<br>

  <a name="GRADUAL_REFORM:_20_YEARS_TO_75_PERCENT"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">GRADUAL REFORM: 20 YEARS TO 75 PERCENT</span></p>
<p>  A shift to public finance from geo-rent would be politically difficult,
which may help explain why it has not been done. The political
difficulty, however, exists despite the fact that most homeowners,
being also wage earners, would have a net gain if other taxes,
including the property tax on improvements, were simultaneously
abolished. But some current landowners, especially of urban commercial
real estate, would have a net loss, unless we build in some kind of &#8220;compensation.&#8221; Economists are accustomed to saying that a tough
transition &#8212; plant-closings, declining industries, retooling and
retraining &#8212; should not deter the long-term good. The same should apply
here.<br>
<br>
I suggest the following transition to geo-rent taxation, if only to
serve as a conceptual model:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time 0</span>:
The new regime is enacted into law.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Years 1 through 10:</span> The
landowner continues to pay the roughly 25 percent of the geo-rent now
implicit in his current property taxes. (If the property tax is 2
percent of land value and the capitalization rate (real interest rate)
is 6 percent, that works out to about 25 percent of geo-rent, which is
an annualized dimension.)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 11</span>: He pays 30 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 12</span>: He pays 35 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 13</span>: He pays 40 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 14</span>: He pays 45 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 15</span>: He pays 50 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 16</span>: He pays 55 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 17</span>: He pays 60 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 18</span>: He pays 65 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 19</span>: He pays 70 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Year 20</span>: He pays 75 percent.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thereafter</span>: He pays 75 percent.<br>
</div>
Here are a number of points the help to flesh out the scheme:
<ul>
  <li>The scheme applies also to government-owned land. The associated
government agency, such as the Bureau of Land Management or the United
States Postal Service, would pay geo-rent for the land it owns. This
will improve government cost accounting and policy decisions.</li>
  <li>To which level of government are geo-rent taxes paid? This is an
important question, but I wish to sidestep it here. For present
purposes, one may imagine a system in which, like property taxes today,
geo-rent taxes would be collected at the level of county government.
When such taxes are sufficiently large, they would flow both down to
the city governments and up to the state and national governments.</li>
  <li>The other side of the scheme, not detailed here, is the untaxing
of buildings, sales, income, etc. Thus, the scheme involves an enormous
confiscation of land-wealth and an enormous de-confiscation of other
kinds of wealth.</li>
</ul>
A reform like that suggested here would, of course, require a movement
and public debate taking years, if not decades. Once enacted, during
the first 10 years, the landowners pay no more in geo-rent than they
are accustomed to paying. All this lead-up time will give people time
to figure out what geo-rent taxation means, and to work out in markets
the present values of land, in anticipation of the coming increases in
levies.<br>
<br>
<a name="NO_EXCESS_BURDEN"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">NO
EXCESS BURDEN</span><br>
<br>
The writings of the Physiocrats, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, James Mill,
John Stuart Mill, Henry George, Leon Walras, and Knut Wicksell, among
many other economists, well recognize that<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> the taxation of site values, as an
inelastic factor, has no excess burden, no deadweight loss. </span>Geo-rent
merely gets transferred to government. The burden is borne by the owner
in not keeping that portion of the geo-rent. The tax is not passed on
to tenants, since a higher rental charge reduces the quantity of rental
space demanded, while not reducing the fixed space supplied, and thus
creates vacancies which induce landlords to keep the rent at the
previous level to avoid losses. There is no excess burden on the
economy other than the ordinary costs of tax administration (which, as
noted, would be particularly low for this type of tax).<br>
<br>
The financial burden is only on the owners who are current at the time
the geo-rent tax is increased. What is not so well recognized in public
finance is that, <span style="font-style: italic;">after </span>the
transition to geo-rent taxation, there is no burden on any <span
 style="font-style: italic;">new </span>site owner. The price of land
is capitalized down in proportion to the tax rate, so the payment of
the tax is offset by the lower price of land. However, if we may
neglect the consequences on the dependents and heirs of the current
landowners, after the transitional generation, no one suffers a burden.<br>
<br>
The impact on the current landowners raises issues of &#8220;compensation.&#8221;
While advocates of tapping geo-rent for public revenue argue that it is
equitable, because it pays back geo-rent generated by government&#8217;s
civic works, critics argue that the transition would not be equitable,
because the financial burden would be concentrated on landowners.
Robert Solow (1998, 278) states that while taxing geo-rent would be
good for a new country, &#8220;Expropriating land values today would have no
semblance of fairness.&#8221; He adds, however, that if the transition is
gradual or if there is compensation, then &#8220;the complaint of iniquity
may lose validity.&#8221;<br>
<br>
An immediate tax shift to geo-rent, with other taxes reduced or
abolished, could be compensated with special bonds whose face-value
interest payments would decrease over time, with an effect similar to
the gradual increase in the geo-rent tax rate suggested above. But
compensation is a side issue. I say we try to sell the reform to the
current landowners on its merits, just as we would argue for a
reduction in trade barriers, as a worthy sacrifice, and offer our
gratitude for their political cooperation. (I say this as the owner of
a prime plot in Berkeley, California!)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="MAINSTREAM_LITERATURE:_READ_BETWEEN_THE"></a>MAINSTREAM
LITERATURE: READ BETWEEN THE LINES<br>
<br>
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mainstream
microeconomic and public finance textbooks almost never bring the idea
geo-rent taxation into the sunlight.</span> The respected journals,
too, give very little attention to these ideas. The principles behind
the idea of geo-rent taxation make sense, however. Indeed, those very
same textbooks and journal articles establish many of the principles
that sustain the idea. But the principles are scattered throughout the
literature. The literature is compartmentalized in such a fashion that
prevents students from seeing how the principles form a powerful idea.
In this sense, geo-rent lurks between the lines of the public-economics
literature.<br>
<br>
Here I highlight eight mainstream topics where geo-rent principles
surface: <br>

</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Producer_Surplus"></a>Producer
Surplus<br>
<br>
</span>Every microeconomics textbook shows the &#8220;producer surplus&#8221; as
the area between the supply curve and the price<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">. But no textbook that I have seen, with
the exception of David Friedman (1996), has thought to ask who receives
the surplus.</span> If the industry is perfectly competitive, firms
being price takers, there is no economic profit, yet the surplus is a
return beyond costs. The surplus does not go to the owners of the
firms, but, as Friedman states, flows through to the input factor
owners. Going beyond Friedman, it should be clear that if markets for
labor and capital goods, too, are perfectly competitive, they too have
no super-normal returns, so the only other place the surplus can go to
is to geo-rent. In a fully perfectly competitive model, &#8220;producer
surplus&#8221; does not go to producers at all; it is a payment to landowners
who have never produced a thing. It is really the non-producer surplus.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Deadweight_Loss_Analysis"></a>Deadweight
Loss Analysis<br>
<br>
</span>Microeconomics textbooks explain the deadweight loss from
taxation. They explain how the loss is lower with a more inelastic
supply and demand. Professors have given thousands of classroom
lectures showing that if the supply curve were perfectly vertical,
there would be no deadweight loss. But they usually end the discussion
by saying, &#8220;and so it is good to try to put such taxation on goods that
exhibit relative inelasticity in supply or demand.&#8221; Some textbooks go
on to say that, because the supply of land is fixed, the taxation of
land rent has no excess burden. A few books point out that Henry George
proposed such taxation. None that I have seen point out that Adam Smith
and John Stuart Mill did, too.<br>
<br>
Tideman et al (2002, 17) &#8220;estimate that the net gain (measured in real
dollars of 2000), from shifting as much taxation to land as could be
financed by collecting 90% of the land rent, would be $1308 billion or
14% of NDP in 2002 and $4,799 billion or 26.6% of NDP in 2042.&#8221; Even if
only a fraction of government revenue shifted from the types of taxes
we know today to a geo-rent tax, the efficiency gains could be really
substantial.<br>
<br>
The elasticity insight remains compartmentalized. In public finance
textbooks, when the discussion turns to tax policies, the insight is
rather neglected, and the idea of taxing land value is usually nowhere
to be found. It is as though there were some medicine available that we
know cures cancer, yet nobody takes it and no doctor prescribes it.
Economists who study irrational behavior should take note.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="The_Henry_George_Theorem"></a>The
Henry George Theorem</span><br>
<br>
Textbooks in public finance and urban economics sometimes contain a
topic known as the &#8220;Henry George Theorem.&#8221; It states that the public
revenue that provides for the collective goods of an optimally-sized
community equals the land rent of that community. As presented in
Atkinson and Stiglitz (1987, 523-5), the representative agent&#8217;s utility
function is U(G,X), where G is a collective and X a private good.
Output Y is a function of N workers:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Y = f(N) = XN + G.<br>
X = {f(N)-G} / N<br>
The wage is the marginal product of labor:<br>
&#8706;f/&#8706;N = X<br>
Therefore,<br>
&#8706;f/&#8706;N = {(f(N)-G)/N}<br>
G = f(N) - Nf&#8217;(N)</div>
<br>
With land and labor the ultimate and original factors of production,
rent (R) is the difference between total product Y and total wages:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">R = f(N) - Nf'(N)</div>
<br>
Therefore,<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">R = G.<br>
</div>
The Henry George Theorem is so named because it echoes Henry George's
(1879) single-tax proposal, that not only should land rent be the only
general tax, but that it will be adequate to finance public goods. The
theorem is accepted in public finance, but it is not applied. In
upper-level public-economics textbooks such as Atkinson and Stiglitz
(1987), it is presented, yet not invoked in policy discussions, and it
is ignored in scholarly treatments of optimal taxation, tax reform, and
public policy.<br>
<br>
Edwin Mills (1998) goes further and constructs a comparative static
model of a metropolis using a Cobb-Douglas production function with
three factors, the third being land, which is a refreshing change from
the usual two-factor analysis that tucks land into capital and then
forgets that it&#8217;s there. One theorem of the model is that a land-value
tax has no effect on resource allocation. Yet he concludes (47) that
despite is theoretical attractiveness a significant taxing of geo-rent
would deprive the owners of their beneficial uses, and would require
compensation, leaving the tax &#8220;practically almost worthless&#8221; (47, 41).<br>
<br>
Thomas Nechyba (1998) also has a model with land, calibrated to U.S.
parameters. He shows that replacing taxes on capital with taxes on land
can actually increase land values, despite the downward capitalization
caused by the tax, because of the greater increase in capital and rent.
According to the model (p. 196), with an elasticity of substitution
between capital and land of 0.5, which is within the estimated range, a
revenue-neutral tax shift to land value increases capital goods by 122
percent and raises output by 89 percent.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Capitalization"></a>Capitalization<br>
<br>
</span>The textbooks and mainstream journals recognize the idea of
capitalization. Indeed, there is a great deal of literature about land
prices reflecting the schools, infrastructure, and security in the
neighborhood. But, again, the understanding is often compartmentalized;
the insight is rarely applied in thinking about efficient forms of
taxation and governance. Public economists rarely point out how the
idea of capitalization favors geo-rent taxation: If local government
taxes geo-rent, and it uses that money to provide infrastructure and
security, it further enhances geo-rent, thus recouping some of its
investment. If local government claims 50 percent of geo-rent, it has
an incentive to enhance geo-rent. It is the half residual claimant. The
arrangement is healthy, because government&#8217;s local works directly
affect the magnitude of geo-rent. The government&#8217;s residual claimancy
gives it an incentive to produce social benefits.<br>
<br>
This government-as-improver process parallels capitalization as the
basis for the private provision of collective goods, such as the common
elements of condominiums financed by the periodic assessment of the
owners. Private communities and condominiums demonstrate the connection
between residual claimancy and capitalization.<br>
<br>
Land values in many parts of the United States are very high, and one
reason is supply-side restrictions. But much of the value reflects the
capitalization of amenities. Today, government works are financed in
large part by taxes on labor, profits, sales, and non-land real estate.
The owners of land receive an implicit subsidy. This implicit subsidy
is of great empirical importance, yet is not discussed in
microeconomics textbooks, and is usually ignored in the tax analysis in
public finance.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Public_Goods"></a>Public Goods<br>
<br>
</span>Public goods are usually defined as both nonrival and
nonexcludable. The public finance literature often alleges &#8220;market
failure&#8221; for goods such as streets, sewers, parks, security, and fire
fighting. Once a collective good is provided, it is not practical or
desirable to exclude persons. For example, even if one agrees that
people can be excluded from a city park, it would not be desirable to
have walls and gates to keep out the free riders.<br>
<br>
The &#8220;free rider&#8221; doctrine, however, tends to treat public goods as
though they have no location in space and time. Somewhere, out in the
ether, there is a public good and some users who cannot be made to pay
for benefits. But the benefits of most real-world public goods fall
within an ambit that is territorial. Accordingly, those benefits become
capitalized into the market price of land within that ambit. Those
using the civic services are included by proximity; it is costly for
far-away users to visit a neighborhood park. Residents, businesses, and
customers willingly pay more because they benefit from the territorial
goods. Most users therefore do make payments that are proportional to
such amenities, since they must pay to use land. But the payments are
made to the landowner. The market-failure doctrine for public goods is
turned on its head: Users do tend to pay in an indirect sense, and
government policy creates the free riding of the landowners, at the
expense of the extraneous taxpayers. Rather than correcting any
deficiency of markets, policy is iatrogenic, that is, illness caused by
the doctor. Streets, parks, and security suffer from free riding
because the doctor made it that way. This insight is rarely found in
mainstream sources.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Externalities"></a>Externalities</span><br>
<br>
A similar sort of blinkered compartmentalization goes for textbook
discussions of externalities. The mainstream literature rarely
highlights the point that, whether by geo-rent taxation or by private
contract, the tapping of geo-rent promotes internalization of
externalities. If the government depends on geo-rent, it has a strong
incentive to increase geo-rents, or to ameliorate externalities. Public
revenue from site values thus is an important way to internalize
territorial costs and benefits. The failure to tap geo-rent exacerbates
externalities. Private communities do base their finances on site
rentals, and we are less inclined to identify the positives and
negatives within a private community as &#8220;externalities.&#8221; Territorial
amenities have been internalized within property relations and
pecuniary effects.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Club_Models"></a>Club Models</span><br>
<br>
Although there was previous analysis of excludable collective goods,
including the model of Tiebout (1956) discussed below, James Buchanan
(1965) established <span style="font-weight: bold;">club theory</span>
by adapting the Samuelson public-goods model to goods that are
excludable and subject to congestion. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The model determines the optimal
size of a club in which the members obtain utility from the club good,
disutility from crowding, and no utility from camaraderie.</span> In
the Buchanan model, the cost of the good is divided equally among the
members.<br>
<br>
The Buchanan model is suitable to something like a swim club. The
Buchanan model is non-territorial; it does not address location and
geo-rent. Some literature does examine territorial clubs, but many of
the models and presentations of club theory intended to be general have
ignored land, even when they seek to be applied to civic goods, making
them not only incomplete but also inapplicable to real-world
municipalities.<br>
<br>
In their textbook <span style="font-style: italic;">The Theory of
Externalities, Public Goods, and Club Goods</span>, Richard Cornes and
Todd Sandler (1986) presented a general theory of public goods and club
goods with no mention of territory or location. The book's index has no
entries for land, rent, capitalization, territory, or location. Only on
the last page of the book (275), they wrote, &#8220;Another suggested
research direction concerns the inclusion of a spatial dimension to
club analysis.&#8221; They added, &#8220;More work on spatial clubs appears
warranted, since <span style="font-style: italic;">no general</span>
analysis of spatial clubs exist&#8221; (italics in the original). By 1986,
the public-goods literature already had the Henry George Theorem
(Stiglitz 1977, Vickrey 1977), as well as a substantial body of theory
concerning location, capitalization, and rent going back to Hotelling
(1938) and far back to von Th&uuml;nen (1842). Cornes and Sandler&#8217;s
omission and last-page suggestion reflects economists&#8217; general regard
for land as tangential rather than central to the theory of public
goods.<br>
<br>
In their second edition, Cornes and Sandler (1996, p. 367) did include
the analysis of Scotchmer (1994), in which the fee for local public
goods is the payment of a land tax. Cornes and Sandler state, "We view
the land tax instrument to be more problematic when individuals are
heterogeneous" because some obtain more utility from the public good
than others (367).<br>
<br>
An individual could limit his land holding to reduce his land tax while
still consuming the same amount of public good.<br>
<br>
Instead of recognizing the virtues of tapping geo-rent, they only point
to a possible imperfection, such as that somebody who enjoys a local
park will own a tiny lot nearby and pay a land tax lower than his share
of the cost. This, say Cornes and Sandler (367), is a "perverse
incentive." But such free riding is rampant with income and sales
taxes, in which tax payments have hardly a gossamer relation to any
benefit. Tapping geo-rent is being judged in isolation by the standard
of perfect efficiency, rather than in comparison to other means of
taxing people to pay for collective goods. This &#8220;perverse incentive&#8221;
proposition is also made in an institutional vacuum. In practice, as
Hamilton (1975) points out, rules can mitigate the problem. City lots
tend to have a uniform size, either with zoning or with covenants.
Moreover, much of the utility of dwellers comes from complementarities,
from the lot and improvements (house and garden) as well as from a set
of civic services, so as analyzed by Ellickson (1971), heterogeneous
utilities are of little empirical significance.<br>
<br>
Evidently Cornes and Sandler (1996) did not consider the Scotchmer
material to warrant entries for land or rent in their 2nd edition
index. On the last page (552) of the 2nd edition, the authors repeat
their earlier suggestion of research into the spatial dimension, and
again assert that there exists no general analysis of spatial clubs,
this time much less justified. (Foldvary 1994 did analyze spatial clubs
in some generality!)<br>
<br>
William Fischel (1998) puts a different twist on zoning, saying that
zoning provides a way to collect land rent by granting developers
exceptions in exchange for fees. But development impact fees distort
development by placing a charge on a particular activity rather than
having a uniform levy rate on all geo-rent. While it may seem efficient
to let those benefiting from a development pay for the related
infrastructure, it in effect has the opposite effect from that sought
by Henry George: those who build get taxed, while those who let their
lands lie idle are not taxed. Moreover, the impact fee may end up
taxing capital and labor along with geo-rent.<br>
<br>
Remarkably, Fischel (1998, 11) states that &#8220;property taxation cannot
achieve any significant efficiency at the state level.&#8221; This, he says,
is because states are too large for Tiebout effects, and states can
internalize the benefits of development. This ignores the efficiency
gains of shifting away from deadweight-loss-causing taxation, a gain
that Fischel recognizes two pages later (p. 13). Fischel (1998, 15)
also accuses site-value taxation of high administrative costs in &#8220;the
knife-edge goal&#8221; of &#8220;getting almost all land rent.&#8221; This is a
straw-man, since the real-world cases of geo-rent taxation have not
sought to measure and collect the full geo-rent exactly, and in fact
there are numerous cases of successful implementation (Andelson, 2000).<br>
<br>
Championing zoning, Fischel (1998, 16) states that &#8220;the zoning system
does not have to be all that accurate.&#8221; Yet for some reason, geo-rent
taxation must be &#8220;knife-edge&#8221; precise. As is well-known, zoning is a
blunt, highly politicized, and highly discretionary instrument. It
often becomes perverse. By comparison, governmental rules for assessing
geo-rent would be much simple, transparent, universal, and relatively
free of politicking.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="The_Tiebout_Model"></a>The
Tiebout Model<br>
<br>
</span>The landmark model of competition among communities in the
provision of collective goods is that of Charles Tiebout (1956), which,
as Bruce Hamilton (1991, 672) stated, offered an "antidote to
Samuelson's rather gloomy results." Paul Samuelson (1954, 388) had
stated categorically, "<span style="font-style: italic;">no
decentralized pricing system can serve to determine optimally these
levels of collective consumption</span>" (italics in the original).<br>
<br>
Tiebout&#8217;s analysis shows that this conclusion does not hold for local
civic goods. The consumers can select the communities which best
satisfy their preferences. In the Tiebout model, unlike the Buchanan
club model, the provision of the club goods is held fixed. Consumers
reveal their demands for collective goods through a choice of
community, and competition among communities assures that local
collective goods are provided at minimum cost. Residents dissatisfied
with their community's civic goods will leave, resulting in, at the
limit, homogenous communities with respect to the public goods desired
by the residents. Joseph Stiglitz (1983) points out that pure
homogeneity is not necessary to the Tiebout conclusions if there are
productive interactions among people, if there are transportation
costs, and if people have different utility functions for land.<br>
<br>
Though Tiebout in his model recognizes space with respect to
congestion, it is unfortunate that the model itself has no spatial
dimensions and no land rent. It was unfortunate both because it made
the Tiebout model incomplete and because much of the subsequent Tiebout
literature also ignores land. As stated by Hamilton (1991, 673), "the
tax instrument is of critical importance if the efficiency or even
existence of a Tiebout equilibrium is to be achieved." And as stated by
Blankart and Borck (2004, 455), "Problems arise in the Tiebout model if
public services are financed by distortionary taxation."<br>
<br>
The <a name="value_of_a_city_park"></a>value of a city park diminishes
with the distance from the park. Therefore, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ceteris paribus</span>, those closest to
the park will have a higher geo-rent. The most efficient way to finance
the community is from the geo-rent, not by equal dues payments. The
Tiebout model will reflect the territorial ambit of goods only when
land and location are taken into account.<br>
<br>
The spatial dimension has been recognized in the Henry George Theorem
and by analysts who have incorporated the capitalization of civic goods
into site value. The empirical studies of Wallace Oates (1969) found
evidence for the capitalization of the benefits of local collective
goods and of property taxes.<br>
<br>
Buchanan and Goetz (1972) found that the internalization of what
otherwise would be externalities would occur if the communities are
proprietary and if competition equalizes the value of the externality.
"Tax shares would have to be related to the size of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">locational </span>rent component in
individual income receipts" (35; italics in the original). "If all
valued 'space' should be privately owned and if competition among
proprietary ownership units were effective in all respects,
allocational efficiency might emerge" (40). Tyler Cowen (1988, p. 14)
notes that models such as that of Buchanan and Goetz "offer the
intriguing suggestion that Tiebout's model is better suited to analyses
of collective goods provision through proprietary communities."<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="HOW_LARGE_IS_THE_GEO-RENT_TAX-BASE"></a>HOW LARGE IS THE
GEO-RENT TAX-BASE?</span><br>
<br>
One of the pitfalls surrounding the idea of tapping geo-rent is that it
is closely associated with Henry George&#8217;s <span
 style="font-style: italic;">single</span>-tax ideal society. Authors
such as Mankiw (2004, 168) and McConnell and Brue (2005, 300) point out
that geo-rent taxation alone could not cover the current levels of
government spending. But that point works only as a criticism of
eliminating all taxes aside from geo-rent taxation, not as a criticism
of the principle of the idea of tapping geo-rent.<br>
<br>
I have the further impression that many economists think that geo-rent
is a tiny portion of GDP. That notion seems to lead some economists to
figure that even if geo-rent taxation is efficient, it is empirically
of small import. Dick Netzer (1998, 116) notes that the proposition
that &#8220;the potential revenue from land value taxation&#8221; is insufficient
&#8220;is widely held today.&#8221;<br>
<br>
In a chapter entitled &#8220;rent, interest, and profits,&#8221; Salvatore and
Diulio (1996) have an exercise, &#8220;What are the criticisms of the
single-tax movement?&#8221; One criticism offered is that &#8220;rents in the
United States today amount to just about 1% of GNP, while taxes are 25%
of GNP&#8221; (355).<br>
<br>
In the official GDP accounts by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bureau
of Economic Analysis</span> in the Department of Commerce, the only
category termed &#8220;rent&#8221; is "rental income of persons," which in 2004 was
put at an annualized estimate of $150 billion, or less than 1.5% of
GDP. This "rental income" is net of expenses such as property taxes and
mortgage interest, but the bulk of such expenses are also returns on
real estate which are being paid to lenders and the government!<br>
<br>
The BEA&#8217;s &#8220;rental income of persons&#8221; includes rental payments for both
the sites and the buildings, adjusted down for the deprecation or
&#8220;capital consumption&#8221; of the improvements. Without capital consumption,
the rental income is $166 billion, and that includes the imputed
rentals of owner-occupied houses and the mortgage interest paid. This
&#8220;rental income of persons&#8221; is personal income, excluding the rental
income from land owned by corporations as well as the implicit
opportunity-cost rental value of land held by governments and nonprofit
agencies. Furthermore, corporate-owned land is severely understated in
corporate reports, because land is valued at the historical purchase
price, not current value.<br>
<br>
That economists would believe that the GDP rental income figures comes
anywhere close to being the total land rent is quite remarkable. Other
official data come closer to the actual geo-rent. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics of the Department of Labor reported that<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> consumer units
spent an average of $13,283 on housing in 2002, one third of total
spending (BLS, 2004), including the imputed rental of owner-occupied
dwellings</span>. The BLS reports 112,108,000 "consumer units"
(households),
so the total spent for housing was $1.5 trillion, ten times the "rental
income" figure of the BEA. That the $150 in BEA rental-income accounts
have little connection with actual geo-rent becomes even clearer when
compared to the 2003 home mortgage debt of $7.2 trillion (Financial
Services Fact Book, 2005), total mortgages of $9.3 trillion in 2003
(Financial Services Fact Book, 2005), and a housing stock of $15
trillion (National Association of Realtors, 2005).<br>
<br>
Property taxes in the U.S. are about $300 billion per year (Youngman
and Malme, 1993), with $228 billion going to local governments (Fisher,
1999). If a landlord collects $20,000 in annual rent and pays a
property tax of $9,000, the &#8220;rental income of persons&#8221; here (not
subtracting depreciation) is only $11,000, because the reported amount
deducts the landlord&#8217;s property-tax expense. Similarly, homeowner and
condominium association dues are deducted out in arriving at &#8220;rental
income of persons.&#8221; This category &#8220;rental income of persons,&#8221; then,
both includes elements other than geo-rent (notably, rental payments
for improvements such as buildings), and excludes much of the geo-rent
of the land.<br>
<br>
Moreover, as <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Gaffney.html">Gaffney</a> (1970, 194)
concludes, the untaxing of buildings, which is part of the geo-rent
taxation proposal, will raise ground rent by an amount about equal to
the loss of building taxes. Narrowing the property tax to geo-rent
only, therefore, would increase the geo-rent tax-base by about the same
amount as the building tax-based removed.<br>
<br>
Studies of geo-rent have been conducted by <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Cord.html">Steven
Cord</a>, <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Gaffney.html">Mason Gaffney</a>, Mike Miles, and
others. Mason Gaffney (1970, 181) finds that site value is generally at
least half of real estate value, which would imply that for the housing
stock alone the site value would be about $7.5 trillion.<br>
<br>
For private lands, much of the revenue from geo-rent is hidden in
interest payments, corporate profits, and capital gains, implying that
it isn&#8217;t showing up in &#8220;rental income of persons.&#8221; For example, the way
that building-owners may treat &#8220;depreciation&#8221; is unrealistic and even
nonsensical. Suppose Bob buys a building for $275,000 (excluding the
land value) and rents it out for $40,000 per year. On the premise that
a building is used up in 27.5 years, the tax code allows him to deduct
$10,000 each year. And then he deducts his real expense (maintenance,
etc.) of, say, $5,000, so the column shows only $25,000 in rental
income. Suppose that after 27.5 years, Bob sells the building to Sam.
Now Sam starts deducting depreciation all over again. Capital
consumption is to a large degree a legal fiction.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">One bids less for land that has tax
liabilities and on which profits are lower.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Untax the economy, and the economy would
produce greater output, which would be capitalized into higher
geo-rent. </span>Even if the geo-rent today were accurately
calculated, it would be far less than the potential public revenue,
because of capitalization effects of the untaxing side of the scheme.
As noted, the scheme would involve geo-rent payments from government
agencies. That, of course, will brings a corresponding increase in
government spending, so the matter of geo-rent of government lands is
not pertinent to the present issue. However, it is worth noting that
for government lands, the geo-rent is utterly opaque (Foldvary, 1989),
and that would have to change.<br>
<br>
Using a variety of data, <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Cord.html">Steven Cord</a> (1985,
1991) puts geo-rent at around 20 percent of GDP. Mike Miles (1990)
comes up with a similar figure using data from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis. The totals include government lands, but these estimates do
not include the increase in geo-rent that would occur with the
elimination of market-hampering taxes.<br>
<br>
The amount of actual and potential site revenues warrants much more
research, but these findings indicate that the tax base is substantial,
most likely in the range of 50 percent of all-level government tax
revenues. Interestingly, if both punitive taxes and transfer payments
were eliminated, the geo-rent would about equal government spending for
goods and services, in accord with the Henry George Theorem! At any
rate, any allegation that land rent is too small to be of policy
significance would have to be well argued.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="OTHER_ADVANTAGES_OF_TAPPING_GEO-RENT"></a>OTHER ADVANTAGES OF
TAPPING GEO-RENT<br>
<br>
</span>While this article will not necessarily serve as a manifesto for
the idea of tapping geo-rent to fund community goods, there are a
number of further advantages that merit passing mention.
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Geo-rent
taxation would reduce sprawl</span>. </span>Current tax
policies tend to discourage the development of urban land, because the
fruits of those developments are directly taxed. To the extent that
those policies are replaced by policies that tap geo-rent, the
landowner is incented to develop his land. Recall, an underused site
pays the same geo-rent tax as a developed site. The untaxing of
production combined with the tapping of geo-rent will induce infilling
of the city center, making for a more compact city, agreeable to mixed
use and pedestrian activity. Hence, the demand-side push for sprawl is
diminished. Moreover, the supply-side pull toward sprawl would also be
diminished: Today, sprawl landowners are subsidized by extraneous
taxpayers who pay for the roads, sewers, schools, fire-fighting, and
security in the sprawl neighborhoods. If those services depended on the
community&#8217;s geo-rent, the pull toward sprawl would be reduced.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dampening
cycles</span>:</span> Today, a factor in cycles is real-estate
speculation. An economic boom increases the price of land, and
speculation can drive prices even higher. Geo-rent taxation would mean
that there are no &#8220;killings&#8221; to be made in land, since 75 percent of
the geo-rent would flow to the government, not the landowner. Tapping
geo-rent would dampen the real-estate cycle, which in turn dampens the
business cycle (Foldvary, 1997).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tax-base
of last resort</span>:</span> Technology promises to make capital and
people ever more mobile, and encryption promises to make money and
enterprise less visible. Put differently, technology threatens to make
conventional taxation more difficult. Tapping geo-rent may well be the
revenue source most suitable for the 21st century. Technology will
never enable the landowner to hide his land or move it off-shore.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="PRIVATIZING_THE_NEIGHBORHOOD"></a>PRIVATIZING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD<br>
<br>
</span>Fortunately, real-estate practitioners pay no attention to
textbook economics. Increasingly, new communities are developed within
a nexus of private ownership and contract. 
<ul>
  <li>In the United States, four-fifths of new housing developments
involve membership in homeowner associations (Community Associations
Institute, 2005).  </li>
  <li>In China, all major new developments have walls, guards and
private governments (Webster, 2002).  </li>
  <li>In Russia (Lentz and Lindner, 2002) and South Africa
(J&uuml;rgens and Gnad, 2002; Landman, 2002), wealthier citizens
privately provide for their safety in gated communities.  </li>
</ul>
The empirical fact on the ground is attracting increasing academic
attention from many fields, including urban studies, legal scholars,
and anthropologists, and there have been international scholarly
conferences to explore private communities (Glasz, 2005).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The great challenge concerns existing
communities of the traditional governmental structure: How are they
converted to a nexus of private property and contract?</span><br>
<br>
Robert Nelson (1999) has proposed a policy for converting neighborhoods
to residential associations, similar to the policy in St. Louis, where
neighborhoods may privatize (Foldvary 1994). Under Nelson&#8217;s plan, state
law would permit property owners to petition to form a neighborhood
association within a proposed boundary. Approval would require an
affirmative vote both of 90 percent of the total property value
affected and 75 percent of the individual unit owners. The relevant
governments would 125 then authorize a transfer of services and
property such as streets to the association, accompanied by tax credits
in compensation for the reduction of government expenses. All property
owners in the privatized neighborhood would be required to be members
of the association and pay assessments. Since they would already have
title to the real estate, there is no financial impediment, as there
would be if they had to buy the land afresh.<br>
<br>
Conversion to civic associations would not only partially privatize
local governance, it would also result in a shift in public finances,
with lower taxes to the city, replaced by association assessments which
would be much closer to geo-rent. The association would get revenue
from payments either equal per member or based on front footage or
property value. The economic ideal would be payments based on geo-rent,
because the rent would most closely reflect the value of the community
services. But even if there is, say, an equal payment by the real
estate owners, if the properties have about the same market value, the
payments would have the effect of tapping geo-rent, with no excess
burden.<br>
<br>
My proposal (Foldvary, 1994) for a neighborhood conversion makes the
membership in private communities strictly voluntary and open to any
real estate owner. Any person or organization having title to land
would be able to partially secede, to withdraw property and services
from governmental jurisdiction, and create its own governance. The
government could require an exit fee or on-going rental payments to
compensate for its services that the private community would still
benefit from. If most of a neighborhood wishes to privatize but some do
not, those wishing to remain directly under the government would
continue to be under government jurisdiction, and there would then be
agreements for the joint provision of services such as streets that
service both members and non-members. While this may result in a more
complicated arrangement than that of Nelson, I believe it is important
to maintain the voluntary nature of civic associations as much as
possible.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION<br>
<br>
</span>The shunting aside and disparagement of public revenue from
geo-rent has distorted economic analysis and contributes to iatrogenic
economy-hampering fiscal policy. We need a broader and more integrated
public economics that recognizes the fundamental role of land in
economies and fully incorporates the analysis of public revenue from
geo-rent. We will then not only have a more complete and accurate
science of economics, but also economists will then offer better
remedies for economic problems.<br>
