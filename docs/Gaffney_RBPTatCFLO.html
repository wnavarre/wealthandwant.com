<div style="text-align: center;"><b><small>The
Relationship Between Property Taxation and <br>
the Concentration of Farm Land Ownership</small> </b><br>
by Dr. Mason Gaffney, <br>
Riverside, CA</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
editor's note: Dr. Gaffney's presentation, as well as Arthur
Yeatman's, was made at the Council of Georgist Organizations
conference, Sept. 22, 2000, in Des Moines, IA during a Panel on
"Sustainable Agriculture
and Taxation Policy: Public Finance Incentives for Community
Agriculture, Organic Production and a Vital Rural Economy." </div>
&nbsp;<br>
I have two ways of looking at this question of the effect of
property taxation on the size of farms: 
<ul>
  <li>interstate comparisons, and  </li>
  <li>intertemporal comparisons, or time series analysis.  </li>
</ul>
The latest data I used came in large part
from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">1987 "Agricultural Economics
and Land Ownership Survey"
(AELOS)</span>. It was the first study of land tenure since 1940 that
distinguished between land
values and building values. Between the years 1900 to 1940, the U.S.
Census reported regularly on the concentration of farms, and they
divided their subject into
land value, building value, and population. In 1945 they stopped
doing it. The reason they started in 1900 was because of the influence
of Henry George and
his followers, who were many, strong and enthusiastic at that time.
The reason they stopped is because the Henry George movement had
petered out and lost its
radical edge at that point. But in 1987 they did it again. Better
yet, they used ownership units as well as operating units (although
that part of the study
was technically flawed, and hard to use). We had a conference on it
and we chewed over the data. <br>
<br>
Here and now, in this brief talk, let's look just at the trend
over time. The national average of farm property tax rates peaked in
1930 at 1.32 percent. It fell to 0.77 percent in 1945, and stabilized
at about that level -- it was
0.85 percent in 1987. The revenues were replaced by sales and income
taxes, which on the whole bear heavier on urban activities. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Vanishing Farmers and Unaffordable Farms <br>
<br>
</span>
You might say this would be a blessing for the farmers who were
now more free of these property taxes. <br>
<br>
However, it didn't work out that way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
mean acres per farm (the
average, that is) had remained fairly constant for 65 years
(1870-1935) at about 155 acres</span>, despite two major industrial
merger movements, including the steel
industry. <span style="font-weight: bold;">After 1935 the mean value
took off and had tripled to 462
acres by 1987. As the number of farms were falling, national population
was on the rise.
In 1900 there was one farm per 11 Americans; in 1987 there was one
farm per 113 persons.&nbsp;
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Farms became unaffordable for folks starting at the bottom of the
agricultural ladder. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Real wage rates, meanwhile since 1955,
have not risen as fast as
real land prices, and they haven't risen at all since 1975. </span>This
has
raised the labor-price of land (the number of days/years a person must
work at the average wage
rate in order to raise the price of a farm.)&nbsp; Coupling this with
rising acres per farm, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
labor-price of a farm roughly tripled, from about 6 years' wages
(before payroll deductions) in 1954 to about 17 years' wages in 1987</span>.
That, of course, doesn't mean you could buy a farm in 17 years, unless
you didn't eat
anything and saved every penny of your wages to buy a farm.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
That is the mean size. At the same time, concentration of
ownership was rising. That was the subject Henry George and Francis
Walker debated way back in the 1880s. In the process Henry George
invented something, later
to be known as the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> "Lorenz Curve"</span>
- academicians are not generous
about crediting Henry George with his various contributions to the
discipline of
political economy. Basically this Lorenz Curve is a way of measuring
concentration by answering the question, what fraction of all the land
is owned by the top ten
percent. The curve extends from zero up to 100 percent. This curve
has been reduced to a single figure, called the Gini Ratio, which is a
measure of concentration
which varies between zero and one. At zero, everyone has the same
amount; at one, one person has it all.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In 1900 the Census Bureau began publishing farm data ranked by
acres per farm. Using those data, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
Gini Ratio was .58 in 1900.</span> By
1930 the GR had gotten up only to .63. This, remember, was the peak
year of property
taxes, before the property tax started waning. The GR began to rise
faster, and by 1950 it was up to .70. It plateaued there for 15 years
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">then rose again to .76
by 1987</span>. That is a high degree of concentration. (By comparison,
GRs
for personal income are much lower, about .40, and are much more stable
over decades.) The
accelerated rise since 1930 coincided with the rise of mean acres per
farm, and both followed the fall of property tax rates.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The Gini Ratio has been criticized because it deals only with the
concentration among existing farms, and doesn't take into account all
of the former farmers who left the business. To adjust for this, we can
simply add them
to the distribution of the farms as farmers with zero land. There are
4-1/2 million farms that died between 1935 and 1988. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you add in the farmers with zero
acres of land to the lowest bracket, that raises GR for 1988 from .76
to .92</span>, a radical rise of inequality since 1930 (.63). But
calculating the ratio this way
gives you a better sense of how concentration has shot up during and
since the Great Depression. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the
Great Depression (1930-1941), six million farms provided a
refuge for the urban jobless and homeless. Today, that refuge is
closed.</span><ul>
  <li>Mining has taken over the Appalachians, where farmers could make
moonshine.  </li>
  <li>Farming
has been taken over by forestry and recreation in the Ozarks.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Rise of Land Quality in Vast Farms
</span><br>
<br>
A frequent way to trivialize this information on concentration is
to say "farms in the Census are ranked by acreage and so the degree
of concentration is a statistical illusion." And "it looks like
concentration because
you are mixing million acre ranches in New Mexico with family farms
in Iowa or New England, which are worth much more per acre, and if you
adjust for that it
is not as concentrated." That is a common allegation.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
There are two things wrong with that allegation, that make it pure
humbug. <br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The first
is, when you rank farms by acres per farm, as the Census
does, the quality of land in the top bracket has been going up very
sharply over this period. </span><br>
<br>
One example has to do with <span style="font-weight: bold;">irrigation</span>.
About 60 to 80 years ago,
1890-1930, irrigation was the refuge of the small farmer -- it was
the new frontier, and specifically in California. A lot of publicity
has been given to
something called the Irrigation District movement, whereby farms and
cattle ranches were incorporated into taxing districts or irrigation
districts, which
taxed land and exempted improvements and used tax powers to issue
bonds and build expensive irrigation units. And under this system,
people in the district
paid for water whether they used it or not, and caused a revolution
in California agriculture from 1900 to about 1930. It was a fantastic
case study in economic
development (which has been mostly ignored by academic and government
economists). As a result, the average size of a farm in California went
way down.
And the concentration of land went way down, and irrigation was at
the forefront of this.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
When irrigation was young in Anglo-America (1890-1914), it was the
recourse of small farmers and ranchers. Then, vast spreads were
subdivided to create small irrigated farms. There was drastic
subdivision and
intensification (1900-1930). After the 1930s drop in property tax
rates, this land has been reconsolidated. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you don't tax land, conglomeration
occurs
inexorably. </span>The sections buy out the quarters. This has
happened in
irrigated agriculture faster than almost anywhere else. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. Irrigated land is worth a lot more than
dry land.&nbsp; </span><br>
<br>
Land in farms of 1,000 acres and over actually dropped
(nationally) by 15 percent from 1900 to 1910, the only drop on
record. Now, however, 34 percent of all irrigated land is in the top
bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. Control of irrigated land means control over water. Control of
water gives control over arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control
based on water have become
highly concentrated. <span style="font-weight: bold;">For farms with
irrigated land, the Gini Ratio is
.82, substantially higher than the GR of .76 for all farms.&nbsp; </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">From 1930-87, the fraction of all farm
acres in units of 1,000
acres and over rose from 28% of the total to 62% of the total. </span>That
is a rise of 123% over the 1930 base. That rise in degree of
concentration is impressive, all
by itself. At the same time, however, the mean value per acre in the
largest spreads was rising much faster than that of other farms. In
result, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the value of the
real estate (land and buildings) in these giant spreads rose from 8%
of the total in 1930 to 38% of the total in 1987.</span> That is a rise
of 375% over the 1930 base.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The second
thing that makes the trivialization humbug is a
statistical principle called "regression fallacy."</span> Many people,
otherwise bright, are thicker than mud when it comes to picking up on
this principle, so there must be
some mental block built into the culture. Once you see this "cat,"
however, it's pretty simple and straightforward. It says that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">the degree of
concentration you find
in any distribution depends on what you choose as the ranking
variable.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>If you want
to compare the concentration of value with the concentration of
acreage, you can't rank the farms by acreage and then take the top
bracket and ask what the value is. You have got to re-rank them by
value, and these are
entirely different rankings with an entirely different collection of
farms in the top bracket, and naturally these are more valuable farms. <br>
<br>
This reranking, farm by farm, is almost impossible to do from
published census data, which come in large groups. But I managed to
do it with some other series, and I can vouch for the fact that if you
do rewrite the data by
value, you get a higher - not a lower - degree of concentration in
terms of value than in terms of acreage.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
So, for those two reasons, concentration of land ownership is not
only high but it has risen at a very rapid rate.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
To sum up, 
<ul>
  <li>rising acreages mean there are fewer farms overall.  </li>
  <li>Rising labor prices per farm mean aspiring farmers who lack prior
wealth can no longer buy in.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Rising Gini Ratios mean acreage is less equally shared among a
given number of farms.  </li>
  <li>Higher quality land is moving into bigger
farms. "Gamma" is the top bracket acre value divided by the mean acre
value, and it is
rising. The Gamma data are confirmed by rising shares of cropland and
irrigated land in vast farms. Rising price to cash flow (P/C) ratios
reflect a higher land share
of real estate value (LSREV), and they mean it is harder for a
newcomer to acquire any farm acres. The combination means the
agricultural ladder has been
pulled up. Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside
finance; exit and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes
accompanied and followed a 40 percent
drop in farm property taxes.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
Conclusion: to redemocratize farming, promote small farms and
break up big ones, raise land tax rates. <br>
