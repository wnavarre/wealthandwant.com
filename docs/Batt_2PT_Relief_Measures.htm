<p>The property tax structure in New York, as in most other places, has many
  problems, but with a bit of attention and tweaking it could be the perfect
  tax. I've written extensively on this, about a hundred articles,<em><strong>1</strong></em> but I will
  deal with only two matters here. I want to address what has often been called
  the &#8220;poor widow&#8221; problem,<em><strong>2</strong></em> the person who fears being expelled
  from her home by lack of ability to afford her property taxes.</p>

<p>First one must understand that the property tax is really two taxes to an
  economist, a tax on land values and a tax on improvement values, each with
  its own dynamic. We should just get rid of the tax on improvements, now something
  easy to do in light of new computer assessment technology and what we know
  about the destructive impact of taxing them.<em><strong>3</strong></em> Experience shows that doing so
  is the most effective tool available to revitalize economies. But, along with
  many others, I have dealt with that elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">3 What is commonly known as Land Value Taxation, or the &#8220;Two-Rate&#8221; tax,
      is described extensively at <a href="http://www.urbantools.org">www.urbantools.org</a>. Several of my articles on the
      sites above discuss this approach at length.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tax on land value can be corrected with better assessments,<em><strong>4</strong></em> shifting
  the rates, and allowing for payment at a time when it is not burdensome. But
  one has to understand what land value is first of all. Then one can understand
  a land value tax and its virtues.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The value of any parcel site is a function of the flow of what classical economists
  know as ground rent.<em><strong>5</strong></em> Ground rent, or economic rent, is different than rent
  for payment for using a house or car. More importantly, it reflects the economic
  vitality of a neighborhood or a region and has nothing to do with what any
  one titleholder does or doesn't do on his property. If all the market transactions
  and productivity were to leave a place, there would be no rent to flow and
  the land values would fall to zero. One can no more alter or eliminate the
  flow of rent in any area than one can stop the force of gravity. The more productive
  enterprise a region has, the higher the flow of rent. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">5 Many of the concepts discussed in this presentation are rooted in the framework
      of classical (as opposed to neoclassical) economics and may not be familiar
      to the reader. There is an extensive list of such concepts and terms, linked
      to articles discussing them, at the Wealth and Want website: See <a href="http://www.wealthandwant.com/themes/aa_all_themes.htm%20">http://www.wealthandwant.com/themes/aa_all_themes.htm </a></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People in this country, even many economists, don't understanding that rent
  is a flow; they often think of land value as a stock, like a house, or a car,
  or an industrial plant. It is actually more like a river, or an emission from
  a radioactive mineral. Viewed in this way, land sites, just like other natural
  resources like water, air, the spectrum, and even occasionally time; all have
  a yield value, even when they are not used. That's because the value is reflective
  of the broader community's activity. </p>
<p>The total value of rent flow through a location is a constant. It can be broken
  up into pieces, however, and this offers us a solution: whatever is not paid
  in a land tax, which is really an expression of rent recapture by the community,
  is then capitalized in market price. The volume of rent can be captured all
  at once or over a period of time. The assessment of land is its capitalized
  rent flow, and this is clearly manifest when a parcel is bought and sold. It
  is also reflective of capitalized transportation costs.<em><strong>6</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">6 See my article &#8220;Stemming Sprawl: The Fiscal Approach,&#8221; Chapter
      10 from the book, <em>Suburban Sprawl: Culture, Theory, and Politics</em>,

</blockquote>
<p>Because the flow of rent is constant and continuous, the more that is captured
  in taxes, the less remains to be capitalized in a site's market price. If the
  tax on land value were totally abolished, all the rent would accrue to parcel
  sites and escalate their market price accordingly. Relieving households of
  the burden of their property taxes through caps, circuit-breakers, homestead
  options, or any other exemption simply results in the increased flow of rent
  to, and ultimately the market price of property. But the higher the cost of
  real estate, the less attractive a location becomes to outsiders: areas of
  California, to take one example, have become prohibitively expensive. When
  property prices escalate beyond what the flow of rent dictates, speculators
  move in to generate bubbles of expectancy, resulting in even higher prices
  than what the community's productive enterprise is able to generate. Ultimately
  there comes a corrective, even a crash &#8211; witness what Japan experienced
  and what we may be going through now, and that downward slide can be as economically
  painful as the initial euphoric rise in parcel prices earlier.</p>
<p>So, one way to maintain a viable and stable economy is to tax land according
  to its market value and even out site values. The higher the payment in taxes,
  the lower the market prices for land sites. From a strictly economic viewpoint,
  taxing all the economic rent would lead to a sale price of zero and a rental
  value commensurate with its continuing flow, and this creation of a perfect
  market for locations would foster very healthy economies. It could totally
  supplant taxes on wages and capital that result in so much lost productivity
  and economic drag (Economists call this deadweight loss.) The reality is that
  rent, left to stick in parcel sites, often &#8220;gums up the works&#8221; in
  a way that slows down markets and makes economies less efficient. Better to
  remove it, and taxing it away is the best way to do so. Significantly, one
  might note, those governments that employ land value taxation have weathered
  economic cycles most easily of all places. </p>
<p>Ultimately, all tax burdens are shifted to land in any case, as Professor
  Mason Gaffney so clearly explains: &#8220;After-tax interest rates are determined
  in world markets and the local supply of capital funds is highly elastic. So,
  local taxes on capital do not stick to capital. Even national taxes on capital
  typically fail to stick, because capital is a citizen of the world. Local labor
  supplies are also pretty elastic, although not so totally. Local taxes on labor,
  therefore, do not stick to labor, either. Payroll taxes drive people out of
  localities that impose them, for example. Ditto for sales taxes. Customers
  move, or shift their purchases, to where taxes are lower, or zero. Sellers
  shift, too, to the extent they bear the tax. What else is left? Just land,
  and land cannot emigrate or immigrate from the local jurisdiction.&#8221;<strong><em>7</em></strong>  Professor Fred Foldvary follows up by asking why not just put the tax on land
  from the start and improve economic efficiency.<em><strong>8</strong></em> Finally, because a tax based
  solely on rent would supplant taxes on wage labor, and on products of people's
  hands and minds, it would be on windfall gains only, and be essentially painless.<em><strong>9</strong></em></p>

<p>But that's not likely to happen, at least soon. What we can do, however, is
  1) foster economic vitality by phasing out taxes on improvements, 2) shift
  the burden to land values in a revenue neutral manner, and 3) allow households
  to pay their property taxes when they have the means to do so &#8212; when
  they cash out. They would do this when they sell their property, paying a portion
  of the gain to the community along with any interest due. Some 24 states and
  the District of Columbia do this, and it is the fairest solution of all. How
  can this all be implemented?<em><strong>10</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">10 Several studies of various state policies have been completed.  Among them
      are those by AARP, NCSL, and, most recently by the staff of the Property Reappraisal
      Committee of the State of Montana, 2004. See <a href="http://mt.gov/revenue/legislativeinformation/propertyreappraisal/finalreport/Addendum%20J.doc">http://mt.gov/revenue/legislativeinformation/propertyreappraisal/finalreport/Addendum%20J.doc</a> </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By state law, assessors must separate out the land value of each parcel from
  its total value. This is standard assessment practice. Economists have known
  since the time of Adam Smith that taxing just the land value is the ideal way
  to raise revenue. &#8220;Ground-rents,&#8221; he avowed, &#8220;and the ordinary
  rent of land are . . . the species of revenue which can best bear to have a
  peculiar tax imposed on them.&quot;<strong><em>11</em></strong> Some 700 places worldwide do this, with
  remarkable results.<em><strong>12</strong></em> In Johannesburg, there is no tax on buildings at all.
  So, effectively, does Hong Kong. Twenty cities in Pennsylvania do it,<em><strong>13 </strong></em>and
  the power of computers and available data now allow simulation of results so
  it's no longer a matter of just appreciating the economic theory. It's not
  my place to reveal anything, but I'm now working with two cities in New York
  State exploring this option. Gradually phasing out of the building tax rate
  and raising the land tax rate in a revenue neutral manner could be done in
  a decade. If the assessments are good, about 2/3 of homeowners pay less. Parcels
  underused relative to their assessed land value pay more. This gives them an
  incentive to improve their parcels or sell to someone who will. </p>

<p>The deferral option is fair to both the homeowner and the community. Relieved
  of any fear that the tax collector will evict a household, it can live assured
  it can reside in place so long as it wishes. This addresses the concern that
  many households may be very equity rich, even if they are income poor. It also
  assures that the locality will ultimately, even if not immediately, receive
  its fair share of property taxes due; no special favoritism is involved. The
  capital gain when a parcel is ultimately sold provides the income necessary
  to pay the tax office with appropriate interest. </p>
<p>One should appreciate that the deferral provision is not only fair and accommodating,
  it also comports with all the textbook principles of sound tax theory. As I've
  explained often elsewhere, deferral of payment is neutral, efficient, equitable,
  administrable, stable, simple, and certain.<em><strong>14</strong></em> This is important at a time when
  we have come to realize how much the property tax fosters sprawl development,<em><strong>15</strong></em>  leads to under use of strategically valuable site parcels urban cores, how
  much it fosters real estate speculation, and how much it dis-equilibrates the
  whole market in housing. </p>

<p>I won't go into detail on the various formulas and permutations of the deferral
  option that states employ; I have sent the staff some material on that. Sometimes
  only homeowners beyond a certain age can defer their property taxes. Sometimes
  there are income caps and thresholds for eligibility, sometimes it is restricted
  to homes below a certain assessed value, sometimes only a portion of the tax
  can be deferred or only a certain component-- school and not municipal, special
  assessments and not utilities. Sometimes the provision is statewide, sometimes
  it is a local option. It is interesting to see that some states impose an interest
  rate on deferred obligations so high that it prohibits its extensive use &#8212;  10%
  in Tennessee, 8% in Texas. I think the option should be broadly available,
  and interest rates reasonable. </p>
<p>Some observers compare it to a reverse mortgage, but experience shows that
  there are many more abuses involved there, and it is frequently far more burdensome
  financially.<em><strong>16</strong></em> There may also be concern that municipalities might incur a
  transitory deficit when many households first avail themselves of the option.
  Some states have allowed a bridge loan from state sources until revenue streams
  have once again stabilized. A bond backed by the same necessary liens against
  properties are another answer. </p>

<p>Yet the deferral option, where legal, is not extensively employed. This is
  because homeowners often don't want to forfeit any of the equity they might
  have built up in the course of many years of ownership. People often see any
  home appreciation as their rightful gain. The availability of the deferral
  option, however, exposes those who are shedding crocodile tears about their
  property tax burden while salivating over future windfall gains, as opposed
  to those who may have a genuine hardship. Here is why:</p>
<p>Houses, a Federal Reserve study<strong><em>17</em></strong> shows, depreciate
  at about 1 percent annually, so that net appreciation a home typically has
  is due to the appreciation
      of the land value and any inflation. Again, buildings depreciate; only
  land appreciates.
        I have already explained that the land value is a function of the flow
      of economic rent, and has nothing to do with what the titleholder has done;
      rather it is
        due to the social enterprise of the community. The community's recapture
      of land rent in the form of taxes is, morally speaking, a claim of what
  it, the
        public, is properly due. Even if the real estate industry and banks argue
      that homeownership is an assured way to &#8220;build equity,&#8221; the
      parcel title provides a passive  gain that is morally problematic. &#8220;Landlords,&#8221; John
        Stuart Mill observed, &#8220;grow richer in their sleep without working,
        risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as
        it does from
        the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community and
        not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;<em><strong>18</strong></em></p>

<p>Offering homeowners the opportunity to pay taxes on their property with appropriate
  interest and at a convenient time in their lives is a fair and equitable solution
  to both the community and to all households at risk. Taxing away the surplus
  economic rent that runs up the parcel values to prohibitively expensive and
  speculative levels assures that real estate markets are more stable, more competitive
  and attractive on a wider scale. </p>
