<center><b>Warren Buffett's Response To the Journal<br>
November 3, 2004</b><span style="font-style: italic;"> (post-election)</span><b>
</b>
</center>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal's</em> Aug. 15 article about me, based on an
interview that I gave one of your reporters about my association with
Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign, was seriously misleading in a way
that caused far-reaching reverberations. For reasons that I will
explain, I could not write to you about this matter until now.</p>
<p>The article, featured on the <i>Journal's</i> front page, carried
a headline and opened with paragraphs devoted entirely to California
taxes. That's fair enough: taxes were certain to be a major issue in
the campaign.</p>
<p>In talking with your reporter, Joe Hallinan, I began by asking him
to record the interview. He replied that his taping equipment was not
working. Therefore, in verifying with him that what I'm about to
recount is correct, you will have to rely on his notes. I do not
expect you to find discrepancies, given that he asked me several
times to repeat the key figures that I presented.</p>
<p>What I said in respect to property taxes was very specific. I gave
him an example of three houses, two in Laguna Beach and one in Omaha.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first Laguna Beach house is a property that I bought in the
early 1970s. It has a current <b>market value of about $4 million</b>
and, because of the limitations embodied in Proposition 13, carried <b>taxes
of only $2,264 in 2003</b> vs. $2,241 in 2002. </li>
  <li>The second house, located just in back of the first, is one that
I purchased in the mid-1990s. It has a <b>market value of about $2
million</b> and, <b><i>simply because I bought it later than the first</i></b>,
carried <b>taxes of $12,002 in 2003</b> vs. $11,877 in 2002. </li>
</ul>
<p>I pointed out to Joe that these figures mean that the tax rate on
the second house -- same neighborhood, same owner, same ability to
pay -- is roughly 10 times the rate on the first house.</p>
<p>I then referenced my house in Omaha, which I believe to be
<b>worth about $500,000</b> (though it's assessed at $690,000). Taxes
on it were <b>$14,401 in 2003</b> and $12,481 in 2002.<br>

<p>I was satisfied, based on our conversation, that Joe understood
the two highly important but uncomplicated points my examples spoke
to:</p>
<blockquote>1. Residential property taxes in California are wildly
capricious, tied as they are to the date of purchase rather than the
value of the property or financial circumstances of the owner.
  <p>2. In the case of properties that a homeowner has held for a long
time, residential property tax rates in Omaha are far higher than in
California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the interview, I then said, as the story reported: "This
property-tax illustration, that tells you, you can draw certain
conclusions from that." Give me an F for syntax. Even so, this
comment clearly applied to both observations regarding property
taxes.</p>
<p><b><i>Yet there was no mention in the story of my second house in
Laguna nor any mention of the tax inequities within
California.</i></b> Instead, the headline, the body of the story and
quote made it appear as if I was only talking about the difference in
taxes between Omaha and California.</p>
<p>It's difficult to understand this omission. Imagine that a
reporter were to ask a candidate about a fiscal problem and received
this reply: "Spending is up 10%, taxes are down 10% -- you can draw
certain conclusions from that." If the reporter quoted only the tax
change portion of the sentence, and followed it with "you can draw
certain conclusions from that," readers would be seriously
misled.</p>
<p>The severe failings in the article were compounded a few days
later when the Journal's editorial page made the mistake of relying
on the accuracy and completeness of the Journal's reporting. Though
the editorial would have undoubtedly made many of the same points it
did had the writer read a complete account of my views, its analysis
would have had to be at least somewhat different if the editorial
writer had been aware of both points I had made.</p>
<p>For example, the statement in the editorial's second paragraph
that "no doubt the non-billionaires in Chico will appreciate Mr.
Buffett's generosity with their cash flow" would make no sense if the
writer had understood that I was criticizing the inequities within
California. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">My sympathies
are clearly with the "non-billionaire"
family purchasing a $300,000 house in Chico today that faces real
estate taxes materially higher than those borne by this non-resident
billionaire on his $4 million house in Laguna. This family, because
of Proposition 13, has been selected to subsidize me.</span></p>
<p>The Journal's editorial page was not the only medium that drew
incorrect and incomplete inferences from the story. The Omaha-Laguna
comparison rocketed around the world accompanied by commentary that I
was suggesting raising property taxes in California, with no mention
at all that I was arguing they needed to be made more equitable.</p>
<p>When I subsequently explained to the Journal's Kevin Helliker just
how misleading the story had been, our office received an e-mail from
Joe Hallinan suggesting that I "might be interested in doing another
interview with us, expanding on some of his earlier points." It is
ironic that the reporter mentioned "expanding" my views when he -- or
his editor -- were the ones who had truncated my views in such a
misleading and unfair manner.</p>
<p>Another interview, of course, would have compounded the problem,
since -- short of the Journal forthrightly acknowledging its original
error -- it would have appeared that I was scrambling to revise my
statement to limit political damage to Arnold. This is the same
point, of course, that has deterred me from writing you, or otherwise
talking about the tax issue, until we reached a date when my doing
that would not influence the election.</p>
<p>Because the Journal's mischaracterization of my views has achieved
such widespread publicity, I am planning to post this letter for an
extended period on the Berkshire Hathaway Web site.</p>

Note</p>
The following note is from Wall Street Journal <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Managing Editor
Paul Steiger</span>:
<p>I respectfully disagree with Mr. Buffett. The article wasn't
misleading. His central point to our reporter was the huge disparity
in taxes on his home in Nebraska vs. those on his properties in
California. Mr. Buffett described this disparity in the context of
discussing with the reporter the troubled state of California's
finances, strongly hinting that raising property taxes in California
closer to levels in Nebraska might be one way of narrowing
California's huge budget gap.</p>
In the interview, Mr. Buffett did make the other point that his
letter emphasizes, that of the sharp disparity in tax rates between
the levies on one California property that he had bought many years
ago vs. those on a nearby property that he had bought more recently.
This additional point was interesting and might well have been
included in the story in detail. Instead, it was referred to only
briefly. In the tight confines of a newspaper article we always have
to choose which of an interviewee's many remarks to report. In this
case, because of Mr. Buffett's overriding theme of the potential
value to California's state and local governments of additional
sources of revenue, it was hardly misleading to exclude it. <br>

Adviser Buffett Hints Property Tax Is Too Low;Targeting State's
Proposition 13
Is Unlikely Republican Stance</span><br>
<br>
By JOSEPH T. HALLINAN, Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
<br>
<br>
Warren Buffett, the billionaire financial adviser to Arnold
Schwarzenegger's campaign for California governor, strongly suggested
in an interview that the state's property taxes need to be
higher.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., took on
California's famous Proposition 13, which has limited property taxes
there since 1978. As an example, he pointed out the difference
between his own property-tax bills for homes he owns in California
and Nebraska.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
His home in Omaha, he said, is valued at roughly $500,000. His
current yearly property tax bill on that home: $14,401.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In California, he owns a Laguna Beach home valued at $4 million,
or eight times as much. The annual property taxes on that home are
just $2,264 -- a fraction of what he pays in Omaha.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
More to the point, said Mr. Buffett, the taxes on his Omaha home
rose $1,920 this year, compared with $23 on the Laguna Beach home.
Mr. Buffett attributed the scant jump in California to the
restrictions of Proposition 13, which generally limits property-tax
increases to 2% a year, no matter how much the value of a property
appreciates.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Buffett stopped short of saying he would urge Mr.
Schwarzenegger to seek a reversal of Proposition 13 to increase
property taxes -- a move that would almost certainly be attacked by
many of Mr. Schwarzenegger's fellow Republicans. But he left little
doubt that that is where he is leaning.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"This property-tax illustration, that tells you, you can draw
certain conclusions from that," said Mr. Buffett. Noting that tax
assessments also vary widely, he said of the tax system, "In effect,
it makes no sense."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"But you've got to look at everything," he added. "I took the job
yesterday. And it's going to be his [Schwarzenegger's]
policies. Any advice I give is going to be to him."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The state has been roiled by financial troubles tied to the
economic downturn and the recent state energy crisis, factors fueling
the effort to recall Gov. Gray Davis. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. has
downgraded California bonds to a triple-B rating, the worst in the
nation and two notches above junk-bond status.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Proposition 13 limits on property
taxes aren't directly
responsible for California's current fiscal problems, which had the
state facing a deficit of $38 billion for the fiscal year that
started July 1. But in general, the limitations on property taxes
have forced state government to rely on other taxes, such as the
personal income tax, and to engage in complicated maneuvers to
reallocate the state's revenue and help entities that faced funding
gaps, especially schools. Even with those constraints, state spending
grew faster than inflation in the 1990s, but then leveled off and is
down this year.
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Schwarzenegger, like other candidates, has vowed to improve
the state's fiscal picture. But suggestions that tax increases could
be an answer could represent a problem for Republicans and the Bush
White House, who have pursued tax cuts as the best way to improve the
economy overall. Democrats are sure to leap at the contradiction, and
the Buffett comments may likely to deepen the biggest fear of many
national Republicans: that the moderate views of Mr. Schwarzenegger,
for all his appeal as a candidate, could spark infighting within the
party.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Sean Walsh, a spokesman for the campaign, said, "The proposals and
courses [Mr. Schwarzenegger] chooses will be his own." The
campaign announced late Thursday that Mr. Buffet and former Secretary
of State George P. Shultz will co-head an "Economic Recovery Council"
to advise the campaign, and he said that Mr. Buffet's voice would be
one among its members. "The breadth of economic and financial views
will be presented to Arnold," Mr. Walsh said.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In the interview, Mr. Buffett also said people approached
Berkshire Hathaway and other financial firms a few months ago on
behalf of the state of California, seeking to secure buyers for the
state's bonds if necessary. "California was looking in the financial
market for, in effect, a 'put,' or guarantee, by financial
institutions that they would be able to come to market with bonds
about nine months hence," said Mr. Buffett.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A spokesman for the California Treasurer said the department had
"no knowledge of any state representative approaching Mr. Buffett."
Steve Peace, California's director of finance, said investment
bankers might have initiated such a discussion, but not with any
official authorization by the state of California. He said the bond
issue most likely involved -- a $10.7 billion limited sales tax bond
-- has not yet been issued.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Buffett said that in the discussion with Berkshire Hathaway,
the state was willing to pay 0.75 percentage point, or about $80
million, to firms such as Berkshire if they would agree to buy
between $10 billion and $11 billion in bonds.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"That's a lot of money to pay for a put," said Mr. Buffett. "It's
a couple bucks for every citizen of California." Just a year earlier,
said Mr. Buffett, the fee for such a put was just 0.18 percentage
point. "I thought about doing it," he said, but decided against it.
Berkshire, he said, owns no California bonds.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Buffett's comments come a day after he startled many political
observers by jumping into politics in the nation's biggest state,
especially on the side of a Republican candidate. He is usually
associated with Democratic causes. "I don't worry about that," he
said. "I vote for far more Democrats than I vote for Republicans. But
I vote for plenty of Republicans."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Among Mr. Schwarzenegger's competitors for the governor's seat is
a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Buffett, former baseball commissioner
Peter V. Ueberroth, who sits on the board of the Coca-Cola Co. with
Mr. Buffett. Mr. Buffett said he hadn't known Mr. Ueberroth would be
a candidate. Referring to Mr. Ueberroth and former Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan, another candidate, he said, "Peter is very able.
Dick Riordan is very able. But Arnold, he's a very smart fellow. He
has brains and muscle. Some of us have neither."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Through Berkshire, in which he controls about a third of the
shares, Mr. Buffett has billions of dollars invested in the state of
California. Those holdings include about $2.67 billion in stock of
San Francisco based Wells Fargo &amp; Co., along with other
businesses, such as See's Candies and MidAmerican Energy Holdings
Co., the nation's third-largest owner of natural gas pipelines.
MidAmerican does substantial business in California. Its Kern River
Gas Transmission Co. operates a 926-mile pipeline from Wyoming to the
San Joaquin Valley near Bakersfield, Calif.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"The truth is California has got very serious financial problems,"
Mr. Buffett said. "It's an economy that's the size of France and
there's no way the U.S. is going to have a healthy economy if
California continues to have the problems it has . . . I've got a
selfish interest in this country doing well, no doubt about
that."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Buffett said his preliminary assessment of California showed
that the state's budget had depended on billions of dollars collected
in capital gains taxes, much of it generated by the bull market of
the late 1990s. "In effect," he said, "they set their financial
planning based on a financial bubble." Now that those gains are gone,
California's budget must be balanced by money from elsewhere.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"You're going to have to get it in balance -- and get it in real
balance. And it is not in balance now," said Mr. Buffett. "And they
have to do whatever is necessary on spending or taxes to get it in
balance.

   California </span><br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that one of his priorities as
  Governor would be to "bring business back to California." This shows
  he understands the root of the state's current problems, but his
  tapping of Warren Buffett for advice is a sign that he doesn't yet
  understand the solutions. <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  Mr. Buffett is a wonderful stock picker but his politics lean
  toward tax and spend. Last week he opined that California's problem
  may be that it is undertaxed. He specifically cited Proposition 13,
  which limits property tax increases to 2% a year. It seems the
  billionaire is vexed that he pays less in property taxes on a more
  expensive home in California than he does back in Omaha. No doubt the
  non-billionaires in Chico will appreciate Mr. Buffett's generosity
  with their cash flow.
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Buffett diagnosis misses entirely
  that California's main
  problem is its high-tax, high-regulation government. The $38 billion
  budget deficit is merely a symptom of the fact that the state's
  liberal political culture is driving entrepreneurs and job-creating
  businesses out of the state.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">A
  new Census report says that were it
  not for Latino immigration, California's population would be falling.
  Between 1995 and 2000, more than 600,000 of its residents moved out
  of what was once America's promised land.
  </span><br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  This takes some doing, considering the state's weather and
  lifestyle. But the liberal Democrats who now dominate Sacramento have
  piled mandate upon regulation upon new tax in recent years in an
  attempt to pay off their trial-lawyer, public-employee union and
  environmentalist backers. Governor Gray Davis tried to keep them in
  check for a year or so, but after the energy debacle he let the
  inmates start running things in return for their re-election support.
  His appeasement has now bought him the humiliation of a recall
  vote.
  <br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
  The Chamber of Commerce in Sacramento compiles a list of the new
  job-killing burdens on business and ultimately on worker/taxpayers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an eight-hour workday overtime rule unique to California that is
far
less flexible than federal law and opens employers to lawsuits;  </li>
  <li>paid
family leave of up to six weeks, the first such law in the country;
and  </li>
  <li>limits on greenhouse gas emissions, also the first in the
country, that will raise prices on cars. </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">High workers' compensation premiums
are also a huge disincentive
for start-ups and business expansion.</span> A recent study of 12 large
states found the average cost of a worker's claim in California to be
33% above the median. The report by the Workers' Compensation
Research Institute also noted that the "Average per-claim expenses
for medical cost containment services, defense attorneys, and
medical-legal expenses are higher [in California] than in
most study states."

<br>
And don't forget the state's steeply progressive tax code, a major
cause of its current fiscal woes. The state is overly dependent on
rich folk for tax revenues. In 2000, Californians paid $40 billion in
income taxes, and 54% of that came from taxpayers who earned $300,000
or more. Almost 38% was paid by millionaires, who file less than
one-third of 1% of tax returns. It's no surprise that when the stock
bubble burst so did California's tax coffers.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In the percentage of income taken by state and local taxes,
California was eighth highest in the nation this year at 10.6%
(fourth highest if you calculate the interaction of state levies with
federal taxes). The Tax Foundation ranked California second-worst in
the nation (after Mississippi) in a May study of state business tax
climates. Among other reasons, the report notes "multiple-rate
corporate and individual tax codes that impose above-average tax
rates" and "high overall state/local tax burdens that have grown
faster than taxpayers' incomes." Mr. Davis and the liberal
legislature used this to grow state government employment by 13.6%
from 1997 to 2001, or twice as fast as state population growth.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All of these are ripe targets for a gubernatorial candidate who
wants to run on revitalizing the state economy. Mr. Davis's inability
to do this is already on the record. The most important Democrat
bidding to replace him, Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, has been
one of those leading the tax-and-regulate charge. As Mr. Davis falls
in the polls, the same public-sector interests that brought him low
are now swinging to Mr. Bustamante. They realize that as Governor
he's likely to be Gray Davis without the backbone.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The two conservative Republicans in the race, businessman Bill
Simon and state senator Tom McClintock, are putting the economy front
and center. Mr. Simon is reprising his sound proposal from the last
campaign to cut the state's capital gains tax to 5% from 9.3%. That
would help both entrepreneurship and state revenue. Mr. McClintock
has long fought to lower the state tax burden.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If Arnold wants to grow his army and become Governor, he's going
to need proposals that give Republicans and independents in
particular a reason to believe that he knows how to revive the
economy of that once-great engine of American growth. Mr. Buffett's
tax-hike musings aren't the ticket.

Says
Higher Taxes Aren't the Answer for California&nbsp;
</span><br>
<br>
By JOHN R. EMSHWILLER and RHONDA L. RUNDLE, Staff Reporters of
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<br>
<br>
LOS ANGELES -- Hollywood star-turned-gubernatorial candidate
Arnold Schwarzenegger said he is against raising taxes and in favor
of reducing government spending to reinvigorate the California
economy, but he offered few specifics on what steps he will take if
he becomes the Golden State's governor.&nbsp;
<p>In his first appearance to discuss his economic views, Mr.
Schwarzenegger said California needs to become a more
business-friendly environment again. He said that as governor he
would immediately tackle ways to reduce the state's
workers-compensation insurance costs. However, he said he couldn't
give many specifics about his broader approach because reliable
information about the exact state of California's finances isn't
available.</p>
Mr. Schwarzenegger said not even economic experts he talked with
"could make heads or tails of the state's budget." He added: "You
can't make sound decisions based on faulty information." As a result,
he said, one of his first acts as governor would be to appoint an
outside auditing group to report back to him within 60 days on the
state's precise financial condition. He said some experts he
consulted estimate that the next governor could inherit a budget
shortfall of as much as $20 billion -- but didn't say how that
estimate had been reached.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Mr. Schwarzenegger, a 56-year-old Republican, is one of more than
130 people vying to succeed incumbent Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who
faces a recall election on Oct. 7. If a majority of voters choose to
oust Mr. Davis, a new governor will be chosen from the names listed
on the second part of the ballot. Whoever gets the most votes from
the crowded field will win the office.
<br>
<br>
While several California political veterans are in the race, Mr.
Schwarzenegger is by far the highest-profile figure, and his
celebrity status has helped attract a star-studded array of
supporters and advisers, some of whom were on display at Wednesday's
gathering.<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Flanked at the news conference by the co-chairmen of his "Economic
Recovery Council" -- Berkshire Hathaway Co. Chairman Warren Buffett
and George P. Shultz, a former secretary of both state and Treasury
-- Mr. Schwarzenegger reiterated his attacks on the state's fiscal
management. "The elephant in the room is the state's irresponsible
operating deficit and massive debt," he said. He said his top
priority as governor would be to create a more business-friendly
environment, and claimed too many jobs are moving out of state
because of high taxes and excessive regulation in California. "We
want those jobs back!" he said. He also supported a constitutional
cap on state spending.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Schwarzenegger said "skyrocketing" workers-compensation costs
are driving businesses away, and promised "on the day I am sworn in"
to call a special session of the legislature to correct the system.
However, he didn't identify any specific plans to deal with one of
the state's most persistent problems, which has been the subject of
several past reform efforts.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
While Mr. Schwarzenegger said he hopes to avoid additional taxes,
he didn't entirely rule them out. He said Californians haven't been
"undertaxed," but that "politicians have overspent." He acknowledged
that circumstances might arise, such as a major natural disaster or
terrorist attack, where tax increases might be necessary to fund
recovery efforts. "You can never say never," he said.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Schwarzenegger was asked about recent remarks by Mr. Buffett,
who said that California's property taxes, which were lowered a
quarter-century ago by Proposition 13, might need to be raised.
Politicians of all stripes have long been reluctant to criticize the
popular measure, for fear of voter backlash. Mr. Schwarzenegger
Wednesday reiterated his support for the measure despite the remarks
of his senior adviser. "I told Warren that if he mentions Prop. 13
one more time, he'll have to do 500 sit-ups," he quipped.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mr. Schwarzenegger avoided discussing specific policy issues when
asked about them by reporters. One question concerned his stand on a
recent state law that gives workers the right to take paid leave for
family reasons. "I'm all for people to leave and take care of family
members," he said, but added that it was "important not to keep going
down that road." Mr. Schwarzenegger said that while he would "want to
give away anything and everything," the question is: "Can we afford
it?"
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Separately, another major candidate, former Olympics organizer and
Major League Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, unveiled his own
economic plan for the state, which touched on many of the same issues
as Mr. Schwarzenegger's presentation. However, he offered more
specifics than his rival, calling for a 5% spending reduction from
all state programs except education, renegotiating union contracts
with state employees and selling off some state property assets.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Meanwhile, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson rejected an
effort by the American Civil Liberties Union to delay the recall vote
until March. The judge said he didn't want to rule against the will
of the people. The civil-rights group, which said it will appeal the
decision, wants the election delayed because of concerns that some
counties won't be able to properly conduct balloting in such a short
period of time.

sequel</span><br>
<br>
TIM RUTTEN |&nbsp; November 5, 2003
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Footnotes are among those things over which humanity fundamentally
divides. On the one side are those who regard them as little more
than typographical underbrush, impedimenta to a good story's
progress. In the other camp are those who find footnotes not just
foundational, but fascinating &#8212; the kind of close reader who
suspects there is no truth larger than the sum of its details.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is a story for the latter group, an engrossing controversy
touching on both the history of California's recent gubernatorial
recall and the journalism it produced:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The protagonists are uber-investor Warren E. Buffett, chairman of
Berkshire Hathaway, and the Wall Street Journal. On Aug. 14,
then-candidate &#8212; now governor-elect &#8212; Arnold Schwarzenegger
announced that the "Sage of Omaha" had joined his campaign as a
financial advisor. The next day, the legendarily plain-spoken
billionaire sent political analysts' jaws plunging when he attacked
California's most sacred cow, Proposition 13, in an interview with
the Journal's Joseph T. Hallinan.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Buffett, the Journal reported, had "strongly suggested &#8230; that
the state's property taxes need to be higher&#8230;. As an example, he
pointed out the difference between his own property tax bills for
homes he owns in California and Nebraska.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"His home in Omaha, he said, is valued at roughly $500,000. His
current yearly property tax bill on that home: $14,401.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"In California, he owns a Laguna Beach home valued at $4 million,
or eight times as much. The annual property taxes on that home are
just $2,264 &#8212; a fraction of what he pays in Omaha&#8230;.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
" 'This property-tax illustration, that tells you, you can draw
certain conclusions from that,' said Buffett. Noting that tax
assessments also vary widely, he said of the tax system, 'In effect,
it makes no sense.' "
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The interview's contents were widely reported and Buffett was
widely assailed, including on the Journal's editorial page, which
dryly observed that "no doubt the non-billionaires in Chico will
appreciate Mr. Buffett's generosity with their cash flow."
Schwarzenegger made a televised show of taking his advisor gently to
the woodshed, and it seems likely that the incident played at least
some role in the resolute no-new-taxes rhetoric he adopted for the
balance of the campaign.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There matters stood until Monday, when the Journal took the
extraordinary step of printing unedited a long letter to the editor
in which Buffett attacked Hallinan's story as "seriously misleading
in a way that caused far-reaching reverberations." Buffett wrote that
he had refrained from expressing his objections "until we reached a
date when my doing that would not influence the election."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The core of Buffett's criticism is that his examples involved not
two, but three houses, two in Laguna Beach and one in Omaha: "The
first Laguna Beach house is a property that I bought in the early
1970s. It has a current market value of about $4 million and, because
of the limitations embodied in Proposition 13, carried taxes of only
$2,264 in 2003 vs. $2,241 in 2002. The second house, located just in
back of the first, is one that I purchased in the mid-1990s. It has a
market value of about $2 million and, simply because I bought it
later than the first, carried taxes of $12,002 in 2003 vs. $11,877 in
2002. I pointed out to Joe that these figures mean that the tax rate
on the second house &#8212; same neighborhood, same owner, same
ability to pay &#8212; is roughly 10 times the rate on the first
house.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"I then referenced my house in Omaha."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
These examples, Buffett wrote to the Journal, were intended to
convey "two highly important but uncomplicated points":
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"1. Residential property taxes in
California are wildly
capricious&#8230;.&nbsp;
<br>
"2. In the case of properties that a homeowner has held for a long
time, residential property rates in Omaha are far higher than in
California."</div>
&nbsp;
<br>
By omitting any reference to his second, more recently purchased,
Laguna house, Buffett argued, the Journal had seriously distorted his
views. Borrowing the hypothetical case proposed by the paper's
follow-up editorial, Buffett wrote, "My sympathies clearly are with
the 'non-billionaire' family purchasing a $300,000 house in Chico
today that faces real estate taxes materially higher than those borne
by this non-resident billionaire on his $4 million house in Laguna.
This family, because of Proposition 13, has been selected to
subsidize me."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The length and detail of Buffett's letter were unusual enough, but
his remarks were followed in the Journal's letters column by a
lengthy signed response from Paul Steiger, the paper's managing
editor, who wrote: "The article wasn't misleading. His central point
to our reporter was the huge disparity in taxes on his home in
Nebraska vs. those on his properties in California&#8230;.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
"In the interview, Mr. Buffett did make the other point that his
letter emphasizes, that of the sharp disparity in the tax rates
between the levies on one California property that he had bought many
years ago vs. those on a nearby property that he had bought more
recently." Steiger went on to call the point "interesting" and wrote
that it "might well have been included in the story in detail.
Instead, it was referred to only briefly. In the tight confines of a
newspaper article we always have to choose which of an interviewee's
many remarks to report."
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
These days, much of the discussion surrounding America's news
media involves stuffing and then knocking around the straw man of
political bias. Yet bias is far less often a significant factor in
mainstream journalism than the talk-show brawlers would have us
believe. Judgment, on the other hand, is indispensable.
Serious-minded people will differ over its application &#8212; even by
conscientious editors and reporters, like those at the Journal.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Buffett could not be reached for comment. In an interview, Steiger
declined to go beyond his published response, but did say,
"Journalism is, as the famous saying goes, the first draft of
history. As such, it is subject to enhancement, clarification and
revision. We just don't feel one is required here."<br>

  <p>      <strong>Buffett's Prop. 13 comments cause stir</strong></p>
  <p>      by Mark Simon, Chronicle Political Writer | 
  Saturday, August 16, 2003</p>
  <p>The smoothly running political machine of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger hit
    its first speed bump Friday when a top adviser to his campaign for governor
    suggested overturning California's landmark property-tax initiative, Proposition
    13.</p>
  <p> Warren Buffett, named earlier this week as an adviser to Schwarzenegger's
    campaign in a move widely touted as giving the movie star credibility on
    economic issues, may have nullified his own value when he told the Wall Street
    Journal that property taxes in California are too low and suggested that
    Prop. 13 ought to be undone.</p>
  <p> Officials with Schwarzenegger's campaign scurried to distance the candidate
    from Buffett's attack on Prop. 13 while opponents wasted no time assailing
    the front-running Republican for the words of his adviser.</p>
  <p> &quot;We're flabbergasted someone is so out of touch with California that
    he would suggest a tripling of the property tax,&quot; said John Feliz, spokesman
    for state Sen. Tom McClintock. &quot;We think maybe he needs to fire Warren.&quot;</p>
  <p> Citing the inequity of the property taxes he pays on his homes in Omaha,
    Neb., and Laguna Beach, Buffett said the California cap on property taxes
    imposed by Prop. 13 &quot;makes no sense.&quot;</p>
  <p> Prop. 13 passed 25 years ago with 65 percent of the vote, and an entire
    generation of Californians believe that voting for the measure is the best
    single vote they've ever cast. The proposition rolled back property taxes
    and limited their annual increase to 2 percent.</p>
  <p> &quot;Warren's right,&quot; said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute
    of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. &quot;It's an unequal system. But
    all the polling indicators I've seen show the appetite for changing the system
    is very low.&quot;</p>
  <p> For Republicans, Prop. 13 is sacred text -- the benchmark by which most
    candidates are evaluated by key donors, top party leaders and many of the
    party's most loyal voters.</p>
  <p> &quot;I'm sure Arnold was mortified when he read (Buffett's comments),&quot; said
    Frank Schubert, a longtime Republican political consultant who has run 16
    statewide campaigns.</p>
  <p> As recently as 2000, a ballot initiative attempting to make it easier to
    raise property taxes failed overwhelmingly, said Kris Vosburgh, executive
    director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, predicting that anyone
    who attempts to roll back Prop. 13 today would face similar voter wrath.</p>
  <p> <strong>'POLITICAL SUICIDE'</strong></p>
  <p> &quot;It's political suicide for a California Republican to propose overturning
    Prop. 13,&quot; said Darry Sragow, a longtime Democratic political consultant. &quot;A
    Republican is going to get his head caved in for this.&quot;</p>
  <p> Schwarzenegger didn't propose overturning Prop. 13 himself -- in fact,
    his political strategists reacted as though a hand grenade had been thrown
    into their midst.</p>
  <p> &quot;Arnold Schwarzenegger has supported Prop. 13 for 25 years,&quot; said
    campaign spokesman Rob Stutzman, adding that the actor was the keynote speaker
    earlier this summer at an event honoring the silver anniversary of the passage
    of the property tax initiative credited with launching a national anti-tax
    revolution.</p>
  <p> &quot;Arnold is an admirer of Howard Jarvis (the late co-author of Prop.
    13) and has referred to him as the original tax terminator,&quot; Stutzman
    said. &quot;He will be a fierce protector of Proposition 13.&quot;</p>
  <p> Schwarzenegger spent the day campaigning at Southern California schools
    and did not comment on Buffett's statements.</p>
  <p> But Schwarzenegger spokesmen spent the day asserting that Buffett is only
    an adviser to the candidate and that he'll make his own policy decisions.</p>
  <p> &quot;Warren Buffett is speaking about his own philosophical position,&quot; Stutzman
    said. &quot;The two of them are not going to agree on every single issue.&quot;</p>
  <p> The flap over Buffett's comments only enhance the suspicions among conservative
    Republicans that Schwarzenegger is not a true California-style Republican
    committed to the no-tax, cut-spending philosophy that has been the mainstay
    of the state's GOP.</p>
  <p> The suspicions already were roused by the prominent presence in Schwarzenegger's
    campaign of former advisers to Gov. Pete Wilson, who, as a candidate for
    governor on the same 1978 ballot on which Prop. 13 appeared, opposed the
    property tax rollback.</p>
  <p> Early in the day, businessman Bill Simon called upon Schwarzenegger to
    disavow Buffett's statements.</p>
  <p> &quot;It's time for Arnold to come out from behind the curtain,&quot; Simon
    said at the opening of his Sacramento campaign headquarters. &quot;I'd like
    to see where Arnold stands on these issues.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong> OFFICIALS BACKPEDAL</strong></p>
  <p> Later in the day, when Schwarzenegger officials began backpedaling from
    Buffett's comments, Simon spokesman K.B. Forbes said, &quot;We're happy that
    the Schwarzenegger campaign listened to Bill Simon's advice of distancing
    himself. However, we want Arnold Schwarzenegger to make a pledge, as Bill
    Simon has, that he will not raise taxes. Is he going to be a tax-and-spend
    governor, or is he going to have the courage to take the pledge?&quot;</p>
  <p> Even Davis, making a campaign appearance at a heavily Hispanic school in
    Los Angeles, weighed in on Buffett's comments, telling reporters, &quot;I
    could not disagree more. I'm very proud that property taxes in California
    are lower than the rest of the country. Prop 13 is principally responsible
    for that.&quot;</p>
