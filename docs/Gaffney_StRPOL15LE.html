The revenue potential of land is greater than anyone thinks. This is a
progress report on a study that finds, bares, and to some extent
measures elements of enhanced revenue potential by using truer and more
comprehensive measures of rent and land values. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It should go without saying, but often does
not, that the purpose of raising more land revenues is not to fatten
vexatious bureaucrats. It is </span><ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li>to replace vexatious taxes,  </li>
  <li>to provide and maintain and operate needed public infrastructure
and services (including a reasonable national defense),  </li>
  <li>to pay off old public debts and avoid new ones, and  </li>
  <li>to fund social dividends (including existing social dividends
like Social Security and public schools).</li>
</ul>
There are at least fifteen elements of land&#8217;s taxable capacity that
previous researchers have either slighted, or overlooked entirely.<br>

ahead to
point &#8220;b&#8221;</a>. Scanning the bullets below, however, gives a clue as to
how
landowner pressure has subverted the property tax over the years.
<ul>
  <li>Conventional use of fractional assessments in many states</li>
  <li>Lag of assessments behind the rise of land values, and behind the
fall of building values with depreciation and obsolescence.
Increasingly, this extra-legal process has been institutionalized, as
in Prop. 13, California</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use of capitalized income method
for assessing business
properties</span> (other than apartments). The bias is against
intensive uses
in zones of transition (ecotones), at every margin between lower and
higher uses.</li>
  <li>Conventional preference given to acreage, regardless of location,
regardless of industrial use. (Allis-Chalmers example in center of West
Allis, Wisconsin. Omission of acreage from otherwise good studies by
the U.S. Census of Governments under Allen Manvel.)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Classification of land for
taxation, with preferential low
assessment for lower uses</span> (rarely are assessments above the
market for
any use, except apartments and rentals for the poor). In <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">California</span>,
some favored use-classes are farming, timber, and golf. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Alabama </span>has
another set of low-tax classes, favoring land in forests and hunting
grounds, catering to the Heston vote in league with <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">absentee corporate
owners</span> (and, for no visible theological reason, organized
fundamentalists). Lands in classified uses are assessed by capitalizing
their visible money income from the official use only, thus exempting
from the tax base all values from rustic manorial, recreational, and
blood-sport uses, and all speculative values based on higher future
uses. In vast rural and sylvan areas these other influences are the
main source of market value.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assessments capped by zoning,</span>
even when the market does not
believe the zoning will endure, or be enforced</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Regressive assessments</span>,
swayed by case law which reflects
differential ability to finance lawsuits and appeals.</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Discounts for large lots or other
holdings that should be
subdivided</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Failure to publicize assessed
values.</span> In some states the values
are not even open to public inspection - Lee Reynis, Director of the
Bureau of Business &amp; Economic Research, University of New Mexico,
has told this audience of secrecy enforced by law in New Mexico</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Reluctance to recognize premium for
plottage potential</li>
  <li>Exempt lands, owners, and land uses. Churches, often targeted by
critics, are minor offenders. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cemeteries
    </span>are major: they also include
commercial ventures holding vast lands for future sale. Commercial or
not, they consume more than their share of water, often at preferential
rates. In industrial dependent Milwaukee, cemeteries preempt more space
than all industry, which helps account for the city's 20% population
decline since 1960. Public lands held by <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">schools and the military</span> tie
up much of San Diego. New York City and Washington, D.C., are notorious
for their &#8220;free lists&#8221; of exempt lands. Once an agency acquires land it
never again appears in the budget, so bureaucrats squander it.</li>
  <li>Homestead exemptions, in some states - widely abused.</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Preferential underassessment of lands
with low turnover. Extreme
underassessment of lands that do not sell:  </li>
  <ul style="font-weight: bold;">
    <li>corporate holdings;    </li>
    <li>proprietary golf clubs;    </li>
    <li>dynastic holdings;</li>
    <li>inherited lands.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rail and utility adjunct
landholdings,</span> i.e. other than their ROW.
(These are state-assessed, not on local tax rolls; are assessed as
acreage, usually, which means underassessment; anyway, taxes are passed
on to ratepayers in the rate-regulation process. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Vast holdings by
rails</span>, e.g. 10% of Chicago; 5% of Milwaukee; vast SP holding
south of
Market Street in San Francisco, and statewide. Hydrocarbon holdings by
regulated utilities.)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rights of way.</span> Assessors
ignore monopoly power inherent in ROW,
assess ROW land on its value in the best alternative use</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discounts to large owners who
have policy of slow sales or
leasing. </span>(Such discounts are given to Oregon timber; to
Appalachian
coal; and many extractive resources. They are given to laggards in
ecotones.)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conventional reluctance to base
assessments on speculative
values</span>, even when condemnation awards are so based</li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;">Failure to assess land first, using
maps (with building value as
the &#8220;residual&#8221;) </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="b._Use_of_IRS_data_on_reported_rents"></a>b. Use of IRS data on
reported rents</span><br>
&nbsp; Many
economists rely on data generated by the IRS, taken from tax returns,
to tell them the sources of income in the U.S. This is an exercise in
crediting bad data. The standard tax procedure of landlords is to
deduct alleged &#8220;depreciation&#8221; from their net operating rents (&#8220;cash
flow&#8221;) to arrive at taxable rents. They accelerate depreciation enough,
usually, to report little or no taxable rent. This is what the IRS then
aggregates and reports as the sum of all rents. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To accept such fiction
as fact is inexcusable, but economists do it anyway. </span>Their
credulity
lends their authority to the IRS, while the IRS &#8220;official&#8221; status helps
legitimize the economists -- mutual validation of mutual error, the
curse of science.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; When
owner A has exhausted his tax &#8220;basis&#8221; by overdepreciating, he sells to
B for a price well above the remaining basis. B then depreciates the
same building all over again, then sells to C, who sells to D, and so
on, so each building is tax-depreciated several times during its
economic life. In any given year, most income properties in the U.S.A.
are being tax-depreciated, even though most have already been
depreciated once or more.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; In
addition, all owners after the original builder are in a position to
depreciate some of the land value, as well. This is because the owners
control the &#8220;allocation of basis&#8221; between depreciable building and
non-depreciable land. The IRS has no defense against secondary owners
who overallocate value to the depreciable building. Congress has never
authorized the IRS to develop any in-house capacity to value land. The
most the agency does, if it will not accept the word of the tax filer,
is to look at allocations used by local assessors. These parties, in
turn (with a few notable exceptions), underassess land relative to
buildings, by using the erroneous &#8220;land-residual&#8221; method of dividing
land from building value. This is partly to accommodate their local
constituents - assessors are locally elected or appointed, and do not
report to the IRS. A little math will tell you that to depreciate land
just once is to achieve perpetual tax exemption. To depreciate it again
and again is a continuing subsidy for holding land.<br>
<br>
When
A sells to B there is a large excess of the sales price over the
remaining or &#8220;undepreciated&#8221; basis. This excess is, to be sure, taxable
income. However, Congress has defined this kind of income as a &#8220;capital
gain.&#8221; Most rents, therefore, show up as capital gains. These, in turn,
are subject to lower tax rates, deferral of tax, forgiveness at time of
death, constant pressure to lower rates to zero, and a dozen additional
avoidance devices. These are known to every lawyer and accountant and
Congressman, but not, apparently, to most economists, who lazily report
from &#8220;official&#8221; data that rents are a low fraction of national income.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;In
addition, the IRS reports nothing at all for the imputed income of
owner-occupied lands, because this kind of non-cash income is not
taxable.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Todd Sinai and Joseph Gyourko
of the Wharton School report
aggregate owner-occupied &#8220;house&#8221; values in the U.S. in 1999 were $11.1
trillions. The annual rental value of that, figuring at 5%, would be
roughly half a trillion dollars a year</span> -- quite a chunk to omit
from the
rental portion of national income. We also know that the prices of
lands for both housing and recreation have risen sharply since 1999,
perhaps by 50% or so, so that $11.1 trillion may be $16.7 trillion now.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">That means that the imputed rent
income is 50% higher than half a
trillion (i.e. &frac34; trillion dollars), and also that the net worth
of the owners has risen by about $5.6 trillion. Such silent gains are
also a form of income from land. </span>To all that, many economists
remain
blind, dumb, and curiously incurious.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
Sinai and Gyourko&#8217;s treatment is superior to what one usually sees,
with some effort made to treat land separately. However, even they,
like others, write of the imputed income of owner-occupied &#8220;housing,&#8221;
exclusively. That is doubly misleading. 
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, it emphasizes the house,
the building, de-emphasizing the land.</span> That is wrong because the
income
proper imputable to the house, per se, is much less than its rent
equivalent. The house requires constant expenses for upkeep, heating,
maintenance and repairs, cleaning, painting, etc. etc. The house also
depreciates, physically. Those expenses and the depreciation must be
deducted from the rental equivalent to get the net income.  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The
land, that is the space and location, does not depreciate physically,
and so requires none of those expenses. Its rental equivalent is its
net current income. Instead, it usually appreciates in value, and that
annual increment is also a current income. So the &#8220;imputed income of
owner-occupied housing&#8221; is mostly attributable to the land - but no one
is saying so.</div>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, it is misleading by
omitting vast lands beyond the &#8220;house&#8221;
value, narrowly defined. </span>We may presume that &#8220;house&#8221; includes
the land
under it, and a little yard or curtilage, but what about other lands
held for the owners&#8217; personal enjoyment? No agency collects data on
such lands and their values, but common observation tells us they are
vast and valuable, and dominate values in many &#8220;rural&#8221; counties.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  c. Use of &#8220;NIPA&#8221; accounts from the U.S. Department of Commerce</span><br>
&nbsp; The
    standard source of data on GNP and its components is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">National
    Income and Product Account (NIPA)</span>, kept and published regularly
    by the
    U.S. Department of Commerce. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When
    it comes to rent, however, NIPA
    depends on the IRS figures, which thus are passed along to all students
    of economics as the &#8220;official&#8221; accounting.</span> We have just
    seen how far
    from reality these data are.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; NIPA
    is worse, in a way, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NIPA
    explicitly excludes &#8220;capital gains&#8221; from National Income.</span> That
    is, first the IRS converts rents into capital gains, and then NIPA banishes
    capital gains from GNP, National
    Income, and National Product. &#8220;Capital gains&#8221; is an artificial term,
    that includes all gains realized from the sale of what Congress defines
    at any time as &#8220;capital assets.&#8221; &#8220;Capital assets&#8221; include land and
    improvements, housing, common stock, growing timber, breeding herds
    (including race and show and riding horses), mineral and hydrocarbon
    reserves in the ground, and several other favorite holdings of the rich
    and well-connected. As we saw in &#8220;b&#8221;, most commercial rents show
    up as
    capital gains, so that NIPA does not report them at all. Then along
    come highly visible economists like Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow,
    Theodore Schultz, Edwin Mills, Jan Pen, and others to look up this
    datum, and declare that land rents are no more than 5% of national
    income, and cannot possibly support modern governments. This is
    unfortunate, and quite misleading.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; NIPA
    is better by virtue of its making a gesture at including the imputed
    value of owner-occupied housing. Whether they do it right is a question
    on my agenda.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> d. Use of Federal Reserve Board (FRB)
    estimates</span><br>
&nbsp; Another source of data is the FRB. Unfortunately it is ensnared in the
    same intellectual webs as the other agencies, so its nominal
    independence is wasted. <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Hudson.html">Michael Hudson</a> has dissected
    FRB methods, which resulted in reporting rents of income property far below
    reality. The <span style="font-style: italic;">reductio ad absurdum</span> arrived
    when its clerks, evidently plodding &#8220;on
    automatic,&#8221; duly reported that the rents of all the income property
    in the U.S.A. are negative. Someone in authority finally noticed, was
    embarrassed, and discontinued the series.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.
  Relying on the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)</span><br>
&nbsp; Many
    economists treat numbers from the NBER as iconic. The press routinely
    cites their datings of U.S. recessions and recoveries as &#8220;official.&#8221; Many
    writers cite <span style="font-weight: bold;">Raymond Goldsmith</span>'s
    estimates of United States land
    values, dating from 1955 and 1962, as &#8220;authoritative,&#8221; because
    they carry the NBER imprimatur. Yet they do not bear examination, even for
    their times. They were generated as incidents to other work in an
    offhand and indefensible way.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; It
    is not easy to retrace Goldsmith's steps; one must track interlocking
    footnotes from several sources. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">At the end of the trail, however,
    he
    simply takes residential land value as 15 percent of building value
    (which comes to 13 percent of land and building value).</span> The
    basis of
    this allocation is the share of land in the cost of one to four family
    houses insured by the Federal Housing Authority, which was about 20
    percent. He does not even explain why he cut this down to 13 percent.
    Goldsmith then applies this basis to nonresidential real estate as
    well. As for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">corporate held
    lands</span>, he enters them at book value -- an
    attitude that opened the door to an epidemic of corporate raiding.
    Goldsmith also seems to omit vacant lots and unsubdivided land.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; These methods are not worthy of the faith with which several economists
    cite the results. <span style="font-weight: bold;">FHA insured houses
    are not typical. They tend to be
    new and on cheap land. </span>Those not new are not very old -- in
    1967 the
    median age of insured existing homes was thirteen years. To apply such
    data to a typical American city, most of whose dwelling units in 1965
    antedated 1920, was outlandish. It is more outlandish today in 2004.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">FHA
    clientele is lower middle class, which means the land share is low,
    land being both a consumer luxury and a rich man's hedge, the land
    share rising sharply with value.</span> The high land share in Beverly
    Hills,
    Greenwich, Belvedere, Santa Fe Springs, Palm Beach, Kenilworth, and
    other enclaves of wealth is missing from FHA data.<br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
&nbsp; The FHA is most active at
    the expanding fringe of cities. A basic fact of urban land economics is
    that the land share rises toward the center. In Manhattan, for example,
    the share of assessed land value has always been higher than in the
  other boroughs.</span><br>
  <br>
&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Applying a land fraction
    derived from
    residential data to commerce and industry is not believable. The land
    share is highest in retailing, the more so now that retailing entails
    vast parking areas.</span> Filling stations and and drive-ins of all
    kinds entail vast aprons for small buildings with short lives. Some
    retailers store their inventories outdoors: auto dealerships, lumber
    yards, junk yards are examples. Many wholesalers and industries do the
    same: tank farms, railroad yards, utility easements, industrial
    reserves, dumps, drive ins, salt beds, terminals, heaps of coal and
    salt and sulfur, and so on and on. In downtown Milwaukee, half the
    assessed value is land. In Manhattan, it is instructive to consider the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Empire State Building</span>.
    If ever a structure overdeveloped a site, the world's tallest building on a
    fringe site should be it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet in two
    transactions since 1950 the site was valued at one third the total. One
    may infer what this implies of the whole island.</span><br>
  <br>
&nbsp;
  Anyone active in real estate would have caught Goldsmith&#8217;s error. Yet
    it passed muster with the NBER, his publisher the Princeton University
    Press, and several learned academic reviewers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This is not a measure of
    their general incompetence, but of the extent to which academicians
    have walled themselves off from anything bearing on the realities of
    land values and rents. Goldsmith treated land carelessly, as a trivial
    side-issue, and his finding was ignored by everyone except those who
    needed to invoke an authority to trivialize land value.<br>
    <br>
    </span>&nbsp; Several published case studies document the higher ratio of
    land value
    to building value in non-residential uses, and central cities. Here I
    will merely list them.

Goldsmith's transfer of the land share in a few new FHA residences to
all urban real estate is a momentous error that dominates his estimates
and destroys any value they might have.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another Goldsmith error is to
exclude subsoil assets.</span> In cities
overlying oil pools, like Huntington Beach, that would make a big
difference. In most cities that may not matter, but is symptomatic of
how insouciantly Goldsmith handled this whole matter of land values.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
f. Ernest Kurnow&#8217;s work under Lincoln and Moley</span><br>
&nbsp;
Ernest Kurnow low-balled land and rent values in a chapter in Joseph
Keiper, Ernest Kurnow, Clifford Clark, and Harvey Segal, 1961, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Theory
and Measurement of Rent</span> (Philadelphia: Chilton Co.). In an
introduction, the authors thank the Lincoln Foundation for financing
their work, but then go on to thank David Lincoln and Raymond Moley
personally for intellectual guidance. Then, extraordinarily, they omit
the standard disclaimer absolving their advisors and taking full
responsibility for the work that bears their names. This is a unique
omission. <span style="font-style: italic;">Res ipsa loquitur</span>:
David Lincoln is speaking. That helps
explain why researchers seeking full estimates of land values seek in
vain at the Lincoln Institute, Lincoln&#8217;s alter ego.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
Kurnow's basic source is tax assessments. He accepts their allocation
of value between land and buildings. Errors are possible, but he
dismisses them because "in all likelihood there is a tendency for such
errors to cancel each other." We have seen how wrong and biased that
is. He does not even correct for the assessment bias shown by sales
assessment ratios of Manvel's Census of Governments, nor for the
greater degree of underassessment revealed by mapping of land values.
He does not consider any of the 17 bulleted points shown above.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Most
modern economists who look into these matters rely upon standard
sources a-f above, mindless, or perhaps even glad, of their downward
biases, and unwilling to research the matter themselves. Young students
are intimidated and awed, or at least impressed and convinced, by the
&#8220;official&#8221;-looking auspices of the standard sources. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: DUE TO SPACE LIMITATIONS IN
GROUNDSWELL, THE REMAINDER OF THIS TEXT, CONSISTING OF 14 MORE POINTS,
IS REDUCED TO AN OUTLINE FORM<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Recent rises, and
likely future rises.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prices of land and resources have risen
sharply in recent years, but assessments always lag. For example, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">forty
years ago Alfred Kahn and Paul Davidson found that most oil profits
were rents</span>. Since then prices have risen from under $10/bbl to
about
$45. Natural gas prices have doubled in the last 6 years.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The Land Fraction of
Real Estate Value (LFREV) is much higher than standard modern sources
show.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On most assessment rolls the value of
old &#8220;junker&#8221; buildings, on the eve of demolition, is listed as higher
than the land under them. This betrays the erroneous use of the
&#8220;land-residual&#8221; method of separating land from building values. It
should be obvious that the old junker has no residual value: that is
why it is being junked. Junking is continuous in enclaves of high value
like Kenilworth, Illinois, or Beverly Hills, California. &#8220;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Locational obsolescence</span>&#8221; is the key
concept. The high and growing value of the underlying site cannibalizes
the residual building value. <br>
<br>

 name="Broadening_the_concepts_of_land_and_its"></a>Broadening the
concepts of land and its rent</span> (Items 4-11)</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 4. Many rents are best
tappable by variable charges. &#8220;Taxes on rent&#8221; are much broader than the
traditional property tax on real estate ex buildings.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We explore in this work the revenue
potential of variable charges on road crowding, water withdrawals from
surface and underground sources, minerals extraction, air and water
pollution, spectrum use, fish catches, billboards, and so on. Some of
these are major additions to land revenues. California, a major
oil-producing state, does not even have a severance tax. In the fiscal
crisis of 2003, with 136 or so candidates running for Governor, only
one (Arianna Huffington) even mentioned it, so total is the mental
blackout.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taxing air and water polluters by
levying "effluent charges" won the favor of economists in the 1960s.
Make polluters pay for preempting publicly owned air. Reaction in
America later moved towards creating private property in pollution
rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-point pollution does not lend itself
to effluent charges, nor to markets in pollution licenses. It calls for
a variety of creative counter-measures, including but not limited to
land value taxation.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Taxes on property
income.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These can easily be made into a means of
collecting land rent while exempting the income imputable to real
capital. Income taxes are less efficient than LVT, because the former
might impose some marginal disincentive, some "excess burden." Yet,
many private landlords write participatory leases in preference to
fixed cash rents. The fisc can develop this option, too. Indeed it did
not long ago, led by Walter Heller, JFK&#8217;s Chair of the Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The personal income tax base includes
income from land. That&#8217;s what the 16th Amendment was all about.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
personal income tax can be converted
into a tax on land income in two steps. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.
Exempt wage and salary
income from the tax, then raise the rates.</span> (Corporate income is
already
net of payrolls, and we have taxed it from 1909). <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">B. Remove capital
income from the base.</span> This is done by &#8220;expensing&#8221;: letting
investors
write off what they spend on new capital, at or near the time they do
it.<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Substituting taxes for
subsidies to promote conservation, turning "Negabucks into Megabucks"
for the treasury.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water makes a good example. Now, as for
years past, we subsidize landowners to withdraw water. The benefits of
the subsidy are roughly in proportion to the area of irrigable land
owned. As a result, water is maldistributed, underpriced and wasted.
There is also great revenue potential in water. In an arid land, water
is life. The Constitution says that water belongs to "the people of
California." The State can serve market efficiency, conserve water, and
raise revenue in one stroke by putting a charge on water withdrawals.
Such a charge would also expedite the current movement to market water.
Many in the Green Movement also see the double efficacy of &#8220;Pigovian&#8221;
taxes (effluent charges that &#8220;tax bads, not goods&#8221;) to curtail overuse
and pollution of common airs and waters, while also raising revenue.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Taxing unearned
increments as current income.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a swelling of land gains as a
component of income. Gains on land value are a form of land rent,
eminently taxable. Great is the need for objective economists to
establish the taxability of capital gains, to show how to tax
unrealized gains as they accrue. It&#8217;s surprisingly easy: levy a
property tax based on the market value of appreciating land. That is
just what the property tax was, before the current movement to limit
assessed valuations to capitalized income from current use only.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Variant kinds of
natural resources, hitherto neglected or not classed with land, show
great revenue potential.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some examples are 
<ul>
  <li>the radio spectrum;  </li>
  <li>telecom relay sites;  </li>
  <li>slots in the geosynchronous orbit;  </li>
  <li>fishing quotas;  </li>
  <li>quotas of all sorts on production and marketing;  </li>
  <li>pollution permits;  </li>
  <li>power drops;  </li>
  <li>street parking spaces;  </li>
  <li>driving on congested roads and through bottlenecks;  </li>
  <li>mooring boats; etc.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Variant forms of
tenures to resources, omitted from standard tax rolls, show great
revenue potential.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leases on public lands give tenure, de
facto, but are often exempt because the public land is exempt. 
<ul>
  <li>Often they are &#8220;sweetheart&#8221; leases, like grazing leases in New
Mexico and 16 other western states.  </li>
  <li>Aircraft landing &#8220;slots&#8221; and &#8220;gates&#8221; are protected by Federal
power from local taxes.  </li>
  <li>Water &#8220;rights&#8221; are mostly licenses, hence not real property,
hence generally exempt from property taxes.</li>
  <li>Resort homes and mineral claims and timber cutting rights
on Federal lands are &#8220;possessory interests,&#8221; sometimes not on the tax
rolls.  </li>
  <li>Licenses assigning radio spectrum are &#8220;on&#8221; Federal property,
hence exempt from local taxes.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a class of &#8220;land-grabbing&#8221;
capital whose value derives from its ability to preempt common land.
<ul>
  <li>Vehicles on public land, whether parked or moving, preempt
valuable space and are a means of establishing a kind of mobile tenure.
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Donald Shoup reckons that
potential revenues from street parking, now free, could raise as much
money as the entire property tax now does</span>.)  </li>
  <li>Boaters in large, fast, noisy, polluting vessels on small lakes
take over the lakes as if they owned them.  </li>
  <li>Polluters in effect preempt <span style="font-style: italic;">de
facto</span> pollution easements over
neighboring lands, including the public lands in streets and parks.  </li>
  <li>Owners of surfboards, ATVs, horses, snowmobiles, trail bikes,
rifles and the like impose a wide footprint over vast tracts of public
and semi-public land without paying rent.  </li>
</ul>
Culturally we have a long way to go before the American public realizes
what our cowboy attitudes are doing to us, but it&#8217;s time to start by
collecting rent, directly or indirectly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaseholds on the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">OCS (Outer Continental
Shelf)</span> are outside state sovereignty, hence not subject to
property
taxes. Their tenure was established by U.S. military might as recently
as 1946, when President Truman unilaterally extended our boundaries
from the traditional 3-mile limit to 200 miles. That is not the end of
it, however, for our military/diplomatic/financial umbrellas undergird
tenures of American nationals and allies in nations around the world,
and protect vessels at sea, even those flying foreign flags of
&#8220;convenience&#8221; (i.e. tax-avoidance). There is every reason why private
beneficiaries of these tenures should pay for their protection.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; 10. Rents that are now
dissipated, but need not be.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Dissipation by open access</span><br>
&nbsp; It
is a truism of economic theory that open access to lands dissipates and
destroys potential rents, by overcrowding. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Open range</span> and fisheries are
classic examples from olden times. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries
</span>are being privatized only
in our times, and the rents, where observable, are often over half the
catch. Streets and highways are like open ranges, with cars and trucks
instead of cattle and sheep. The revenue potential of charging
motorists for squeezing into crowded streets is staggering. <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/studies/Gaffney_on_Vickrey.html">Wm.
Vickrey</a>, among others, has come up with vertiginous numbers. The
beauty
of it is that discouraging marginal trips by pricing actually can
increase the aggregate traffic flow, a double gain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;
Access to underground &#8220;pools&#8221; of water and petroleum is limited to
overlying landowners, but even that degree of openness is enough to
destroy much potential rent that may be conserved by unitized control
or better, severance taxes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> 2. Dissipation by rent-seeking in
the process of tenuring</span><br>
&nbsp;
Private tenure is not the panacea for all resource problems, because
the process of creating tenure entails orgies of &#8220;soonerism.&#8221; Notorious
examples are exploring for minerals in the preleasing period, and
establishing water licenses based on prior appropriation, and radio
spectrum licenses based on histories of broadcasting. <br>

11-15)<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; 11. Removal of reasons for
limiting tax rates</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The base is not
erodable (tax capitalization is not erosion)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. There is no taxable
event, hence no Laffer Effect or Excess Burden (except as in #4, above,
where the slow-down is deliberate, for conservation and congestion
reasons).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The base is highly
concentrated, making the tax progressive in impact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The tax encourages
both saving and investing, leveling them upwards, the macro-economists
dream.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The tax base is the
after-tax value of land, making the real rate much lower than the
apparent rate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Using the tax to
obviate other taxes raises the tax base via the ATCOR Effect (see #13,
below)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The tax fosters
better allocation of the tax base, raising its taxable capacity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. The tax hits
absentee owners of land, without discouraging the inflow of capital.
There is a strong local multiplier effect from taxing absentee owners.
Refer to #15, below <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; 12. The unseen reservoir of
high internal valuations and holdout prices</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The observed land market conceals
holdout values, which are much higher. The &#8220;willing seller&#8221; concept is
mostly fictional: it is the &#8220;motivated&#8221; seller who makes the observed
market. Most sales are in some way &#8220;forced.&#8221; Other owners want higher
prices - that is why they are not selling.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The meaning for tax policy is that
there is scope for raising tax rates substantially without flooding the
market with distress sellers.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; 13. Raising taxable rents by
untaxing capital and labor, production and exchange: the concept of
ATCOR (All Taxes Come Out of Rents)</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The meaning and relevance of ATCOR is
that when we lower other taxes, the revenue base is not lost, but
shifted to land rents and values, which can then yield more taxes. This
is most obvious with taxes on buildings. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When we exempt buildings, and
raise tax rates on the land under them, we are still taxing the same
real estate; we are just taxing it in a different way. This &#8220;different
way&#8221; actually raises the revenue capacity of real estate by a large
factor, by relieving it of the excess burden of taxing production and
capital. <span style="font-style: italic;">This is that &#8220;free lunch&#8221;
that Chicago economists wrongly preach &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no such thing as.&#8221;</span></span><br
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historical experience with exempting
buildings has shown that builders offer more for land, and sellers
demand more, when the new buildings are to be untaxed. The effect on
revenue is the same as taxing prospective new buildings before they are
even built, even though the new buildings are not to be taxed at all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Net result: the revenue capacity of
land, when it is substituted for other tax bases, is comparable to
current revenues. Owing to efficiency effects, and renewal effects, it
may well be higher.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; 14. Mortgage interest as land
rent?</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is ticklish, so I advance it
tentatively, lest it divert us from the main chance.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
Municipal general obligation bonds.</span> When a government borrows on
the security of land revenues, it is in effect selling those revenues
to the borrower. The bondholder becomes a landowner, and could be taxed
as such.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 2. Private mortgages</span>. One kind
of private paper is systematically recorded at the county level:
mortgages, or deeds of trust. It is administratively feasible to put
these into the property tax base, as Professor Don Hagman of UCLA Law
School urged. A tax on mortgages would be mostly shifted to borrowers
in the form of higher interest rates, the supply of mortgage funds
being highly elastic. Thus, to tax mortgages is indirectly to tax real
estate.</div>
<br>
&nbsp;
Mortgage lending would shrink, it is true, but that would release funds
for other kinds of loans, shorter-term loans, causing higher turnover
both of loans, and the nation's capital stock. Both can be shown to
have positive allocative, distributive, and macro-economic effects.
Most beneficial would be the effect on stability of lending
institutions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It is widely assumed
that cheap
long term credit is essential to let most people buy real estate. That
reasoning overlooks the nature of land values, which makes it circular.
The main effect of long term loans is to inflate land prices, creating
the very problem it offsets. It is a treadmill effect, like keeping up
with the Jones's, and this treadmill has a history of breaking down in
crises. </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; 15. Multiplier effect of taxing
absentee owners to spend funds locally</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transferring rents from absentees to be
spent locally improves the State economic base and balance of payments
(except to the extent the State outsources its work). Focusing taxes on
land means absentees cannot remove the tax base from our state. The
worst they can do is sell it to residents, thus raising the quality of
life.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> California's
legislative analyst, William Hamm, estimated in 1978 that over fifty
per cent of the value of taxable property in California was owned by
residents of other states or nations.</span> The potential impact of
this factor is enormous.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a curious silence on the
matter. When it comes to discriminating against immigrant workers,
xenophobia fills the air. There is a hue and cry against outsourcing.
Taxing alien property, however, pushes a different button. Yet, here is
one instance where localism may be harnessed to help create a more
healthy society. The purpose of democracy is to represent the
electorate, not the absentee who stands between the resident and the
resources of his homeland<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary on fifteen new elements of
taxable capacity</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous estimates of rent and land
values have been narrowly limited to a fraction of the whole, thus
giving a false impression that the tax capacity is similarly narrow. We
are adding Fifteen Elements to the traditional narrow &#8220;single tax&#8221; base:
<ul>
  <li>correcting omissions and understatements in standard data sources</li>
  <li>updating ancient sources that use obsolete low values</li>
  <li>raising the Land Fraction of Real Estate Values (LFREV)</li>
  <li>adding rents that are best taxed by use of variable excises</li>
  <li>adding rents taxable by income taxes</li>
  <li>substituting taxes for subsidies to foster conservation</li>
  <li>adding current unearned increments as part of ongoing rent</li>
  <li>adding previously invisible and undervalued resources to the tax
base</li>
  <li>adding lands held under variant forms of tenure</li>
  <li>adding rents that are now dissipated, but need not be</li>
  <li>noting the feasibility of much higher tax rates on a base that is
both non-erosive, and concentrated in ownership</li>
  <li>noting the great mass of holdout prices exceed visible market
prices by a large factor</li>
  <li>adding the revenue from most existing taxes to the potential land
tax base, on the ATCOR principle</li>
  <li>adding (tentatively) the value of mortgage debt</li>
  <li>adding the favorable multiplier effect on balance of payments </li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any one of those Fifteen Elements
indicates a higher land tax base than economists perceive today. Taken
together, they cast a new light on this subject. <br>
