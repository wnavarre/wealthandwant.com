<a href="#SUMMARY"><small style="font-weight: normal;">Summary</small></a><br>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Common Property in Land is Compatible
with the Market
Economy.</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> You can enjoy the benefits of
a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; <br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">To
keep land common while shifting to a market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems.</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The very people who gave us the term
laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have learned to
measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.
</span><br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
The most valuable land by far is
city land. Ted Gwartney, a
professional land valuer, is
speaking to us about that. I have
data showing that <span style="font-weight: bold;">well over half
the value of city real estate is the
pure land value</span>. In big, key cities,
prices per unit of land go
astonishingly high, dwarfing most
other values by comparison. For
example, at the height of the Japanese boom, in 1990, land
prices in that great
city rose so high that the appraised value of the land
under the Imperial Palace in
Tokyo was as great as all the land in California! At the
same time, within
California, most of the land value was in our cities, even
though California is the
premier farm state in the U.S.A. Urban land of such
immense value makes a rich,
rich tax base for you, or any nation.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
Another natural resource (hence part of "land"), whose
nature and value the mass
of people are only slowly realizing, is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">radio
spectrum</span>. In this age of
communication its value is vaulting skywards even faster
than the rockets
launching the satellites that direct and relay signals
through the spectrum. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each
satellite requires a spectrum assignment, or it is nothing
but space junk.</span> One
minor American entrepreneur, Craig McCaw, collected a
bundle of spectrum rights
for cell phones, and a few years ago sold them to AT&amp;T
for $12 billions. Then Mr.
McCaw went partners with Bill Gates, perhaps the richest
American, in a firm
called Teledesic, to launch hundreds of satellites and
amass radio spectrum
rights around the entire world, including your part of the
world, in the hope of
dominating worldwide communications. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio
spectrum is a
natural resource, and
it belongs to the government, even in the capitalistic
U.S.A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Teledesic
comes calling, </span>under the auspices of our Vice President Al
Gore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't sell
anything cheap! In fact, don't sell anything at all, but
lease it for a limited time, so
you may gain from future rises in value.</span> And don't stint
on the professional help
you should hire to protect your interests: these lease
contracts are complex, and
are worth billions if you play your cards right.
</span><br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Hydrocarbons are a third set of
valuable resources.</span> The
values involved are
gigantic. The recent merger of the Exxon and Mobil oil
firms was valued at $260
billions, several times greater than the Russian annual
budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should private
parties make off with all this natural value?</span> Several
nations, including some of your
neighbors, support themselves entirely from these
revenues. Norway pays for a
lush welfare state from its oil revenues. Its reserves are
so valuable that the mere
change in their appraised value in several recent years
has exceeded the entire
GDP of Norway. And your oil reserves? If they match your
production, they may
be the largest in the world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
World oil prices are down this year, as you know, but
there is another side to this.
The devaluation of the ruble has raised the value of your
oil in Russian terms,
because the oil earns "hard" currency abroad. Your
government has recognized
this by imposing a special tax on the resulting
"windfall," but we will see below
(Sections 2,C and 2,D) that there is a much more effective
way to tax resource
rents.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The American state of Alaska holds
down its other taxes by
socializing part of its
oil revenues, which otherwise would inure to a handful of
the major stockholders of
two corporations (ARCO and BP). Alaska not only holds down
other taxes, it pays
each resident - man, woman, and child - a social dividend
of over $1,000 per year.</span>
Go thou and do likewise. Your expert, Dmitri Lvov from the
Russian Academy of
Sciences, a speaker at this meeting, has written that you
could cover most of
your national budget from your enormous production of oil
and gas.
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Many third-world nations like
Venezuela or Nigeria have
fabulous mineral oil that
they fail to exploit for their own people, letting
sophisticated or ruthless foreign
corporations, in tandem with weak or corrupt insiders,
reap the gains.</span> The
question for Russia is whether to follow their bad example
and become a poor
resource-colony of the west, or whether to assert your own
sovereignty over your
own resources for the benefit of your own people. You need
look no further than
Norway for a model.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Other subsoil resources have great
value, too.</span> Many
nations, even backward
ones, gain large parts of their national revenue from
"hardrock" minerals. Bolivia,
Gabon, Jamaica, Liberia, New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea,
Zaire, and Zambia
have raised over 25% of their budgets this way in recent
years; Chile, Thailand
and Malaysia have taken lesser, but substantial amounts.
Saskatchewan, a
Canadian Province, raises large revenues from potash and
uranium; Minnesota, an
American state, from iron ore; and so on. Some other
nations fail to raise much
revenue from fabulous minerals from which others profit,
like S. Africa with its gold
and diamonds, West Virginia with its coal, or Missouri
with its lead mines and
reserves. Russia is a treasure-house of untapped mineral
wealth that you can and
should tax to alleviate the condition of the Russian
people.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life, and the
most valuable
natural resource is water. </span>For
example, in southern California we need water so much we
import it from the
Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump it uphill
through the long San Joaquin
Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain range, and
tunnel it through the
San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great cost. When it
gets here, it
supplements and competes with local water that nature
provides freely in the
Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
then has a value equal
to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
That value in the local
waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
to take that surplus
value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
and worse, we actually
subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay for
dams, canals, and
pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we turn a public
asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly
that is called "dissipating
rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past
time we learned to husband
and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the
surplus. So should you, in
comparable circumstances.
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Another value from water is to
generate power.</span> Again,
California witlessly fails to
socialize this value, but Canada, our northern neighbor,
has shown the way.
British Columbia, Newfoundland (the Labrador part),
Quebec, and other provinces
raise large revenues from charges on the use of falling
water. Russia, with some of
the world's largest hydro-electric projects, can do the
same, or better.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of value.</span>
In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell these
licenses, but simply
gave them away to owners
of existing boats, and others with political influence.
Each license now sells for
something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
instant millionaires and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway
from the many,
created an instant class society where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. <br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%. Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="2._The_Net_Product_of_Land_is_the"></a> 2. The Net Product of
Land is the Taxable Surplus</span>
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> A. To socialize the taxable surplus,
land rent,
effectively, you must define
and identify it carefully, and structure your taxes to
home in on it. </span>Taxable
surplus means a value you can collect in taxes without
destroying, or even
diminishing it, or driving it away. In practice this means
mostly land rent, because the supply of land is fixed -- what
economists call
"inelastic" -- however much or
little you tax it. <br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Land rent is the same as the Net Revenue of land, that is
the Gross Revenue less
the cost of mobile human inputs (including capital) needed
to make land yield the
revenue. Accountants generally divide these mobile human
inputs into two parts:
current expenses and durable capital. The durable capital
has to be converted to
an annual equivalent, to make capital costs commensurable
with annual
expenses. This is done by multiplying the value of capital
on the land times the
sum of an interest rate plus a depreciation rate. Summing
that up in one line:
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> N = G - E -
K(i+d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) <br>
where <br>
N = Net Revenue <br>
G = Gross Revenue <br>
E = Expenses (current) <br>
K = Capital, at current value <br>
i = interest rate <br>
d = depreciation rate</div>
<br>
It is common to simplify the expression by consolidating
the first two terms into
one, called "cash flow." Thus: <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;
&nbsp;
G-E = "cash flow"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)</div>
<br>
Likewise, K(i+d) is called the "user cost of
capital." <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> K(i+d) = "user cost of
capital"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Net Revenue is also called "Rent."</span> Thus, finally, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rent = Cash Flow less User Cost of Capital
(4) </span>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Defining and measuring rent then resolves itself into
defining and measuring each
of the component terms, in some detail. That is a 2-hour
lecture at least, which
time precludes here, and I hope to discuss with officials
in the Ministry of Natural
Resources; but it gives you the basic idea of how to
define and measure rent, the
Taxable Surplus from land.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> B. Taxable surplus is also what you
can tax without
driving land into the
wrong use.</span> It is not enough that the land supply is fixed:
a tax must not force
underuse or other misuse of the fixed supply.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> A great advantage of taxing
rent is that it does not
change the ranking of land
uses in the eyes of the landowner.</span> Let me explain.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
In a free market, the function of rent is
to sort and arrange land uses:
landowners allocate land to those
uses yielding the most net product, or rent. Economists
have shown (and you can
easily see) that this is socially advantageous: the net
product is the excess of
revenue over all costs, so land yielding the highest rent
is adding its utmost to the
national product.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
When you base your tax on the net product (or rent), the
ranking of rival land uses
remains the same after-tax as it was before-tax. That is,
if use "A" yields 20%
more rent than use "B", and a tax takes 50% of the rent,
then use A still yields
the owner 20% more after-tax than use B, and the owner
still prefers use A. We
will see below, (<a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_surplus_of_lan.htm#D._Raising_output_by_removing_tax_bias_">Section
D</a>), that when you tax something
other than rent (say the
Gross Revenue, G), you will drive the land into less
intensive uses, or out of use
altogether.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A related advantage of taxing
rent is that you can often
levy the tax on the land's
<span style="font-style: italic;">potential </span>to yield rent,
regardless of what use the owner
actually chooses.</span> This is,
indeed, a standard way of taxing rent in most capitalist
nations. It is possible
because buyers and sellers trade land based on their
careful estimates of its
maximum rent-yielding capability. The tax valuer observes
and records these value
data, and uses them to place a value on all comparable
lands. Many books and
manuals and professional journals have been published on
the techniques used: it
is a well established art, with its own professional
associations, of which our
speaker Mr. Gwartney is a leading member.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Such a tax is limited to the maximum
possible rent, and so
will not exceed a
landowner's ability to pay - provided he uses the land in
the most economical
manner (which is not always the most intensive manner). It
will surely not interfere
with his using the land in the best way, but will
discourage using it any other way.
</span><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">C. To tax rent we must be sure there
is rent to tax, and
we must adopt public
policies to husband and maximize it, and avoid policies
that lower and dissipate it.</span>
This covers the whole area of public spending, a vast
topic, so I will give just a few
pointed examples.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">i. Avoid "perverse subsidies." </span>These
are subsidies
that encourage
harmful things like 
<ul>
  <li>polluting air and water,  </li>
  <li>wasting
water,  </li>
  <li>cutting timber
whose value is less than the cost of logging, or  </li>
  <li>populating remote regions
whose costs exceed the benefits derived. </li>
</ul>
Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
contains the most
polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
to sustain its
uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
that employ just a few
people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
North America. <br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people to
withdraw scarce
water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
artifact of such
misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
Colorado is actually
subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
the privilege. If they
paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
the Treasury, which
could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
saving.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great national
asset, our national
forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
subsidizing forest roads in
subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
in good areas,
but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
to get $1 in
revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
destroying scenic values
and watershed protection.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ii. Avoid letting lessees of public
land conceal
their revenues</span>. Many
minerals and hydrocarbons on public lands are leased
by private firms,
subject either to "royalties" or "severance taxes"
based on the value of
output. Many of these private firms are "vertically
integrated," meaning they
own the downstream firms, often in other countries,
to which they sell.
They grow skilled at shifting profits away from where
taxes are higher to
where they are lower, by rigging the internal
transfer prices. That is, they
sell to themselves at artificially low prices, so
your share of their revenues
disappears. What they call "world market" prices are
really their own
internal prices, adjusted to help them steal from
you. You must guard
against that.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> iii. Avoid letting lessees or
taxpayers pad their
costs to understate
their net revenues</span>. When you let lessees or taxpayers
deduct their costs
(as you should) from the tax base, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">you must audit
those alleged costs to
be sure they are real and legitimate. Pay these
auditors well, and support
them: they will save you a hundred times what you pay
them.
</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;">
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> iv. Avoid dissipating rent by
allowing open access to
resources like
fisheries</span>, which we have already discussed.
<br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> v. Avoid trying to distribute rents
to consumers by
capping prices
below the market.</span> This, of course, is the history of
energy prices in
Russia; it has also been used, in milder forms, in
Canada and the U.S.
What is wrong with it? In a word, it fosters wasteful
use, and aborts a lot of
economical production. In addition, it leaves a lot
of rent in private hands,
untaxed (see <a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_surplus_of_lan.htm#D._Raising_output_by_removing_tax_bias_">"D"</a>,
next below).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It is easy to understand the dire need for guaranteed fuel
in a northern continental
winter climate. You mustn't let people freeze, and they
will bless and support you
for keeping them warm. As society gets better organized,
though, you can gain by
guaranteeing the poor a minimum cash income with which to
buy fuel and other
needs at market prices, rather than lavishing them with
free fuel that you might be
exporting to meet other urgent needs. You can provide the
cash income from the
rents created when fuel prices rise, and have a lot more
to spare from the resulting
net gains, which I next explain.

by removing tax bias
</span><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This section involves some analysis, some definition, some
accounting, and some
hard thinking: it calls for a slower reading pace than
what precedes. I urge the
reader to give it the close attention it needs; I promise
that the effort will repay you
well. This is the heart of the thesis, and makes sense of
everything else.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">When you base a tax on taxable
surplus, and keep the tax
proportional to taxable
surplus, you levy taxes without twisting and inverting the
landowner's or land
manager's ranking of land uses. </span>As noted before, the
owner's preferred use after
tax remains the same as it would be without any tax. On
the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">if you
tax on some other basis</span> (Gross Revenue, for example), <span
 style="font-style: italic;">you
bias the owner
against uses more heavily taxed.</span></span> To keep the example
simple, and generally
realistic, we assume here that the seller is a
"price-taker," meaning he sells on a
world market and cannot raise the price, and so has no
choice but to bear the tax.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Bear in mind that Net Revenue is the Taxable Surplus: you
cannot tax more than
that without aborting the land use. The ratio of Costs (C)
to Gross Revenue (G)
varies over a wide range, from zero up nearly to one (and
even above one for
subeconomic uses which, however, you do not want). Let's
compare two rival
uses, A and B, for the same piece of land. Use "A" yields
more Net Revenue (N),
but has a higher ratio of C/G. We levy a tax of 10% on
Gross Revenue (G). To
simplify, Expenses and Capital Costs are consolidated as
"C", so N = G-C. Table
1 shows the effects of the tax on Net Revenue after Tax
(NAT).<br>

<br>
<p>The higher use, A, produces more goods, makes more jobs, and yields
more Net Product: it is clearly the higher use. The tax on G [Gross
Revenue], however, turns A into a lower use than B, in the eyes of the
landowner or manager. A 10% tax on G is a 100% tax on the N from use A,
wiping out the entire incentive to put land to use A. It is a 40% tax
on the N from use B, leaving 60% of the Net Product for the landowner.
The landowner would choose use A in the absence of taxes, or with a tax
on N; but the tax on G forces him to choose use B, which is socially
inferior. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This, in a nutshell,
expresses the damage done by imposing taxes on bases other than N, the
Net Revenue of land. </span><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The tax lowers output, employment, and investment opportunities
for capital, all three. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Fourth, it lowers tax revenues well below their maximum possible
level of $10k, the Net Revenue from use A.</li>
</ul>
More generally, a tax on G [Gross Revenue] is a tax on N [Net Revenue]
at a rate equal to G/N times the tax rate on G. For every parcel of
land there are usually many alternative uses, and even more alternative
intensities of any given use, a whole spectrum of choices. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Up and down the spectrum, a tax on G [Gross
Revenue] systematically aborts the "higher" (more intensive) uses in
favor of lower uses. The effect is like a "scorched-earth" policy, but
not one we inflict on the invading enemy in wartime: we inflict it on
ourselves in peacetime by adopting a foolish tax policy.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>
<br>
If we tax C [Capital] instead of G, we can illustrate the effects by
another Table like Table 1, but this is now a simple exercise that I
leave to the reader. Here the bias is in the same direction but a good
deal worse, because the tax on N [Net Revenue] will be the tax on C
multiplied times C/N. To visualize this effect most simply, premise a
third land use, "D", that yields some G without using any C at all -- a
parking lot is a near-example. Use D would now be tax free, while uses
A and B would still pay a good deal, and be displaced by use D. Parking
would be ample, but there would be nothing there to park for.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;There are many more possible tax types we might consider, taxes
imposed on parts of C, but not all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A
payroll tax is an example.</span> This tax would discourage the use of
labor on land, but not the use of capital, and so would have two
biases: less labor use, with the same capital use, or even more capital
use as capital substitutes for labor. We do not here pursue all such
possibilities of bad tax policy, for they are too numerous. The major
point is that taxes on any base other than N, the Net Product of land,
bias the market against the best and fullest use of land. <br>
<br>
Note, finally, that a cap on the price of G, such as discussed above,
has the same effects as a tax based on G. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>E. Maximizing public revenue.</b> <br>
<br>
When you focus taxes on the Net Product, N, you can raise the tax rate
very high with no ill effects on land use. By contrast, you cannot
raise taxes on G [Gross Revenue] very high because a high rate will
drive some land completely out of use, and all land out of its best
use, a catastrophic outcome. To avoid the catastrophe you must lower
the tax rate, but that means you cannot collect in taxes all of the
rent from land uses like B, or much of any from uses like D. Thus, with
taxes on G, you first abort some of the taxable surplus, and still fail
to collect all that remains. In <a href="#Table_1">Table 1</a>, the
tax collected is only $2k, or 40% of the Taxable Surplus (N) from use
B; while the potentially taxable surplus is $10k, from use A. With
taxes on N, you can collect the entire taxable surplus from use A,
$10k, while aborting none of it. <br>
<br>
Critics of the land tax policy would have us believe that the land tax
base is "too small," and cannot support the government. How wrong and
misleading they are! The truth is the opposite. <a href="#Table_1">Table
1</a>, and the reasoning behind it, tell us we can collect more by
taxing land, and exempting G and C, than in any other way. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>F. Sustaining the tax base</b> <br>
<br>
The taxable surplus available from taxing the Net Product of land goes
on forever, and grows as land rents grow. It is not like the false
"revenue" that comes from privatizing land, which the IMF et al. would
have you do. Selling the title to land gives money to the government
currently in power, which this government is prone to treat as current
income and spend right away: but it is not permanent income, any more
than you would call it income when you sell your farm or home. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">To have income, permanent income,
you must reserve the right to tax land forever, and use that income for
public purposes or social dividends. </span><br>
&nbsp; <br>
If you think you need cash immediately, in excess of current taxable
surplus, you can always borrow on the security of the tax revenue you
have reserved for your government. There are certain dangers in
mortgaging your public revenues like that, and I would counsel prudence
and caution; but these dangers are small and uncertain compared with
the certain disaster that will follow if you sell land forever, without
reserving any power to tax it in the future. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
The U.S.A. fell into this trap in the 19th Century. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Federal Government supported
itself for years by selling off its vast public domain, a domain so
vast that generations of politicians came and went who thought of these
sales revenues as a kind of income.</span> After a while, though, the
land was all gone. Then we had to turn to excise taxes, and income
taxes, which have now grown so high they will slowly strangle us. Those
of us who foresee this danger now look to you, Russia, with your vast
undeveloped resources in public ownership, to avoid our errors and
become, as we once fancied ourselves, the "last best hope of earth." We
look to you to convert your nation from its status as a wretched colony
from which people would escape, to a refuge of new opportunity for your
own people, and for the "huddled masses, yearning to breathe free" of
the whole world. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b><a name="3._Taxing_the_Net_Product"></a>3. Taxing the Net Product of
Land Permits Untaxing Labor</b><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The IMF and its allies advise you to
impose heavy taxes on the payrolls of labor, and on employers who hire
labor, and on the goods labor must buy to survive and support families.
</span>Then they turn around and tell you that labor-intensive
operations, like some of your coal mines, are inefficient because labor
is so costly, even though the workers are getting very little after
taxes. They advise you to downsize or close these operations, throwing
labor out of work. They even lend you money for the purpose: not to
develop and build up Russia, but to dismantle its industry, which they
call "restructuring," and throw its workers onto welfare. In a few
specific cases they may be right, but in general, this is a strange way
to develop Russia's economy and living standards!<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It is enough to
make one wonder whose welfare they have in mind. </span> <br>
&nbsp; <br>
To restructure your industry, first uplift incentives to build and man
new plants; then let managers close old ones by their own free
individual choice, as their workers leave for better jobs. We see from
Table 1, and the analysis following it, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">a tax on labor artificially
discourages labor-using land uses like A, in favor of labor-sparing
uses like B, or even D, which uses no labor at all.</span> <br>
  </li>
  <li>If, on the other hand, you untax labor, you lower its cost to
employers. When you change the tax system to relieve labor, many lands
will be shifted to the more intensive uses, soaking up your surplus
labor and "restructuring" your industries in the most constructive,
efficient ways. Employers will want to upsize, not downsize. Workers
will move off welfare and produce more goods either for export, or for
your own consumers, lowering your need to import. Both of those will
strengthen the ruble: production is the key, in either case. </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You will also collect more taxes, as
shown, by shifting the tax base to the Net Product of land. </span>Lower
welfare costs, coupled with higher tax collections, will balance your
budget and lead to the day when you can even run a surplus. With these
new surplus funds you can pay off old debts, if you choose to. I take
no position and offer no advice on whether you should pay off old debts
from the Soviet era: that is a judgment call for you to make, based on
your evaluation of the history of those debts, and how obligated you
feel. I do know, though, that if you have good public revenues for the
future, you will have good credit, regardless of the past. Lenders will
seek you out, eager to become your creditors again. That is the clear
lesson of U.S. history. We have had two centuries of experience in
which many of our states and cities repudiated debts, many of them owed
to foreigners, only to borrow from them again within a few years. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b><a name="4._Taxing_the_Net_Product_of_Land"></a>4. Taxing the Net
Product of Land Permits Untaxing Capital</b> <br>
<!-- pull quote --><!-- pull quote --> <br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The IMF, World Bank, and
various U.S. advisors tell you and the world that you must make a hard
choice: you must cut spending on social welfare, even on needed
pensions and back wages, in order to attract and retain capital. The
supposed hard choice is false, and the advice is bad. </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">When you
tax Net Land Revenue, as advised here, you are not taxing at all the
investor who uses his capital to improve land, or equip it with
machinery and stock it with goods. </span>The landowner or manager
gets to deduct the User Cost of Capital from the tax base (as shown in <a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_surplus_of_lan.htm#2._The_Net_Product_of_Land_is_the">Section
2</a>). The improver gets to keep, free of tax, the entire <b><i>increment</i></b>
in production that his capital generates. Taxes are limited to the Net
Product of land, which you may even evaluate and tax prior to the
owner's using the land at all. In the acronyms of finance, the investor
who applies real capital to Russian land will get to keep the entire
"Marginal Return" (MR) from the capital. This MR after-tax (MRAT) will
become the same as the MR before-tax (MRBT). Few other nations can
offer such an attraction. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
This change will reverse the capital flight you now suffer from, and
help recall over $100 billions of expatriate capital now stashed
abroad. More, it will attract foreign capital, whose supply is highly
elastic, into private ventures. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Russia
will become like a "tax haven" for mobile capital (and all capital is
mobile within a few years).</span> This will not be done clandestinely
in the sometimes sinister manner we associate with Cyprus, Switzerland,
or Bermuda, but quite openly and honestly. Russia will not, like the
present tax havens of the world, serve merely as a broker or transit
station for capital headed elsewhere; Russia will be the final
destination, to your great advantage. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Foreign capital will not come here primarily to buy Russian land and
collect Russian rents, for you will be taxing that land heavily. It
will come primarily to improve, stock and equip Russian land with new
capital that you will NOT be taxing. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Will the IMF object and make trouble for you? They should be happy to
see their loans used to create capital in Russia, and restructure your
industries to earn income to repay the loans. That is what they <b><i>say</i></b>
they want, at any rate, and this will be a good way to test their
sincerity. If they do make trouble, you need not care, for you will no
longer need them: world capital will be beating a path to your door. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
The OECD will surely object, for they are waging a campaign to force
all nations to adopt the same kind of oppressive, biased,
counterproductive tax systems they use themselves. So far, however,
they cannot even compel several small island nations to bend to them,
so I think giant Russia, with its proud sovereign traditions, can
resist. If you do exempt capital from taxation, as recommended here,
and begin to suck in significant amounts of capital from the whole
world's pool, your competition will alarm and embarrass many OECD and
other nations, who may be forced to follow suit. That, however, is a
problem, if it is one, for a somewhat speculative future. Your
immediate problem and crisis calls for recalling $100 billions of your
own expatriate capital, and few could object to, or feel threatened by
that. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b><a name="5._Taxing_the_Net_Product_of_Land"></a>5. Taxing the Net
Product of Land Provides Ample Public Revenues: a Master Solution to
Many Problems</b> <br>
<br>
Many of your most vexing problems derive simply from governmental
poverty, and will melt away when you shall have solved the basic
problem of raising revenues. People speak of them as separate problems,
but they are byproducts of not collecting enough taxes. At the risk of
reciting what may be obvious to some, I will list some of these soluble
problems. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>A. Public revenues will support the ruble.</b> They will improve
your public credit, as shown. They will obviate inflationary finance,
which is a recourse only for governments lacking tax revenues. Taxes
will, when collected from the net product of land in the manner shown
above, spur land managers and owners to produce more goods: some for
export, and some to replace imports. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
The basic backing of most currencies in the world is their status as
"legal tender" for paying taxes. Private people and businesses must
acquire rubles to pay their taxes, thus giving the ruble value. If you
believe that the ruble requires the backing of national bonds, your
strong revenue stream will back such bonds and let you issue them in
whatever volume you may think is required. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Last, when you induce foreign investors to want to transfer funds to
Russia, they will have to buy rubles for that purpose, supporting your
currency. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>B. Your public credit will, of course, recover to AAA rating </b>when
lenders see that there is a strong flow of revenue to pay public debts.
Cash flow is what lenders rely on, basically: other things are
incidental trappings. Never again need you pay premium usurious
interest rates. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>C. Never again need you bend to any "advice" or commands from alien
lenders</b>, nor endure patronizing, humiliating homilies from alien
bankers, nor beg any foreign power for aid. Never again need you accept
loans earmarked for dismantling or "restructuring" your own industries
for the benefit of foreign industries or nations. The simple key to a
strong, proud nation is the national revenue. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>D. If you again feel the need (as I hope you will not) to rebuild
your military, you will of course require strong revenues.</b> Some
American policy-makers apparently believe America's security depends on
keeping Russia weak, dependent and colonial; their bad advice may very
well have that end in view. I rather see America's interest in a
prosperous, friendly Russia, bound to us by mutual advantage, respect
and prosperity; a Russia whose people are too satisfied and fulfilled
at home to menace either their neighbors, or those who live on the
other side of the world, ten or twelve time zones away. Then you can
use those ample revenues to raise your own living standards, which for
too long have lagged behind other industrial nations; and to develop
and disseminate your wonderful cultural treasures for the benefit of
the world. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
I hope Russia will not merely match the West in the wisdom and
efficiency of its revenue system, but surpass us and set an example,
along the lines sketched out earlier, for the West to emulate. There is
scope for great improvement in Western revenue systems, some of which
have degenerated, and now approach becoming forms of state slavery. The
"leapfrog theory" of history, based on observation, has it that
relatively backward nations, when they stir themselves into forward
motion, do not just "catch up" with the leaders, but leap ahead of them
and become the new leaders. This is the destiny I see for Russia. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>E. Strong national revenues are required to unite Russia</b>, and
keep it one nation. Every nation's central government must first have
its own direct revenues; it cannot survive independently on
contributions from regional governments. Revenues are a direct link
between the nation and each individual taxpayer. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
Naturally, this relationship must not be one-sided and exploitative, or
it will stir up anger, hatred and discontent. The central government
must provide those selected public services that it can perform better
than local governments -services like national defense and regulating
interregional transportation, for example. Central government should
not preempt services that are better performed on a smaller scale, and
closer to the people, but "devolve" each function to the smallest
jurisdiction that is big enough for the job. There is a vast fund of
experience, and a dynamic, evolving literature on federalism to
acquaint you with the experience of the world on the particulars of
devolution. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
A key to national unity is the fair treatment of intergovernmental
relations and subventions, as between rich and poor regions, and cities
and subregions within regions. By "rich" I mean rich not in total, but
per capita. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It makes sense to adjust
tax rates so they are higher in the regions with higher resource values
per capita, and then distribute a national dividend on a simple per
capita basis</span>, in the manner that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Alaska </span>has made famous on the state
level. The dividend should be "portable," so it does not bind the
recipient, like a serf, to a particular place, nor induce people to
move to the wrong places. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
It is not wise to distribute central revenues to local units of
government as such, for at least two reasons. 
<ul>
  <li>One is that some local units, in bleak, poor and remote regions,
or mined-out regions, might better be allowed to expire peacefully as
their residents leave with their portable dividends. Many nations have
wasted great wealth subsidizing people to remain in obsolete locations
and industries that they would better abandon, both for their own and
the nation's welfare.</li>
  <li>The other reason is that some poor regions, like the American
State of New Mexico, or Canada's Prince Edward Island, are ruled by
small oligarchies of wealthy people who create their own region's
poverty by the extreme inequality of resource ownership. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It is folly to "tax poor people in rich
regions to subsidize a few rich people in poor regions," as often
occurs. </span></li>
</ul>
<b><a name="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</b> <br>
In summary, I have shown how a free market economy is compatible with
common property in land, through taxation; that the main taxable
surplus is the net product of land; that an effort to tax other bases
stifles much production while failing to collect the full surplus; that
untaxing labor is the key to making good jobs for all Russians; that
untaxing capital will reverse capital flight; and that an ample public
revenue is the master key to solving a host of problems that now seem
so menacing and intractable.<br>
