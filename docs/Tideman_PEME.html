<b><br>
</b>
<p>This paper argues that a liberal theory of the resolution of
disagreements about the requirements of justice must include the
possibility of secession. When such a possibility is allowed, it can
be predicted that there will be changes not only in the character of
disputes about the requirements of justice, but also in the patterns
of taxes and public expenditures. There will be a greater propensity
for seeing the other side's point of view in disputes about the
requirements of justice, and a greater tendency to support public
activities by efficient taxes on the beneficiaries of public
expenditures.</p>
<p>The paper begins with a discussion of the nature of moral truth,
its relation to scientific truth, and the way in which moral
knowledge grows. Next discussed is the difficulty of translating
moral knowledge into social institutions, arising from the
inevitability and impropriety of judging one's own cause. Ackerman's
"neutral dialogue" is endorsed as the most acceptable way of dealing
with this difficulty. But I suggest that in dialogues regarding the
requirements of justice there should be an understanding that one
possible outcome of the dialogue is failure to agree on mutually
acceptable conditions for being part of the same society, leading to
a parting of the ways. The conditions under which such a parting
would occur constitute the most fundamental question of justice. I
suggest that Ackerman's proposed condition of equal sharing of the
providence of nature (Ackerman's initial manna) among all generations
constitutes an appropriate basis for parting if agreement should be
impossible.</p>
<p>I argue that such an understanding of the possibility of secession
would provide a better framework for the growth of moral knowledge
than when the politically successful are able to preclude experiments
with alternative conceptions of justice. It would also reduce
opportunities for the politically adroit to exploit the less adroit.
If competition among societies for citizens resulted from the
possibility of secession, the competitive equilibrium would include
land value taxation.</p>
<p><a name="The Nature of Moral Truth and M"></a><b>The Nature of
Moral Truth and Moral Knowledge</b></p>
<p>Any society embodies shared moral convictions. The dominant shared
moral convictions of our own society are those of liberalism, which
has been defined as the effort to achieve "a political, legal, and
economic framework in which assent to one and the same set of
rationally justifiable principles [enables] those who espouse
widely different and incompatible conceptions of the good life for
human beings to live together peaceably within the same
society." </p>
<p>constitution, and has enjoyed growing success for more than two
centuries. </p>
<p>Moral frameworks such as liberalism have the character of
paradigms in science. A scientific paradigm is a set of axioms or
presuppositions, along with a cultural tradition within a community
of scientists, specifying how one identifies an interesting research
problem and how one decides whether a new claim qualifies as an
addition to knowledge. Similarly, liberalism embodies a set of
presuppositions ("We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal...") and a tradition regarding the way in which
new moral truths are identified and incorporated into the social
order.</p>
<p>My reference to new moral truths may seem incoherent. Isn't
morality just a matter of personal view? The philosopher Renford
Bambrough has offered the following proof of the possibility of moral
knowledge: "We know that this child, who is about to undergo what
would otherwise be painful surgery, should be given an anaesthetic
before the operation. Therefore we know that at least one moral
proposition is true."</p>
<p> Bambrough provided this example to
  show that a person who denies the possibility of moral truth denies
  platitudes that are as widely accepted as the proposition that
  physical objects exist. I accept Bambrough's view that moral
  propositions can be just as true as propositions about the physical
  world, but I deny his apparent assertion that we can have a basis for
  being completely confident that we will never revise a view that any
  particular proposition, of any sort, is true. Any understanding of
  what is true exists within a framework that entails presuppositions,
  which are often not even discerned until they are questioned, and
  when they are questioned it may seem inconceivable that they could be
  false.</p>
<p>For example, most of us, myself included, operate in our daily
lives on the basis of an unprovable presupposition that space-time
has a unique history, that there is always a unique answer to the
question, "What really happened?" We may find it impossible to
imagine having a basis for revising this presupposition, which is
involved in so much of the way we organize our understanding of our
existence. The degree of our commitment to this presupposition is
probably no less than that of nineteenth century physicist to the
(then unexamined) assumption that the mass of an object does not
depend on its velocity, which twentieth century physicists reject.
</p>
<p>We have neither the possibility nor the need for absolute
certainty. Thus the only possible operational meaning of "true" is
"belief that is justified within a framework shared by those engaged
in dialogue." However, it is an important part of human psychology
that we are consistently unaware of the presuppositions that give us
less than absolute certainty. This unawareness might even be
necessary to save us from doubt-induced immobility. Thus when we hear
someone assert that something is true, we generally understand him to
be asserting that he is offering a correct description of an aspect
of objective reality. "True" conveys this understanding of
"absolutely true" within a system, for persons who are not aware of
their presuppositions, while those who are aware of the
presuppositions of the system in which an assertion of truth is made
understand "truth" to mean "belief that is justified within the
system in which the asserter operates."</p>
<p>New moral truths, like new scientific truths, are propositions
that attain the status of being regarded as fully justified within
the community of those who share a given paradigm. The most
far-reaching new moral truths to have emerged from our commitment to
liberalism are that slavery is utterly wrong and that all persons
must be accorded the same civil and political rights, irrespective of
gender and race.</p>
<p>A very significant step in the incorporation of a newly discovered
moral truth into our social order is its embodiment into our
constitution. Mere legislation does not suffice to certify a moral
truth, for a reason articulated by Bruce Ackerman in an exegesis of
the views expressed by James Madison in Federalist
10<font size="-1"><b><i>3</i></b></font>. We understand that citizens
have too many other interests in life to attend to all the political
issues that arise. Therefore everyday politics is bound to be
dominated by a few people pursuing narrow interests. In the
constitution-writing process, on the other hand, the level of
involvement is sufficiently extensive and the level of consensus
required sufficiently great to permit those who succeed in having
their views incorporated into the constitution to say that they speak
for the whole nation. What is crucial, according to Madison, is not
that the letter of established constitutional procedures be followed,
but rather that the society be widely involved in discussions about
what is done. This was Madison's reason for arguing that the
constitution written in 1787 could be valid despite the fact that the
group who wrote it was not supposed to be writing a constitution.
Ackerman argues that the same reasoning applies to the seemingly
defective procedures by which the post-Civil War constitutional
amendments were forced through, and to the revision of the Supreme
Court's interpretation of the Constitution in the 1930's, under
Franklin Roosevelt's threat of court-packing. The standard
constitutional amendment process, of course, is designed to entail
the levels of involvement and consensus that permit the advocates of
a successful amendment to speak for the nation.</p>
<p>While the constitutional process succeeds in achieving a
substantial consensus about moral truths, it is not a perfect
process. Our constitutional reversal with respect to the prohibition
of alcohol is proof, if one were needed, that not every idea
incorporated into the constitution is an advance. The real truth of
any idea comes not from the fact that it is incorporated into a
constitution, but rather from the consensus that supports it. And in
the process by which a constitution evolves, there are often
substantial groups that feel extremely ill-treated. These groups can
attack the justice of any constitutional outcome on the ground that
those who favor the successful outcome are judging their own
cause.</p>
<p><a name="The Problem of Judging One's Ow"></a><b>The Problem of
Judging One's Own Cause</b></p>
<p>Concern for the inappropriateness of judging one's own cause has a
long history in political philosophy. Thus Thomas Hobbes says, "And
seeing every man is presumed to do all things in order to his own
benefit, no man is a fit arbitrator in his own
cause."<font size="-1"><b><i>4</i></b></font> John Locke says, "I
easily grant, that Civil Government is the proper Remedy for the
Inconveniences of the State of Nature, which must certainly be Great,
where Men may be Judges in their own Case, since 'tis easily to be
imagined, that he who was so unjust as to do his brother an Injury,
will scarce be so just as to condemn himself for
it."<font size="-1"><b><i>5 </i></b></font>Immanuel Kant says,
"...the people, under an existing civil constitution, has no longer
any right to judge how the constitution should be administered. For
if we suppose that it does have this right to judge and that it
disagrees with the judgement of the actual head of state, who is to
decide which side is right? Neither can act as judge of his own
cause."<font size="-1"><b><i> 6</i></b></font> In Federalist 10,
James Madison says, "No man is allowed to be a judge in his own
cause, because his interest would certainly bias his judgement, and,
not improbably, corrupt his
integrity."<font size="-1"><b><i>7</i></b></font></p>
<p>Among modern writers, recognition of the need to avoid the bias of
self-interested judgement is reflected in Rawls' assertion that
justice is described by what individuals would unanimously choose
from behind a "veil of ignorance," where they did not know their
particular circumstances.<font size="-1"><b><i>8</i></b></font>
Buchanan and Tullock employed a similar concept in their assertion
that desirable social institutions entail "conceptual
unanimity."<font size="-1"><b><i>9</i></b></font> But neither Rawls
nor Buchanan and Tullock address the practical question of what steps
are warranted in the face of an actual absence of unanimity. The work
of Buchanan and Tullock appears to be intended to be primarily
descriptive of what individuals will choose in specified
circumstances, rather than prescriptive of what ought to be chosen,
while that of Rawls is more clearly prescriptive, and thus seems to
invite the following interpretation: "This is what individuals would
agree to if they were not biased by self interest and knowledge of
their particular circumstances, so we are justified in imposing it on
them whether they agree to it or not." I do not believe that Rawls
actually thinks this; I would guess that his view is actually closer
to the following: "It is inevitable that democratic majorities will
impose their will on minorities. But people do have a moral sense.
And the framework I offer is one that can be commended to individuals
who wish to have their democratic actions informed by moral
considerations." </p>
<p>In commenting on Rawls, Kenneth Arrow has said,</p>
<blockquote>...if the specific application of the principles is judged
to be different according to different life experiences (and of course
different genetic experiences), even as between parent and child, then
the needed concordance of views may evaporate....To the extent that
individuals are really individual, each an autonomous end in himself,
to that extent they must be somewhat mysterious and inaccessible to
each other. There cannot be any rule that is completely acceptable to
all. There must, or so it now seems to me, be the possibility of
unadjudicated conflict, ...<font size="-1"><b><i>10</i></b></font></blockquote>
<p>This unadjudicated conflict leaves any constitution with an
imperfect claim for respect, as it is necessarily supported by
individuals who are judging their own cause. How are conflicting
claims about the constitutional requirements of justice then to be
resolved?</p>
<p><a name="Ackerman's Liberalism"></a><b>Ackerman's
Liberalism</b></p>
<p>One writer who has characterized liberal principles explicitly in
terms of the resolution of conflicts is Bruce Ackerman, in
"<b><i>Social Justice in the Liberal State</i></b>". Ackerman gives
his formulation for the foundation of the liberal state the name
"Neutrality." This is the principle that every holder of power must
be prepared to answer every challenge to his power with a rational,
consistent justification that does not assert either that his
conception of the good is better than that asserted by any of his
fellow citizens, or that he is intrinsically superior to any of his
fellow citizens.<font size="-1"><b><i>11</i></b></font> Ackerman
argues that adherence to the principle of Neutrality requires a
society in which each person starts his or her adult life with the
same material endowment with which others start their lives, apart
from compensation for genetic domination by others, and with an
education that provides a basis for self-definition. Ackerman goes on
to argue, in typical liberal fashion, that in pursuing one's
conception of the good life, one is free to interact with others in
whatever ways are mutually desired and do not interfere with
others.</p>
<p>The limits of individual self-definition are reached when one
comes to goods such as air quality, which can only be consumed
collectively.<font size="-1"><b><i>12 </i></b></font> But since no
individual can assert, within the constraints imposed by Neutrality,
that his conception of the proper trade-off between air quality and
other goods is superior to that proposed by any other person, liberal
principles come under tension. Ackerman makes two suggestions for
liberal ways of dealing with this tension. The first is what Ackerman
calls federalism (which would be more familiar to economists under
the name of the Tiebout solution): Let people sort themselves out
into groups that favor the same level of air quality and each have
the level they prefer. Ackerman recognizes that this solution is not
perfect, both because it is not possible for every option with
respect to provision of public goods to be offered, and because costs
of moving are significant. "Despite these serious imperfections,"
Ackerman says, "a federal regime is far better than some
all-or-nothing solution that would force all deviants to pay for a
collectively specified level of good air or force all
environmentalists to suffer with bad air merely because they cannot
transcend the organizational hurdles imposed upon them by an
individualistic property-holding
system."<font size="-1"><b><i>13</i></b></font></p>
<p>The other suggestion that Ackerman offers for dealing with
differing tastes for public goods is "Lindahl solutions," in which
people are called upon to pay for public goods in proportion to the
benefits they receive, though he recognizes that we do not possess
the means to implement this concept perfectly. Two chapters later,
Ackerman addresses the issue of how to resolve disagreements
regarding the best approximation to the liberal ideal when its
complete attainment is not
possible.<font size="-1"><b><i>14</i></b></font> Here he offers a
different pair of suggestions: majority rule (with any majority-rule
cycles that arise resolved by a random process), and the use of a
lottery to pick one of the suggested options.</p>
<p><a name="Secession as the Resolution of"></a><b>Secession as the
Resolution of Moral Disagreement</b></p>
<p>One area in which Ackerman does not entertain the possibility of
sustained, good-faith disagreement is in regard to what the liberal
ideal requires, though he does repeatedly contrast the results of his
analytical approach with those of contractarianism and
utilitarianism. Ackerman is disregarding a very significant question
here. Political dialogue presupposes some shared understandings, but
there is no way to predict in advance the places where the shared
understandings will end.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, that a child is born with a disorder that
will almost certainly kill him after a few very painful years. Should
the child's parents be allowed to subject the child at birth to the
least painful death that technology permits? I expect that there will
be people with different beliefs, each feeling very strongly that his
or her answer to this question is correct. Is there any reason for
believing that persons of goodwill will all reach the same conclusion
as to what the right answer to every such question is? And if
consensus cannot be attained, should the disputants be obliged to
resolve the question by majority rule or by lottery? There is another
way of dealing with disagreements about what justice requires, and
that is to allow for the possibility that the persons involved will
not in the end be parts of the same sovereign state.</p>
<p>The possibility that those who disagree about what justice
requires will not be part of the same sovereign state is already
allowed for to some extent in the liberal consensus that no state may
justifiably prevent its citizens from emigrating. (There is some
sentiment that young men subject to a military draft can be prevented
from emigrating, but even in this domain the U.S. was unwilling to make
a serious effort to prevent emigration during the Viet Nam
war.)</p>
<p>But why should the opportunity to register one's unwillingness to
be part of the same sovereign state be limited to emigration? Suppose
that, like Ackerman in his initial discussion, we were talking about
setting up rules for the settlement of a previously unsettled planet,
or suppose that we were talking about a fully claimed planet like our
own, and that there was no nation that was willing to tolerate the
behavior proposed by a minority-- perhaps the use of a drug such as
cocaine or caffeine. Why shouldn't the majority and the minority each
have their own sovereign state?</p>
<p>To some extent our federal system allows for just such a
possibility, in that such issues as whether public places must be
free of tobacco smoke are decided differently by different
jurisdictions. But when an issue arises that is so important to one
faction's sense of what justice requires that they cannot tolerate
being part of a sovereign state in which their view does not prevail
everywhere, then their only options are either emigration or an
unending effort to impose their view on the entire nation through
constitutional amendment. Is there never a time for an amicable
parting of ways?</p>
<p>There are several practical difficulties with secession as the
resolution of moral disagreement that need to be mentioned. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, as long as the world seems so hostile that defense against
foreign invasion is required, there will be efficiencies in defending
larger areas. </li>
  <li>Second, when sovereignty is fragmented, there will be a
temptation to levy taxes that will be paid predominantly by foreigners.
It was in response to the recognition of this that the U.S.
Constitution included a ban on taxes in interstate commerce. The same
impulse can be seen today in the desire of localities to impose taxes
on restaurant meals, backed up by the argument that a substantial
fraction of such a tax is paid by people from out of town. </li>
  <li>Third, if any partition were undertaken, there would be likely to
be numerous people who found themselves on the wrong side of the
dividing line, as happened so tragically when Pakistan was partitioned
from India.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will respond to these in order. As a general rule, apparent
efficiency is not a sufficient reason for imposing on people what
they do not want. While the efficiency of defending a larger area is
real, is not a sufficient reason for insisting that people be part of
the same sovereign state when some of them do not want that. The
temptation to levy taxes that will be paid by foreigners is somewhat
different. This would be an adequate reason for resisting the
secession of a group that occupied a crossroads in a sovereign
nation, but it would not be an adequate reason for resisting the
secession of a group that occupied some reasonably convex region on
the periphery of nation, such as the State of Maine.</p>
<p>Suppose then that it were proposed that Maine secede from the
nation. On what liberal ground might this be opposed? If it was only
a bare majority of the residents of Maine that wanted to secede, then
one could raise the objection that those who wanted to secede had no
right to impose costs of adjustment on those who did not want to
secede. While this argument carries some weight, it is not decisive,
because neither would the unionists have a right to impose their view
on the secessionists. The argument is a stand-off. What can be said
is that the greater the degree of consensus within a reasonably
convex, peripheral region that is contemplating secession, the harder
it is to justify opposition on grounds of adjustment costs. In the
limit of complete unanimity, the argument would carry no weight at
all. Thus liberal principles require that there be some conditions
under which secession is permitted.</p>
<p>Still, there are some secessions that could be opposed by a
liberal, even without adjustment costs. Suppose, for example, that
those who wanted to secede were a few persons who owned tens of
thousands of acres of virgin forest. A consistent liberal could argue
that there was something faulty about the process by which
individuals came to be regarded as the owners of a disproportionate
amount of what had been provided not by the effort of any person, but
by nature. Those who wish to secede can be obliged, in a liberal
framework, to insure that they do not claim a disproportionate share
of land and natural resources.</p>
<p>So suppose that those who wished to secede claimed no more land
and natural resources per capita than were available to others, but
they constituted a group that was distinctly more capable than
average. Could those who were left behind argue that this departure
of talent was unfair to them? They could not consistently oppose the
departure per se, as those of unusual talent would certainly be
permitted to emigrate rather than secede. But Ackerman argues that
genetic disadvantages must be offset by extra resources devoted to
education and by greater assigned shares of land and natural
resources. If this argument is accepted, it means only that an
unusually talented group that proposed to secede could be obliged to
accept smaller-than-average allotment of land and natural resources.
They could not be required to refrain entirely from seceding. At
worst, they might be so talented that awarding them even the smallest
portion of land and natural resources would be unfair to those left
behind. In that case the secessionists would still have a reasonable
claim to the chance to the use of some territory for their own
sovereign state if they were prepared to pay the less talented a fair
rent for its use. The superior talent of those who wish to secede
cannot bar their secession.</p>
<p>The result of the argument that secession must be possible in some
circumstances is that dialogue regarding the requirements of justice
takes on a new character. Instead of being limited to endless
dialogue, majority rule and random process as ways of resolving
disagreements about the requirements of justice, disputants have the
additional option of agreeing to disagree and go their separate ways.
This means first that a bound is placed on the harm that can be done
to those who might be dissatisfied with an outcome that emerges from
the process of constitutional evolution. Second, those who are able
to secure an outcome they desire within established procedures can
justly be somewhat less concerned about their inability to achieve
complete consensus, since those who are dissatisfied could secede if
they wished (though the substantial moving costs that would be
entailed imply that impositions would not be entirely
eliminated).</p>
<p>This also means that greater authority is given to whatever
emerges from the constitutional process. The effort to achieve a
consensus on the requirements of justice, and to forge a
correspondence between that consensus and a constitution, does not
terminate arbitrarily at the adoption of a constitution or amendment,
with a protesting minority completely vanquished. Instead, those who
are disappointed in the constitution-writing process have the
opportunity to give expression to their conception of justice in
their own sovereign state, to set an example or to learn over time
from the example of others.</p>
<p>Finally, the possibility of secession means that constitutional
dialogue would be reshaped. In view of the costs to all parties that
would be entailed by secession, the factions involved in a dispute
would have a greater incentive to strive for a general agreement than
when all the costs of disagreement can be predicted to fall on the
faction that loses in the constitution-writing process.</p>
<p>With respect to tax and expenditure decisions, politically active
special interests would face an important additional limitation in
their efforts to exploit the rest of the public: An exploited group
could secede. While the costs of secession would limit the use of
secession as a device for avoiding exploitation, the need to be
sensitive to this possibility would create pressure for
benefit-related taxation and for an efficient public sector. If
alternative states are viewed as competing for citizens, one can ask
what offers potential citizens would receive from states. The answer
from economic theory is that each citizen would be offered his
marginal product, plus the rent on the share of land and natural
resources to which the state would have a claim by virtue of his
citizenship. Competitive pressures would induce states to refrain
from taxing labor incomes, unless there were social costs associated
with the generation of income. Future capital accumulations would
similarly tend to escape taxation. Thus land, natural resources and
previously accumulated capital would be the only tax bases not
subject to erosion by competitive pressure.</p>
