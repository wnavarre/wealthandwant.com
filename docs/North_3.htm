<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">STARK WINTER</span><br>
  In the summer<br>
  I will sing of flowers<br>
  And fling pretty phrases<br>
  At the hearts <br>
  Of fair women.<br>
  <br>
  I will image palaces of hope<br>
  And social structures<br>
  Where human beings<br>
  Might live and strive<br>
  Without hate.<br>
  <br>
  In the summer<br>
  When the pulse throbs<br>
  Atune with earth's<br>
  Creative impulse.<br>
  In the winter<br>
  As thru a lense I see<br>
  Life's barbarities and superstitions<br>
  Focalized.<br>
  <br>
  I see broken lives,<br>
  Starving children,<br>
  Mortgaged homes;<br>
  Love lost or defiled<br>
  For profit or for bread;<br>
  Power's cruelty to the weak.<br>
  <br>
  I long for the summer<br>
  Of roses and hope,<br>
  But may the winter of reality<br>
  Ever stir me to act.<br>
  For only action<br>
  Brings the Ideal.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">WHO ARE THE STRONG?</span><br>
  <br>
  Is it Great to mulct the little,<br>
  Or Fine to cheat the poor?<br>
  Do the Strong oppress the lowly,<br>
  Wring taxes from the landless?<br>
  <br>
  Does Strength beat cripples,<br>
  Or Courage starve women?<br>
  Is it Masterful to strike the blind,<br>
  Or crush a weakling?<br>
  <br>
  Such is christian valor &#8212;<br>
  To hang the daring bandit,<br>
  Enrich and honor<br>
  The craven exploiter!<br>
  <br>
  We cripple the weak,<br>
  Trample the meek,<br>
  Despoil the ignorant<br>
  Starve the infant at birth.<br>
  <br>
  Even charity is graft.<br>
  And we boast<br>
  Of Strength and Courage!<br>
Who are the Strong?</p>
<p><br>
&nbsp;<br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">BE TRUTHFUL</span></p>
<p> Lie to others if you must &#8212;<br>
  To the jealous wife,<br>
  The importune creditor.<br>
  <br>
  It will save you <br>
  Much trouble<br>
  If you don't.<br>
  <br>
  But &#8212; if you must &#8212;<br>
  Lie to your tradesmen<br>
  And your mistress &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  Sell goods by lying,<br>
  Gain what you will<br>
  By falsehood &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  So wages the world.<br>
  Or appears to.<br>
  But &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  Tell yourself the truth.<br>
"I am a knave and a liar,"<br>
  Say often.<br>
  <br>
  Deceive others if you must,<br>
  Tho courage finds it seldom necessary &#8212;<br>
  But &#8212;<br>
  <br>
"I am a liar and a knave"<br>
  Say to yourself<br>
  Frequently.<br>
  <br>
  It is better not to lie<br>
  Very much. But &#8212;<br>
  Tell yourself the truth!<br>
  <br>
  No one is wholly<br>
  Truthful, in christendom &#8212;<br>
  But don't lie to yourself.<br>
  <br>
"I am a scoundrel" &#8212;<br>
  Say it often in secret.<br>
  You are!<br>
  <br>
  Who is not in christendom?<br>
  Don't lie <br>
  To yourself.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">BUSINESS<br>
  <br>
  </span>I am a business man.<br>
  I must cheat, haggle, exploit. <br>
  Ninety-five per cent of us fail<br>
  Because we cannot kill<br>
  All our human qualities<br>
  And remain to the end tricksters and brutes.<br>
  <br>
  I am a business man.<br>
  In my heart I loathe it.<br>
  Deep within me was a hunger<br>
  For life and love and friendship <br>
  That I have almost strangled.<br>
  <br>
  I am a business man. <br>
  Who has Succeeded!<br>
  After long years of bitter strife <br>
  And preying on the weak <br>
  I have won these Ashes.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">CULTURE<br>
  <br>
  </span>I am tired of art and beauty <br>
  And all their tinsel twaddle;<br>
  I am tired of logic and philosophy <br>
  And all their endless chatter; <br>
  I am heart-sick and soul-tired <br>
  Of Culture &#8212;<br>
  While a million children starve!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">BOTTOM FACTS</span> <br>
  <br>
  They seize the earth &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; its ore, coal, oil, and <br>
&nbsp; timber, hold the larger <br>
&nbsp; part idle and sell the <br>
&nbsp; product for what they <br>
&nbsp; please: that's the bottom<br>
&nbsp; fact of High Prices.<br>
  <br>
  They seize the earth &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; its unused fertile acres, <br>
&nbsp; and hold them out of use, <br>
&nbsp; which crowds the city <br>
&nbsp; with workers who must<br>
&nbsp; bid against each other for <br>
&nbsp; jobs: that's the bottom <br>
&nbsp; fact of Low Wages.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">I AM FREE</span><br>
  <br>
  I am free<br>
  To choose, sometimes,<br>
  Which master of the earth <br>
  I may elect to serve.<br>
  <br>
  I am free<br>
  To sell myself, if I can find a buyer, <br>
  For enough to feed <br>
  And clothe myself.<br>
  <br>
  I am free<br>
  To beg, or steal, if I can, <br>
  Or starve &#8212;<br>
  In a land glutted with wealth.<br>
  <br>
  I am free<br>
  To pinch and screw and save<br>
  And give the best energies of my life <br>
  Merely to gain a roof.<br>
  <br>
  I am free<br>
  To wander homeless<br>
  Over twenty-three hundred million acres mostly vacant, unused,<br>
  In search of a job.<br>
  <br>
  I am free<br>
  To push out a worker <br>
  And take a job<br>
  From one whose need may be greater than mine.<br>
  <br>
  I am free<br>
  To be a prostitute, beggar, thief,<br>
  Or to tramp with the disemployed.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  PREPAREDNESS <br>
  <br>
  Thieves go well armed. <br>
  Assassins, detectives <br>
  Manhunters<br>
  Must always be prepared <br>
  Against invasion &#8212;<br>
  A troublesome necessity <br>
  Of their calling.<br>
  <br>
  Houses that shelter <br>
  Stolen goods,<br>
  Houses that sell <br>
  Woman's bodies,<br>
  Homes of the insane,<br>
  Jails and penitentiaries<br>
  Need guns, bars, and guards <br>
  Violence always threatens.<br>
  <br>
  Homes of billionaires <br>
  Where are gathered<br>
  In monstrous superfluity <br>
  Wealth rended from <br>
  Countless broken lives<br>
  And homeless paupers &#8212;<br>
  Need a vast army <br>
  To protect them.<br>
  <br>
  Banks that hoard <br>
  Working capital <br>
  From tradesmen<br>
  Until their necessities <br>
  Wring blood usury<br>
  Need more than time locks <br>
  And steel vaults <br>
  To save them.<br>
  <br>
  Titles to idle acres, <br>
  Mortgages on homes, <br>
  The penal code,<br>
  Privileges and monopolies, <br>
  Sweatshops, <br>
  Slums<br>
  Gallows &#8212;<br>
  Need much "preparedness."<br>
  <br>
  The house of exploitation <br>
  Is safeguarded <br>
  By murder.<br>
  Despoliation fattens<br>
  On the war psychology. <br>
  Chains rattle<br>
  Above the roar<br>
  Of death machinery.<br>

  I am Palaver &#8212;<br>
  Of many aliases:<br>
  Security of the State, <br>
  National Honor, <br>
  Civilization, Humanity &#8212;<br>
  The spoken or written <br>
  Word, to which <br>
  The Individual<br>
  Is forever sacrificed <br>

  I am Cant the hypocrite, <br>
  Loved and feared <br>

  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">II</span><br>
  I am Patriotism &#8212;<br>
  Provincial and bigoted; <br>
  Hating all but my own, <br>
  Ready to persecute <br>
  And murder<br>
  For a word or a look<br>
  Alien to my understanding. <br>
  I am the little heart<br>
  And the narrow brain. <br>
  I am ignorance, creed, <br>
  And the church.<br>
  I am he who kills<br>
  And dies for Greed.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">III</span> <br>
  I am Profit &#8212;<br>
  The modern Moloch,<br>
  The western Juggernaut, <br>
  The only essential Individualist<br>
  The world has ever known. <br>
  For me all things exist <br>
  And all creatures. <br>
  On my altars <br>
  Are spread<br>
  The life of childhood,<br>
  The heart of manhood, <br>
  The souls of women.<br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">WE'RE GOING TO HANG A BOY IN CALIFORNIA<br>
  <br>
  </span>We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Twelve men, a regular physician, a schooled jurist, and a cityfull of
righteous people have condemned &#8212; a boy of eighteen.<br>
&nbsp; Whom the wisest of earth, its saviors, prophets, and sages, have refrained
from judging; whom the Central Figure of the era (in whose name the nations are
filled with temples) admonished the world to "Judge Not" &#8212; twelve men,
a regular physician, a schooled jurist, and a cityfull of righteous people have
not only judged but condemned &#8212; a boy of eighteen.<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Not in passion's blinding mists, or youth's high fever that riots thru
distended veins and over-throws the inner God.<br>
&nbsp; Not in lightning spur to lust of blood &#8212; the quick flowering of
an atavistic germ from cave and forest.<br>
&nbsp; Not for a sudden clot that bursts a tiny vein and floods a lobe and clouds
the mental vision.<br>
&nbsp; Not for a flashing impact on a nerve that reaches from the spleen and
dethrones the clay's master.<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; To uphold the majesty of the law, maintain the dignity of the State &#8212; a
boy of eighteen &#8212; to prove that California is an order-loving commonwealth.<br>
&nbsp; Three million people against a boy of eighteen. We will hang him to prove
our courage, our virtue, and our civilization.<br>
&nbsp; And the church of Jesus Christ is approvingly silent.<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; A jury, a doctor, and a "Daniel come to judgment" have condemned a boy &#8212; read
his heart, searched his soul, pierced the secret chambers of his mind, laid bare
the human ego, and found it all bad!<br>
&nbsp; A jury, a doctor of physics, and a Daniel, have measured the surging impulses
of hot youth, balanced the force of impact and impulsion, read the record of
the motor brain areas &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; And found the boy sane and bad &#8212; quite sane and all bad, and have
ordered him hanged.<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; We hope. The sentence may not stand &#8212; ah, well, we have had our
orgie.<br>
&nbsp; We have gloated at the spectacle in court.<br>
&nbsp; The mother moaned, the sister screamed, the boy was bold &#8212; then
cowed by the brave and manly judge, he trembled, hid his face in his hands, as
the fatal words of the learned judge fell &#8212; manly, learned, righteous judge &#8212; (I'd
rather be a wolf.)<br>
&nbsp; Tho the hangman be cheated, we have had our orgie.<br>
&nbsp; We have heard the mother moan, the sister scream, and seen the boy tremble!<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; A bad boy. Why is he bad, because he murdered? Then is he sane because
he murdered? Or did he murder because he was sane?<br>
&nbsp; Did the doctor measure the boy's sanity by his own? Would the doctor do
murder? Is it only fear of hanging that keeps the doctor from murdering? Then
the boy were a braver soul. If the doctor will consider why he would not murder,
he will reach a truer measure of the boy's sanity.<br>
&nbsp; If the doctor has a better test of sanity than murder is, he is wiser
than God.<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Unless the supreme court intervenes &#8212; or the governor.<br>
&nbsp; Why are we going to hang the boy? To show that murder is wrong? &#8212; but
we are going to murder him.&nbsp; Murder means killing. We are going to kill
the boy &#8212; we hope &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; We kill to show that killing is wrong. We are not only a brave people &#8212; three
million against one boy; we are also a sensible, rational, intelligent people.<br>
&nbsp; If it is wrong to kill, why do we kill?<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Eighteen years from God. Take him back, God, he's bad, all bad, not fit
to live with the three million inhabitants of California.<br>
&nbsp; Murder is right; we are going to murder a boy. <br>
&nbsp; It's the boy that's bad, not murder.<br>
&nbsp; Why is the boy bad? because he is sane; if he were not sane he would not
be bad and we would not hang him.<br>
&nbsp; Take him back, God &#8212; we reject him; he's all bad &#8212; a bad boy
not fit to live with us.<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Why are we going to hang him; because in a hot flash he did murder? O,
no; we are going to murder him &#8212; in cold blood &#8212; deliberately.<br>
&nbsp; Because he is sane? Many are sane and do murder and are not hanged &#8212; those
who murder scores for profit, in a cheaply protected mine drift, or because life-boats
are expensive.<br>
&nbsp; Because he is bad? Many bad people are not hanged. Because he is bad,
sane, and a murderer? Many have been all these and were not hanged.<br>
&nbsp; Why were they not hanged? Because they were very Wealthy!<br>
  <br>
  We're going to hang a boy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Because he is poor! His people haven't much money.<br>
&nbsp; If this bad, sane boy were the child of multi-millionaires do you think
he would have been sentenced to hang?<br>
&nbsp; If you do you are very guileless.<br>
&nbsp; If the boy's father were very rich he could have engaged the services
of a dozen eminent psychiatrists who would have testified (truthfully) that the
boy was insane.<br>
&nbsp; We are going to hang the boy because he is Poor!<br>

  <br>
  </span>Where are the women of California &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; The wise matrons, the honored sisters, the virtuous wives, and the enlightened
spinsters<br>
&nbsp; Who gained the ballot to uplift society? <br>
&nbsp; Where are the women milder and truer than men, of deeper impulse and wider
sympathy? <br>
&nbsp; Where are the enfranchised women, while the gallows is building<br>
&nbsp; On which to hang a boy?<br>
  <br>
  Where are the women of California &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; More humane and benign than men, with tendered sensibilities and nobler
purpose to humanize society, soften its barbarous customs and replace its ancient
cruelties with decenter statutes than those of fang and claw?<br>
&nbsp; Where is the gentler sex with purer love and higher instincts to lead
mankind from savage passions and primitive blood-lust?<br>
&nbsp; Doesn't it heal the dull stroke of the hammer in the old lumber room of
San Quentin?<br>
  <br>
  Where are the women of California &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; With the mother hunger for every mother's son in distress and hate for
none &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Who value the life of youth more than the jungle law of revenge?<br>
&nbsp; Where are the mothers whose ways are kinder and wiser than those of the
hangman?<br>
&nbsp; Where is the noble motherhood, the gentle sisterhood, the precious maternal
instinct &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Where do they hide that they cannot hear the building of the gallows on
which two sons of mothers are to be hanged?<br>
&nbsp; One of twenty-three and one of eighteen? <br>
&nbsp; Where are the million mothers of California?<br>
  <br>
  Where are the women of California &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Who will not hypocritically hide their lust of revenge<br>
&nbsp; By fatuously asking, What else can we do with a boy who kills another?<br>
&nbsp; Where are the women whose love for the unslain, and care for those who
have not killed, is stronger than their hate of a mentally weak boy?<br>
&nbsp; Where are the wise women of impersonal view who will discourage murder
by suppressing the state's example of murder? <br>
  Where are the women who loathe murder more than the blind victims thereof?<br>
  <br>
  Where are the women of California &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Whose finer feminine intuitions have raised them above the brute instincts
of men?<br>
&nbsp; Where are the women who will bring moral vigor to civilization and lure
us away from the fear and hate of cave days &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; The women less crude and cruel than the shrinking low-browed males of
California who have no shame to hang a boy?<br>
&nbsp; Where are the women, better than men, to save a boy from the gallows?<br>
  <br>
  Where are the women of California &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Whose sympathies are wider than their skirts &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Their mentalities stronger than their love of tango?<br>
&nbsp; Where are the women, the voting women, with mind and heart reaching beyond
the boundary each of her own little nest?<br>
&nbsp; A hundred real women could wipe the stigma of the public hangman off the
seal of the state.<br>
&nbsp; Where are the women of California!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">TWO IN A MILLION<br>
  <br>
  </span>Braver than soldiers stalking to kill &#8212;<br>
  Than heroes their own lives who take or give. <br>
  True as who live when death were easier. <br>
  Rash as those splendid gamblers <br>
  Throwing dice with the unknown <br>
  For gain of knowledge.<br>
  Bold as seekers for the Pole<br>
  Or the Congo's source &#8212; as those <br>
  Who dare the skiey whirlpools.<br>
  <br>
  These play for gain that is dross <br>
  To the mother's gain<br>
  Who pleads for the life of the boy <br>
  That slew her own.<br>
  These play for honors, excitement, <br>
  For gold. or for peace;<br>
  But what the widow's gain <br>
  Pleading for the life that<br>
  Killed her children's father?<br>
  <br>
  What have they braved?<br>
  The jeers of a hate-ridden world, <br>
  Contempt of the shallow and emotional <br>
  Alien to deep sympathy &#8212;<br>
  The sneers of the modern jungle<br>
  Whose denizens still proudly share <br>
  The passions and impulses <br>
  Of the wasp and the wolf.<br>
  <br>
  What have they dared?<br>
  To do what the pious preach <br>
  And never practise; to be<br>
  What sages admonish all to be<br>
  And few are; not to seek revenge.<br>
  They have honored their dear dead <br>
  By love complete<br>
  That leaves no room for hate.<br>
  <br>
  What is their courage?<br>
  To brave the contumely of lawyers <br>
  And judges &#8212;<br>
  The scorn of the self-righteous, <br>
  The abuse of that poverty-fear <br>
  Whose craven imbecility <br>
  Keeps the hangman's law<br>
  On the statutes of California.<br>
  <br>
  They have braved public opprobrium <br>
  And the ridicule of the smug. <br>
  From a thousand pulpits<br>
  They will be rated "sentimental." <br>
  They have braved<br>
  The orthodox church <br>
  And the harlot press.<br>
  <br>
  Their gain &#8212; if but the hope of gain <br>
  Can spur the heart and head <br>
  To act in concert &#8212; Their gain?<br>
  Who understand alone may know. <br>
  What light is to darkness, <br>
  And love is to hate, <br>
  Such is their gain.<br>
  <br>
  Daughters of the Newer Eve! <br>
  Yours the light what time Earth's gloom shall cleave? <br>
  Temptresses with riper fruit!<br>
  Yours the lure of men bold-hearted<br>
  In the long pursuit.<br>
  <br>
  Fair! ah, sisters fair! <br>
  'Tis men, not brutes,<br>
  Your "sacrosanct cajoleries" ensnare. <br>
  Nor man nor Superman <br>
  Might live to grieve<br>
  His "soul's enmeshment in your hair."<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">ONLY THE POOR</span><br>
  Only the poor we hang &#8212;<br>
  Never the rich!<br>
  Not all the poor we hang &#8212;<br>
  But none of the rich!<br>
  <br>
  Not for murder we hang &#8212;<br>
  And only the poor!<br>
  Many slay and are free, <br>
  But not the poor!<br>
  <br>
  To kill for profit,<br>
  Betray and debauch,<br>
  Are common things &#8212;<br>
  For the rich!<br>
  <br>
  The hangman guards <br>

  We hang only the poor &#8212;<br>
  Never the rich!<br>

  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">WE LOVE MURDER<br>
  <br>
  </span>We love murder &#8212;<br>
  And hate the man.<br>
  We gloat on the crime <br>
  And loathe the man.<br>
  <br>
  Our venom<br>
  We exhaust on the man &#8212;<br>
  And wallow exultant<br>
  In the shocking crime.<br>
  <br>
  Our jaded appetites<br>
  Morbidly revel in the details <br>
  Of the murder &#8212;<br>
  And shrink from the man.<br>
  <br>
  By press, code, gallows <br>
  We foster crime &#8212;<br>
  And hate men.<br>
  We love murder.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">IF HE WERE YOURS<br>
  <br>
  </span>Judge, if he were your boy, <br>
  Would you hang him?<br>
"The law" is two words &#8212; nothing more. <br>
  Those two words &#8212; of hate and revenge &#8212;<br>
  Are impotent without your interpretation. <br>
  You speak the word of death!<br>
  <br>
  Governor, if he were your boy<br>
  You would not sign that death warrant. <br>
  If he were the son of your old friend, <br>
  The son of your political manager,<br>
  The son of the woman you loved &#8212;<br>
  You would not sign the death warrant.<br>
  <br>
  Warden, if he were your son, <br>
  Would you hang him?<br>
  No; it is not "the law" that hangs him. <br>
  Only human beings can build a gallows, <br>
  March a boy or a man on it,<br>
  And spring the trap that hurls him Out.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">IF WE HATED MURDER<br>
  <br>
  </span>If we hated murder &#8212;<br>
  We would cease to encourage it;<br>
  Cease to feed it on Poverty, Hate, Fear; <br>
  Cease to breed it by gruesome spectacles <br>
  And inculcate it<br>
  By the subtle force of suggestion.<br>
  <br>
  If we intelligently discouraged murder &#8212;<br>
  Judges, detectives, sheriffs, keepers, lawyers <br>
  Would lose their jobs, dignities, salaries. <br>
  In every population are many,<br>
  Whose incomes depending on crime, <br>
  Are not interested to lessen murder.<br>
  <br>
  If we hated murder &#8212;<br>
  And thought hanging would lessen it <br>
  We would hang even the rich.&nbsp; Once <br>
  We hanged a man who had $75,000 &#8212;<br>
  But not until the last penny of it<br>
  Was gone for legal fees and expenses!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">YOUR BROTHER<br>
  <br>
  </span>If he were your brother <br>
  You'd go far <br>
  And do much<br>
  To cheat the gallows!<br>
  <br>
  If he were your brother, <br>
  Your neighbor, you kin, <br>
  Or your friend &#8212;<br>
  Would you cry "Hang him"?<br>
  <br>
  If he were your brother, <br>
  Your son, your father,<br>
  Your husband, or lover,<br>
  You would plead for his life!<br>
  <br>
  If he were your brother, <br>
  You would raise heaven <br>
  And earth to save him <br>
  From the gallows!<br>
  <br>
  He is<br>
  Your brother!!<br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">I WILL NOT FIGHT<br>
  <br>
  </span>I will not fight<br>
  To save for Wall street <br>
  The exclusive privilege<br>
  Of exploiting, degrading<br>
  The people of America &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  For a flag, for markets, for words <br>
  Like patriotism, prosperity, or<br>
  To keep the Japanese or any other people out. <br>
  There's room enough for the whole world of men.<br>
  <br>
  I will not fight<br>
  To perpetuate slavery &#8212;<br>
  But with a mighty battle<br>
  To open the land of America <br>
  To the dispossessed millions <br>
  Count me in to the end.<br>
