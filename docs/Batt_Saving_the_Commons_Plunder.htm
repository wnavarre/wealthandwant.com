<p><strong>Garrett Hardin's Lament</strong></p>
<p>    Forty years ago exactly,<em> Science Magazine</em> published ecologist Garrett
    Hardin's article, &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons,&quot; now perhaps the
    most widely cited and reprinted scientific piece ever.<em><strong>1</strong></em> As
    both history and parable, it purported to show how unattended and unprotected
    natural resources were
      exploited and ultimately destroyed by villagers. The context was 16th century
      Tudor England and the enclosure movement that drove peasants off the land
      into the cities and provided cheap labor for the ensuing industrial revolution. &#8220;The
      commons&#8221; was well understood as the shared land, usually pasture,
      that provided the space for grazing animals.<strong><em>2</em></strong> Hardin recounted in metaphoric terms
      an explanation of an ecological history of resource overshoot that has since
      been replicated countless times over.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">1 &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons,&quot; Garrett Hardin,

      2 After over half a century, the greatest single account of this period remains
      Karl Polanyi's book, <em>The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic
      Origins of our Time</em>. New York: Reinhart, 1944.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article resonated with a public newly awakening to environmental dangers &#8211; Rachel
  Carson's <em>Silent Spring<strong>3</strong></em> was published just six years
  earlier, and to the growing public fascination with economics &#8211; the Nobel
  prize in Economics was added the following year.<em><strong>4</strong></em> Hardin's
  article also offered, unintentionally, the perfect corroboration to neoclassical
  economics, which holds that the most
  stable, productive, and efficient market system is one in which resources
  are best protected by their privatization, and where the public sector, vulnerable
  to exploitation and abuse, should be reduced to a minimum.</p>
<blockquote>

        only in 1968, and many now believe this was a mistake. </font>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neoclassical economic theory holds that wealth is best produced by competing
  interests vying with one another in open markets,  prices then adjusting to
  supply and demand in ways that assure all participants and interests are served
  according to their enterprise and merit. It is a self-regulating equilibrium
  system assuming that human beings are wholly self-interested. One can trace
  its roots perhaps to the work of Bernard Mandeville, a Dutchman who wrote &#8220;The
  Fable of the Bees&#8221; in 1705, a notable piece of doggerel to test his English
  language prowess. It describes the division of labor of a hive, the efficiency
  and indeed the beauty by which its stability and continuance was assured. Adam
  Smith, intrigued and challenged by Mandeville's insight, incorporated this
  model of society in his 1776 work, <em>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes
  of the Wealth of Nations</em>, a work people know    today than
  by the phrase, &#8220;invisible hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mandeville, Smith, and Hardin have since been invoked to ratify the unfolding
  patterns of economic life, now more fervently than ever, as the apologists
  for privatization have continued their ascendancy and preeminence.<em><strong>5</strong></em> The
  unfolding and increasing pace of private capture of common wealth has left
  doubters
  and opponents today hard put to respond. The Chicago School economists' use
  of Hardin may have disturbed him, as he was alarmed by the growing neglect
  and privatization of the commons. </p>

<p><strong>The Modern Era of the Land Grab</strong></p>
<p>    The year 1776, you recall, also marks the severing relationship between
  America and Great Britain, and it was in here where the new economic
  ideas
      saw their strongest application. To John Locke, property
      meant  elements of nature
      with which
      one &#8220;mixed his labour,&#8221;<em><strong>6</strong></em> essentially
      tools, clothes, and armaments. But the idea took hold in America that land
      also might be
      owned as a commodity, just like a horse or a house. The founding fathers,
      to a man, all quickly took to buying and selling land for speculative gain,
      and if they weren't involved in land dealing, they were likely making money
      litigating it like  Patrick Henry and Abraham Lincoln. Robert Morris,
      one of the least scrupulous figures of the new Republic, wrote that &quot;everyone
      with spare cash invested in land.&#8221; The new Secretary of State, Timothy
      Pickering, told his sister in 1796. &#8220;All I am now worth was gained
      by speculation in land. In 1785 I purchased about twelve thousand acres
      in Pennsylvania which cost me about one shilling [about fifteen cents]
      in lawful
      money an acre. ... The lowest value of the worst tract is now not below
      two dollars an acre.&quot; <em><strong>7</strong></em> Tocqueville wrote
      that, &#8220;the European emigrant
      always lands, therefore, in a country that is but half full, and where
      hands are in demand; he becomes a workman in easy circumstances, his son
      goes to
      seek his fortune in unpeopled regions and becomes a rich landowner. The
      former amasses the capital which the latter invests.&#8221;<strong><em>8</em></strong> So,
      what Native Americans viewed as part of nature was quickly snatched up
      as property by western
      settlers, in what has been the greatest theft ever. New studies are now
      emerging about
      this era, and I predict that the impact of this research will be profound.<strong><em>9</em></strong></p>

<p>So began a view and practice which continues to this day, that speculating
  on the resources of nature is a wholly legitimate enterprise. A person today
  would think it strange not to be able to sell his home at a gain years after
  buying it, even though the building be largely depreciated. People see gains
  in land value as an assured way to &#8220;build equity.&#8221; The greatest
  fortunes of the 19th century were built on the capture and sale of natural
  resources, not only land but furs, lumber, coal, oil; even, for a time, slaves,
  that were viewed as much a part of nature as animals.<em><strong>10 </strong></em>It
  was easy to get rich harvesting the bounty of nature; costs of doing so involved
  mostly labor
  investment and a bit of capital. The sale price, driven by demand, might be
  many times as large. Consider how rich someone could become by striking oil;
  the only investment was the time involved in prospecting, and perhaps the expense
  of an oil derrick. Once found, it just gushed out of the earth and could be
  sold for whatever the market fetched. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Today many other elements of nature  command a market price,
  exploited under private auspices and title. Some minerals have incalculable
  value, uranium being just the best known. Consider also all the elements of
  the biota -- seeds, algae, topsoil, wild animals, domesticated breeds, various
  plants for food, medicine and beauty. When Jonas Salk identified the polio
  vaccine in 1955, he was interviewed shortly thereafter by Edward R. Murrow. &#8220;Who
  owns the patent on this vaccine?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Well,&#8221; Salk
  answered, no doubt taken aback by the question. &#8220;The people, I would
  say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?&#8221;<em><strong>11</strong></em> But
  less than two decades later things had changed. Close by here at the GE Global
  Research Center
  in Schenectady, Dr. A. M. Chakrabarty managed to genetically engineer
  an organism that could break down the crude oil at sites of spills. A patent
  was filed, and led to a court case that went all the way to the US Supreme
  Court.<em><strong>12 </strong></em>He won. Strains of rice and other grains
  that have been in the public domain for millennia are now being captured and
  successfully patented by corporations.
  A massive outcry has come, especially in developing nations like India, along
  with scientist Vandana Shiva's several books protesting such practices, with
  titles like <em>Biopiracy</em>, <em>Stolen Harvest</em>, and <em>Protect or
  Plunder?</em><strong><em>13</em></strong></p>

<p> We've
  typically thought of municipal water systems being part of the public domain,
  as well as that which our agricultural industry relies upon, as a &#8220;free
  good&#8221; from nature. But as it becomes more scarce, as aquifers drain,
  and as climate patterns become less predictable, water has become a commodity
  with a growing market price. Corporate interests have moved in to capture that
  resource for potential profit. It is not just the bottled water for sale; it
  is wholesale river systems, lakes, estuaries, and beaches. Boone Pickens is
  investing heavily in the arid regions of west Texas -- for the wind and aquifer
  potential it holds. Dozens of cities in the US have seen their municipal
  water supplies taken over by
  private
  industry.<em><strong>14 </strong></em>In
  the late '90s the water system of  Cochabamba, Bolivia, was privatized
  upon the insistence of the World Bank as a way for it to settle
  international
  debts. Urban riots ensued after the Bechtel Corporation tripled the price of
  water. Not only did the people refuse, the action ultimately brought down the
  government itself.<em><strong>15</strong></em> </p>

<p>We also hear that &#8220;The Public Owns the Airwaves.&#8221; But in fact
  the electromagnetic spectrum has been privately owned ever since 1928 when
  the radio corporations were freely given frequencies in exchange for a promise
  that the public interest would be served. Those frequencies have since been
  bought and sold among media conglomerates for millions! It is not the electronics
  in the station that explains their price; it is the monopoly ownership of those
  frequencies. As spectrum use changes from analog to digital signal, frequencies
  reclaimed or retained by the government are being auctioned off for a price,
  now to be owned as property much like earlier segments. Meanwhile, public
  expectations about media responsibility have largely fallen by the wayside,
  and spectrum
  owners are able to deploy those frequencies for radio, television, cell phone,
  and other uses with little oversight except as concerns technical efficiency.
  The Federal Communications Commission is viewed as industry-owned.</p>
<p>When natural resources come to have public utility and market value, private
  economic interests seek to confiscate them. When technology finds an application
  for them with commercial potential, pressures also grow for their privatization.
  This was even the case with oil, which was initially viewed as having no market
  potential at all. An interesting and revealing illustration of the confiscatory
  impulses of corporate powers is taking place with efforts to install free over-the-air
  Internet service (Wi-Fi) in several cities. Two or three years ago, the news
  media was abuzz with the number of places that were embarked on installing
  Wi-Fi that would be free to all the users within range. Albany was one of those
  cities. But, alas, the program to complete the service citywide has now been 
  scuttled.<em><strong>16</strong></em> What happened? </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">16 Ian Urbina, &#8220;Hopes for Wireless Cities Fade as Internet
        Providers Pull Out,&#8221; <em>New York Times</em>, March, 22, 2008.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies that originally agreed to provide such service under municipal contract,
  like Verizon, Earthlink, and others, decided that &#8220;the operations of
  the municipal Wi-Fi assets were no longer consistent with the company&#8217;s
  strategic direction.&#8221; So it looks like I will have to connect to the
  Internet through my Time-Warner Cable for about $50 a month. It could have
  been much cheaper, both for me and for the community. </p>
<p>We are now seeing the very air we breathe being auctioned off as private!
  New York State has made an alliance with other northeastern states in what
  is called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative &#8211; RGGI. Shortly, the &#8220;pollution
  rights&#8221; will be auctioned off to own or trade as property and for use
  as a dump for the effluents of utilities! The public will set the tolerance
  thresholds but rest assured there will soon be pressure to relax them. The
  so-called &#8220;cap and trade&#8221; system will let industries own, buy and
  sell the air as a commodity, limited only insofar as the public is able to
  police and control its use. Suppose the air has an impact on climate change,
  or on the acidity of rainfall, or on fauna and flora in other ways? Will the
  public have the political means and wherewithal to reign in those corporate
  powers that now have a financial interest to protect? Property rights, once
  granted, are hard to rescind or to limit.</p>
<p>There are many other elements of what arguably are the birthrights of all
  humanity, resources that by tradition and logic are best defined as &#8220;the
  commons&#8221; but have now been privatized that one wonders what is left.
  Journalist James Ridgeway's book,<em> It's All for Sale</em>,<strong><em>17</em></strong> lists
  elements of nature with market value that are now offered up for private bid.
  Among them are fresh
  water, fuels, metals, forests, fibers, fertilizers, foods, flowers, drugs,
  the sky, the oceans, biodiversity, and human beings themselves.  </p>

<p>There is no shortage of commentary about the privatization of the commons,
  most of which is a lament. It typically sees the transformation as one of private
  greed and power, the theft of what rightfully belongs to all of us. David Bollier,
  for example, titled his book, Silent Theft,<em><strong>18</strong></em> reflecting his view that the
  shift in ownership is not only unnoticed but pernicious. But his is a minority
  view;
  the dominant economic ideology now condones privatization as productive and
  efficient, therein serving a public interest, whereas the public realm is marginal
  and even parasitic.<em><strong>19</strong></em> It isn't just that the private sector is by its nature
  compelled to internalize gains and externalize losses, that it drives the economy
  in directions that serve power. It has now been shown that neoclassical economics
  actually violates the laws of physics!<em><strong>20</strong></em> Destructive as it is, viewing the
  world through this paradigm for a century is hard to overcome. </p>

<p><strong>Understanding Economic Rent</strong></p>
<p>Wherein arose the idea that pieces of nature should become owned? It can be
      traced, at least in theory, to Roman law, even though it was more often
  honored in the breech. Freehold title in land is a uniquely Western idea, even
  though
      it is now spreading worldwide. It was tempered initially by what is now
  known as Public Trust Doctrine, arising first in the Byzantine Empire in the
  sixth
      century. The law of trusts evolved from the Institutes of Justinian (535
      A.D.), a part of which reads, &#8220;By the law of nature these things
      are common to mankind: the air, running water, the sea and consequently
      the shores
      of the sea.&#8221; These allodial (i.e., granted by God) elements were
      by extension the equivalent of the later-day commons, which distinguished
      those
      things made by man and those made or granted by God. Legal tradition off
      and on has made use of this concept ever since, most recently this year
      in Vermont where water is now proposed as a public trust.<em><strong>21</strong></em> We have among
      our
      local colleagues one of the foremost US experts on public trust doctrine
      in attorney and news columnist Paul Bray.<em><strong>22</strong></em> But law has limited capacity
      to contain attacks on the public interest, important as it is. I believe
      pricing
      designs can be an equally powerful and complementary influence. The key,
      however, is in getting the prices right, which means getting the economics
      right. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>A far more reasonable and effective check on the avarice underlying privatization
  of the commons exists in the framework growing out of classical economics,
  the founder of which was the same Adam Smith noted earlier. As classical tradition
  evolved, from Smith and other Scottish moralists, through Thomas Malthus, David
  Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and finally with Henry George, the economy was based
  on three factors of production: land, labor and capital. Land meant &#8220;not
  merely the surface of the earth as distinguished from the water and the air,
  but the whole material universe outside of man himself.&#8221;<strong><em>23</em></strong> Land was its
  own factor category. Capital was defined as all the products of labor and land,
  essentially tools. The most significant point to make about land, however,
  is that it yields a continuing flow of ground rent, which reflects the vitality
  of economic enterprise of proximate locations. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">23 Henry George, <em>Progress and Poverty: An Inquiry into
          the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with Increase
          of Wealth: The Remedy</em>. 1879, and afterwards, p. 38</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rent, moreover, is a phenomenon not of any one site's activity but due rather
  to a total community's or region's market vitality. The market value of your
  plot is due mostly to the value and activity of your neighbors'. It was this
  insight that led Smith to conclude that &#8220;Ground-rents and the ordinary
  rent of land are . . . the species of revenue which can best bear to have a
  peculiar tax imposed on them.&quot;<strong><em>24</em></strong> Because the flow of rent is a continuing
  reflection of the economic activity of an area larger than a single site, it
  can't be eliminated or stemmed. Nor can it be shifted. But it can be recaptured
  in the form of a tax or capitalized in the exchange value of a parcel as a
  market price. It can also be captured in part through rent-seeking, a practice
  that reduces economic performance but is a high art of those looking to get
  something for nothing. But in any given area, and however it is cut up, the
  flow of rent is constant. Absent its being taxed or skimmed, the promise of
  a gain from capitalized parcel sites, or from any other element of &#8220;land&#8221; in
  the economy, speculative investment in titles all but guarantees an eventual
  increase in market return. The gain in market prices is a good bet due both
  to the demands of a growing population and economy and by speculative competition
  for titles. Leaving rent capitalized in property titles also makes their markets
  less liquid, thereby &#8220;gumming up the works&#8221; and making their performance
  less efficient. Recall that market economies are most productive when buyers
  and sellers are willing to make exchanges at any moment in time. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Failure to recapture the socially created ground rent by properly designed
  taxes leads by default to the inevitable growth in site values prompting &#8220;land
  grabs&#8221; that have been so evident in modern history. The word &#8220;land
  grab&#8221; has come to mean not just purchase of any element of nature that
  is arguably part of the commons; it means the wholesale privatization of resources
  by the most rapacious element of society. Contemporary neoclassical economic
  theory sanctions the notion that &#8220;greed is good,&#8221; that avarice
  leads to increased wealth and productivity, no matter its source. Classical
  economics at least rewarded a person for what he earned by his labor; neoclassical
  economics rewards unearned gains from rent captured from privatized titles
  of what had been part of the commons. Smith appreciated the significance of
  taxing land for how it tempered greed and protected and preserved the commons.
  Mill too saw that taxing land rent not only fostered a more productive economy;
  he also believed that it was far more just. &#8220;Landlords,&#8221; he observed, &#8220;grow
  richer in their sleep without working, risking or economizing. The increase
  in the value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,

<p>The transposition from classical to neoclassical economics was momentous.
  This paradigm shift from three factor economics &#8211; land, labor, and capital &#8211; to
  two-factor economics where land was conflated into capital, has allowed economic
  rent to be hidden so the owners of natural resources escape their full duty.
  I discussed this about a decade ago in an earlier presentation to Torch,<em><strong>26</strong></em>  and
  how this is arguably the greatest instance of corruption in American history.<em><strong>27</strong></em>  It
  was due, after all, to the blandishments of the wealthiest corporate powers
  in the country that the founders of the American Economics Association were
  persuaded to change their definitions and formulas so that they would henceforth
  be advantaged. The concept of rent in the century since has been all but eliminated
  from discussion in American neoclassical economics texts. Even calculating
  the amount of rent as an amount or as a percent of the GDP is impossible except
  as a plausible guess. Texts typically put it as about 1 percent of the GDP.<em><strong>28</strong></em></p>

<p>But that is far from the case. Although calculating rent in the American economy
    is impossible (due to the failure of our government to keep numbers properly),
    it is possible in Australia, and Professor Terry Dwyer, a Harvard-educated
    economist, has taken on this challenge for his native country. His analysis
    shows that economic rent is well over 30 percent of the Australian GDP, for
    real estate rent alone, ignoring other resource rents that exist.<em><strong>29</strong></em> &#8220;The
    'bottom line' reinforces the overall conclusion . . . that land-based tax revenues
    are indeed sufficient to allow total abolition of company and personal income
    tax. Further, to the extent that some taxes, such as rates, land tax, resource
    rent taxes and even part of income tax on land rents are already capitalized
    in lower market values for privately held land, the figures would tend to understate
    the capacity of land income to replace existing taxes.&#8221; I earlier explained
    how taxing rent would comport with all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory, how it would stem and reverse sprawl development,<em><strong>30</strong></em> and
    improve our society in many other ways.<em><strong>31</strong></em></p>

<p>Most of all, however, it is the moral argument that makes the recapture of
  socially created economic rent so compelling. First of all it removes the tax
  burden on that which we want and puts it on that which we eschew. In a word,
  it taxes bads, not goods, and taxes waste not work. Rent-seekers, like all
  those that speculate in resource gains, are freeloaders. John Houseman, an
  actor perhaps most widely known as Professor Kingsfield in the film and long-running
  television series, The Paper Chase, later became the pitchman for Smith Barney.
  In one advertisement, his tag line was &quot;They make money the old-fashioned
  way &#8212; they earn it.&quot; That is economic justice! In the tradition
  of classical economics, Thomas Paine put it this way: &#8220;Men did not make
  the earth... it is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth itself,
  that is individual property... Every proprietor owes to the community a ground
  rent for the land which he holds.&#8221;<strong><em>32</em></strong> Just possibly,
  our nation might have gone in this direction, and taxed rents instead of facilitating
  land grabs
  and speculation. Thomas Jefferson wavered in his view: &quot;The earth,&#8221; he
  said, &#8220;belongs in usufruct to the living; the dead have neither powers
  nor rights over it. The portion occupied by any individual ceases to be his
  when he himself ceases to be, and reverts to society.&quot;<strong><em>33</em></strong> Given the land
  grab fever of the era, the forces opposed to taxing rent were just too strong.
  Besides, economic theory, which always lags behind social reality, had not
  yet evolved as a coherent paradigm to make such arguments clear. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>As Jefferson understood them, usufructory titles are consistent with
    the idea of land rent. Property law abjures use of the word &quot;ownership&quot; in
    preference to the term &quot;bundle of rights,&quot; that lawyers talk about
    in enumerating the privileges attaching to locations.<em><strong>34</strong></em> The
    idea of &#8220;fee
    simple&#8221; title to real property is a misnomer; ownership is never absolute.
    Typically enumerated among the several contingent but partial rights that
    are linked to titles are the rights to sell, to mortgage, to bequeath, to
    lease,
    to use and occupy, to alter and install, and to subdivide and develop. Who
    has the right to ground rent is overlooked because it is an artifact of classical
    economic theory. But the power to recapture rent is an element of ownership
    that society should restore. </p>

<p><strong>A New Commons of Recaptured Rent</strong></p>
<p>    The second argument for recapturing rents is that it offers to us a way
  to maintain and recover the commons. The commons wouldn't necessarily be a
      collection of the world's or the nation's natural resources as earlier
      held, but it
      would be comparable inasmuch as the economic yield from those resources
      would be recaptured by the taxation of rent. There would be a public realm,
      a commonwealth!
      It would be the proper corrective to a contemporary economy that is distorted
      and debilitated. Rent, after all, is a central element of the commons;
      as I earlier noted it is socially created, and by rights it should be communally
      owned. Recapturing the socially created land rent would provide sufficient
      revenue to government that the support of public services would not be
      so
      precarious. The taxes on our labor and our goods that we often evade and
      abhor could be scuttled. The income that we garner would be based on our
      earnings, not on our pursuit of windfall gains, the &#8220;unearned increment&#8221; that
      Henry George talked about. Such tax regimes would be essentially painless.<em><strong>35</strong></em></p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that the economic rent generated by a nation's economy
  is as much as a third of its GDP, but a bit more elaboration of its elements
  could be helpful. We recognize first of all that natural resources generate
  rent that right now remains in the pockets of titleholders without regard to
  any merit on their part except by their having captured ownership. The manifold
  sources of rent-yielding resources is carefully enumerated in a new paper by
  Professor Mason Gaffney.<em><strong>36</strong></em> To those sensitized to the concept, sources yielding
  rent are readily apparent. Discounting inflation, and with a 5 percent return
  on principle, one wouldn't even need to capture all of it. </p>

  $140 to $280 billion annually beginning in the year 2010.<em><strong>37</strong></em> The
  total value of the spectrum may be worth $3 trillion, which could provide a
  rental yield
  of $150 billion annually.<em><strong>38</strong></em> The estimated rental
  value of the world market for water is in the neighborhood of $300 billion
  to $800 billion annually.<em><strong>39</strong></em>  Who knows what the total market value of land in the US is; the US Census of

<p>How simple is it in fact to institute a reform in tax regimes and in the economic
  design by which we live? Not hard, as it happens. Consider the way in which
  our present tax regimes are conceived. All tax revenue is drawn from one of
  three factors of production: land, labor, or capital. The price of labor is
  paid in wages; the price of capital is paid in interest, and the yield from
  land is paid in rent. What is involved is simply a tax shift; phasing out taxes
  on labor and capital and raising the taxes on sources that yield rents.<em><strong>40</strong></em> For
  real property this is already being done in many places worldwide, twenty cities
  in Pennsylvania alone.<em><strong>41</strong></em> The tax rate on improvements
  is reduced and the tax rate on the land values is increased in a revenue neutral
  schedule. The same
  shift could supplant sales and income taxes. How much rent to recapture is
  another question: left-wingers would take more for a larger role of government;
  right-wingers would capture less. </p>

<p>There has been a lot written recently about which elements of society are &#8220;free-riders,&#8221; and
    who is getting the &#8220;free lunch.&#8221;<strong><em>42</em></strong> Right
    now, by our failing to collect economic rent, the title holder to land gets
    the &#8220;Free Lunch.&#8221; It
    was Adam Smith, again, who reminded us that rent was the natural and just
    source of revenue. A century ago proponents included Tolstoy, Churchill,
    Sun Yat Sen,
    John Dewey, Bernard Shaw, Teddy Roosevelt, and Clarence Darrow. Recent supporters
    number Bill Buckley, Molly Ivins, Steve Moore, Ralph Nader, Michael Kinsley,
    Jack Kemp, and George Gilder. Those today don't always espouse their views
    very publicly or often, as they may not understand the philosophy in great
    depth. But they have said many good things about it. What promise it holds
    is due largely to computer power and available data that now makes possible
    demonstration of the merit and feasibility of an idea that has been on the &#8220;back
    burner&#8221; for a century. Success may depend in part upon the collection
    of good financial and statistical data.<em><strong>43</strong></em></p>

<p>The culmination of classical economic theory, defeated by its opponents just
    when it achieved full fruition and articulation, embodies an appreciation
  of a public realm, comparable to what existed in the pre-industrial era as &#8220;the
    commons.&#8221; At a time when neoclassical economics sees the greatest virtues
    in total privatization, classical economics now offers an opportunity to
    look once more at wisdom of the past. It is well expressed in a folk poem
    that is
    traceable at least to 1764:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>They hang the man and flog the woman<br>
      That steal the goose from off the common.<br>
      But let the greater villain loose<br>
      That steals the common from the goose.</em></p>
  <p><em>The law locks up the man or woman<br>
      Who steals the goose from off the common'<br>
      And geese will still a common lack<br>
      Till they go and steal it back.<strong>44</strong></em></p>
