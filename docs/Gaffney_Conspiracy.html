<center><b>Is There a Conspiracy in the Teaching of Economics and
History <br>
within the American Education System?</b></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;<i>An Interview with Mason Gaffney,
Author and Professor of Economics at the University of California,
Riverside</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By Adam Jon Monroe, Jr.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Professor Gaffney's book, <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html"><b><i>The Corruption of
Economics</i></b></a>, cowritten with Fred Harrison, was published in
1994 by Shepheard-Walwyn of London. Ordering information is available
at the website of <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/">The Robert Schalkenbach
Foundation</a> or at Dorothy's
Economic Justice Bookstore.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>The Progress Report</b> - In your
latest book, <b>The
Corruption of Economics</b>, you seem to be exposing an amazingly
deep and long-standing scandal around the study of economics within
the American education system. Sum it up for us. How, why and by whom
do you think the teaching of economics in America has been
corrupted?</p>
<p><b><i>Mason Gaffney</i></b> - Generically, it goes back thousands
of years: <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">every
system that divides mankind into rentiers and proles
requires a rationale.</span> Those with leisure have time and resources
to
provide it: sometimes directly, but usually through hired guns.</p>
<p>The need became more acute in the USA during and after the
Progressive Era, with its development of the secret ballot and direct
democracy. Voters could no longer be bought or intimidated directly;
they had to be brainwashed. The device used was to replace the older
Classical Political Economy (Quesnay, Adam Smith, Ricardo, Mill, and
Henry George) with "Neo-classical Economics," which blurred all
distinctions between producers and rentiers.</p>
<p>Henry George was the clear and present danger that triggered off
the work of early neo-classicals, especially in America, but also
around the world. He was not just an economic writer but a political
force. He was nearly elected mayor of New York, a key position in US
national politics. He communicated well with masses of people: a few
who understood his reasoning, and a mass who got the general idea and
resonated with his personality. He had an ethnic constituency, the
Irish-Americans of New York, who carried his ideas into the
Irish-English conflict, a springboard for a worldwide anti-colonial
movement. He and they carried his ideas into Vatican politics,
triggering off the 1891 Encyclical, "<i>Rerum Novarum</i>," a
defining turning point in the social action views of the Catholic
Church. His followers grew strong in the Radical wing of the Liberal
Party in England, had a deep influence on Edwardian politics,
culminating in the disempowerment of the House of Lords in 1911.</p>
<b>TPR </b>- So, it goes back farther than Henry George's
detractors. Who would you say was the first "professional"
economist?
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Thomas Malthus was perhaps the first person to
teach a subject of that name, although earlier writers, including
church writers, said a lot about it. Thomas Aquinas had been highly
influential; so had Aristotle.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - They were paid to keep
quiet about the land
question?</p>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - No more than anyone else. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">They lived in a
society dominated by landowners.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Adam Smith spent his
life on the
payroll of the Duke of Buccleuch, as tutor for His Grace's son.</span>
Landowners were so very secure, some of them could let their house
intellectuals tweak their noses with radical ideas - probably found
it entertaining. It was later, after universal manhood suffrage, that
the landowners got nasty and conspiratorial and defensive, and went
about brainwashing the electorate. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Ricardo and Von Thuenen were
independently wealthy, and could afford to indulge their passion for
ideas, objectively. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Mill was a prodigy who built an enormous
reputation, and had civil service tenure, before he ventured radical
ideas about land ownership. <br>
  </li>
  <li>A.R. Wallace, too, had a towering rep. as
a biologist before venturing into public policy. Had he not done so,
he would still be as famous as Darwin, as originally he was.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">All this time there was a large
majority of small intellects who
catered to the landed interest. </span>Nassau Senior was one. The
weight of
their numbers was enough to offset their mediocre attainments, and
cast Mill as an eccentric loner, an impractical ideal ist, as well as
a sissy who favored women's rights.&nbsp;<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span style="font-style: italic;">
- Do you believe this purchasing of economic
theory still going on today, and if so, what well-known economists do
you suspect of being involved with it?</span>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - It pervades the culture of the profession. Most
members are looking for grants and promotions to put frosting on
their cake. They call it, "Responding to the incentive structure,"
giggle nervously, and shuffle the blame onto "the system." They
abandon personal moral responsibility, and quickly become part of the
system themselves. They rationalize their own dereliction by
attacking those who expose it, turning themselves into a generation
of vipers. Grants come from those with money. Follow the money trail.
Most administrators are even worse: they push faculty members to get
outside grants, whatever the source. They only occasionally decline
one when faced with embarrassing publicity.</p>
<p>Look at the names and histories of major grantors and patrons of
the past: Stanford, Rockefeller, Russell Sage, Carnegie, Hewitt,
Cornell, Wharton ... Look at the governing boards of major private
and public institutions. It's all there to see, for those that have
eyes to see, minds to draw the obvious conclusions, and hearts to
carry on the good fight for the public interest. Upton Sinclair
spelled it out pretty well back in 1923 or so, in "<b><i>The Goose
Step: a Study of Education in America</i></b>".</p>
&lt;&gt;It's partly a matter of coopting people by dangling money
before
them, and partly a matter of selecting and supporting those whose
ideas are already more simpatico to the major grantors. It's hard to
tell the difference, so it's hard to say who's been corrupted, and
who corrupted himself at an early age.&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - How can my readers find out
if what you're
saying is really true? Name the most widely used economics textbooks
in American universities right now and what they teach that is an
obvious lie for the benefit of landed interests.</p>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - I no longer use textbooks much, but there are
dozens available for the more common courses. Some are less bad than
others.</p>
<p>Strategies change over time. It is no longer common to attack
George virulently, as was done in the period that my book covers,
1880-1930 or so. Today Georgism has receded as a political force, so
modern strategies are less frantic and overt. Today, they trivialize,
misrepresent, and brush off lightly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, Peter
Mieszkowski, Theodore Schultz,
and Edwin Mills, for example, casually pronounce that land rent is
only 5% or so of total income, so a single land tax could not support
government as we know it. They offer no support for this except to
echo each other, and to cite some transparently irrelevant data from
the US Dept. of Commerce. They are, tragically, encouraged in this
stratagem by work subsidized and influenced by the <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/Lincoln.html">Lincoln
Foundation</a>, an outfit originally funded to promote the ideas of
Henry
George, but soon coopted and diverted from its chartered purposes.
They simply ignore the few careful studies of the matter, as by<a
 href="../auth/Hudson.html">
Michael Hudson</a>, Allen Manvel, <a
 href="../auth/Gaffney.html">myself</a>, and<a
 href="../auth/Cord.html"> Steven Cord</a>,
that show much
higher figures.&nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><b>TPR</b> - Do you think the
public education system has
been 'corrupted' as well? Could you actually prove, somehow, that
Henry George should be better addressed in American history
books?
<p><b><i>MG </i></b>- I do not teach history, nor own any history
textbooks, but even when I was in high school in the 1930s, even
during the great depression when radicalism was in flower everywhere,
my history text and teacher passed over Henry George quickly, and
obviously with no understanding. In fact, the evasive, garbled,
confusing answers I got at that time were a major factor stimulating
my own study of George.</p>
<p>Parts of George got into the texts, but without credit.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We all
learned about the vast railroad land grants, for example - a scandal
first broken by George in his first book, 1871, "<b><i>Our Land and
Land Policy</i></b>."</li>
  <li>We learned about the effect of the frontier on
American character, a thesis that Frederick J. Turner cribbed from
George without credit.  </li>
  <li>We learned about the electoral reforms -
secret ballot, direct election of Senators, repeal of property
qualifications, open primaries, initiative and referendum and recall,
votes for women - without a word about George and his leadership
toward those reforms.  </li>
</ul>
No one told us, for example, that George
favored enfranchising women, and his enemies like F.Y. Edgeworth and
Vilfredo Pareto were male chauvinists of the most extreme kind. No
one revealed that Carrie Chapman Catt, who led the fight for women's
votes and then founded the League of Women Voters, ran in 1920 for
vice President, on the Single Tax ticket. No one told us that
Cleveland had a run of two single tax mayors, who lowered the
carfares to 3 cents. One of them, Tom Johnson, was earlier a US
Congressman; the other, Newton Baker, was a prominent member of
Woodrow Wilson's cabinet, along with three other single taxers. No
one told us that three of Wilson's closest advisers were single
taxers: Joseph Tumulty, Edward House, and George L. Record.
<p>All that interesting Georgist history is blanked out of most
history books. <br>
</p>
<b>TPR</b> - If what you're saying is
true, this is a
pretty big story; why aren't you doing this interview with Larry
King, or at least Geraldo? Do you think the press is getting paid
off, too or do you just need a better press agent?
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Once the public domain was handed over to a
handful of rich, politically connected people, they consolidated
their position by taking control of the media, of education, and the
churches. This has become so much a part of our being that people
hardly think about it, and what it implies. <b>No one needs to pay
off the press: in most cities, the biggest single downtown landowner
is the press itself. No one needs to pay off radio and TV stations:
their spectrum assignments are the basis of their being.</b></p>
<b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span style="font-style: italic;">
- How are sales of your book going?</span>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Fair, which is excellent compared to most
Georgist books. It's being translated into Russian and Spanish. It's
been reviewed in two major scholarly journals, a good sign.</p>
<b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span style="font-style: italic;">
- What about the screenplay? You're a
charismatic, underground, economic prophet; why don't you narrate a
documentary, do some interviews...</span>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - I'm willing.</p>
<b style="font-style: italic;">TPR </b><span
 style="font-style: italic;">- Would you wear a hidden camera and pull
a
20/20 on them?</span>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Spying is not my style, and it's not necessary:
corruption is out in the open. Go to any meeting of economists and
just listen with the inner ear. What's lacking is general sensitivity
to it as a problem.</p>
<b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span style="font-style: italic;">
- How far do you expect your book to go towards
exposing the scandal you suggest is going on?</span>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Only a little way. It's addressed to people
with some background in economics, and most of them are already
corrupted and/or coopted, in the manner I described earlier. I am
hoping that someone will take it as background, though, to justify a
more populist approach to stir up lots of concerned citizens.</p>
<p>The economics profession today has mostly retreated into obscure
irrelevancy, spinning out empty subtleties to boggle the mind and
keep students too busy to look at real social problems. It's become a
great financial burden on society, especially those who pay college
tuition. The numbers of majors keep falling away. At some point,
society will rebel, as it has in times past against theological
establishments that became arid, pedantic and too expensive. Then
there'll be a wide open opportunity for new ideas to arise outside of
academia.</p>
<b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span style="font-style: italic;">
- You are also a professor of economics at the
University of California, Riverside. Are you a popular professor or
do your students dread having to take your classes?</span>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - That's not for me to judge, but it's hard on
students to have one Prof. whose ideas do not blend easily with the
majority. The serious students are mostly serious about their future
careers, and shy away from those whom the other Profs. tell them are
eccentrics, or out of favor with future employers, or whatever. Even
in the 1960s, when we had a culture of rebelliousness and public
service among students, it was dominated by a kind of
anti-intellectual drop-out mentality that discouraged seri ous
thinking.</p>
<b>TPR</b> - Ever go to a kegger?
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Sure, but the level of discourse there is
pretty low.</p>
<b>TPR</b> - Do you try not to talk to
your students about
the corruption going on in the teaching of economics and history or
is there a "Corruption 101"?
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - I assign parts of the book now and then. It
tends to confuse many students. They are looking for certainty, and
authority, and simple formulae to learn for the exams. It takes a
mature student to learn the standard stuff, and at the same time
learn how it has been twisted to control his mind in certain
ways.</p>
<br>
<b>TPR</b> - What is their usual reaction? Are they shocked
by what's going on; do they think you're some kind of
conspiracy-theory kook; do they have trouble swallowing that the
teaching of economics has been intentionally manipulated to benefit
the rich few at the expense of the impoverished masses?
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - A substantial minority end up preferring George
to other leading economists. Some may do this to please the
instructor, and soon get over it.</p>
Some of them think of themselves as among the rich few. They know
when their special interests (or what they expect to inherit) are
being attacked, and they don't like it.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - How do you counter attacks
that classical
economic theory is old fashioned, out of date, no longer relevant in
our new, more complex global economy?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - If they produce specifics, then we have
something real to chew over, and the person is engaged, and we have a
good talk. I generally present George as one whose policy
prescription reconciles the grand dilemmas posed by the conventional
wisdom, and therefore highly relevant to whatever dilemma people
pose.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - If you were a student with
a 'corrupted'
professor today, what would you do, ask difficult questions, shut up
and get a good grade, form a student union, what's your advice?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - Every student has to play that one so as to
make peace with his inner morality. Jesus solved the problem by
earning his living as a carpenter. It's a hard row to hoe, being a
college professor and being known as a Georgist. It is harder than
ever now, for the supply of jobseekers is much greater than the
demand, docile foreigners are imported to beat down salaries and
discourage rebelliousness, etc. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
best way to advance today is to
major in math or stat, then switch over to econ and intimidate people
with your technical expertise and obscurity. In a small way, both Nic
Tideman and I did that, in our times. Once you get tenure that way,
you can relax and tell the truth without running.&nbsp;</span>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - What's it like on campus?
Do you think there
are professors or board members at your school that knowingly push a
'corrupted' version of the science of economics for money? Do you
poke fun at them or vice-versa? Any good stories?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - Poke fun? It's not funny. There are all kinds
of corruption. 
<ul>
  <li>There are physics Profs. who consult for nuclear
firms;  </li>
  <li>entomology Profs. who consult for pesticide firms;  </li>
  <li>Profs. of
medicine who switch mothers' eggs around;  </li>
  <li>Profs. of natural resource
economics who are promoted for protecting the privileges of water
hogs and land speculators;  </li>
  <li>Profs. of agronomy who tailor their work
to the needs of giant landowners; etc.  </li>
</ul>
They instinctively recognize
their common interest in corruption, and gang up on anyone who bucks
the system. They did gang up on my department, and tried to destroy
it. Failing that, they arranged to pack it with conventional
irrelevant theorists and give them control over hiring and
promotions.&lt;&gt;&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - Does UC let you teach
public finance?</p>
<p><b><i>MG </i></b>- Yes, curiously enough, but only at the
undergraduate level, and only to students previously brainwashed by
having to be screened through the conventional theory courses. Thanks
to such screening, the numbers and quality of our students keep
dropping.</p>
They called off the dogs after taking away my power to give
graduate degrees in resource economics. What ticked them off most was
my opposing a 1982 boondoggle proposal to waste taxpayer money
carrying water from 500 miles north of us to enrich a few gian t
speculators in desert areas of our semi-arid "Inland Empire." It was
even worse when my side won.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - What's your take on the
Pennsylvania story?
Are the landlords running scared from the new 'Whiskey Tax
Rebellion'?</p>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Pennsylvania allows its cities what is called
"local option" on property tax policy. This gives each city the
option of down-taxing buildings and up-taxing land. An accelerating
number of cities have chosen this option, the latest being
Allentown.</p>
<p>Landowners can't run, not without leaving their land behind; and
the idea is not to scare them, but show most of them they have more
to gain from un-taxing buildings than they lose from up-taxing land.
Un-taxing buildings encourages new building, with all the gains that
brings. When a city gets old and rundown, a lot of people get the
point.</p>
The opponents have several points from which to attack. Now they
are focusing on the State Legislature. As it happens, Harrisburg
itself is one of the cities that has adopted the option of
down-taxing buildings, and the good results may be seen by looking
out the window; but many legislators get their ideas and motivations
from elsewhere. The great danger to the movement in Pa. is that about
when half the cities will have chosen to down-tax buildings, the
legislature will follow the bad example of California and replace
the property tax by raising state income and sales taxes.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - What's your opinion of the
Multilateral
Agreement on Investment, to be signed this May?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - It's been derailed, I think, but will pop up
again. It's another effort to use the treaty power of the US
Constitution to overpower local democracy. It would jeopardize all
local authority over property taxation, and enhance the power of abse
ntee landowners to kill any local movement toward raising land
taxes.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - What is the real story
behind the stock market
'exuberance' these days? Does it have anything to do with corporate
globalization or the pending MAI?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - It's the market's recognition of the growing
power of corporations, their power to shed taxes and control
governments. This shows itself in many walks of life, including what
passes for the discipline of economics.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - So, if America were to
begin the transition to
sane economic reform, would there be some kind of breakdown? Are we
past the point of no return?</p>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - The point of "sane" reform is to avoid
breakdowns, not to trigger them. One of the many beauties of Georgist
reform is that it is non-catastrophic. It may be done incrementally
and piecemeal, at several levels of government, by degrees, using
existing institutions.</p>
&lt;&gt;A stock market collapse, should it occur, is not a "breakdown."
No
real values are destroyed; it is just a transfer of wealth from
present owners to all potential buyers, i.e. new savers.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - Explain exactly what would
happen if America
began shifting taxes off of everything else and onto land value.</p>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Exactly? The effects are too great, too
pervasive to predict exactly. </p>
<ul>
  <li>It would unleash massive forces of production, exchange, capital
formation, and building, forces now trapped and frustrated in the coils
of our complex, counterproductive tax mess. </li>
  <li>It would enhance the supply of goods and services while
simultaneously lowering taxes on the poor and the workers, thus
reconciling the needs of both efficiency and equity, in one stroke. </li>
  <li>It would raise taxes on the richest Americans, and alien
landowners, too, without diluting in the least their incentives to
work, to create capital, or to hire workers: it would actually fortify
those incentives. </li>
  <li>It would spring people loose to renew large parts of our older
cities, and rehab what they do not re place. </li>
  <li>It would let local school districts support education at much
higher levels than now, without fear of driving away business. </li>
  <li>It would satisfy the demand for housing on land that Nature
suited for housing, without invading flood plains, steep slopes, remote
deserts, and other places that cost society dearly to serve and rescue.
  </li>
  <li>It would raise the demand for labor, taking people off welfare
and keeping them out of jails.</li>
</ul>
One could go on at length, but Henry George summed it up in three
words: "<b>Association in Equality</b>." Civilization advances when
those conditions are met, and declines when they are denied. America
has been denying them; we are all paying the price.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - For an economics professor,
you're said to be
quite an expert on the environment, what's the connection?</p>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Economic analysis, properly used, can serve the
cause of environmentalism. The neo-classical economists abused both
economics and the environment badly, as a byproduct of their drive to
discredit classical political economy, and Henry George. John Bates
Clark wrote that land is not scarce, that mankind can convert capital
into land without limit, and create as much as we please. He wrote
that natural resources have no value to mankind until and unless they
are privatized; that privatization itself is what creates value. Our
universities churn out thousands of new economists yearly, imbued
with such attitudes. When Rachel Carson kicked off the new
environmentalism in 1962 with her "<b><i>Silent Spring,</i></b>" most
economists trashed or disdained her: they 'd been trained that
way.</p>
<p>Faced with the obvious growth of environmental sentiment,
economists dealt with it as they have with other problems: they
absorbed it in the discipline, then marginalized it. Now they can say
it is part of economics, while they proceed to ignore or trivialize
it in their major policy pronouncements, wherein endless territorial
expansion continues to be not just a goal, but a necessity to make
the system work.</p>
<p>The legitimate goals of environmentalists, they coopt and distort.
Here are two examples. </p>
<ul>
  <li>They'll tell you that it's not OK to promote oil conservation by
taxing withdrawals, but it is OK to do so by monopolizing the industry
- monopolists are our best friends. </li>
  <li>They'll tell you it's not OK to check polluters by taxing their
effluents, but it is OK to give them property rights to pollute, based
on past emissions, and then buy those rights back from them at their
price. You think I'm just making that up? I wish I were! The EPA is
actually applying that idea around the country. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you, John B. Clark; thank you, neo-classical economics. It
all follows from Clark's efforts to avoid any recognition that
natural resources are common property: in this case, the air itself
is turned into private property. Your very right to breathe, you have
to buy from major owners of the air. And how did they establish that
ownership? By their track records of dumping their crud in the air in
the past. It beggars belief, but there it is: it shows what the war
against Henry George has made of the discipline of economics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - If Earth's ecosystem and
poorest people will
be the largest beneficiaries of the reform you advocate, how will it
ever gain public acceptance in America's increasingly money-driven
political system? If the press will never acknowledge it and the
education system is so lost and blind, how can this reform ever
happen? Are Georgists like the character in 1984?</p>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - Every system must purify itself from time to
time, or be destroyed. How long that takes depends on how strong a
base you started from, and how strong your rivals are. The USA
started from a strong base, built in part by the Progressives
(including many Georgists) and the New Dealers (in spite of some of
their destructive moves). Now, our leaders think we are riding high,
just because the stock market is rising, even though real wage rates
have fallen for 25 years, our debts are staggering, our liabilities
and contingent liabilities exceed our assets, our biggest growth
industry is building jails, our population is losing its literacy,
our major cities have decayed, and so on. Marx was right about one
thing, at least: the system carries the seeds of its own
destruction.</p>
<p>Our leaders have done a good job of subverting our rivals, in part
by forcing on them the ideas of neo-classical economics, the ideas
that originated as part of the anti-Georgist campaigns. Japan gave us
a good run for a while, but got suckered into aping our worst habits,
and hence a good old-fashioned American-style land boom and bust that
has knocked them out of the race for a while. Most of S.E. Asia has
now followed suit.</p>
<p>It's a delicate balance. The haves can brainwash the have-nots
just so long, until reality breaks through, as in 1929. When it does,
you want to be ready with a plan tailored to the times, which
Georgists at that time were not. Meantime, we keep the idea alive by
recording and publicizing important facts, such as that the
prosperity of Hong Kong was a product of Georgist policies; likewise
that of Taipei, Sydney, Johannesburg, and other great cities. </p>
<ul>
  <li>We support object lessons like those in Allentown, Pa., and go
for a really visible one like Philadelphia. </li>
  <li>We combat moves to raise sales and income and payroll taxes, and
awaken people to the benefits of lowering them. </li>
  <li>We awaken people to the possibilities of including more land
income, and less payroll income, in the base of the income tax. </li>
  <li>We support efforts to democratize the media. </li>
  <li>We alert people to the corruption of academia and the kept
think-tanks, and provide alternative venues by mobilizing the resources
of the few Georgist-oriented foundations. </li>
  <li>We get on social action committees of various churches, and try
to give their well-meant but often foggy-minded efforts some clearer
focus, with more punch and less platitude. </li>
  <li>We remind people of their common rights, and the history of
common property in land. </li>
  <li>We expose and ridicule the inconsistencies and hypocrisies of
kept economists, hoping that embarrassment will convert those whom
truth will not.</li>
</ul>
<p>We avoid the temptation to play Jeremiah, but seek to join the
system and make it work better, even as Henry George and his friends
did.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - Do you think your phone is
tapped? Do men with
dark suits and perfect haircuts follow you around?</p>
<b><i>MG </i></b>- That did happen for a brief period, in 1982,
when I was leading the campaign (in my county) against a major
water-supply boondoggle, "The Peripheral Canal." It was then I
learned that the Metro Water District of Southern California (MWD)
is, for historical reasons, the center of the club of land
speculators.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - Do you ever have to use
karate?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - As a young man I thought I might, so I went out
for the wrestling squad in college - hated the smell of that gym, the
mat burns, the liniment, the dumb coach, the sadistic undercurrents -
but that's not how they work these days. They talk and conspire
behind your back. They attack your credentials, accuse you of letting
students hang around too long, of not cooperating with other
departments, of filing reports late, of alienating local businessmen
... anything they can dig up or invent, mostly invent, and they are
shameless about that. Bureaucratic infighting is the game, and
administrators rise by knowing the rules.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - Any death threats? Any hate
mail?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - Sorry, nothing so melodramatic. As I say, these
people work indirectly, mostly behind the scenes. When they come out
in the open it is with trumped-up charges, delivered by some
front-man, that give no clue as to who they are and what motivates
them. For example, I was on the city utility board, and tried to
change the rate structure so as to stop overcharging small businesses
and middle class homeowners for the benefit of giant businesses and
luxury homeowners in the hills, and land speculators in the boonies.
In response, they had their tools accuse me of missing meetings, and
revealing confidential personal matters. Both charges were lies,
which I demonstrated and documented, but the press paid no heed, and
went along with the plot. That's how they operate. The council
waffled by cutting my renewal term in half (to make sure I never got
seniority and the power of chairmanship). The university
administration played along by gutting the graduate program of the
whole department of economics, based entirely on the charge that our
student turnover rate was too slow. Again, I demonstrated and
documented that the charge was a lie, but the steamroller chugged
right on anyway, and the press played along. They didn't care about
the student turnover: something else was moving them.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - Do you ever feel frustrated
by the power of
the forces stacked against you or are you just glad to be part of the
solution rather than a 'liar for hire'?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - Both.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - So what do you do when
you're not exposing the
seedy underbelly of the American education system? Please don't say
snow skiing!</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - I am a family man who enjoys staying home. I
have given up most land-hogging recreation like golf; the most space
I use is playing tennis on free local courts. Jogging, hiking and
biking with my wife and children, vegetable gardening, reading ,
studying, fixing up the old house, these are my recreations. I have
six kids who come home a lot and keep me busy.&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - What's next for Mason
Gaffney? Do you want
Pete Wilson's job?</p>
<p><b><i>MG</i></b> - If they were giving it away, I'd take it - but
they aren't. I once filed for city council here, impulsively, seizing
a last minute opportunity when the incumbent bowed out suddenly. They
immediately bent the rules to let someone else file after the last
minute, and threw lots of money and newspaper support behind him. As
the saying goes, "If you want to know who's in charge here, just
start something." I didn't campaign; just wanted to see what would
happen. I lost: you do have to campaign, and make a career of it.
Someone has to do it, but it's not for me, at least not here, not
now, after Prop. 13 has tied the hands of local councils. Even before
Prop. 13, city councils have no power to change the property tax
base, which is defined by state law, and administered by county
officials.</p>
I decided I could be more productive writing books like the one
that caught your attention. I hope you are proving I made the right
choice.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - Well, I've read the book
and find it
positively inspirational, so I certainly couldn't say you should have
done something else! In your opinion, how is the Georgist movement
doing these days?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - It's pulling itself back together after a long
interlude of desuetude.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - How would you feel about
the formation of a
Georgist political party? Would you be a candidate, if asked?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - Circumstances alter cases.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - How do you like our
chances, Professor? Do you
think Earth is going to be a loser planet or will the good guys
somehow snatch victory from the jaws of defeat?</p>
<b><i>MG</i></b> - A bit of each. Keep hassling, and things will
be a bit better than if you gave up.<br>
&nbsp;
<p style="font-style: italic;"><b>TPR</b> - Thank you very much,
Professor Gaffney, for
everything.</p>
<p><b><i>MG </i></b>- Thank you.</p>
