<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Rent, the Whole Rent, and Nothing but the Rent</span><br>
by Fred E. Foldvary <br>
Senior Editor, <a href="http://www.progress.org/">The Progress Report</a><br>
</div>
<br>
Rent is the highest bid that a normal tenant would pay for the use of
land. Economists have divided the resources that go into production
into land, labor, and capital goods. The wealth that is produced is
distributed to the owners of these three "factors of production." That
portion that goes to landowners is rent.<br>
<br>
The meaning of rent as the return to land has been broadened in
economics and in popular use to including hiring any asset, such as
renting a car. But for economics, the term "rent" should strictly mean
the payment for the use only of land.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Tideman.html">Professor
Nicolaus Tideman</a> defines
rent more precisely as the "second highest bid for the use of land when
it is unimproved, when the user has an option on continued use into the
indefinite future." </span>In an ideal auction, we want the good to go
to the highest bidder but at the price set by the second-highest bid,
to avoid penalizing too-high bidding. In practice, if the folks who
want to rent land have no special emotional attachment to a site, then
the highest bids will be similar.<br>
<br>
Land includes all natural resources, including 
<ul>
  <li>the spatial surface of the earth,  </li>
  <li>material resources such as water and minerals,  </li>
  <li>the radio spectrum,  </li>
  <li>the atmosphere used for travel or as a dump,  </li>
  <li>all wildlife, and  </li>
  <li>the genetic information in living beings.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A tenant's payment for a site has two
components. </span><ul>
  <li>The pure land rent is the natural rent, the payment for the
resource as provided by nature.  </li>
  <li>The second component is a rental for the advantages of a site due
to the civic works. This is the infrastructure such as streets, parks,
utilities, security, schools, and the legal system which makes real
estate much more useful. This rental is really a return to capital
goods and labor services rather than land.</li>
</ul>
Real-estate land rent and rentals arise from the differing productivity
of various sites: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">rent is the
differential between the productivity of
a site relative to the least productive marginal sites</span>. This is
the
same as the "marginal product" of land as used in economics. Buying
land for speculation anticipating higher future rentals not paid for by
the landowner can induce higher prices for land that shifts the margin
to inferior lands, raising the rents on superior lands and lowering
wages set at the margin.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If we regard human beings as having
equal moral worth, then it is morally wrong for some to be masters and
others slaves.</span> Each person therefore has proper moral ownership
of his labor and wage. Such self-ownership does not extend to land, but
people may properly have individual rights to possess land, since this
is necessary for the application of labor, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it is efficient for land
to be under private title and control.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But it is not necessary for efficiency
for the pure land rent to belong
to the individual title holder.</span> Economists use the term
"economic rent"
for payments beyond what is needed to put a factor of production to
efficient use. Land rent is economic rent, since the land is already
there, and for real estate, the amount of land within some boundary
line is fixed. So when rent is used for the public finances, it does
not reduce the quantity of land. The rent will not be passed on to the
tenant, since the payment of the rent to a community does not change
the supply or demand for land.<br>
<br>
The use of rent for public revenues therefore has no excess burden, no
burden on society or the economy. Taxes on income, goods, and
transactions do have an excess burden, since by raising the price and
reducing the quantity of goods, resources do not get allocated to where
the people most want them. Taxes on labor and goods raise prices, while
rent-based payments do not affect the rent, and they lower the price of
land rather than raise it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is therefore the ideal source of
general public and community revenue. </span>Tax reform should
therefore shift to rent as the primary source of general funds.
Pollution charges can supplement the rent, and indeed can be considered
a rental charge for using and abusing the atmosphere, land, soil, and
other forms of land. There could also be user fees for services
specific to users, fines for violating traffic rules, and profits from
enterprises.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The economic rent from minerals,
water, and oil would be natural resource royalties that could be paid
by bidding for the rights to extract, from payments based on the amount
of mining, and the profits from the operations, depending on the
circumstances.</span><br>
<br>
When the civic works such as streets and security are provided by
private enterprise, whether it is a single owner of a shopping mall or
an association of owners as in a condominium, the rentals for these
works would be paid to the providers. Private communities can perform
all the civic functions of government, and usually do it more
efficiently. Networks and associations of private communities can
provide the public goods suitable for a large area.<br>
<br>
The philosophy and economics of using rent for community services and
sharing the rent equally is called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoism</span>."
The economist Henry George popularized this idea, so it has been called
"Georgism" after him, although the concept was proposed a hundred years
earlier by the French economists calling themselves the Physiocrats, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">physiocracy
meaning the rule of natural law</span>.
<ul>
  <li>Some geoists think that land rent belongs equally to members of
local or global communities, so it should be distributed to the
residents in equal shares as a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">citizens'
dividend</span>" to spend on personal or civic services as the
individuals choose. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Other geoists think that all the natural rent and the rentals due
to government civic works and services should be the "single tax" spent
primarily on governance and public goods, with any remaining revenues
distributed as dividends. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Anarchist geoists consider the rent and civic rentals as the best
source of community revenue, but only among those who choose to belong
to such a community network.</li>
</ul>
The implementation of geoism can take various forms. Whichever
implementation you prefer, rent and rentals are important concepts that
are not given enough attention in conventional economic texts and in
political dialogues. The public and community collection of rent puts
land at its most productive use, maximizing the wages of workers while
minimizing sprawl as well as boom/bust cycles. We need to understand
rent to fully understand the market process and the cause and remedy of
many of today's social problems.<br>
