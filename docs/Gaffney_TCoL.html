<center><b> The Taxable Capacity of Land</b>
<p>&nbsp;Mason Gaffney</p>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;[Published in Patricia Salkin,
1993. <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Land Value
Taxation</span>. Albany, N.Y.: Government Law Center, Albany Law
School, pp.
59-82, with the addition of a Figure 1, facing Table 1. ]</p>
<p><b>The question I am assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;The universal state and local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He keeps repeating we
must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;There is the answer to Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Most California land, on the other hand, is now taxed at
well below the allowable max of 1%</b>. <b>Speculators may sit on it
at little tax cost, however many highways and water and sewer lines
run to and past it, however many policemen are guarding it from
trespass.</b> Little wonder that California enterprise, once so
dynamic, flexible, and vital, is giving way to stasis and decay. We
used to lead the nation in making jobs; now in losing them. We used
to lead in school quality; now in jail population.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you tax land,
the market moves each owner to join it with labor and capital as a
vehicle for enterprise or shelter.</span>  </li>
  <li>When you untax it, the market
moves each owner to hold it more passively and obstructively as a
"store of value," like a dog burying a bone. The market not only
moves the sitting owners, it moves ownership itself to new owners
whose needs are compatible with the tax system you impose.</li>

<p><b>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The property tax,
rather than "shoot anything that
moves," is a charge on inactivity.</span></b> It taxes both lands and
buildings on their market value, regardless of how they are used.
"Hold on," you might say, "how about the very activity of
constructing those buildings?" Yes, touch&eacute;, the property tax
does shoot at that, and shoot hard. However, that is why we are here
today, to consider modifying the tax to exempt buildings. The
proposal is to make it a tax mainly, or even purely, on "land ex
buildings," a tax on inactivity, a tax just for sitting on a piece
carved from the world's fixed, limited land supply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Hold on again," I have heard, "how much revenue can land
yield by itself?" It is my job to address that. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I assure you it
can
yield more than local governments need.</span> I have already pointed
out
you can raise the rate to any level without fear of driving away
jobs, capital, people, or building. That is a remarkable quality in a
tax, especially one as progressive as the land tax. I will also
support the point in several other ways.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;The taxable capacity of land is camouflaged in our times
by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a consistent modern
tendency to underassess it, relative to
buildings.</span> There are several studies in point. The most general
one
is the quinquennial Report of the U.S. Census of Governments. It
actually understates the tendency a lot, by omitting the class of
land most underassessed, that is, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">raw acreage in and near
cities.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;There is great latitude in the assessment process. This
latitude is now used to lower the fraction of the property tax base
that is listed as land value, and raise the fraction that is listed
as building value. It could just as well be used the other way, and
used to be in many cities, whenever assessors were getting that
message through the election returns. This would have roughly the
same effect as going to a two-rate system on a more formal basis --
except, obviously, that the formal basis is more permanent, reliable,
and generally respectable. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I have here data (Gaffney, 1970, submitted herewith) I worked
up in Milwaukee from 1969 data indicating that, if land were assessed
correctly, the land fraction of the real estate tax base would be
over twice what the City Assessor reported. His fraction was 31%; it
should have been 70%. &nbsp;</b></p>
<p>How does one come to so startling a finding? Wisconsin is not a
backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
administration. <b>What I did was study sites on the eve of
demolition.</b> When you buy an old junker to tear down and replace
with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that
the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the
land. However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the
building was worth about three times as much as the land, just before
tear-down. That is a good way to measure to what extent land is
underassessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan. When the visitor first gapes at its
skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you
poke around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the
exception. Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of
it tumbledown, commanding rents mainly for their location value.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Check the Empire State Building. Old as it is, it is
still nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is
in a so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the
<a name="100% location"></a>100% location (57th Street, I would
guess). Even so, when the site and the building sold in separate
transactions a few years ago, the site represented 1/3 of the total
value. What does that say about the land fraction on neighboring
parcels, covered only with the remains of ordinary old structures?
What does that say about the land fraction nearer the 100% location?
</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;Besides that, exempting buildings from the property tax will
raise the value of the land that goes with them. When you exempt
buildings and uptax land, you are still taxing the same parcel of
real estate, you are just taxing it in a different way. What you
don't get from the building you can now get from the land, whose
taxable capacity is enhanced by your exempting the building, and all
potential future buildings, on the parcel. The process of arbitrage,
the higgling of the land market, should make the land value rise by
about the amount of the discounted present value of the building
taxes abated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;How much is that? Take a property tax rate at 2% of the
market value of a new building. Over fifty years, tax payments add up
to 100% of the original value. That's a lot. To be sure, we must
correct for the "time value of money," and discount those future
payments to the present. We must adjust for the anticipated drop in
the building assessment after 20 years or so. Doing so brings that
100% down to about 30%, more or less, depending on your discount
rate.<b> Thus, the impact of a 2% property tax on a new structure is
about the same as a 30% building permit fee levied once, at the time
of building.</b> Ouch! Remove that tax threat and buyers will be
willing, if they must, to bid that much more for the land underneath.
If they must? They must: competition and arbitrage see to that. Land
is fixed, but Capital flows like liquid or gas. It abhors a vacuum,
and rushes into new chances. To seize this one, the investors must
bid for land in the subject jurisdiction. <b>Collectively they bid
land up, fortifying your land tax base.</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Please understand, the proposed tax change will not
produce an untempered rise of land prices. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxing land at a higher
rate balances and offsets the effect of exempting buildings. It tends
to lower land prices,</span> just as untaxing buildings tends to raise
them.
On balance, however, the positive effects on land prices will
outweigh the negative ones, because of the constructive incentive
effects of changing the tax base to land. Read on.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;"What, then, will have changed?", you might be asking. It's
a fair question. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What's changed is
that your property tax is no
longer biased against renewal, against replacement of old by new</span>.
Neither is it biased against full development of the economic
capacity of each site. All the ground rents that are now aborted by
deferral of renewal, and by underdevelopment, will be generated by
new, full development. Land prices, your new tax base, will be pushed
up just by the expectation of new buildings' being tax free. The mere
expectation will immediately boost the value of land, your new city
tax base, even before the new buildings go up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, Pittsburgh in 1980 downtaxed its buildings and
uptaxed its land, and is fiscally very sound, much more so than
bleeding California. It is raising revenue and also attracting
capital: a nice combination. At the very same time the Mayor of
desperate Philadelphia, clueless and unavailing, is telling the world
he cannot raise taxes because everyone would leave the city! You can
peer south across the line better than he, apparently, can look west
on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. You, by observing and thinking, can
benefit from Pittsburgh's example, and Philadelphia's folly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>"How about corporate stock?", I hear. "Should we exempt
corporate wealth from the property tax?" Actually, almost all
jurisdictions already exempt stock and all other "intangible"
property. Not to worry, however, you tax corporate assets. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When you
rank property owners by value of holdings, the top ten on most tax
rolls are all corporations. </span>None of their multi-national
profit-shifting through layered ownership of foreign subs, and
creative transfer pricing, can hide their taxable property on your
assessor's maps. This makes sense anyway. Why should you think you
can tax a corporation for its business in Malaysia? What concerns you
is its property in your town.</b></p>
<p>"Wait another minute," I hear. "Some corporations build bright new
plants in cow pastures, with a high fraction of building value. If
you exempt buildings, you let them off easy." There are cases in
point, I concede, like the blue-collar industrial suburbs of Cudahy
and South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Probably you could have said that in
Amsterdam, N.Y., when the rug industry was thriving there.
Amsterdam's fate, however, draws a moral about that. An industry that
depends on your land, your location, is likely to stay put; but an
industry that brings in most of its own assets, in the form of
capital, is mobile. What it brought in it can take out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Take out buildings? Be serious!" you may say. Buildings
look rooted to the spot, but that is illusory: those roots are
temporary. Buildings depreciate. They may be milked through
undermaintenance, and the <b>capital consumption allowances
(CCAs)</b> reinvested elsewhere. After a few years the plant is an
empty shell. They close it, flat-bed the equipment, and silently
steal away. If they really need nothing but a cow pasture, they can
find ten thousand others, anywhere, and reinvest their CCAs there.
You are wise not to tax such plants out of town. You need them, but
they can take their capital to greener pastures. Capital is mobile,
both coming and going. Only land stays put.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>In other cases, industries occupy land of high value that
is wrongly assessed low simply because industry occupies it, and it
has not been subdivided. What has subdivision to do with it? The bias
of assessors is to value industrial "acreage" low, relative to
improved "lots," even though they lie cheek by jowl. It is a kind of
wholesale discount for owners of "raw" (undivided) tracts.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;For example, in West Allis, Wisconsin, the southwest corner
of the Allis-Chalmers plant occupies the northeast corner of the
<a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_capacity_of_la.htm#100%%20location">100%
location</a>, the most valuable
commercial site in town. That land, with the same retail potential as
the other three corners, is assessed as raw industrial acreage, as
though it were in the boonies, with no recognition of its high
location value for retail/office use. To make a land tax work, the
assessor must be reinstructed to value that land at its highest and
best use rather than as ordinary raw acreage. Exempting buildings
would create the necessary pressure, thus solving the very problem
that otherwise might be taken as a point against it. As noted
earlier, the U.S. Census of Governments gives us no data on this
point. You, however, can find it easily enough: tax assessments are
public records, and you know your own town.</p>
<p>In still other cases "industry" surrounds and intersperses itself
with vast swaths of vacant land. They hold it for open storage,
parking, purported "future expansion," accessways, buffers, backlots,
discouragement of competitors, etc. Many of Los Angeles' swankiest
buildings of today arose over the former surplus lands of the cinema
industry, which disgorged them before 1978 because they used to have
to pay substantial taxes on surplus lands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Corporate" is not coterminous with "industrial," anyway.
Many corporations are in retailing. They own chain stores, malls,
gasoline stations, auto dealerships, major real estate
"developments," drive-ins, office space, department stores, banks,
"power centers," etc. As to these, shifting to the land basis will
shift more of the tax burden to them, because retailing has a higher<a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/LSREV.html">
land fraction</a> than any other major land use (except vacant, golf
courses, cemeteries, parking lots, etc.). <b>That is because location
is more critical to retailers than other businesses. You can tell
this by their high rate of tear-downs and remodeling.</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Among its other effects, site-value taxation will induce
some land to shift from retail to industrial use.</b> Recall that
exempting the building, or prospective building, lets buyers bid more
for land. The higher the building fraction, the stronger is that
force. Thus the present system, which is biased against buildings
generally, is biased against industrial compared with retail uses.
Removing that bias will help industry outbid retail for land -- not
all land, of course, but land on the tipping point between the uses.
Most towns today seem oversupplied with retailers, compared with
their shortage of basic industries. Shifting to the site-value basis
of property taxation helps redress that balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Let the market decide," some say. "No good can come from
forcing land into use, against the owner's private judgment."
Actually,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> the proposal to exempt
buildings and focus property taxes
on site values is premised on the market concept of consumer
sovereignty;</span> it's the present property tax that isn't. The case
may
be summed up like this: if the tax on a parcel varies with the use of
the parcel, then the tax biases choices against the use more
taxed.<b> Economists call the land tax "neutral," for that very
reason: it does not vary with use.</b> It does not bias the choice of
uses; the consumer sovereign prevails. "No other tax can make that
statement."</p>
<p>&nbsp;I do not view that as saying we should throw away other
social controls over land use. I have written a short piece,
"<b><i>Land Planning and the Property Tax</i></b>," showing how land
taxation strengthens the hand of planners and helps them and the
market work together. There are a few libertarians who would
terminate city planning altogether, but that is pretty extreme, and
not the proposal we should be considering here today. Rather, let us
consider a measured proposal, an incremental change within the
framework of present law and custom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Hold on once more," I hear, "not so fast, <b>how about the
mansions of rich people?</b>" Another fair question: how, indeed, can
you justify exempting them from taxation? The answer may astonish
you. Here are some data from British Columbia that speak to the
point. They are from the area around Vancouver (The "Lower Mainland")
and the southern part of Vancouver Island, around Victoria, where
over half the people in the province live. B.C. practices high
quality professional assessment; data from its rolls are quite
reliable, as such things go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cities and districts around Vancouver and Victoria are
ranked, in<a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_capacity_of_la.htm#TABLE%201:%20%20Land%20Values%20%28LV%29%20per">
Table 1</a>,
according to the land value per property (single-family residences).
These range from nearly $700,000 each in the "University Endowment
Lands" district (very posh), to around $40,000 each in the "Victoria
Rural" district (more modest). The last column, LSREV (Land Share of
Real Estate Value), shows the land value (L) as a share of the total
value (B+L).</p>

&nbsp;These shares range from a high of 80% on the<b> University
Endowment Lands (UEL)</b> down to 38% in Colwood (the lowest), and
39% in Victoria Rural (next to lowest). In between, the numbers
follow the trend closely. The dearer the land parcels, the higher is
the "land fraction" (the fraction of total real estate value that is
land value). From such data, one might formulate a rule along the
lines that "the lot value increases with the square of the house
value." It is hard to be so precise, and not necessary. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The relevant
rule we need here is just that people's house values are more alike
than their lot values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
lot value, more than house value, that
divides the rich from the poor.</span></span></p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;The average <span style="font-weight: bold;">house (ex
land)</span> in the posh UEL jurisdiction
is worth <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.8 time</span>s the average
in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($173.1/$61.9).  </li>
  <li>The average <span style="font-weight: bold;">land parcel (ex
building)</span> in the UEL is
worth <span style="font-weight: bold;">17.5 times</span> the average
in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($692.5/$39.6).</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;Now do us both a favor, please. Pause and savor that
comparison. Let it linger, as though you were testing a slow sip of
wine from Fredonia's famous grapes. Roll it on your tongue, mull
sensually over its aroma and bouquet, and, getting back to business,
mull cerebrally over its full import<b>. The house that shelters the
very rich family is worth 2.8 times the house of the modest family;
but the land under the house of the very rich is worth 17.5 times the
land of the modest.</b> Seventeen and one half times as much! Again,
it is lot value, more than building value, that divides the rich from
the poor. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Seldom
will you find an economic rule more strongly
supported by data. It's just a matter of presenting the data so as to
test and bring out the rule.</span>
<p>An American counterpart of Vancouver's "University Endowment
Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
something like a million dollars. Beverly Hills, with its great
wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." Every year many a
grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;What do those data tell us? The rich as a rule do not live
next to the poor. Rather, they cluster in neighborhoods with much
higher lot values. <b>The poor seek shelter first, and go where it is
affordable.</b> The rich put a high premium on location,
neighborhood, views, and grounds, resulting in higher land fractions
in their real estate. Mansions are visible evidences of wealth,
impressing viewers powerfully; land values are invisible. The
perceptual bias is to underrate the invisible, if you are not
regularly in the real estate market. In the numbers, however, land
and buildings are equally visible, and their message is clear. <b>It
is land value more than house value that divides the rich from the
poor. Ergo, a tax shift from buildings to land is a shift from the
poor to the rich, even though the houses of the rich are exempted. It
makes the property tax more progressive. </b></p>
&nbsp;To be sure, those data are grouped by separate municipalities,
not
neighborhoods within municipalities. The poor of Colwood cannot tax
the rich in the UEL, except through a higher level of government.
However, <span style="font-weight: bold;">what is true among
municipalities is also true among
neighborhoods within municipalities.</span> Indeed, if we divided
Vancouver
into neighborhoods, the contrasts might be sharper than those shown.
The UEL, for example, is really just a neighborhood in Vancouver
that, for historical reasons, happens to be reported on separately.
Harold Brodsky has done neighborhood comparisons in Washington, D.C.;
Margaret Reid in Chicago; Richard Muth in various cities. They tell
the same story. If we are very lucky, some Institute or Foundation
concerned with land policy will see the importance of this question,
and support teams of researchers and graduate students testing the
point in a dozen American cities. San Francisco, with its scores of
well-defined neighborhoods, would be a natural. Compare exclusive St.
Francis Woods (top of the line) with the crowded Richmond District,
and both with Visitacion Valley (the pits). I surmise the findings
would reinforce those presented above. Meantime, nothing stops you
from checking things out in your own town.
<p>&nbsp;Making the property tax more progressive is not just
equitable, it raises its revenue capacity. That is because visible
damage to the poor and marginal puts a cap on any tax. You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip, and if you try you'll look like the
Sheriff of Nottingham. <b>A land tax won't drive the poor from their
humble huts, because it exempts the huts, and the sites have low tax
valuations. It may tax a few off valuable land, if their poor huts
are there and they own the land. However, if they own such land, are
they really poor?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;They may be "land-poor:" a few folks always are. They have
non-cash assets, but are illiquid. "Illiquid" may be just a euphemism
for "holding out for more" -- there is always a market at a price.
Even so their plight, genuine or affected, traditionally evokes
sympathy and support. We must address it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;California, although backward in many ways, has addressed it
effectively. In our <b>special improvement districts (SIDs)</b>,
State law allows the SID to contract with the landowner as follows.<small>
<font size="+1"><small>You don't have to pay your annual charge in
cash. If
you choose not to, we take an equity in your property, charging a
modest rate of interest. Our equity accumulates over time. When you
die, we sell the property and take our share; your estate gets the
rest. Should our equity reach 100% during your lifetime, you stay
there for the duration, tax free.</small></font></small></p>
<p>&nbsp;Objectively, it looks like a good deal for the taxpayer.
They can't come out behind, even if they die soon; if they live long,
they come out ahead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The instructive
result is that very few people
take this apparently advantageous option.</span> UCLA's Donald Shoup
has
published several works on the program. One way or another, they
manage to pay on time. Perhaps it attracts the attention of potential
heirs, in a compelling way, but somehow the cash comes forth. While
intending only to relieve distress, the program seems to have called
a great bluff. The lachrymose plea of the cash-poor widow is
unanswerable in debate, without appearing callous, doctrinaire, and
jackbooted. Meantime wealthy interests, thoroughly undistressed, hide
behind the widow's skirt and get their way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We also hear, sometimes, that "it's never been done," or
it's only been done by our drab neighbor Pennsylvania, for whom
familiarity may have bred contempt? Only "far kine have long horns."
Or, whatever progress ensued there was happening anyway. We are
destiny's tots in the grip of cosmic forces. We rise and fall with
the tide. We cannot control Fate; relax and accept what the gods dish
out. Fatalism: it's a sure recipe for milling around ineffectually
while life passes us by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Let's raise our sights far afield to where "it" has also
been done. I was in <a name="Johannesburg"></a><b>Johannesburg</b> not
long ago, a city that thrives in the face of daunting handicaps. I am
struck by the miracle of the place; it is Bootstrap City. It should
have died when its gold mines played out, like a normal mining
boomtown. Instead it remains as the economic capital of its nation
and half a continent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Johannesburg defies and belies many "laws" of urban
economics, such as that "mines create no great cities." Its
once-fabled gold mines are just tailings now, so it should be a ghost
town. It has no harbor, no water transportation, not even any gravity
water supply. It is, in fact, on a ridge-top (the Rand or "reef"), at
an elevation over 5,000'. Water supply is pumped uphill. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It has no sunburst of rail lines, like Chicago or Boston, "The
Hub," except perhaps what it has attracted itself. It is on the main
rail line, but so are a thousand miles of other sites. The natural
site lacks outstanding amenities, and can't hold a candle to Cape
Town. Jo-burg has no governmental economic base. Surrounding farmland
is poor, the climate droughty. Why Johannesburg? Why is it the
largest city, the center of finance, industry, commerce, and
international air travel? &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a public finance economist I may overvalue incentive taxation,
but Jo-burg has it. <b>The property tax is on site value alone, and
at a high rate: they tell me it is 4%. </b>This is what makes Jo-burg
distinctive. Challenge and response: Jo-burg had to do something
right in order to survive, and that is what it did. It not only
survived, it became and remains Number One. Give me a better
explanation and I'll back off. I haven't heard one yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Jo-burg is not heaven, far from it. It is surrounded by and
transfused with social problems we can hardly imagine, much more
expensive to handle and solve than what we know. That is part of the
present point. Jo-burg obstinately prospers in the face of these,
added to its natural geographic disadvantages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cape Town, by contrast, is Sleeping Beauty. Nature has been
generous there. It is gifted with one of the world's great harbors
and sites, ideal climate and scenery. It has the national legislative
Capitol. It enjoys the business potential of New York, the climate of
La Jolla, the scenery of Vancouver, and the political base of
Washington (or at least Albany). Tourists flock there, and would do
so even if the place were misgoverned by Mayor Idi Amin with Police
Chief Saddam Hussein. Meantime Jo-burg, the ugly duckling, walks off
with most of the nation's business. What is Cape Town's problem? It
taxes buildings, the way we do. &nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Taiwan"></a><b>Taiwan </b>is another place that "did it,"
in part. Its present government is what remains of the Kuomintang,
founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the mainland around 1920. Sun's ideas
were abandoned to corruption until the Kuomintang's remnants,
discredited and beaten, fled to Taiwan in 1948. Then finally, backs
to the wall, they purified themselves. They put Sun's visage on their
currency and buildings, and beatified him. They created an efficient,
honest government and applied the policies Dr. Sun had prescribed
long ago for all China. Sun's basic economic program was simple. He
was a convert to the ideas of Henry George, which were stirring the
world in Sun's formative years. Tax the land; exempt the buildings,
said Dr. Sun. That is what Taiwan finally did; the Taiwanese economic
miracle ensued. It is there to see and study. Them as has eyes t'see,
let'm see. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not that simple, of course, and certainly not that pure:
nothing ever is. That is the gist of it, however. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">As to adequacy of
revenues, they have combined their local land tax with a national tax
on land gains, levied at time of sale. These two taxes between them
raise a full 20% of all Taiwanese revenues: local, regional, and
national. </span>Remember we are talking about a government under
siege,
with a heavy military budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We are
talking about land prices that
keep rising in spite of taxes levied on the land value base.</span>
Again,
it is there to observe. It is not in America, true: it is even
better. It is an American export that took root and flourishes in an
alien culture because it answers universal needs. Among the Chinese
it also evoked memories of revered statesmen and philosophers, like
Wang An-shih, who had implemented land taxation to abet China's
ancient glories. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Singapore, Sydney, Brisbane, and Nairobi</b> are other cities
that collect substantial land revenues. From 1900-20, roughly, many
American and Canadian cities uptaxed land and downtaxed buildings. It
was a part of the Progressive syndrome. There is a world of
experience to instruct us, if we will but study it. Pittsburgh and
those other smart Pennsylvania cities are near and now and
noteworthy, but they are not the whole story. If you want more, your
world of observation is as big, and time as long, as you want to make
them. &nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The adequacy of a tax base must be judged over the cycle of
boom and bust, a cycle we are now learning is still much alive.
</b>How stable is the base? Capital comes and goes; land is fixed.
When they finally close that plant and move the work to Mexico, at
present we reward them by lowering their taxable valuation -- reward
them and punish ourselves, as city revenues fall. On the other hand,
if we taxed just their land, the valuation would remain about the
same. They will squeal, cajole, and threaten, but no way can they
move their land to Mexico. They will just have to find a new use for
it. Meantime, you will have made it more likely there are profitable
new uses by removing the tax threat against whatever new capital they
might invest in your town to employ your people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Land prices boom and bust too, jeopardizing revenue
stability. That can be a problem, but land taxation contains a
built-in contra-cyclical factor. <b>When a land boom reaches its
manic phase, as it did in California before 1989, growth expectations
rise so high that they offset interest costs: people think they are
holding land with no net carrying cost. </b>Your home is expected not
just to shelter you, but pay off its own mortgage, upkeep, and
maintenance by appreciating. Call it irrational, but it happens. In
this phase, the fast-moving tax assessor is an equilibrating force.
The quicker he follows such a market, the quicker he showers it with
cold water, by imposing a sobering cash drain on the participants.
This is an excellent time for local governments, if they have the
wit, to pay their debts, fix their potholes, and fill the fiscal
reservoir against the next drought. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Those getting the cold shower, meantime, may resist it. In
California, the land of extremes, we got Howard Jarvis and <b>Prop.
13. This Constitutional Amendment capped the property tax rate at 1%,
and virtually froze assessed values until land sold. </b>Then the
boom really went wild. I myself, after campaigning hard against
Jarvis, unexpectedly made $200,000 in a few months after it passed.
Buyers were chasing me around the block, just to buy a scrap of land
I happened to have in the right place at the right time. It was blind
luck, but the money was as good as though I had earned it honestly:
better, in fact, because 60% of the gain was not even reportable as
taxable income. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but buyers
and sellers came to regard it as normal, and only fair. They saw
regular annual increments as a divine right of property. For a few
mad years, they were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>It was the lack of a tax stabilizer that took the cap off
land prices. When my lot rose to $240,000, it was still assessed at
$10,000, and capped there by constitutional law! Taxes were 1% of
$10,000 - that's right, $100/year, 1/24 of 1% of the market value.
Was I in a strong bargaining position? You bet, and I loved it, just
as you might. Now we are paying the price, or beginning to, as our
public services collapse and our criminals outgun our police. This
year they are cutting faculty salaries (that's me) 5%, and raising
college tuition (that's my three children) 100%.</b> I'll pay all
right. All tax rates other than property are headed north; land
prices south. Our once-vibrant economy is dying; our unemployment
rate leads the nation. Our largest city was torched last year by the
frustrated unemployed. Our once-leading schools trail the nation; our
murder rate leads it. Those are the economic consequences of Howard
Jarvis. Like Tokyo and London and Faust, we signed with
Mephistopheles. He showed us a grand time, but now his bill is due.
To paraphrase Kipling, "Be warned of our lot, which I dread you may
not, and learn about Jarvis from me."</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Another attractive feature of land taxation is its
interesting positive effect on the economic base of a city. It
strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder than
resident owners.</b> The land fraction in real estate is generally
highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place for
absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. <b>About 2/3 of downtown
Los Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh
winters.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your balance of payments. When you
get more tax money from absentees, money that used to flow to Tehran,
Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your local treasury to pay your
local teachers and city workers, and relieve your builders and
building managers. In this way taxing land actually acts to undergird
the value of its own base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To stimulate building is also to uphold and fortify the tax
base, even though you do not tax the new buildings directly. Some
people fault the "depressing" canyons of Manhattan, between the
skyscrapers. In my observation, it is not the canyons that depress
Manhattan. <b>When the GM building went up, Fortune Magazine reported
it doubled the rents of stores across the deep canyon so formed.</b>
Its spillover effects were highly positive. What really depresses
Manhattan are rather the centenarian firetraps and the activities
they attract. They tend to downvalue other lands nearby, eroding the
tax base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Consider the effect of floorspace rentals on ground rents
and land values. Doubling floorspace rentals will more than double
land values, through a kind of leverage effect. That is because <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">all
cash flows above a constant amount required for the building will
inure as ground rents.</span> The higgling and arbitrage of the market
will
see to that. Once that constant is met, everything above it goes to
landownership as such, raising land prices which are the land tax
base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities much, the positive neighborhood
effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
base.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;There are three kinds of slums.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Type I slums</b> develop on land in the van of downtown
expansion, on land held for a future higher use. The speculators are
milking the old structures for any residual value. They don't much mind
when the tenants leave, and spare them the trouble of an eviction when
they want to sell or rebuild. That's what they're in it for: the
current use is incidental.</li>
  <li><b>Type III slums</b> (listed here out of numerical order)
develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,
people are driven there by the inadequate development of good land.</li>
  <li><b>Type II slums</b>, our focus here, are the most extensive.
They occur on good or superior residential land originally developed
over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed the upper
crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they "filtered
down," and down, and down, until their occupants began radiating
negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point where the
neighborhood self- destructs cumulatively, because no one wants to
build new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal value of
land is lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social and
public costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to renew
itself on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the Bronx,
East St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;That's the bad news. How do you turn it around? When you
drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
<b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
and there is where it begins.</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Once it begins, it proceeds incrementally through the
Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
calls.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;I once wrote a long chapter on this subject, "<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">T</span><b><i>he
Adequacy of Land as a Tax Base</i></b>" (Gaffney, 1970). It came out
of two years of research, and is too long even to summarize now. I am
delivering it to Pat Salkin, however, and hope she may add it to the
record of this conference. I also attach a short bibliography of
articles that expand on topics covered above, for whoever is moved to
study more on this fascinating subject. I hope you think it as
important as I do. <b>Please pick up this ball and run with it.
Nobody said it was going to be easy. There are some bone-crushing
line-backers out there, like Greed, Ignorance, Myopia, and Inertia.
So much the more credit to you when you cross the line: your fans
will love you for a touchdown. They really need a lift; they've
waited so long!</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
