<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">A Cannan Gets the
Range</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mason Gaffney</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Cannan's Law</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edwin Cannan (1861-1935)</span> is
best known for his 1904 edition of
<b><i>The Wealth of Nations</i></b>. His other best-known work is a
<b><i>History of Theories of Production and Distribution</i></b>,
1893. His book most relevant here is <b><i>History of Local Rates in
England</i></b>, 1896. He was Professor at the London School of
Economics, 1907-26, although a large inherited fortune let him reside
at Oxford and dabble at London part-time. He criticized both
Marshall and Keynes, although without much effect. His later work
drew little enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In 1907 Cannan fired off a round at local rating of site values. It
hit home. First he recited the logic of what today we call the
"tragedy of the commons" (it was common coin long before Garrett
Hardin). Then he pointed out that a city taxing only site values to
provide free public services would attract too many people and too
much capital. A city is an "open economy," free to immigration of
everything but land, something like an open range or fishery. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Even
if all cities tax only site values, cities with more rents per head
may support public services at higher levels, and so attract
immigrants. This distorts locational decisions, attracting people to
jobs of lesser productivity where they may gain from better public
services. This is "Cannan's Law."</span></p>
<p>There are three bad results from Cannan's Law. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>One is an uneconomical distribution of population, as cities
with more rentable lands attract more of mobile labor and capital than
they should. </b> That is not to deny that people are attracted to New
York for good economic reasons. Rather, it is that distributing
economic rent freely to all comers attracts people above and beyond the
good economic reasons. Thus, people move to New York to earn high
wages, well and good; but in addition they may receive a high quality
college education from CCNY, the "poor man's Harvard," paid from local
property taxes. In the glory days of the Mesabi iron range, children of
immigrant Finnish miners there in Hibbing, Minnesota, enjoyed some of
the best schooling in the country, paid from local property taxes on
iron ore. In Alaska and Alberta, workers receive high wages to overcome
the harsh climate, remote locations, and other disamenities. That is
economically sound, but in addition they get a cash dividend each year
from the overflowing oil revenues. All that tends to draw more people,
like flies swarming to fresh pie, than the wages warrant.</li>
  <li><b>A second bad result is what economists call "dissipation of
economic rent." </b> To make it simple, consider a rich but crowded
fishery where another fishing boat added to the crowd will not raise
the total catch at all, but simply take fish from other crews who were
already there. Interlopers will keep entering until the average boat
and crew just make costs, leaving no net rent for anyone. This has long
been standard economic lore. As Cannan writes, if a locality uses its
rents to benefit all its "inhabitants," people will flock to the
richest places until there is no further gain to immigrants because
they have wiped out all the rent. </li>
  <li><b>A third bad result of Cannan's Law is to lower the incentive
of local governments to provide public services that are open to all
comers.</b> It fosters local institutions and attitudes that are
harshly hostile to newcomers and outsiders, especially to the poor,
young, homeless, hungry, and vagrant. As Woody Guthrie, the Okie bard,
sang of California, "Believe it or not, you won't find it so hot, if
you ain't got that do-re-mi." That was in 1935; it is truer today.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cannan goes on to say that if we are to tax site values, the tax
should be national. It is not clear how sincere he is -- his style is
carping, condescending, elitist and unsympathetic. Still, his logic
implies it, and he does say it, however grudgingly. On this point
the great Alfred Marshall agreed, in a positive spirit (positive,
that is, for Marshall, a famously "two-handed" economist). </p>
<a name="Why heed Cannan?"></a><b>Why heed Cannan?</b>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss Cannan, a careless writer. One could
pick at his many flaws, but it would be tedious and petty. He lacked
much standing in the profession, except as a hanger-on. He is best
known for editing <b><i>The Wealth of Nations</i></b>, the work of
another man's genius. Marshall credits Cannan as one of many who
have helped him on "special points," yet Cannan misquotes and
misrenders Marshall so badly one doubts if Cannan ever finished
reading Marshall's <b><i>Principles</i></b>, with its emphasis on the
distinctive qualities of land, and its virtues as a tax base. </p>
<p>Yet it would be wrong to dismiss Cannan without heeding the
thunder of his well-aimed artillery. His point is that if we are to
think globally we must also act globally, or at least nationally, not
just locally. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Those who follow the
behest to "Think globally, act
locally" trap themselves in an anomaly, dooming them to the fate of
Sisyphus. No locality has much incentive to share its land,
unilaterally, with the rest of the world's mobile people.</span> </p>
<p>Alfred Marshall seconds Cannan's point, although he notes that the
"well-to-do" tend to move to the suburbs, leaving the "working
classes" in central cities. He rather misses Cannan's point that
the "London Dukes" who owned (and still own) the best of central
London are the target of land taxers. At this point Marshall
minimizes the problem - his world tends to be the best of all
possible ones.<br>

<p><a name="The Balkanized Tax Base"></a><b>The Balkanized Tax
Base</b></p>
<p>Differences among city tax bases are actually, however, extreme. One
desperate little farm town in Fresno County, Parlier, has just
$10,000 of assessed value per head. Here are some assessed values
per head from different California cities in The County of Los
Angeles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lynwood, $21,500; </li>
  <li>Beverly Hills, $294,000 (13 times Lynwood); </li>
  <li>City of Industry, $5,533,000 (257 times Lynwood, and 553 times
Parlier) . </li>
</ul>
<p>Destitute Slab City (Unincorp.) in Riverside County has no land
values at all. (It is an abandoned military base between a bombing
range and the fragrant southern end of the Salton Sea, with rotting
algae and dying fish.) One would not expect much support in The
City of Industry for a proposal to share land as common property with
the transients who park in Slab City, which has no public services
except a species of public schooling, nor would we expect the
transients to stay in or return to Slab City if they could park on
the streets of Beverly Hills, camp in its parks, attend its schools,
and beg or "work for food" on Rodeo Drive.</p>
<p>This is why some critics have called the property tax
"regressive." Balkanization of the property tax gives some
plausibility to the otherwise bizarre claim that switching to a sales
tax is less regressive than sticking with a property tax. Within
each city the property tax is progressive, but when your data meld
cities like poor little Parlier and Lynwood with Beverly Hills you
sometimes find poor people paying more of their income in property
taxes than rich people, and getting less for it.</p>
<p>Then there are resource tax enclaves. Hydrocarbons and hardrock
minerals are unevenly distributed, geographically. McLure tells us
that the Siberian oblast of Tyumen, with 2% of Russia's people,
yields 65% of Russia's oil. There are similar regional disparities
worldwide.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rich farm counties are not,
generally, resource tax-enclaves
(except by comparison with poor farm counties).</span> The "rural"
counties
today with high values per head are resort counties, like Vilas and
Walworth in Wisconsin, with their prized lake frontages; or "exurban"
counties like Napa in California; or Berkshire in Massachusetts. In
California, you might think that fruitful farming counties like
Tulare have a lot more taxable real estate value per head than urban
ones. Such is a durable belief, but it is wrong. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Tulare County reports assessed values per head of $38,100. </li>
  <li>The whole state averages $60,000 per head. </li>
  <li>Suburban Marin County weighs in with $95,400; </li>
  <li>urban Los Angeles County has $59,000; </li>
  <li>Orange County has $74,000. </li>
</ul>
<p>You might also think that Tulare, being rural, has a lot higher
fraction of land value in its mix, but again, not so. The <b>Land
Share of Real Estate Value (LSREV)</b> in Tulare County is 28%,
compared to a statewide mean of 40%, and 47% in Orange County. Grazing
and mining counties like Inyo have high values of LSREV, but
they are a small share of the farm economy. Counties with intensive
working farms, like those of the San Joaquin Valley, have low values
of LSREV. </p>
<p>Switching just the local property tax to land ex buildings will do
little to correct such disparities. It will therefore make little
progress toward overall distributive justice, and the wide support
that would evoke. There is, in fact, a natural cap on local property
tax rates imposed by local particularism. The City Council of
Beverly Hills will not raise land taxes in Beverly Hills to help
voters in Parlier and Lynwood move to Beverly Hills and share the
rents.</p>
<p><a name="Local Particularism Caps the Pr"></a><b>Local
Particularism Caps the Property Tax Rate</b></p>
<p>Everything above points to there being a low ceiling on Georgist
taxation applied locally. Henry George recognized that the power
elite of landowner/employers use Malthus' doctrine to oppose raising
wages -- it would just spawn an invasion of new brats into the work
force, they said, bringing wage rates back down to bare subsistence. To
make his points, George had to refute Malthus. George's view
mostly prevailed, with exceptions, until fairly recent times.
Neo-classical economists even hijacked it, with a reverse spin, to
trivialize land values. Whatever we may think of Malthus today,
there is no doubt that the fear of population increments from outside
the taxing polity now plays the role that George ascribed to
Malthusianism, and plays it with devastating effect.</p>
<p>Meantime, while academicians bandied words, many applied
politicians saw Cannan's Law clearly, and used it to further their
ends. <b>James Madison</b>, major author of the U.S. Constitution,
arranged for that document to block direct Federal property and land
taxes, unless they be proportioned to state populations -- a crippling
provision. He allowed property taxes at state and local levels --
even encouraged them by blocking interstate tariffs, then the most
common alternative form of revenue. He also guaranteed free
interstate migration. Thus he assured that local particularism would
cap land tax rates, while local fiscal preemption would obstruct
Federal use of property taxes. The Federalist Papers make it clear,
that was his objective -- perhaps his major one. </p>
<p>Austen Chamberlain, an English politician who (with his
half-brother Neville) battled against proposed national land taxation
from 1920-38, formulated the Tory strategy thus:</p>
<blockquote>"It is certain that if we do nothing the Radical Party will
sooner or later establish their national tax, and once established in
that form any Radical Chancellor ... will find it an easy task to give
a turn of the screw. ... On the other hand if this source of revenue
... is once given to municipalities, the Treasury will never be able to
put its finger in the pie again, ... " </blockquote>
<p>Parliament followed his lead, and thus set the stage for repealing
Snowden's national land tax (it was enacted in 1931, but died
aborning). Poor Neville Chamberlain was to be the goat of such
penury when he had to let Hitler humiliate him, but meantime English
landlords were spared paying taxes for any national purpose.</p>
<p>Upton Sinclair's run for Governor of California on the radical
EPIC platform, with strong Georgist elements, was winning until the
enemy found the formula of anti-Okie-ism. Jackson Ralston, running
single tax initiatives in the same era, lost to the same force
redoubled, for he based his campaign on "Home Rule" for cities. A
third radical, Francis M. Townsend, had the good sense to go national
- and he won, becoming the father of social security.</p>
<p><a name="Evanescent Local Successes and"></a><b>Evanescent Local
Successes and their Failings</b></p>
<p>There have been many temporary and partial political successes,
applying Georgist ideas locally, in spite of Cannan's Law. These are
something like correcting bad vision using eye exercises instead of
glasses. There are enough minor successes, after heroic efforts, to
lead us on, but only to frustration. Local action alone cannot
achieve the main goal. Here are a few such stories.</p>
<p>Some successes entail barriers to immigration. <b>Alaska</b>
early on set out to limit its social dividend to citizens with five
years prior residence in Alaska. It immediately lost out to the
ghost of Madison. In Zobel v. Williams (1982) the U.S.S.C. called
this provision a barrier to interstate migration, and struck it down.
Alaska's annual oil dividend survived, but were it not for Zobel
might be much higher than today. Meantime, Alaskan landowners pay no
property taxes. Land cannot immigrate, but there goes the dividend,
and Anchorage is the most sprawled city in North America.</p>
<p>Significantly, exclusionary zoning has been ruled NOT a barrier to
migration. It may depend on whose ox is being gored.</p>
<p><b>Ethnic political machines tap into local rents while
restricting the benefits to a closed circle that is hard to
enter.</b> Their role in urban American history is well known. So
are their shortcomings, which need no belaboring here. Note, though,
that many machine politicians -- Al Smith is the poster boy -- have
been friendlier to Georgist reforms than have patrician "good
government" reformers.</p>
<p><b>Theocracies with a religious test for entry are noteworthy.</b>
Two obvious cases are Congregationalist New England of the 17th
Century, and Mormon Utah of the 19th Century. Each was marked by
egalitarian sharing of rents among the faithful. Neither was able or
wanted to expand its example to encompass other faiths, however,
except via conversion.</p>
<p>California has quite a history of taxing land for public benefits.
But what public? California cannot exclude U.S. citizens directly,
but does so indirectly by using illegal alien labor for stoop and
sweatshop work. These aliens repel eastern U.S. immigrants, while
the aliens, mostly non-voting, are excluded from most public
benefits.</p>
<p>Race discrimination, ironically, may promote solidarity and
sharing within each ethnic group. To the Yankee, the camaraderie and
group solidarity among whites of the old South was striking and
attractive, but it came at the price of hostility to blacks,
including a propensity to tax sales more and property less. </p>
<p>Another set of successes came from selling voters on the gains
from growth and immigration. Henry George was apparently elected
Mayor of New York City in 1886 (although counted out). He had Irish
support, but was not selling an ethnic machine -- Tammany and the
Irish Catholic hierarchy turned against him. He preached on the
benefits of growth. Immigrants would not dilute rents as much as
they augmented them, said George. It is a central point he
underscores in his major work, <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and
Poverty</i></b>.</a></p>
<p>Edward Polak (1915), a George supporter in The Bronx Borough,
repeated George's argument in supporting the proposed exemption of
buildings in New York City -- an exemption that was implemented,
1922-32, with a strong boost from Governor Al Smith. Now, however,
there is a visible loss of belief in economies of scale of population
-- except in dying towns whose people feel their loss keenly, too
late.</p>
<p>George also brought out a countervailing point Cannan overlooked,
in his exclusive concern with protecting high central rents from
invasion. Taxes on the use and improvement of marginal lands
sterilize them, said George, "and tend to drive population and wealth
from them to the great cities." Godfrey Dunkley argues convincingly
that that is what VAT did, when South Africa adopted it for the very
purpose of making marginalized blacks pay taxes.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(20)</i></b></font> That is not the last word
on the subject either, but shows there is more to the subject than
Cannan began to disclose. As George maintained, aborting rent on
marginal land, not just rent-sharing on superior land, distorts
locational decisions. </p>
<p>Chambers of Commerce and Real Estate Boards have generally
followed the same tack as George, touting the gains of growth. In
the single-tax era in western Canada, that crested ca. 1919,
organized real estate people were a major force promoting the
exemption of buildings. <font size="-1"><b><i>(21)</i></b></font> They
often support land tax increases: some of them even opposed
Proposition 13 in California. They recognize the role of
infrastructure in promoting economic development, and the benefits of
untaxing buildings. Chambers of Commerce, however, now put much more
emphasis on attracting capital than labor. Changes in fiscal
federalism, discussed below, have reshaped their incentives and
attitudes.</p>
<p>Public universities have been a screening device attracting an
especially desired form of immigrant. Local support for education
is, however, lopsided, overbalanced for graduate and technical
education.</p>
<p>In sum, local growth-orientation has become too weak, partial, and
spasmodic to overcome the restrictive force of local particularism,
which today dominates policy almost everywhere. The resulting
exclusionary policies, when practiced by all or most localities,
drive landless proles from pillar to post until they become so
desperate they will serve landowner-employers for very little. It is
not enough to "think globally": we must act globally. "Some for the
glories of this world, and some sigh for the prophets' paradise to
come; &#8230;" Now, it seems, to win some glories of this world we
must do more than just sigh for the prophets' paradise, we must work
for it.</p>
<p><a name="Acting Globally"></a><b>Acting Globally</b></p>
<p>One way to act globally (or at least nationally) is through a
national land tax, or some reasonable facsimile thereof, coupled with
a national citizens' dividend. The income tax act of 1894 did
include land income in the tax base, thanks to the persistence of a
handful of single-tax Congressmen -- yes, really, there once were such
men. The U.S.S.C. struck it down for that reason,
<font size="-1"><b><i>(22)</i></b></font> but Congress and the voters
came back with the 16th Amendment, adopted in 1913, that did include
land income in the tax base. When Congress, led by single-taxer
Warren Worth Bailey, first implemented the amendment it virtually
exempted wages and salaries by exempting incomes below a high cutoff
point.<font size="-1"><b><i>(23)</i></b></font> The brunt of federal
taxation fell on property income, much of it land income, and it was
enough to finance World War I.</p>
<p>Since then the income tax has evolved, step by step, into its
present anti-labor form, with most property income exempt <i>de
facto</i>, and high rates on earned income.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(24)</i></b></font> It is legal to reverse
that trend, and would be good, but here we will focus on the cognate
matter of "fiscal federalism."</p>
<p>To enable basic tax reform at the local level we must deal with
local particularism. To do that, in turn, we must deal with "fiscal
federalism." How are central governments to distribute funds from
their so-called "surplus": to people (social dividend), or to local
governments representing landowners? When we wake up to smell this
coffee, we will find that a lot of economists have gotten up first.
Many of these deal with LAND RENT, defined as Ricardo would.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(25) </i></b></font></p>
<p>The reason it is so hard to sell growth policies -- like land-value
taxation -- at the local level today is that fiscal federalism, as
practiced today, is perverse. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Central
governments, imbued with the
anti-personnel spirit of Austen Chamberlain, tax people as people,
while handing out subventions to landowners as such, and to local
governments as such. The landowners can get the subventions without
having people, so who needs people?</span> That's our problem in a
nutshell. Persons as such become fiscal pollutants, from the local
view. After the T-Men have plucked their feathers, working persons
are less able to pay local taxes; while Federal grants relieve local
landowners from needing population to share public
costs.<font size="-1"><b><i>(26)</i></b></font> </p>
<p>Perverse fiscal federalism is DEsocialization of rent -- creating
new private rents using public monies wrung from workers. This is
inherent in grants for capital spending, e.g. for sewerage; and tax
exemption of muni bonds. These are given to municipalities as such.
That is only a step away from returning dollars to landowners as
such, because municipalities are defined as areas of land, a group of
local landowners. Desocialization is inherent in farm subsidies,
e.g. payments to fallow land, using tax money from workers. It is
inherent in preferential assessment of farmland, e.g. California's
Williamson Act, where the state pays localities for their lost tax
revenues from underutilizing lands. It is inherent in the use of
property-tax exemptions to subsidize many underutilizations of land
and hobbies of the rich, like redundant airports for private jets,
cemeteries, golf courses, campuses, church parking lots, conservation
easements, timber, etc. Some of these may foster socially defensible
uses, but note it is the lands, not the personnel, that are
tax-exempted.</p>
<p>Canada's classic Carter Commission Report
<font size="-1"><b><i>(27)</i></b></font> led the right way, but
Canada's actual equalization program leads the wrong
way.<font size="-1"><b><i>(28) </i></b></font> Equalization grants
from Ottawa to the provinces are lower to provinces whose taxable
capacity per head is higher, and of course vice versa, according to a
detailed formula. So far, so good, but the devil is in the
definition of "taxable capacity." Canada specifically excludes land
value from measures of taxable capacity.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(29)</i></b></font> Buildings are included as
part of the potential tax base; a hardworking productive population
is included; a thriving commerce is included; but land value is
quietly excluded. Thus a province wherein vast and valuable lands
are underused is considered a charity case, eligible for alms from
Ottawa; while another province that makes productive use of meager
lands is liable to pay more taxes, but will get less relief. That
helps explain why Ontario and Quebec, despite their great urban and
locational advantages, still rank below the provincial average in
measured taxable capacity.<font size="-1"><b><i>(30)</i></b></font> It
is not the capacity that is lacking, but the measurement of it. The
tilt is patent; it could hardly be an accident. If any of the
many brilliant economists, politicians, and bureaucrats who publish
on equalization payments, horizontal fiscal federalism, and Canada's
Representative Tax System (RTS) have even peeped on this vital
matter, I am not aware of it. Their consciousness has fallen below
the threshold of perception, and needs desperately to rise.</p>
<p>Within provinces there are equalization programs, too. British
Columbia offsets the magnetism of Vancouver by subsidizing less
magnetic cities from general revenues, and by cross-subsidizing rail
and utility services to distant outposts in the boonies, but it is
local governments or private landowners, not people as such, that get
the benefits. The exception is public education, which is therefore
the target of the most spirited attacks by privatizers (like smug
George Will) who dominate the op-ed pages today.</p>
<p>The modern "Public Choice" school has grown terribly chic in the
economics profession. It focuses on fear of "the tyranny of the
majority," given votes. The basic concept is unrealistic and
prejudicial, in view the observable fact that the minority of
landowners, armed with discretionary wealth, sway the majority of
voters to support policies that favor landowners over the underlying
population. The Public Choice school leads us to fear and fend off
an imaginary problem, blinding us to the real one that is quite the
reverse. Veblen explained voter behavior better by analyzing the
mindset of voters as a cultural throwback to an age of marauding
Viking bands organized around mindless fealty to some alpha male,
whom the betas and omegas were bound loyally to support and protect
at any cost to themselves.</p>
<p><a name="Reversing Perverse Policies"></a><b>Reversing Perverse
Policies</b></p>
<p>Public spending should feature "Citizen Dividends." These are
social dividends limited to citizens, thus discouraging free or
illegal immigration that would dilute the dividends and erode their
voter support. (The degree, pace, and conditions of legal
immigration is an issue to treat separately.) Dividends take many
forms other than outright per head cash grants. The G.I. Bill was a
splendid example. Social Security payments are another. School
equalization payments based on a.d.a. are another. A state or
province cannot easily restrict benefits to its old time citizens, as
Zobel showed -- but a nation can.</p>
<p>At the same time, there should be no more capital grants to
localities for public works. When cities pay for their own public
works they must attract population to justify the capital outlays and
service the debt.</p>
<p><b>Federal taxation should bear heavier on land income, and
lighter on wage and salary income, as in 1916. It was constitutional
then; it still is. </b> The combination of a citizens' dividend and
income-tax reform would drastically rebalance local incentives. Cities
would compete to attract median people rather than, as now, to
repel them. This would not cause swamping of cities with people
because it is a zero-sum game in a closed system. Competition would
simply raise wage rates and lower living costs.</p>
<p>Congress should repeal the tax exemption of state and local bonds,
a massive ongoing subsidy to local landowners. This repeal will be
challenged as an invasion of state sovereignty, but recall that
Congress had no trouble in 1939 repealing the tax exemption of state
and local employees. Would the courts find bonds to be more sacred
than payrolls? To find out, we only need a simple act of Congress
that would quickly be adjudicated.</p>
<p>The federal government should review local zoning, and other
exclusionary policies, as barriers to interstate migration.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a federal interest in
better tax assessment of land, to
keep buyers of used buildings from overallocating their tax "basis"
to depreciable buildings, thus arranging falsely to depreciate land,
and erode federal revenues.</span> Something like a national board of
equalization is called for. The U.S. Census of Governments, with the
pioneering work of Allen Manvel and political support from Illinois
Senator and Economics Professor Paul Douglas, established the
precedent. While we're at it, let us outlaw the sequential
depreciation of the same building by successive owners, an obvious
outrage.</p>
<p>The result of such measures would be to restore the concepts of
dignity of labor, and the key role of income-creating investing (as
opposed to acquiring existing wealth and rent-seeking).</p>
<p><a name="Colin Clark's national land tax"></a><b>Colin Clark's
national land tax</b></p>
<p>For nations where a national land tax is politically thinkable,
Colin Clark has proposed a simple counter to Cannan's poser. Says
Clark, "&#8230; land values per head of population should first be
ascertained; then the state would impose a land tax which exempted
altogether those local authority areas where per-head land values
were low, and which rose in a progressive scale for those with higher
land values per head. Each local authority would then also impose
its own tax, &#8230;"</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfred Marshall</span>, disguising
his boldness under a mousy writing
style, proposed an even stronger supplement to the land tax. He
would make the tax base the capital value of land, rather than the
annual cash value, to tap "the part of the real annual value of land
which does not appear in a money form &#8230; ". Repeating himself
for emphasis, he says that taxing capital value will "bring under
taxation some real income, which has escaped taxation merely because
it does not appear above the surface in a money form." That is,
Marshall wants the national tax to fall on imputed land income, an
enormous annual flow of value that now totally escapes income
taxation. </p>
<p>And what is the value of land under old buildings? Marshall
writes no nonsense about seeking the depreciated value of the old
building first.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Land value is the
opportunity cost of the site
itself: what land would bring "if cleared of buildings and sold in a
free market."</span> <font size="-1"><b><i>(32)</i></b></font> Imagine
how
that set of policies, from this prissy pillar of property and
propriety, would radicalize national taxation in any modern state. </p>
<p>Yet there is more. Marshall applauds Lloyd-George's "Social
Welfare" Budget of 1909, the one that humbled the House of Lords,
because the proposed land tax will "<b>check the appropriation of
what is really public property by private persons.</b>"
<font size="-1"><b><i>(33) </i></b></font> Did Henry George ever
say it plainer, or more provocatively "in-your-face"? No wonder
Edwin Cannan shied away from mastering Marshall's Principles. No
wonder George Stigler had to go back to a disorderly altercation at
Oxford, and alleged comments that Marshall never published, shiftily
to define the great Marshall as an anti-Georgist.
<font size="-1"><b><i>(34) </i></b></font> Can we, in our Federal
system, come up with something comparable to the ideas of Clark and
Marshall? It is a matter of thinking creatively, with the right
attitude.</p>
