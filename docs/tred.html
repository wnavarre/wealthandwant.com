The Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development<br>
</div>
The Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development was
my grandfather's baby, funded largely by the <a
 href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/">Robert Schalkenbach Foundation</a>,
to the best of my
knowledge.&nbsp; He and his second wife, Jessie Tredway
Matteson Carter, labored long and hard to make it work, living simply
and working well into his 80's and her 70's. &nbsp;
I hope you will indulge me if I include here a quote about
him! This from Arthur Becker's acknowledgments for <a href="#TRED4">TRED
4</a>:
<blockquote>"I wish to acknowledge the rare talents of Weld Carter,
executive secretary of the Committee on Taxation, Resources and
Economic Development. His understanding of the taxation of natural
resources is exceeded only by his sensitive regard for the scholarly
mind. His counsel to the committee and the editor of this book has been
inspired, as well as helpful."</blockquote>
<p>Weld was the executive secretary for its first 12 or so years. In the committee's
      later years, it continued to conduct annual conferences, at least through 1996
      (see the <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">article on Bill Vickrey</a>.)</p>
<p> Some of these
        books are still <a
 href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/store.php?crn=82&amp;action=show&amp;show_products_mode=cat_click">available
            </a>on the <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/">Schalkenbach</a> website,
      and the first is available on microfilm. </p>
<p>In Weld's correspondence was this description of TRED: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>TRED came into being because a small group of scholars believed that economics,
      as taught and as practiced, had blinders on, that it was ignoring an aspect
      of its field that was of fundamental importance. It sought to provide a forum
      in which these blinders could be, even if only temporarily, removed. It did <em>not</em> seek
      to impose doctrinaire conclusions. It sought merely to encourage discussion,
      pro and con, of aspects of its field that had obviously been under a stigma
      of taboo.</p>

<i>Extractive Resources and Taxation</i></b></font>, edited by<a href="../auth/Gaffney.html"> Mason
Gaffney</a></p>
<p><i>dust jacket: </i>This volume springs from a conference of
experts in the field called to discuss the taxation of rent from
extractive natural resources. On the assumption that rent is a
suitable object for taxation, the problem posed to the group was how
to define rent when resources are extractive, and how best to tax it.
With an introduction and conclusion by the editor, this book offers
the opinions of fourteen other economists on extractive resources and
taxation -- ample ammunition for those concerned with plugging
loopholes in the tax laws for natural resources.</p>
<p>Of the three major divisions of this book, the first, on theory,
develops a basic conceptual framework for analyzing the working of
the market in regulating the timing of extraction and the effects of
taxation on intertemporal choices. The second part, on institutions,
deals with the effect of different tenure systems on economic use and
the relations of resource tenure and taxation to competition. The
final section concerns policy and draws on the first two parts to
suggest some tax and tenure policies best calculated to optimize the
timing of use of known resources and of exploration for
replacements.</p>
<p>The <i>Editor's Introduction</i> begins "The Importance of
Extractive Resources: Mankind signalizes the importance of extractive
resources in a number of traditional ways. Nations insist on some
political control of their own supplies of raw materials, believing
that these are limitational inputs vital to national survival. Among
oligopoly firms the same tendency prevails -- most mills try to
capture their own resource reserves, in spite of the inflated capital
requirements, beacuse the free market in most ores is not reliable
and resource ownership is, or might become, a lever of exploitation
or control. This insistence on controlling one's own supplies
constitutes in the aggregate, indeed, an overrecognition of the
importance of extractive resources. It often fosters premature
development of excessive reserves: in mining and oil firms the
asset-outputratio is higher than in any other industry.</p>
<p>Federal stockpiling of strategic materials is another traditional
acknowledgment of the importance of exhaustible resources. Subsidy
for exploration is another. Social and legal pressures to retard
withdrawal of minerals and to discourage exports are yet others.
Every month or two produces its new jeremiad against rising
population and living standards, with intimations of Malthusian
doom.</p>
<p>Probably most economists would agree that those traditional
feelings are, on the whole, overwrought. But there are more sober
indicators of the true importance of exhaustible resources. One is
the higher wage level in the United States. The perennial question
"How can American firms compete with foreign firms which pay lower
wage rates?" has as part of its perennial answer that the marginal
productivity of American laborers is perennially elevated by their
more generous complement of raw materials.</p>
<p>Monopolization of strategic deposits of raw materials is one of
the more common means of controlling markets; and in World War II
federal priorities and rationing of raw materials were key levers in
control of the economy. Exhaustible resources are especially
susceptible to concentrated ownership because the workable,
accessible high quality deposits are limited. Again the long waiting
period between early exploration and ultimate liquidation of many
deposits favors concentration of ownership. Only a handful of the
ultra-affluent can afford to wait half a century between investment
and liquidation; and if we measure the extreme range from first
exploration to the last yield from a mine, more than fifty years
would be a realistic life. In extractive industries, an average
reserve-output ratio of twenty years would not be unusual. But that
is like an inventory that turns over only five times a century.
Within the industries the financial Titans tend to specialize in
ccarrying the financial burden of holding valuable resources, a
pattern of ownership that helps set the stage for market and social
control. In any complete list of giant corporations and giant
personal and family fortunes, mineral holders are conspicuous near
the top: oil and gas, coal and iron, and in Europe "chemicals" are
paramount; followed by copper, sulfur, lead and zinc, gold and
silver, molybdenum, bauxite, uranium, phosphate, potash, nickel, and
so on through the list of useful elements.</p>
<p>In public finance, special treatment of exhaustible resources
provides one of the major loopholes through which property income
escapes taxation. The value of the depletion allowance is a matter of
some billions of dollars each year. And in many local jurisdictions
the assessor is ill-equipped to put a propert valuation on subsurface
mineral possibilities for property-tax purposes.</p>
<p>The development of exhaustible resources is also a source of
economic instability. This, like the concentration of ownership,
follows from the long waiting period between early exploration and
final liquidation. Natural resources might be described as a capital
investment of unusual duration. The more durable a capital good, of
course, the more subject it is to the acceleration principle and
cobweb-type oscillations. Its value is sensitive to small changes in
interest rates. Economic instability, studied both empirically and
theoretically, is widely agreed to relate closest to investment in
durable assets. Added to this, natural-resource owners are prone to
form cartels, with their tendency to hold a price umbrella that
stimulates submarginal developments and leads, over a long swing of
perhaps a generation, to the development of excess capacity and an
ultimate boomerang that collapses prices and cartels.&nbsp;</p>

2 <i>Property Taxation -- USA</i></b></font>, edited by Richard W.
Lindholm, The University of Wisconsin Press, 1967, 315 pages.</p>
<p><b><i>Dust Jacket:</i></b> There is currently a revival of
interest in the United States in the way the property tax has
functioned in the past and how it is now operating. Moreover,
developing nations are turning to the property tax to meet their
fiscal needs. The contributors to this volume consider old and new
economic theories and administrative procedures of property taxation.
Approaching the subject in a number of ways and considering both
practical and theoretical aspects of the topic, the contributors
point out that many current administrative practices and legal
provisions of the property tax are anachronistic and in need of
reform. Their analyses demonstrate, however, that -- particularly if
site value is emphasized as the tax base -- the property tax
possesses great potential for economic planning and revenue raising.
Summarizing many facets of the way the property tax functions, they
make constructive suggestions for reform and improvement of the tax
to meet present-day demands.</p>
<p><b><i>Preface:</i></b> This is a period of revival of interest in
the way the property tax has been applied in the United States and in
the way in which the tax may develop in the United States and in
other nations of the world. This publication is intended as a
contribution to the growing effort to understand how the property tax
does work; what can be done to make it work better in the United
States; and what should be avoided by new nations interested in
developing a strong property tax. In an attempt to realize this goal,
a group of some of the world's most knowledgeable persons on the
subject of property taxation in the United States were brought
together to present papers and to make comments on broad and narrow
aspects of this subject.</p>
<p>This book presents the proceedings of the conference, Property
Taxation -- USA, which took place on the campus of the University of
Wisconsin -- Milwaukee during the period June 14-16, 1965. Fourteen
of the participants presented detailed examinations of a selected
aspect of property taxation in the United States. In this volume,
these very informative analyses are divided into three groups, and
each group is preceded by an introductory section by the editor. Part
I&nbsp;is titled "Some Fundamental Considerations;" Part II is titled
"Business and Industry;" and Part III is titled "Special Problems."
The contributions of all the conference proceedings has been to
permit the reader to approach as closely as possible to becoming an
actual participant while keeping the quantity of reading to a
reasonable level.</p>
<p>The backgrounds of the conference participants cover a wide range
of property-tax experience. All aspects of the taxation of property
in the United States. In working toward this goal, some important
trends are identified, and old and new theories of property taxation
are examined to determine their usefulness in reform and improvement
of the tax. In most cases, the papers are based on experience with
the subject under consideration but cover some theoretical aspects of
the subject as well. They also identify policy implications of the
facts and analyses presented. Persons interested in the introduction
and administration of improved tax systems in the low
per-capita-income developing nations of the world will find the
papers and the summary of the informal discussions to be mines of
useful advice and information.</p>
<p>The well-publicized weaknesses of the property tax are described,
and, when the sources of these weaknesses are explored in paper after
paper, a general program for basic property-tax reform emerges. The
fundamental reform which appears to be required is the re-emergence
of the property tax as a major source of state revenues. These
receipts would be used by the states as centrally collected revenues
of local governments or as receipts to support state
expenditures.</p>
<p>Two other basic policy positions evolve less sharply from the
papers, but they are clearly discernible. The first is that a general
property tax is much less acceptable than one based largely on land
value. The second is that the impacts of income-tax developments in
the United States have not been recognized, or have, at best, been
considered only intermittently in property-tax legislation.</p>
<p>As the reader goes through these collected papers he will,
I&nbsp;am certain, find himself saying (even as I did) that the
taxation heritage of the United States -- based on sound democratic
principles -- has been permitted to become heavily encrusted with an
overlay of special-interest legislation. It is time these accretions
were scraped off so that the clean lines of the original may be seen.
When the original purposes and methods of reaching them are revealed,
the property tax becomes much more attractive to businessmen, to
economists, to tax specialists, and -- most important of all -- to
taxpayers in general.</p>
<p>The property tax was developed as a general, state-wide tax, and
its evolution into a special district and municipal tax was most
unfortunate and requires remedy. In the United States, the property
tax just does not possess great, unique advantages as a revenue e
source within a small geographical area. Actually, many of the small,
independent property-taxing jurisdictions are not required for
effective local control of government, but are an example of
property-tax encrustation through special-interest legislation.</p>
<p>Before the days of the income tax, the property tax was aimed at
ability to pay, and many of its current shortcomings arose from
efforts to reach income directly. This effort is no longer required.
The development of the income tax as the major revenue source of the
federal government and the emergence of the federal government as the
nation's major tax-gatherer -- plus the wide use of the income tax by
state and local governments -- have largely eliminated the original
need to justify the property tax by attempting to base it on ability
to pay. Individual justice could now be attained if the property tax
were based on cost of benefits enjoyed by the property. Social
justice could be achieved if the tax took into account society's
general expansion in numbers and productivity. Recognition of the
property tax's strength in helping society to benefit generally from
the land and resource values it is creating seems currently to be
growing.</p>
<p>The conference and this book owe much to the stimulus and support
of the Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development and
the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation. In addition, the participants
were assisted in making their contributions by the organizations with
which they are associated. The School of Business Administration of
the University of Oregon was particularly helpful.</p>

<i>The Property Tax and Its
Administration</i></b></font><font size="+1"><b>,</b></font> edited
by Arthur D. Lynn, Jr.</p>
<p><b><i>dust jacket</i></b>: In the United States today, the
twenty-five billions dollars a year returned by the property tax is
exceeded only by the federal income tax as a source of governmental
revenue.</p>
<p>The scholars, state officials, and the professional appraiser who
are contributors to this volume address themselves to questions of
public policy, practicality, and equity in the property levy. They
raise hope for (and set limits on) the value of electronic data
processing in accurate assessment, while reserving an essential role
for the human assessor.</p>
<p>Guarded optimism is expressed for possible state legislative
reform required qualified assessors at the local level, full
disclosure of assessment ratios, reduction in number of assessment
districts, and review of tax-exempt property.</p>
<p>Self-assessment, with penalties of fines or forced selling at the
self-assessed price, is proposed as a substitute or supplement to
administrative assessment systems and as a transitional device in
newly developing countries until an effective property tax
administration is established.</p>
<p>After examining the property tax as a tool for implementing public
policy in the urban fringe areas of the continental United States,
one expert recommends the use of limited tax deferrals. Hawaii's Land
Use Law, a measure designed to control state-wide land use to
maintain environmental quality under conditions of rapid economic
expansion, is analyzed in its relation to the property tax.</p>
<p>This thorough, constructive coverage of the property tax will be
valuable to economists as well as to officials of state and local
government. Editor Arthur D. Lynn, Jr., is Professor of Economics and
Law and Associate Dean of Faculties at Ohio State University.</p>
<p><b><i>Preface</i></b> Both economy and polity have often been
influenced by economic and institutional cycles. So also has the
property tax. This ancient levy and opinion about its quality have
moved through many different phases. The tax base has expanded and
contracted. The relative use of the tax has waxed, waned and waxed
again. Its public image, as well as its evaluation by specialists,
has varied considerably over time.</p>
<p>The property tax has been roundly condemned from time out of mind.
Some experts have predicted that, unless greatly and, indeed,
promptly, improved, this fiscal institution is destined for early
oblivion. Others -- apparently thinking the existing pattern
unresponsive to changing circumstances -- anticipate no significant
change in present property tax arrangements. Despite such conflicting
judgments, it is not unreasonable to expect that some form of the
property tax will remain as an important fiscal arrangement for the
forseeable future. Accordingly, questions both about barriers to
change and about improvement possibilities are of continuing
significance.</p>
<p>This book contains the papers presented and the summarized
discussion recorded at a conference on the property tax and its
administration conducted by the Committee on Taxation, Resources and
Economic Development (TRED), an association of academic economists
concerned with natural resource taxation. The conference was held at
Kenwood Hall, the continuing education center of the University of
Wisconsin -- Milwaukee, from July 6 through July 8, 1967. The
participants considered whether and to what extent administrative
patterns and problems, including the assessment process, are
obstacles to change in property tax arrangements and ...</p>

Land and Building Taxes:&nbsp;Their Effect on Economic
Development</i></b></font>, edited by Arthur P. Becker. 308 pages
University of Wisconsin Press, 1969</p>
<p><b><i>Preface:</i></b> While there seems to be general agreement
that the property tax plays a significant role in economic
development, there is far less agreement on the nature and importance
of that role. Concern has been rising as to whether the property tax
(and especially the real estate tax) acts as a possible deterrent to
continued progress in economic development in general and to urban
development in particular. Lack of knowledge about the property tax
in the face of this rising concern has prompted the Committee on
Taxation, Resources and Economic Development to direct and encourage
scholarly attention to the problem.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the present volume is to help fill this
scholarly gap by inquiring into the nature and operation of the
components of the real estate tax and how they are related to
economic development. Experts in the dual disciplines of the property
tax and economic development have shared in the inquiry, and their
contributions have been brought together in this volume.</p>
<p>Part I presents a theoretical analysis of taxes on land and
buildings and of their broad effect on economic development. Various
micro and macro aspects of these taxes are considered in terms of
their general impact on the economy. Next, their impact on certain
economic problems of development is examined. Taxes on land and
building values are analyzed in terns of their effect on the
maintenance and rehabilitation of housing, urban renewal,
metropolitan growth and planning, and investment in multiple-family
housing.</p>
<p>Part II consists of five case studies which attempt to relate the
economic development of various countries to their taxes on land and
buildings. Political, economic, and social realities that influence
the course of economic development in various states and countries
often require the adoption of tax institutions considerably removed
from what one might regard as ideal. Nevertheless, the different
approaches to taxing land and building values in each country are
interesting and often instructive.</p>
<p>This book is based primarily on papers delivered at or stimulated
by the conference, "The Property Tax and Economic
Development,"&nbsp;which took place on the campus of the University
of Wisconsin--Milwaukee, during 13-15 June 1966. The chapters by
Ernest A. Englebert, Albert B. Henley, and Arthur L. Grey, Jr., are
based on unpublished papers delivered at earlier conferences, but
were included in this volume because they strengthen and complement
the other chapters. They have been brought up to date where it was
found necessary to do so and have also been integrated with the other
papers. John Strasma was in Chile at the time of the conference and
therefore was unable to present his paper in person. It fit so well
with the others, however, that it was included in Part II.</p>

5:&nbsp;<i>The Assessment of Land Value</i></b></font> edited by
Daniel M. Holland</p>
<p><b><i>dust jacket:</i></b> The American practice of taxing the
improved value of properties is being increasingly criticized as not
suited to the needs of contemporary society. Much has been claimed
for a site value tax as an alternative to the present property tax,
and support for it appears to be growing. This latest
TRED&nbsp;volume explores the feasibility of implementing such an
alternative.</p>
<p>Proponents of the site value tax see it as an aid in encouraging
construction and in alleviating distorted development patterns, such
as suburban sprawl and inner city decay. Critics, however, claim that
site and improvement values have become so inseparably blended that
the tax would be impossible to implement. Moreover, they argue, were
land alone the base, an inordinately high rate of taxation would be
required. Here, twelve students of public finance, assessors, and
planners -- all recognized experts in their fields -- consider
whether modern assessment practice is capable of assessing land
values with sufficient accuracy to make site value tax administrable.
They also address themselves to legal and transitional problems which
would develop in changing to a site value tax and consider the
prospects for revenue adequacy under such a tax.</p>
<p><i>The Assessment of Land Value</i> will be of interest and
assistance to scholars in economics, business, public finance and
administration, political science, planning and urban affairs, and to
practicing lawyers, municipal and county administrators, planners,
assessors, bankers, developers, and others concerned with the role of
property taxation in social development.</p>

<i>Government Spending &amp;&nbsp;Land Values:&nbsp;Public Money
&amp;&nbsp;Private Gain</i></b></font><font size="+1"><b><i>
</i></b></font>edited by C. Lowell Harriss (1973)</p>
<p><b><i>Dust jacket: </i></b>Billions of tax dollars are spent
annually on government subsidy programs which are designed to help
certain groups, areas, and industries, and contribute to the general
welfare. Despite the good intentions of legislators, however,
analysts point to evidence that the programs are not only burdensome
for the taxpayer but often fail to do their intended jobs. Critics
find that major benefits go not to those whom the programs are
designed to help, but to others who can "capitalize" on them.</p>
<p>One major feature of the subsidy benefit pattern -- unintended but
predictable -- is the capitalization of land values. The value of
land will increase when the benefits, chiefly money income, are
enhanced by government subsidization. When the land is sold, the
benefit of a subsidy which seems likely to continue will be captured
by the seller. Thereafter, tax funds that continue to subsidize a
program will not fully benefit those for whom they were presumably
intended, but the seller will have made a capital gain.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;classic example can be drawn from the experience of
federal farm programs. Taxpayers and consumers have been spending
billions annual to aid some farmers. In practice, of course, these
programs have often -- and intentionally -- reduced farm output and
raised consumer prices. The consumer-taxpayer is thus dealth a double
blow, in effect subsidizing an increase in his own food prices. Yet
the operating farmer, burdened with a higher land price, fails to get
the full benefits of the programs established for his welfare.</p>
<p>In farm programs, as in some other subsidy programs, the expected
annual benefits are capitalized into higher land prices. Then, after
land prices have gone up to reflect these benefits, the annual
payments to farm operators in effect support the higher land prices.
In effect, the seller of land realizes the benefits of government
subsidy into perpetuity. A somewhat similar pattern is to be expected
in other public spending programs, including those concerned with
urban renewal, where benefits are localized.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The pattern shows that
farm programs do not raise wages of low-paid farm labor, that urban
projects do not rid cities of slums, and that the taxpayer-consumer
bears the burden of both.</span></p>
<p>This volume explores, and at least attempts to define, the extent
to which land values tend to capture the benefits of subsidies and
other government spending through capitalization. It includes papers
by proponents as well as critics. The contributors, who include some
of the nation's leading economists, discuss the nature and effects of
farm and housing programs, commodity price supports, transportation
outlays, land preservation projects, water resource development, and
urban renewal programs. Their work will be of more than routine
interest to economists, political scientists, lawyers, political
officeholders and government officials, planners, and all others who
seek to unravel the complex fabric of multi-billion-dollar government
spending programs.</p>

Taxation and the Finance of Education</i></b></font>, edited by
Richard W. Lindholm</p>
<p><b><i>Dust jacket:</i></b> No single tax as aroused so much heated
or widespread public controversy in the past decade as the property
tax, which is the major single source of support for public
elementary and secondary education.</p>
<p>In this volume, more than twenty experts -- including tax
economists, a lawyer and a professor of education administration --
present their reasoned views on the strengths and weaknesses of the
property tax system, while comparing it with other possible revenue
sources. Together, they develop a comprehensive theory and philosophy
of the use of the property tax and land value taxation to finance
public education.</p>
<p>The contributors give thorough consideration to the impact of
recent court decisions in California, Texas and New Jersey on the use
of the property tax to finance education, and they present three
special studies of the specific problems of the Boston, Baltimore and
Chicago systems.</p>
<p>The entire problem of the relation of the property tax and the
land value tax to taxpayer ability to pay is analyzed in depth. The
contributors give full consideration to alternative sources of
educational support, and they examine the strengths and weaknesses of
a uniform statewide property or land value tax. Their work makes
clear their belief that the structure and administration of the
property tax can be improved in virtually all areas of the country,
but that we are not yet prepared to abandon the property tax as a
major educational support source.</p>
<p>This, the first book to explore this problem fully, will be of
immediate and lasting value to everyone concerned with this crucial
area of public policy. Legislators will depend on this material to
act with confidence in deciding on basic education finance policies.
School superintendents will welcome it for its new insights in the
light of recent developments in other regions. Government officials
and tax lawyers will depend on it for its reliable summary of current
knowledge and its informed opinions. Finally, this book will be
called upon to serve in many college and university courses dealing
with both taxation and education.</p>
<p><b><i>Preface</i></b><i>: </i>The costs of education provided for
the young people of America has skyrocketed because of the greater
numbers in the basic education age bracket and the rapidly rising
costs of instruction. One result of this situation has been a greater
increase of property tax collections than was generally considered
twenty years ago. Rising costs have caused local property tax
collections to increase more rapidly than personal income.</p>
<p>For many years the data have clearly demonstrated a close
association in many sections of the nation between property tax rates
and school financing requirements, and the lack of a close
association between the value of taxable property and school revenue
needs. State education foundation programs and related state revenue
allocation schemes have been adopted to reduce the obvious
inequitableness of the situation. It is very generally realized these
programs have failed to do the equalization of the economic burden of
public education that is required under the general understanding of
equal treatment clauses of many state constitutions. As a result,
court decisions, citizen protests, and the findings of numerous
studies have examined new approaches to the finance of education. It
has become one of America's major areas for social-political-economic
examination aimed at change.</p>
<p>This book presents the papers and discussions of a conference
titled <i>Property Taxation and the Finance of Education, </i> that
was held on the campus of the University of Wisconsin, Madison,
Wisconsin, during the period October 20-22, 1972. The conference's
purpose was to examine what has been learned in this general area
through special studies, legal considerations, and theoretical
economic analyses.</p>
<p>Twenty of the participants presented papers that carefully
considered important aspects of the finance of education. Although
the emphasis is on finance and American procedures, consideration is
given to expenditure effectiveness and foreign experience.</p>
<p>The four groupings of papers and discussions have been made to
assist the reader in where to place his original emphasis.
Understanding of the problem requires the interaction and combination
of many types of information. Therefore, compartmentalization and a
given organization can only be offered as one approach to
understanding.</p>
<p>The first grouping used is titled "Theoretical and General
Considerations." The papers and discussions of Part I give
perspective to the problem through provision of background materials
of a historical, international, theoretical and political character.
The Conference Review Hour tackles the question of the relationship
between financing and the purpose of education.</p>
<p>Part II, titled "Statewide Approaches" examines the general
character of the property tax as a source of education financing
funds. Attention is concentrated on the use of uniform statewide
taxes. Although some emphasis is given to statewide taxes other than
a property tax, it is the property tax, and particularly site value
taxation, i.e., taxation of land, that receives the major attention.
The Conference Review Hour is largely concerned with the location of
the economic burden of the property tax.</p>
<p>Part III, "Legal Adjustments and Restrictions," considers the
legal adjustments that court decisions are requiring and the
restrictions that may be placed on taxation procedures used to
finance education. The experts and the states have been chosen to
assure consideration of a variety of legal and legislative
situations. The Conference Review Hour examines the relation of local
control to statewide financing.</p>
<p>Part IV centers on school finance developments in metropolitan
areas and is titled "Metropolitan Area and City Fiscal
Environment."&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, revenue sources other than a property
tax are considered, but this time the desirability of alternatives is
related to local conditions. Consideration is given to spending
decisions for education arising from the local election process. The
Conference Review Hour considers a variety of topics, including the
taxable base of the income tax and the local government needs of
older people.</p>
<p>The moderator of the Conference Review Hour was Professor Daniel
M. Holland, editor of the <i>National Tax Journal.</i> Professor Eli
Schwartz of Lehigh University has edited the materials presented at
the Conference Review Hours. The editor wishes to than all of the
participants for their wonderful cooperation and to ask forgiveness
for all inconveniences his efforts caused.</p>
<p>The Conference and this book owe much to the stimulus and support
of the Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development
(TRED) and the John C. Lincoln and the Robert Schalkenbach
Foundations.</p>

Land Use &amp;&nbsp;Public Policy</i></b></font><b> </b>edited by
Arthur D. Lynn, Jr.</p>
<p><b><i>Preface:</i></b> One reviewer of an earlier volume in the
TRED&nbsp;series noted that the group had once again "rushed in where
angels fear to tread." Such may again the the case here where,
despite the natural and obvious limitations that a relatively brief
conference imposed upon both the breadth and depth of consideration
possible, property taxation, land use, and public policy are explored
in order to ascertain at least in a preliminary fashion the impact of
the interrelationship of property taxation and land use patterns upon
present and prospective public policy.</p>
<p>Recent years have witnessed a growing national debate about
appropriate public policy designed to enhance the quality and style
of life in a technological society. One conference, which considers
only a particular subset of that debate, can at best make only an
incremental contribution to the range of understandings conducive to
formation of the consensus necessary for effective agreement about
appropriate public policy. Nonetheless, given that caveat dictated by
what might be termed becoming modesty, we are convinced of the
cumulative value of such contributions to the process of long-run
policy determination.</p>
<p>Property taxation has been much considered by TRED as well as by
many other observers and analysts. The tax has been roundly
criticized time out of mind, and certainly the phrase <i>natura non
facit saltum </i> is descriptive of the process of adjustment and
improvement of this ancient levy. Nonetheless, positive development
occurs. Ronald Welch recently noted five significant changes in the
property tax during the past four decades. These included its virtual
elimination as a source of state revenues, a relative decline as a
source of local government general revenue, a substantial increase in
total revenue dollars produced, a tendency to become less general in
coverage due to the development of both increased exemptions and
additional classification of property categories for ad valorem tax
purposes, and finally, distinct improvements in property tax
administration.* His summary comment serves to remind us that change
occurs even if sometimes only at a glacial rate. Even so, concern
continues about the effect of the tax upon land use and resource
allocation as well as the character and results of the tax in terms
of received criteria such as economic neutrality and distributional
equity. Similarly, while classifications or exemption have often
accorded preferential treatment to farm land, household personalty,
and business inventories, significant analytical and policy questions
remain concerning possible partial or complete untaxing of
improvements and the classification of land for ad valorem tax
purposes.</p>
<p>While property tax change has progressed at a rather slow and
uneven pace, a congeries of other developments have generated
increased interest in both urban and rural land use policy,
especially the former. Many concerned with land use improvement
potentials have concluded from their examination of the evidence that
land use planning must be strengthened and improved, especially at
the state level. In this connection, the possibility of adjustment of
the property tax base from land and improvements to heavier taxation
of land has received renewed attention not merely in terms of
traditional justifications but also in relation to the presumed land
use effects of such a policy change. Accordingly, it seemed
appropriate for the Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic
Development (TRED) to consider the impact of the interrelationship of
property taxation and land use patterns upon public policy, including
but by no means limited to the potential untaxing of
improvements.</p>

<p><i>dust jacket: </i>What, if anything, should be done to control
the rate of urban growth or to direct it into particular
activities?</p>
<p>How should zoning laws be changed to achieve the most efficient
patterns of urban land use?</p>
<p>How great is the risk that a move toward areawide metropolitan
government would increase locat hal government expenditures and tax
burdens?</p>
<p>How real are the fears that higher local taxes will repel business
enterprises and thereby frustrate the efforts of hard-pressed city
governments to raise more money?</p>
<p>How can the property tax be improved and what will be the effects
of different measures designed to do so?</p>
<p>How would different families be affected by a shift from local
property to local income taxation or by the assumption of more state
responsibility for the financing of particular local government
programs?</p>
<p>What impact does the federal income tax have on local land use and
development, and which federal tax reforms should local officials
especially push for?</p>
<p>This book addresses some of the most heatedly discussed of
contemporary urban issues and problems, centering around policies and
practice of metropolitan financing and growth mangement. Included are
examinations of the experience in Oregon (which, in 1973, became the
first state to adopt statewide regulations on land use), as well as
in Toronto, Boston and Milwaukee. The three chapters on property tax
reform will be of special interest to those who have long questioned
the theory and implementation of this, the nation's major source of
support for primary and secondary public education.</p>

Taxation of Urban Property in Less Developed
Countries</i></b></font>, edited by Roy W. Bahl</p>
<p><i>from the dust jacket</i> Taxes on property are the single most
important source of locally raised tax revenue for urban governments
in less developed countries. Moreover, since central and state
governments have generally preempted the sales and income tax bases,
and since urban government expenditure needs to continue to press, it
seems likely that the role of rban property taxes will become even
more important.</p>
<p>Yet with this importance and potential, surprisingly little is
known about the practive of urban property taxation in less developed
countries. Comparative norms are not available, and there has been
little information compiled about successful and unsuccessful
experiences, despite a rich history of experimentation with urban
property taxation in developing countries, particularly with the use
of the tax to influence the use of urban land.</p>
<p>The objective of this volume, and the TRED conference from which
it came, is to take a step toward filling this gap in our knowledge
about the practice and impacts of urban property taxes in less
developed countries. This volume will be of interest and value to
economists, political scientists, historians, and all scholars and
students whose interests include the problems of developing
countries. Planners, managers, and other professionals in government
and industry will also find much of value here.</p>

<i>Land Value Taxation:&nbsp;</i>The Progress and Poverty<i>
Centenary</i></b></font>, edited by Richard W. Lindholm and Arthur D.
Lynn, Jr.</p>
<p><b><i>Dust jacket:</i></b> In these days of economic doubt and
turmoil, the writings of the classical economists are being
reexamined with more than ordinary interest. A century ago, the
American economist Henry George published his best-known work,
<i>Progress and Poverty. </i></p>
<p>George's ideas, although they created a stir at the time, never
found a place in the mainstream of American economic thought as they
did, for instance, in Australia and New Zealand. American
democratic-capitalism, rather, was later built on the aggregate
economic thought of John Maynard Keynes and a long string of
successors who followed macro-type economic analysis and had no fear
of government deficits. The country's current economic problems have
not, however, found solutions in Keynesian economics. Perhaps,
suggest the contributors to this volume, it is time to reexamine the
revolutionary philosophy of Henry George.</p>
<p>George offered an answer to Marxism that has never been accepted
widely in other developed or developing countries. Each of this
volume's contributors -- both seasoned economists and young
experimental economists -- adds to an understanding of why the George
alternative to both Keynes and Marx has never been really accepted,
and what promise it holds for resolving some of today's problems.</p>
<p>This is the first book to assess the potential of George's land
taxation philosophy to eliminate inflation, balance governmental
budgets, increase investment and productivity, and expand
opportunities for employment in both developed and developing
economies. Sections by Alan Prest and Kenneth Boulding are essential
for a basic understanding of the Georgian perspective. Mason Gaffney
and Matthew Edel provide a historical understanding for George's lack
of acceptance in the past, while sections by Arlo Woolery, Richard
Lindholm, and Roger Sturtevant show how George's land tax concepts
can be applied to local government in the United States.</p>
<p>George's theory stems from his interest in the maximum utilization
of resources and his observation that among the foundations of
production land is unique because the supply does not change with
price shifts. He observed that, while the cost of land rises as
population grows and production increases, the increased income from
the land does not, and cannot, result in a meaningful expansion of
supply.</p>
<p>He saw, too, that while governments needed more money to provide
necessary services for growing populations, other forms of increased
taxation had serious negative effects. Taxes on wages reduced the
efficiency and availability of labor, while taxes on capital reduced
investment. Higher taxes on land, however, could be collected without
reducing the returns to labor and capital. In addition, land taxes
could encourage full use of land potential.</p>
<p>This thorough reexamination of Henry George, and of the potential
value of his thought to the economic problems of the 1980s, will be
of immediate interest not only to practicing economists and
educators, but also to all those who are searching for bold and
well-reasoned answers to many of our most disturbing economic
problems, world, national, state, and local.</p>
<p><b><i>Preface:</i></b><i> </i>The year 1979 was the centenary year
of <i>Progress and Poverty</i>, the first and most important work of
that unique American analyst and philosopher, Henry George.
Accordingly, it is appropriate to consider anew George's particular
role in American tax thought. This book reports the papers and
summarizes the discussions held at the 1978 Conference of the
Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development (TRED). The
discussions here included take a careful look at the writings and
conceptual positions of Henry George (1839-1897); they explore the
usefulness of George's philosophy in dealing with the modern forms of
the problems he considered a century ago.</p>
<p>The papers included were prepared by both general philosophical
and specialized tax economists, as well as by practicing tax
administrators from both Europe and the United States. Although the
preparers of papers and their several discussants represent a broad
spectrum of tax and economic thought, a general, if tentative,
consensus develops. It is that George's land tax possesses
significant utility as a source of government revenue, especially for
local government. Therefore, wider use of land value as a tax base
merits the attention of policy makers.</p>
<p>The United States continues to be a country of great progress with
substantial pockets of poverty a century after George wrote of this
in <i>Progress and Poverty</i>. George advocated wide and substantial
use of a tax on land, combined with sharply reduced taxes on earnings
and economic endeavor, in order to alleviate poverty and stimulate
progress. Yet his followers have enjoyed only modest political,
practical and academic success. Currently spiraling land prices,
general inflation, and the shortage of investment produce economic
conditions that suggest a reappraisal of tax incentives and
disincentives. The analysis of this book and the conference that it
represents, <i>Land Value Taxation in Thought and Practice</i>, will
give added insight and confidence to those considering tax system
design and the place of land as a tax base in that context. Both the
1978 conference and this book owe much to the stimulus and support of
both the members of the Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic
Development and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. As the late
Harold Groves once remarked, Henry George's contribution contains
elements of truth that are of enduring importance. It is appropriate
to recall this fact a century after the publication of his major
work.</p>
