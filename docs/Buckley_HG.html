<center><b>Henry George and the Single-Tax</b></center>
<div align="center">
  <p>William F. Buckley, Jr.</p>
  <p>[an interview with Brian Lamb, CSpan
        Book Notes, April 2-3,
      2000] </p>
</div>
<p>CALLER: Mr. Buckley, it's a pleasure to talk to you.</p>
<p>William F. Buckley, Jr.(WFB): Thank You.</p>
<p>CALLER: I've heard you describe yourself as a Georgist, a follower
of Henry George, but I haven't heard much in having you promote land
value taxation and his theories, and I'm wondering why that is the
case.</p>
<p>W.F.B.: It's mostly because I'm beaten down by my right-wing
theorists and intellectual friends. They always find something wrong
with the Single-Tax idea. What I'm talking about Mr. Lamb is Henry
George who said there is infinite capacity to increase capital and to
increase labor, but none to increase land, and since wealth is a
function of how they play against each other, land should be thought
of as common property. The effect of this would be that if you have a
parking lot and the Empire State Building next to it, the tax on the
parking lot should be the same as the tax on the Empire State
Building, because you shouldn't encourage land speculation.</p>
<p>Anyway I've run into tons of situations where I think the
Single-Tax theory would be applicable. We should remember also this
about Henry George, he was sort of co-opted by the socialists in the
20s and the 30s, but he was not one at all. Alfred J. Nock's book on
him makes that plain. Plus, also, he believes in only that tax. He
believes in zero income tax.</p>
<p>You look bored (addressing Brian Lamb)!</p>
<p>B.L.: No, no. As a matter of fact I was going to ask you about
this little book ("<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Lexicon,
A Cornucopia of Wonderful Words for the
Inquisitive Word Lover</span>"). I'm fascinated by it. I'm going to see
if
you can pronounce the word,
the-fear-of-having-peanut-butter-stuck-to-your-roof-of-your-mouth,
This little book starts off and the fellow's name, is it Jesse
Sheidlower?...</p>
<p>W.F.B.: I think so.</p>
<p>B.L.: S-H-E-I-D-L-O-W-E-R? You've never read it (the Introduction
to "The Lexicon").</p>
<p>W.F.B.: No. I never have.</p>
<p>B.L.: (Quoting the book) "The first time I met William F. Buckley,
we were both members of a televised panel discussing word. The
moderator introduced me with a pop-quiz to test my credentials asked
me to define the word..." Is it USUFRUCT?</p>
<p>W.F.B.: Usufruct, yeah.</p>
<p>B.L. (Quoting the book) "I felt smug as I recite the right to
enjoy another's property as long as you don't damage it. Then Mr.
Buckley leaned into his microphone and quoted an entire paragraph on
usufruct from the political economist, Henry George.</p>
<p>W.F.B.: Oh for heaven's sake!</p>
<p>B.L.: And this little book has..</p>
<p>W.F.B.: The land belongs to those in usufruct .<br>
</p>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td
 style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);">The
reference is from Henry George's speech entitled "<a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/the_land_for_the_people.html">The Land for the People</a>".<br>
      <br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">We start out with these two
principles, which I think are clear and self-evident: 
      <ul>
        <li>that which a man makes belongs to him and can by him be
given or sold to anyone that he pleases.        </li>
        <li>But that which existed before man came upon the earth, that
which was not produced by man, but which was created by God-that
belongs equally to all men.        </li>
      </ul>
As no man made the land, so no man can claim a right of ownership in
the land. As God made the land, and as we know both from natural
perception and from revealed religion, that God the Creator is no
respecter of persons, that in His eyes all men are equal, so also do we
know that He made this earth equally for all the human creatures that
He has called to dwell upon it. We start out with this clear principle
that as all men are here by the equal permission of the Creator, as
they are all here under His laws equally requiring the use of land, as
they are all here with equal right to live, so they are all here with
equal right to the enjoyment of His bounty.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We claim that the land
of Ireland, like the land of every country, cannot justly belong to any
class, whether that class be large or small; but that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the land of Ireland, like the land of every
other country, justly belongs in </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">usufruct </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">to the whole people of that country equally,</span>
and that no man and no class of men can have any just right in the land
that is not equally shared by all others.</span> ...<br>
      <br>
THESE are the plain, simple principles for which we contend, and our
practical measure for restoring to all men of any country their equal
rights in the land of that country is <span style="font-weight: bold;">simply
to abolish other taxes, to put a tax upon the value of land,
irrespective of the improvements, to carry that tax up as fast as we
can, until we absorb the full value of the land, and we say that that
would utterly destroy the monopoly of land and create a fund for the
benefit of the entire community. </span>How easy a way that is to go
from an unjust situation like the present to an ideally just situation
may be seen among other things in this. Where you propose to take land
for the benefit of the whole people you are at once met by the demands
of the landlords for compensation. Now, if you tax them, no one ever
heard of such an idea as to compensate a people for imposing tax.<br>
      <br style="text-decoration: underline;">
      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In that easy way the
land can again be made the property in <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">usufruct </span>of the
whole people, by a gentle and gradual process.</span><br>
