<p><a name="Equal" id="Equal"></a><b>Equal Rights</b></p>
<p>We believe that the opportunities that governments assign to
citizens should be assigned in ways that recognize the equal rights
of all. Governments should not enrich some persons at the expense
of, or to the exclusion of, others. When governments must assign
opportunities that cannot be made available to all, those to whom the
opportunities are assigned should be required to pay into the public
treasury, on an annual basis, an amount equal to what the
opportunities would have been worth to others.</p>
<p>For some opportunities this principle is widely recognized. An
example would be the allocation of off-shore oil drilling rights. No
one says that governments should decide how much drilling rights each
oil company deserves, and pass the rights out without charge. It is
recognized that the value of these rights ought to accrue to the
public treasury, and any company that extracts the oil should be
obliged to pay, through an auction, what the rights it exercises
would have been worth to some other oil company. We believe that this
principle should be applied to all opportunities that are assigned by
governments.</p>
<a name="Ending" id="Ending"></a><b>Ending Privilege</b>
<p>When the principle that the value of government-assigned
opportunities should be received by the public treasury is violated,
the result is "privilege," which from its Latin roots means
"<b>private law</b>," that is, law that permits one person to do what
others are not permitted to do. Thus what we stand for is an end to
privilege.</p>
<p>Numerous examples of privilege are incorporated in our
institutions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Farm legislation restricts the growing of tobacco to those who
have been assigned acreage allotments.</li>
  <li>For numerous commodities, trade legislation limits shipments from
individual countries to specified quotas.</li>
  <li>In many cities, only persons who have been given permits are
allowed to operate taxis, and new permits are not issued.</li>
  <li>To operate a radio or television station requires a license, and
there are no opportunities for new licenses to be issued.</li>
  <li>In most cities, construction of commercial or multi-family
residential structures requires zoning permission that is granted to
some and not to others.</li>
  <li>But the single most important category of privilege is land
titles.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list of examples of privilege, which is by no means
exhaustive, contains some privileges, such as acreage allotments and
import quotas, that would be best reformed by eliminating
restrictions and permitting all to do what now only some may do. For
other privileges, such as broadcast licenses and land titles, great
productivity results from the social understanding that a specified
individual will have the use of a given resource. For these
privileges, the best reform is the introduction of the requirement
that any person who is assigned such an opportunity must pay to the
public treasury an annual fee equal to what the opportunity would be
worth to someone else.</p>
For other privileges, such as zoning restrictions, there is no
need to allocate exclusive access to a resource, but there may still
be good reasons for limiting the amount of the controlled activity,
because of the costs it imposes on others. For such a privilege, the
reform we recommend is the introduction of a tax corresponding to the
costs imposed by the activity, combined with a rule that anyone who
pays the tax is permitted to engage in the activity. Thus, by the
combination of eliminating unnecessary restrictions, introducing fees
for exclusive access to resources, and introducing taxes for engaging
in permissible activities that have adverse consequences for others,
all private gain from privilege can be eliminated.<br>
<p><a name="Land" id="Land"></a><b>Equal Rights to Land</b></p>
<p>The component of this perspective that is likely to be most
controversial is our belief that the value that individuals receive
from the exclusive use of land should be collected publicly. As this
idea is reflected in our name and central to our philosophy, we now
discuss it in some detail.</p>
<p>It is because land was not created by human effort that land
titles are privileges, for which fees are properly collected. A plot
of land is a bit of space on the earth, with access to other plots,
access to public utilities and other public services, natural
resources, and natural soil fertility. All of these features that
give value to a plot of land.</p>
<p>None of them resulted from effort on the part of the person who
has title to the plot. The size of the plot, its natural resources
and natural fertility are gifts of nature. To the extent that value
arises from access to public utilities and other public services, it
is governments that give value to land. To the extent that value
arises from the intensity of economic activity on nearby sites, it is
the users of those nearby sites that give value to land.</p>
<p>The unimproved value of land is in no way attributable to actions
of the person who holds title to the land.</p>
Of course, when land is used, people add improvements, and the
value resulting from the addition of improvements to land is value to
which a user of land can have a respectable claim. Thus the fee that
the public can properly require of the user of improved land is the
rent that the land would command if it were unimproved. This fee
should not be higher for land that is extensively improved than for
similarly situated land that is less highly improved. The art of
assessment, discussed in a later section, deals with the estimation
of such values.<br>
<p><a name="Proper" id="Proper"></a><b>The Proper
Disposition of Returns to Different Factors of Production</b></p>
<p>The idea that the rent of land is properly collected by
governments is an example of the more general idea that it is
important to distinguish the different "factors of production"
identified by classical political economy. The return to each factor
has a proper destination.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The contributions of human abilities to productive efforts are
called "labor," the return to labor is called "wages," and the
appropriate recipients of wages are those whose labor contributes to
productive activities.</li>
  <li>The contributions of past human products to productive efforts
are called "capital," the return to capital is called "interest," and
the appropriate recipients of interest are those who past saving made
the creation of capital possible.</li>
  <li>The contributions of government-assigned opportunities to the
productive process are called "land," the return to land is called
"rent," and the appropriate recipient of rent is the public treasury.</li>
</ul>
<p name="Replacing Existing Taxes"><a name="Replacing" id="Replacing"></a><b>Replacing Existing
      Taxes</b></p>
<p>When we say that the appropriate recipient of rent is the public
treasury, it should be understood that this is not in addition to
existing sources of public revenue, but rather instead of existing
sources of public revenue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Those who contribute labor to productive processes should be
allowed to keep the wages that result from their labor.</li>
  <li>Those whose saving makes the creation of capital possible should
be allowed to keep the interest that accrues from the use of capital.</li>
  <li>But there is no one who has a corresponding claim to the return
to land. This is the reason that fees for the use of land and other
opportunities assigned by government ought to be the primary source of
government revenue.</li>
</ul>
While one might call such fees "taxes," we consider that
designation inappropriate, because the word "tax" connotes an
exaction from someone of something to which he or she has a just
claim, and we deny that there are such just claims with respect to
land. We expect that the collection of fees for the full value of
opportunities assigned by governments would provide adequate revenue
for all necessary government expenditures.<br>
<p><a name="Reducing" id="Reducing"></a><b>Reducing the Price of
Land</b></p>
<p>We recognize that the implementation of our ideas will lead to the
disappearance of the sale value of titles to unimproved land and
other forms of privilege. While some will see this as an unjust
confiscation of property, we deny this.</p>
<p>We believe that it is possible to implement our ideas while
remaining true to <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_PJER.html">principles of justice</a>.
We note first that, while we
propose to introduce or increase fees for exclusive access to
opportunities assigned by governments, we also propose to eliminate
existing taxes.</p>
<p>For many people the value of eliminating existing taxes will
offset the fall in the market value of the privileges they now claim.
But it cannot be expected that all persons experience full offsets.
There will be some persons whose income prospects fall as a
consequence of the implementation of our ideas. But this in itself
does not constitute injustice. Every change disappoints someone.</p>
<p>It is our view that what makes a disappointing change an injustice
is not the fact of disappointment, but rather a self-seeking
disregard for adverse consequences to those whose prospects fall.
Such selfish disregard for others must be distinguished from the
implementation of new moral insights. Of course, one can always try
to hide self-seeking proposals behind a facade of alleged
principle.</p>
Thus the necessary distinctions are difficult to make, but this
does not justify abandoning the effort to make them.&nbsp;
<p><a name="Importance" id="Importance"></a><b>The Importance of
Constitutional Change</b></p>
<p>One important way of seeking to ensure that a new proposal that
disappoints some persons is not selfishly motivated is to require the
proposal to clear not just the hurdles for new legislation, but the
higher, more elaborate hurdles for constitutional amendments. It is
an unfortunate fact that legislative processes are all too often
dominated by well-organized special interests.</p>
<p>The constitutional amendment process, on the other hand, requires
such broad consensus that domination by special interests is highly
unlikely.</p>
We believe that while some steps in the direction of our ideas can
be properly undertaken through legislation alone, the full
implementation of our ideas should occur through a process of
constitutional amendment that would signify a social consensus that
privilege is intolerable.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><a name="Historical" id="Historical"></a><b>Historical
Precedents</b></p>
<p>We are not the first people to assert that governments should not
allow anyone to appropriate an excessive share of nature's bounty.
Hints of our ideas can be found in the writings of 17th century
English philosopher, John Locke.</p>
<p>The physiocrats of 18th century France: Quesnay, Turgot, Condorcet
and others who sought to reform that country's tax system prior to
its bloody revolution understood the importance of collecting a
nation's revenue from levies upon land. The 19th century English
philosophers Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill understood the
injustice of claims to the ownership of land, though they could not
bring themselves to recommend the fiscal measures that flow naturally
from that insight.</p>
<p>But the person whose writings gave greatest impetus to our ideas
was the 19th century American social philosopher, <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/About_HG.html">Henry George</a>. His
books and <a href="../HG/writings.htm">speeches</a> contain
powerful elucidations of ideas that we
espouse. We particularly recommend <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b></a>
and <b><i>Protection or Free Trade</i></b>. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">It should be understood
that while we admire George's work, we do not regard him as an
infallible authority. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our commitment
is to principles of justice that
we believe are part of the understanding of all open-minded people.
George is the person who, in our view, has provided the best written
expression of these principles so far.</span></span></p>
<p>Among the famous persons who have endorsed George's ideas are
Albert Einstein, Leo Tolstoy, Winston Churchill, and Sun Yat Sen.</p>
<p><a name="Creating" id="Creating"></a><b>Creating a More
Productive Economy</b></p>
<p>The ideas we espouse are attractive not only for their embodiment
of principles of justice, but also because they can be expected to
lead to a more productive economy.</p>
<p>Economists agree that the imposition of taxes generally retards an
economy. The reason for this is that with almost all taxes, it is
possible for a tax payer to reduce total tax collections by doing
less of whatever is taxed--work less, spend less, save less, etc.
This means that taxes generate an incentive to be less
productive.</p>
<p>With fees for the use of government-assigned opportunities, on the
other hand, the only thing that a person can do to reduce the amount
of money that he or she pays is to use fewer of these opportunities.
But then the opportunities can be used by someone else, who will pay
the fees, and total public revenue will be unchanged. There is no
possibility reducing total government revenue by being less
productive. Thus these fees can be collected without dragging down
the economy in the way that existing taxes do.</p>
<p>Our ideas provide for the natural financing of any worthwhile
public expenditure that makes a particular area more attractive or
productive--parks, freeways, subways, sewer systems, etc. These
public expenditures raise the rental value of land in their vicinity,
and thereby raise the fees that can be collected for using the land.
If the activity is worthwhile, the increase in rental values will be
sufficient to pay for the activity.</p>
<p>Another way in which our ideas promote a more efficient economy is
by eliminating the opportunity grow rich by having government promote
one's own interest at the expense of others. Such distortions of the
political process can occur either by persuading a government agency
to spend money in a way that raises the value of land that one owns
while others foot the bill, or by persuading a government agency to
prohibit others from doing what one is permitted to do. In both kinds
of cases, the person who promotes his or her own interest has no
reason to take account of the costs that are thereby imposed on
others, and typically these costs to others are greater than the
self-seeking benefits. This makes the economy less productive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the very possibility of growing rich by manipulating
government action draws talented people into the effort to manipulate
government decisions, when they could be employed doing something
useful.</p>
<a name="Making" id="Making"></a><b>Making Housing
Affordable</b>
<p>The implementation of our ideas would have a dramatic effect in
making housing more affordable. The principal reason why housing
costs have risen so much is that the price of land has risen
enormously. Some increase in the price of access to land is a natural
accompaniment of an increasing population.</p>
<p>But the very great increases of recent years, which have made it
nearly impossible for young families to afford houses of their own,
have additional causes. The implementation of our ideas would bring
down the price of access to land in three ways.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, much land is held off the
market by speculators who may wait generations do decide to develop it.</span>
The introduction of a fee for holding land, whether used or not, equal
to the rental value of the land, will induce speculators to either
develop this land themselves or turn it over to someone who will.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, an important cause of
higher prices for access to land by those who wish to build low-cost
housing is zoning restrictions. </span>These restrictions are
introduced by political factions that already have their houses and do
not mind if housing becomes scarcer. It just raises the market value of
their homes. But if a rise in land values were accompanied by rises in
the fees that existing residents had to pay for the use of the land on
which their houses sit, they would have an incentive to do what they
could to make land plentiful rather than scarce, and zoning
restrictions could be expected to diminish.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third, a person who wishes to
own a house must borrow money to cover the price of buying the title to
the land on which the house sits as well as the cost of the house
itself. </span>If the use of land required the payment of a fee equal
to the rental value of land, so that the selling price of land titles
became virtually zero, then the amount of money that a family would
have to borrow to purchase a house would fall.</li>
</ul>
<a name="Applications" id="Applications"></a><b>Applications
Abroad as Well as at Home</b>
<p>As important as our ideas are for the justice and efficiency of
the American economy, their application is even more important in
less developed countries, where often 80% of the land is held by 3%
of the population. To give all the citizens of these countries
chances to make something of their lives, it is extremely important
to equalize access to land, not by redividing the land (which
inevitably winds up putting land into the hands of people who cannot
use it well) but by requiring any one who uses land to pay according
to the unimproved value of the land that he or she uses. To bring
this message to the world, we must first apply it to ourselves.</p>
