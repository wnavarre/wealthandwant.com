<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxation
of Interjurisdictional E-Commerce</span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Notes from the speech by Mason Gaffney
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">Professor of Economics, University of
California - Riverside </div>
<div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">October, 1999
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most writers and reporters in this
new field accept state and
local sales taxes as part of the ordained order of things.</span> The
predominant attitude is one of how to preserve and raise the state
sales tax, by taxing purchases from "foreign" (out-of-state)
sources, which are regarded as an administrative nuisance and a
leakage. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern textbooks on public finance
do not treat the general retail
sales tax as the historical novelty that it is. They no longer
mention that no state taxed retail sales until 1929 (GA) and 1930
(MS), and most not until 1933 (when California joined the movement
with a rate of 2%) and the mid-thirties, by which time half the
states joined in. Few books give any weight to the fact that 5 states
and one province (Alberta) have no sales tax at all: the states are
Alaska, Oregon, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Montana. </span>The
academics
treat these states as eccentrics and laggards, and trivialize them
for their small populations, but the states in question, which have
10 U.S. Senators among them, do not see themselves that way at all.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One of them, Oregon, in 1980 retired the powerful Chairman of the
House Committee on Ways and Means, Al Ullman, because he championed a
Federal VAT.  </li>
  <li>Another, New Hampshire, plays a key role in screening
presidential candidates. It is rather a matter of some local pride,
not to mention commercial advantage.  </li>
</ul>
People speak casually about a
uniform Federal standard for all states (and all cities and counties
within states, over 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in all). But state
taxes are a power reserved to each state; not one they will quietly
abandon.
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Few academics show much concern
about the sales tax's partiality
and non-uniformity. They enumerate a few exemptions, but then favor
it because it allegedly exempts capital formation.</span> </p>
<p>Even some decentralists seem to favor federal action to promote
state sales taxes. Here is the attitude of Charles McLure of the
Hoover Institution, who wrote, "I believe sales taxes to be the most
appropriate form of tax for state and local govts. to use." He adds,
" ... the ridiculously unfair and distortionary de facto exemption of
interstate sales by mail- order houses" should be banned by federal
legislation. (Curiously, the main theme of McLure's article is in
favor of intergovernmental tax competition, which would seem to rule
out sales taxes. McLure is a bright and savvy economist, but he gives
no support for his "belief.") McLure is currently active with ACEC,
and, not surprisingly, is advising the states to find ways to tax
e-commerce. </p>
<p>Even more surprising is the attitude of business sources. You'd
think they'd show some delight that a new way has been found to
undercut the sales tax. Instead, many of these works might as well be
written by tax administrators. Their main concern may be making sure
that other firms pay, too. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">My viewpoint is the reverse. I am
here to explore how e-commerce
may work as a lever to lower or quash sales taxes, and to show how
states may do that without making catastrophic quakes or waves.</span> </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"> The Commerce Clause</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution bans state taxes on interstate commerce.
"The Congress shall have the power ... to regulate Commerce with
foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian
tribes; ... " - (Article I, Sect. 8).</p>
<p>"No State shall, w/o the consent of Congress, lay any Imposts or
Duties on Imports or Exports, ... (Article I, Sect. 10). This
reinforces the commerce clause of Sect. 8. </p>
<p>The Commerce Clause has preserved interstate tax competition.
Without it, it is likely that state sales taxes would rise to 20% or
more in short order, as the wholesome fear of interstate competition
was stifled. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It created and has
preserved our domestic market, the
greatest free trade zone in the world, an essential ingredient of
American productivity and prosperity. It is not something to be
thrown away lightly, especially not for the sake of something as
baneful as the retail sales tax.</span> </p>
<p>Sections 8 and 10 are there by design. James Monroe was the
leading champion (T.J. Norton, p.51), so I shall herein call the
Commerce Clause "The Monroe Doctrine" -- one that did and does more
for the greatness of the U.S.A. than the better-known doctrine of the
same name (which was actually the work of J.Q. Adams, anyway). </p>
<p>Media and academic pundits slight domestic trade, yet this is the
basis of our greatness. They write and speak of "trade" and
"commerce" and "specialization" as basic good things, but synonymous
with international trade. (Look up "commerce" in The New Palgrave
Dictionary of Economics: it says "see International Trade.") States
and cities speak of their export industries as their "economic base,"
yet their internal trade is far more important (Jane Jacobs). Case of
Erie Canal: it thrived and made money for 20 years based purely on
internal trade, inside the state of NY (Carter Goodrich, Philip
Cornick). </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a
 name="How Congress might circumvent t"></a><b>How Congress
might circumvent the Monroe Doctrine - but probably won't</b></p>
<p><a name="A. &quot;The consent of Congress.&quot;"></a><b>A. "The consent of
Congress." </b></p>
<p>States may tax imports "with the consent of Congress." McGoldrick
v. Berwind White (1940) established they might apply a sales tax if
the seller has a nexus in the taxing state. Quill Co. v. N.D. 1992,
seems to have established that Congress has the power to enact
legislation allowing states to levy sales and use tax on remote
sales, including mail-order and electronic sales, without the current
requirement of physical presence. Congress and the President have the
power to require all online vendors (and all mail-order sellers) to
collect sales and use tax on all sales to all states. </p>
<p>That's interesting, but Congress doesn't pass laws just because it
may. It also has power to tax capital gains as they accrue, but it
never has, and the leading case where the U.S.S.C. advised Congress
it has this power is usually cited to show the opposite, because the
Court told the Administration it needed the consent of Congress
(Eisner v. Macomber, 1920). The very first power the Constitution
enumerates for Congress is the power to levy a national land tax
(Art. I, Sect. 2, Para. 3), but it hasn't since 1862. </p>
<p>Congress has not lacked for urging and lobbying by the States. The
ACEC includes a large number of state representatives who keep
asking for authority to tax remote sales, both electronic and
traditional.<br>
</p>
<a name="B. The Uniformity Requirement"></a><b>B. The Uniformity
Requirement </b>
<p>Congress is bound by the constitutional mandate of uniformity.
"... all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the
U.S." (Art. I, Sect. 8). Many states are not so bound. There are over
7,000 sales tax jurisdictions (counting cities and counties), and
constant flux in the rules. Then there are business license fees: in
Riverside, California, for example, business license fees vary from
business to business because the city uses 35 (sic) formulas to
calculate the charge. Some fees are based on gross receipts, which
would seem to make them city sales taxes, too. The chances of
achieving uniformity seem remote, indeed. </p>
<p>One might object that many Federal taxes appear non-uniform, but
"the uniformity of taxation throughout the U.S. is geographic, not
intrinsic" (Bromley v. McCaughn, 1929; also the Head Money Cases,
1884). Thus, the U.S. may tax maple syrup and exempt cotton, but it
must do so the same in every state. </p>
<p>Then there are the 5 states without any sales taxes at all. Can
Congress get into helping enforce a Duty, Impost or Excise in 45
states while exempting five? </p>
<p><a name="C. Zeitgeist"></a><b>C. Zeitgeist </b></p>
<p>The spirit of the times is for Decentralization and "Devolution" --
of power and responsibility from the Feds to the states. There are
large cuts in Federal programs. Some old centralists, like Alice
Rivlin, are still proposing a national sales tax or VAT to be divided
among the states, but they are swimming against a current. </p>
<p>The EU and the OECD are centralist, but have hit major roadblocks
in their drive for tax "harmonization" among all nations. Even in
Europe, the "principle of subsidiarity" (Devolution) is written into
the original Maastricht Treaty. Oskar Lafontaine is gone. The
Commissioners of the EU have all been disgraced and replaced. </p>
<p><a name="D. Double taxation"></a><b>D. Double taxation </b></p>
<p>Retail sales taxation has always involved some double taxation, as
businesses buy some of their inputs at retail, and then sell their
products at retail. With e-products and services this problem grows
more severe, because most e-commerce is business to business. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a name="The novelty of e-commerce"></a><b>The
novelty of
e-commerce </b></p>
<p><b><a name="A._Tendency_to_overstate_novelty."></a>A. Tendency to
overstate novelty. </b></p>
<p>Every generation thinks it invented sex, and rewrites textbooks on
physics, math, and English composition, as well as biology, even as
the underlying disciplines remain much the same. Much literature on
e-commerce overstates its novelty and underestimates the experience,
imaginations and precedents of our forebears.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Justice Marshall in
Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824, clearly stated that "commerce" is a broad
concept not limited to trade in tangible commodities - he then
applied it to ferrying passengers across the Hudson River.  </li>
  <li>In
Pensacola Telegraph v. Western Union, 1878, Justice Waite explained
that transmitting intelligence via the new and intangible medium of
electricity was commerce, in the Monroe Doctrine meaning, and "must
not be encumbered by state legislation."  </li>
  <li>The Radio Act of 1927
subjected all forms of interstate and foreign radio transmission to
Federal control; the USSC upheld it in Federal Radio Commission v.
Nelson, 1933. </li>
</ul>
Some novel intangible electronic products may now escape the tax
net, it is true; but every retail sales tax is already riddled with
exemptions, many of them far grosser than e-products are likely to be
for some time to come. Distressing and damning as that is, it has not
served to quash retail sales taxation, which legislators love for its
revenue capacity; the addition of e-products is not likely to change
that.
<p><a name="B. Secrecy, privacy, and evasio"></a><b>B. Secrecy,
privacy, and evasion. </b></p>
<p>E-commerce allows greater secrecy in transmitting orders, making
payments, and keeping records. To tax sales, a state must know the
location of buyer, but this may not be known. Some addresses are
merely domain names. </p>
<p>Furthermore, a seller who is found to have nexus in the high-tax
state of a buyer may simply change his server location to another
state with no sales or use tax. </p>
<p><a name="C. Greater volume"></a><b>C. Greater volume </b></p>
<p>E-commerce may generate a much greater volume of "foreign"
purchases than does mail-order at present. It is easy to
overanticipate this growth, just as buyers of ".com" IPOs are prone
to overestimate future profits, but clearly this is something to
watch, even if with a jaundiced and skeptical eye. </p>
<p><a name="D. Problems with business taxes"></a><b>D. Problems with
business taxes </b></p>
<p>Many states, like California, apply a "unitary" system to dividing
the profits of MNC businesses among jurisdictions. Without it, taxes
on business income are a travesty. With e-commerce, however, the old
allocation formula is hard to implement. Under the standard
allocation formula, the state calculates the world profits of the
MNC, and then takes its cut based on its share of three elements:
sales, payroll, and property. </p>
<p><b><a name="Sales:_but_where_does_the_sale_occur"></a>Sales: but
where does the sale occur?</b> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Employees:</span> where do they
count, if they live in India and supply a
service in California, transmitting the semi-finished product by
e-mail. At what stage do you tax it? What if it is re-exported in a
final product? </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Property</span>: a lot of the
assets are intangible. These include parts
of the inventory; fixed assets in licenses, copyrights, and frequency
allocations. A lot of the assets are highly mobile, like satellites.
So, to be sure, are ships and aircraft, but the ships, at least,
often escape the tax net. Will there next be flags of convenience for
satellites? </p>
<p>Finally, there is encryption. Government security agencies have
made great strides in breaking codes and intercepting messages,
seeking out keywords, but the code-breakers have a priority in
national defense matters, and we may surmise that encryptors are
constantly racing to be a step ahead, so this is to be an endless cat
and mouse game of growing cost and uncertainty, with substantial loss
of revenue. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a name="Net result"></a><b>Net result</b></p>
<p>Look forward to a new world in which forms of taxation must change
substantially. There must be more emphasis on immobile assets. That
is not necessarily a bad thing: we've been there and done that, and
it wasn't half bad. Professor Wallace Oates, Univ. of MD, writing in
the current <em>Review of Economic Literature</em>, refers his readers to his
study of Pittsburgh, where he and a colleague found that a shift to a
more immobile tax base, land, may have caused a rise in building
activity. I cite Prof. Oates because he and Prof. Robert Schwab
approached their subject in the most cautious imaginable way, and
their conclusions are about as soft-pedaled as is humanly possible
from the data they present. </p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"> What would happen in
California if we eliminated the sales tax,
and replaced it by raising the property tax?</p>
<p><b>A. No catastrophe </b></p>
<p>Five states and the Province of Alberta already get along nicely
with no sales tax, so it must be possible. No state at all had a
retail sales tax before 1929 (GA).</p>
<ul>
  <li>California opened its gates in
1933 with the Riley-Stuart Act, and so did several other states. It
was sold as an "emergency measure," at a rate of 2%. <br>
  </li>
  <li>As late as 1977
it was 4.75%. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Now it is 7.25% statewide, with many cities, counties
and transportation districts adding their tolls to the total, but for
most of our state's existence we got along nicely with either no
sales tax, or much lower rates than today. </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Property Tax
rate would rise to a level lower than it was
before Prop. 13.</span> California sales tax revenues are currently
1.19% of
the <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Assessed
Value (A.V.)</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of
taxable property. Add that to the
current 1%, and get 2.19%, compared to 2.7% before Prop. 13 - except
that the 2.7% was applied to actual value, while today's assessed
valuations are far below that. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The A.V. value of land is
probably about 1/3 or so of market
value; buildings are closer to market.</span> </p>
<p><b>B. Greater equity.</b> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The distribution of the tax burden
would shift from poor counties
to richer ones. </span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Thus, in the poor inland counties of Fresno, Tulare,
Imperial, and Stanislaus, sales tax revenues are about 1.5% of A.V.s.  </li>
  <li>In rich coastal and suburban counties of Sta. Barbara and Marin,
sales tax revenues are about .75% of A.V.s.  </li>
</ul>
Thus, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the state sales tax
takes a lot more money from the poor counties than it would cost them
to replace the services from local taxes; the rich counties, with the
high property tax bases, are contributing less to the common pool
than they are saving in property taxes.</span>
<p>Within counties, by extension and analogy, I am reasonably certain
that a careful study will show that the burden would shift from
poorer cities and districts to richer ones. Again, among individuals,
I believe we would find the same. One of these days, God willing, I
will find the time and money to conduct or sponsor such a study. </p>
<p>The relevance here of this equity question is that most states and
provinces have complex and expensive systems and formulae for "power
equalization," and the like, designed to shift resources from rich
counties to poorer ones. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One
reason such programs are needed is to
offset the effects of the very same state sales taxes used to finance
them.</span> There are great savings to be realized by quashing this
cross-hauling of public funds. </p>
