<a name="Defining Real Property Historic"></a><b>Defining Real
Property Historically</b>
<p>Just over a week from now, right here in Albany, the <b>Property
Rights Foundation of America</b> will hold its second annual
conference. <b>These are the people who are the core of the so-called
"wise use" movement, that is those who believe that the rights of
ownership of real property stand above just about all other values in
political negotiation, and that rights to private property are
gravely threatened by a government that today seeks to encroach on
the foundations of our forefathers' vision of society</b>. In the
American west it is better known as the "sagebrush rebellion." I
won't talk much about whether or not these rights are soundly framed
or well grounded. I will talk, however, about some changes that took
place about a century ago that have had profound consequences for the
directions of American society in the interim. Had those changes not
taken place, it is doubtful whether the groundswell of anger over the
place of private landownership would be as intense as it is
today.</p>
<p><b>One must start by looking at how the meaning of the word
property has changed over the course of centuries.</b> In most
societies of the world, as was true in classic western thought,
property typically meant personal property clothing, household goods,
bodily adornments and armor, and similar such items. Land was
typically owned by society in common, or perhaps belonged to God or
nature. Roman law made some effort to allot land titles to private
individuals and families, but it was honored more in theory than in
fact. Indeed, it was not until the now well-documented "<b>enclosure
movement</b>" in early Tudor England that land titles began their
long transformation from what has been termed "<b>leasehold</b>" to
"<b>freehold</b>." Against the will of the King and his Council,
noblemen seized the land for themselves, marking it into defined
units, fenced off in their names only, even when they had no use for
it. Karl Polanyi noted that:</p>
<blockquote>Enclosures have appropriately been called a revolution of
the rich against the poor. The lords and nobles were upsetting the
social order, breaking down ancient law and custom, sometimes by means
of violence, often by pressure and intimidation. They were literally
robbing the poor of their share in the common, tearing down the houses
which, by the hitherto unbreakable force of custom, the poor had long
regarded as theirs and their heirs'. The fabric of society was being
disrupted; desolate villages and the ruins of human dwellings testified
to the fierceness with which the revolution raged, endangering the
defenses of the country, wasting its town, decimating its population,
turning its overburdened soil into dust, harassing its people and
turning them from decent husbandmen into a mob of beggars and thieves.</blockquote>
<p>Rutgers Professor of Urban Planning Donald Krueckeberg more
recently explained how real property became for the first time a
"commodity," much as the market gives personal property exchange
value.<b> Native Americans tied the concept of property not to
ownership but to use.</b> "One used it, one moved on, and use was
shared with others." <b>But the colonists took their notion of real
property from evolving British legal tradition, defined largely in
terms of what its owners could subdue and control against
challengers.</b> John Locke's conception of property was, in one
sense, more akin to the Indian notion in as much as one owned it only
to the extent that one "mixed one's labor" with it.</p>
<p>Indeed the most widespread notion of property ownership,
especially in realms where Roman law had left no legacy, was title
in<a name="usufruct"></a><b> usufruct</b>, meaning title to use. But
that meaning has gradually given way to the prevailing conception of
<a name="title in fee simple"></a><b>title in fee simple</b>, even
though legal constraints have grown to curtail abuses of such
ownership and are even seen sometimes as assaults on it. Krueckeberg
notes that as many as nine kinds of property rights have been
distinguished:</p>
<ul>
  <li>possession,</li>
  <li>use,</li>
  <li>alienation (the power to give away),</li>
  <li>consumption,</li>
  <li>modification,</li>
  <li>destruction,</li>
  <li>management,</li>
  <li>exchange, and</li>
  <li>profit taking.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the first application of the land law of the New England
settlers there has been a gradual extension of private control over
land titles first to simple use, then the right to benefit, and
ultimately "<b>to the idea of gain made by selling. Land speculation,
which was to spread across the continent, radically transformed New
England's democratic town pattern.</b>" Concurrent with this
spreading application of titles in fee simple has come changes in the
meaning of the word property, a term which, although employed in the
Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, was amplified
only during the second half of the 19th century. <b>The notion of
land as a commodity has had pernicious effects on the course of our
whole civilization. </b></p>
<p>As recently as a century ago classical economic thought still
regarded land for the most part as the common heritage of mankind.
From Adam Smith, through Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, and finally
with John Stuart Mill <b>economic productivity was regarded as a
function of three interacting factors: land, labor, and capital.</b>
John Locke also accepted these premises. <b>To achieve optimal
economic productivity, one had to exact the appropriate price from
each of those factors. The price of labor was in wages; the price of
capital was interest; and the price of land, particularly following
the thinking of David Ricardo, was rent</b>.<a name="Rent"></a> Rent in
its classical sense means payment for the use of something in fixed
supply, or, more generally, payments above the costs incurred for its
creation. <b><i>Disequilibriums and inefficiencies in economic
development resulted if the appropriate prices were not paid for each
factor. But, as we shall see, there were powerful interests in this
country, bent on not seeing any rent extracted from land use, that
persuaded the nascent economics profession at the end of the 19th
century no longer to regard land as a separate factor and to redefine
the terms of production instead in two-factor theory. This was
concurrent with the inclusion of land as property, since called "real
property." </i></b></p>
<p><b>As land came to be transferred to other nobility and usurped
under title in fee simple rather than in usufruct, it came to be
regarded as a private financial asset.</b> Earlier it was regarded as
part of nature, much like air, water, wind and weather. Accounting
practices now listed land as an asset "owned" in fee simple, and as a
liability on the other side of balance sheets in money "owed" to
banks. <b>This tendency has been extended today so that we have
privatized much of our air, water, wind, and even sunlight. Land came
to be simply one special kind of capital, nothing special, nothing
requiring further treatment</b>. Ricardo's Law of Rent became an
artifact of intellectual history. <b><i>The conflation of land into
capital to create two-factor economics is one of the greatest
paradigm shifts in the evolution of social philosophy</i></b>. How
the premises and terms of economic discourse have been changed has
been documented for the first time in a new book by a California
professor of economics, Mason Gaffney. The account is put forth in
fascinating detail entitled, <b><i>The Corruption of
Economics</i></b>. It was indeed a corruption of a discipline, a
deliberate putsch by powerful economic forces with an interest in
seeing such definitions changed, and we have all been paying the
price since that time. This revealing thesis is what I really want to
relate to you, and to explain the dire consequences it has had for us
in our contemporary world. I have come to believe it; it makes sense
to me, both historically and in contemporary analysis, from several
perspectives.</p>
<p><a name="The Corruption of Economics"></a><b>The Corruption of
Economics</b></p>
<p>As I explained, classical economics emerged from a school of
thinkers known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the
18th century. There ultimately evolved three major schools of
economic thought a century later,</p>
<ul>
  <li>one continuing tradition of Adam Smith through J.S. Mill,</li>
  <li>a second being the aggressive and emerging school of Marxism, and</li>
  <li>the third a proposal for two-factor economics being pressed
largely by interests in America.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marxism was never a major force in United States; the primary
challenge to the classical tradition came from what has since come to
be known as neo-classical economics.</p>
<p>Professor Gaffney has for the first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</p>
<p>The classical tradition of economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book,<a href="../George_P&P.html"> <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b></a>,
sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
travelled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and travelled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</p>
<p>In classical economics, the definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather than being returned
to society in rent.</p>
<p>The failure of society to recapture the appropriate level of land
rent from titleholders led also to depression of labor wages at the
margin, creating poverty and artificial scarcity of labor where
otherwise it could be relieved. Hence the title of George's book,
<b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>. George recognized that the value
of any land parcel arose out of its social activity, not from
anything which a titleholder might have done to it. He recognized
that many, perhaps most, titleholders in land were speculators,
reaping the benefit of others' investments, and selling out at last
when their price was met. Hence it made sense that society had a
right to a return on what it had brought about, as well as from the
fact that those titles could never be other than leaseholds. That
land rent, shortly confused by use of the words "single tax," was, to
George, the rightful return to society.</p>
<p><b>The railroad barons of the 19th century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885.</b> The
actual intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got
appointed and promoted, who was funded in research, which were given
endowed chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation
with defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount
preoccupation of all of these figures. The central figures were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</li>
  <li>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</li>
  <li>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</li>
  <li>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</li>
</ul>
<p>These figures are even today the honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Friedman</a>,
Harberger and now thousands of <a href="../themes/Chicago_School.html">Chicago-oriented</a> economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. Was it for the falsity
of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then have
managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather, it
was the threat George represented to powerful interests that required
him to be defeated, and in doing so they succeeded but only in the
short run, as they were within decades victims of their very
successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</p>
<p>There were many arguments to be made for the classical tradition
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</li>
  <li>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising taxes
on capital.</li>
  <li>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</li>
  <li>It constituted no disincentive to business location or population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</li>
  <li>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government revenue
without any penalty upon its base.</li>
  <li>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time promotes
economy in government.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Those economists who today still persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as
<a name="Georgists."></a>Georgists</b>. They represent a small
minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they are,
they are among its most esteemed members.</p>
<p><b>Two-factor economics, however, had advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit.</b> This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. <b>In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner.</b> When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.</p>
<p><a name="Assessing Sound Taxation"></a><b>Assessing Sound
Taxation</b></p>
<p>What David Ricardo called<a name="the &quot;law of rent,"></a><b> the
"law of rent,</b>" and which Henry George integrated to a
comprehensive economic theory, can be made the basis of a perfect tax
measured by contemporary principles of tax theory. Public finance
textbooks typically list them as</p>
<ul>
  <li>economic neutrality,</li>
  <li>efficiency,</li>
  <li>equity,</li>
  <li>administrability,</li>
  <li>simplicity,</li>
  <li>stability, and</li>
  <li>sufficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these words embodies an important virtue of sound of
taxation going back to the insights of Adam Smith two centuries ago.
And now you know a bit of where I'm headed.</p>
<p><a name="Tax neutrality"></a><b>Tax neutrality</b> refers to the
influence (or absence of such) that any particular design has on
economic behavior. Typically taxes are perceived as a damp on
economic activity taxing income reduces the incentive to work, taxing
sales discourages retail transactions, and taxing savings reduces the
propensity to save. The more a tax is perceived to be neutral the
less the identifiable distortions it imposes on the economy. The
common assumption of most tax theorists is that all taxes impose
distortions; it's simply a matter of which ones are least burdensome
to economic health. A tax which imposes no distortions is ideally
best.</p>
<p><a name="Tax efficiency"></a><b>Tax efficiency</b> is much like
tax neutrality, and is the measure of how much shifting of behavior
it imposes, resulting in what is called "excess burden," or
"deadweight loss" on the economy. Tax economists usually hold that
the best taxes are those that are shifted little if at all. Using a
tax base that has little or zero elasticity is the best way of
assuring that taxes are not shifted. Zero elasticity is another way
of saying fixed supply, as, earlier noted, land is.</p>
<p>The principle of <a name="equity"></a><b>equity</b> is central to
any discussion of tax design. Tax design requires concern with both
what is fair and the extent to which it must sometimes be compromised
to satisfy the other principal criteria. Fairness can be evaluated
according to what is termed "<b>horizontal equity</b>" the extent to
which those in similar circumstances will pay similar tax burdens,
and "<b>vertical equity</b>" how well those in different classes bear
different burdens in the tax structure. It is this latter perspective
that leads to the use of terms like "proportional," "progressive,"
and "regressive" in referring to tax structures. A tax is
<b>progressive</b> with respect to income if the ratio of tax revenue
to income rises when moving up the income scale, <b>proportional</b>
if the ratio is constant, and <b>regressive</b> if the ratio
declines. There is an ancillary question of whether taxing to reach
greater equity should employ measures of income or of wealth,
difficult as this is to measure. Such questions of equity are a
matter particularly central when discussing the property tax. This is
because people capitalize their income in the course of a lifetime
frequently in property. Although claims are often made to the
contrary and really comprehensive studies have yet to be done,
available studies suggest that the property tax is really highly
progressive, especially for the land component.</p>
<p><a name="Administrability"></a><b>Administrability</b> refers to the
ease with which a tax can be administered and collected. Taxes which
distort the economy are inefficient but so are taxes that cost lots
to administer. This is measured not only in the direct costs of tax
avoidance and accounting expenses, but in the level of evasion and
cheating, and by the cost of government auditing and policing. When
the taxpaying public perceives that a tax is easily evaded,
cumbersome, and unfair, it loses its legitimacy and calls government
itself into question.</p>
<p>This is why the principle of
<a name="simplicity"></a><b>simplicity</b> is important: the more
complex the tax design, the more lawyers and accountants will find
loopholes, encourage the appearance of unfairness, and drive up the
cost of its administration. People know that with simple taxes other
parties are also paying their fair share, and all this enhances the
legitimacy and therefore the compliance of the tax system. Whatever
you think of the current income tax, Steve Forbes certainly pointed
out its problems recently.</p>
<p><a name="Stability"></a><b>Stability</b> refers to the ability of a
tax to produce revenue in the face of changing economic
circumstances. Income and sales taxes, for example, vary greatly
according to phases in the economic cycle; the property tax, in
contrast, is highly stable regardless of the state of the economy.
Followers of economist John Maynard Keynes believe that revenues
should be inverse to the cycles of the economy; i.e., that the
government should be used to stabilize or boost the economy as
occasions require. I should add as an aside that there are some
theorists who believe that, were revenue sources completely based on
land value, economic cycles would disappear.</p>
<p>In assessing the value of a tax it is also important, of course,
to understand its potential to bring in
<a name="revenue"></a><b>revenue</b> for the purposes of government.
This is usually deemed revenue sufficiency. Income, sales and
property taxes, along with corporation taxes to a lesser extent, have
come to be regarded as the workhorses of the American revenue
structure. But, as anti-tax politicians are quick to note, the higher
these taxes are, the more they impose a drag on the economy. This is
why one should ponder whether to consider raising taxes which have
demonstrable distorting effects. In contrast, if you take the time to
look at a tax on land value alone, it measures up so well that it
looks like the perfect tax!</p>
<p><a name="The Costs of Poor Taxes"></a><b> The Costs of Poor
Taxes</b></p>
<p>Society pays a price for not adopting taxes which follow the
principles developed over the centuries. Here I want only to show how
the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. This is because the population and improvement
densities needed to make public transit traffic economically viable
did not come about. Taking the long view of society, George Kennen
notes in one of his books that:</p>
<blockquote><b>The railway</b>. . . was capable of accepting and
disgorging its loads, whether of passengers or freight, only at fixed
points. This being the case, it tended to gather together, and to
concentrate around its urban terminus and railhead, all activity that
was in any way related to movements of freight or passengers into or
out of the city. It was in this quality that it had made major and in
some ways decisive contributions to the development not only of the
great railway metropolises of the Victorian age particularly of such
inland cities as Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and Chicago but even certain of
the great maritime turnover ports, such as London and New York.</blockquote>
<p><b>The automobile</b>, on the other hand, had precisely the
opposite qualities. Incapable, in view of its own cumbersomeness and
requirements for space, of accepting or releasing large loads at any
concentrated points anywhere, but peculiarly capable of accepting and
releasing them at multitudes of unconcentrated points anywhere else,
the automobile tended to disintegrate and to explode all that the
railway had brought together. It was, in fact, the enemy of the
concentrated city. Thus it was destined to destroy the great densely
populated urban centers of the nineteenth century, with all the
glories of economic and cultural life that had flowed from their very
unity and compactness.</p>
<p><b>Failure to recapture publicly-created land rents through the
tax mechanism provided the incentive to speculators to buy land, not
to use it in production but to hold it for the rise</b>. In this way,
choice parcels remain undeveloped or underdeveloped relative to the
full extent that their values warrant and development occurs instead
in remote areas where opportunity for profit is more immediate. The
result was low density development what we know as sprawl.</p>
<p>To some people this may be counter-intuitive. It may not be
obvious that increasing taxes on a parcel of land will foster its
improvement. Consider, however, the possibility that there are two
parcels of land in roughly the same location and of equal size. You
own a vacant parcel and another next to it has a twenty-story
building. If only the land-value is taxed you will be paying the same
tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you likely to do with your
parcel? If you are rational, you will either build a twenty-story
building or else sell the land to someone who will. In this way
improvements tend to be clustered in high-land-value areas except
where it is prohibited, perhaps for a park.</p>
