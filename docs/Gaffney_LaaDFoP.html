  <p><b>Land as a
    Distinctive Factor of Production</b></p>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
The<span style="font-style: italic;"> classical economists</span>
treated land as
distinct from capital:
"land, labor and capital" were the three basic "factors
of production."&nbsp; They were mutually exclusive.&nbsp; They were
comprehensive, including all economic agents. Each was also
"limitational," meaning at least some of each was needed for
all economic activity (v.&nbsp; <a href="#A-9">A9</a>, below)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> They
made a coherent
system, like Humboldt&#8217;s Cosmos, in the spirit of The Enlightenment that
spawned them both.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>1.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land
is absolutely
limitational.&nbsp; Capital is nearly so in practice: we need not dwell
on rare cases to the contrary.</small></font></div>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Neo-classical</span> economists
denied the distinction and undertook to purge
land from economese.&nbsp;<ul>
  <li>Many of them, following John B.
Clark and
Frank Knight, still deny the distinction as I explain in <i><a
 href="Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The
Corruption of Economics</a>, </i>a companion volume in this
series.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Many treat the matter by seizing on
and stressing all similarities of
land and capital, while ignoring all differences.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Some invent gray
areas that seem to fuse land and capital, present them as typical, and
quickly move on.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Many more simply ignore land, which
has the effect
of accepting the Clark-Knight verdict in practice.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Others uneasily
finesse and blur the issue by writing "land" in quotes, or
trivializing its value, or referring vaguely to "quasi-rents"
to comprehend a broad spectrum of incomes both from land and other
factors.</li>
</ul>
What ever possessed the neo-classicals to
leave such a mess?&nbsp; One
needs to know something of their times and politics.&nbsp; J.B. Clark
and
E.R.A. Seligman of Columbia University were obsessed with deflecting
proposals, strongly supported at the time and place they wrote, to
focus
taxation on land.&nbsp; <a href="../themes/About_HG.html">Henry George</a>,
after all, was nearly elected
Mayor
of New York City in 1886 and 1897.&nbsp; Frank Knight, founder of The
Chicago School, followed them closely.&nbsp; That explains why some of
the points made herein may seem obvious
to readers who have been spared the formal conditioning
imposed on graduate students in economics.&nbsp; In graduate training,
however, the obvious is obscured, silenced, or denied.&nbsp;<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Hundreds of
books on economic theory are published with "land" absent from
the index.</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span>
Denial is reinforced by dominant figures using
sophistical, pedantic cant, which students learn to ape to distinguish
themselves from the laity and advance their careers.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2 </span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
<font size="-1">2.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Careers
both
inside
and outside academia are much influenced by "deep lobbying," as
described by William Greider, 1992, <i>Who Shall Tell the People?,
</i>pp. 42-59.&nbsp; "Deep lobbying" is targeting public
opinion several years in the future, by building allies in think tanks,
academia, the media, and select activist groups.&nbsp; Greider gives as
an example the effort of polluting interests to undo the Superfund
law.&nbsp; They chose The Conservation Foundation, engineering the
selection of William.&nbsp; K. Reilly as environmental czar.&nbsp; Greider emphasizes
the role of economists, <i>et al., </i>as hired
guns.&nbsp; The eagerness of many college professors and administrators
to get grants at any price must be experienced to be believed, but I
can
attest from personal observation that it drives much of the profession
and its attitudes.</font></small></div>
<br>
The dominance of
"fusers" is shown by the prevalence of <span style="font-weight: bold;">2-factor
models</span>, wherein
the world is divided into just labor and capital.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> Land
is melded with
capital, and simply disappears as a separate category, along with its
distinctive attributes.&nbsp; A number of economists don't buy it, but
don't do anything about it - acquiescing in error by silence,
indifference, passivity, or anxiety of the professional
consequences.&nbsp; They handle the question by "going into
denial," as it were, resolving a vexing issue by pretending it isn't
there. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Anything else spoils the
web of interpretation through which their art seeks to make human
experience intelligible.</span><small><span

Truth will not be made manifest
by <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">donning blinders </span>hedging,
especially
against such motivated forces as have an interest in hiding unearned
wealth behind the skirts of capital.<br>

help me, in

wrong: they gravely admired the model's "elegance."</font></small></div>

<br>
The market exchange of capital for land causes an elementary failure in
the minds of many.&nbsp; Land and capital each have their prices and
may
be bought and sold for money.&nbsp; Each alike is part of an
individual's
assets, colloquially called his "capital".&nbsp; Each is a
store of value to the individual.&nbsp; What is true of each individual
must be true for all together, is the thinking: it is the "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fallacy
of composition.</span>" We will see herein that society cannot turn
land
into capital (<a href="#A-6">A-6</a>), and land is not a store of value
for society (<a href="#A-10">A-10</a>).<br>
<br>
The discipline has not totally eliminated land, but marginalized
it. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The discipline has not
totally terminated land: it is too subtle for outright skullduggery,
preferring equivocation and confusion.&nbsp; Rather, it has
marginalized it.&nbsp; </span>There is a subdiscipline called "Land
Economics," and
a journal of that name.&nbsp; There are journals of Agricultural
Economics, Urban Economics, Regional Science, Environmental Economics,
Natural Resources, and more.&nbsp; There are also whole disciplines of
Geography, Economic Geography, Military Science, Biogeography, Geology,
Geometry, Surveying, Astronomy, Theology, Ecology, Oceanography,
Meteorology, Soils, Physiography, Topography, and Hydrology, all
dealing
with The Earth and Nature and Creation as definable topics distinct
from
man's works.<br>
<br>
The subdisciplines are kept away from the "core" and
"mainstream" of economic thinking by compartmentalization and
colonialization.&nbsp; Patronizing "land economics" as a
colonial discipline keeps potentially contagious movements within the
empire, where they can absorb critical tendencies under
watchful control, while yet remaining safely remote, in the
outskirts of the system.&nbsp; Orthodoxy flows out from the core,
communicated via mandatory "core courses." Land economics is
banished from the "commanding heights" of money and banking,
macropolicy, and required "basic" courses in methodology and
micro theory.<br>
<br>
Colonial life is safe and easy, if dull and unfulfilling, but once
labeled "colonial" one is supposed to remain in the assigned
cage.&nbsp; One who attempts integration is "overambitious,"
and "spread too thin".&nbsp; Colonials are not supposed to
relate land economics to unemployment, inflation, financial collapse,
deficit finance, and such core topics.&nbsp; They become unwitting
co-conspirators in marginalizing their subject.<br>
<br>
Micro theory is the inmost citadel of holy writ, where "the economic
way of thinking" is inculcated.&nbsp; It is required of all
economics students before they venture into real issues.&nbsp; It
becomes
their shibboleth, their <span style="font-style: italic;">lingua franca</span>,
and shapes their worldview.&nbsp;
Within common micro theory, to the extent it relates to real life at
all,
the technique has been first to relegate production economics to a
minor
role: "price theory" comes first.&nbsp; Production economics
deals with the optimal combination of inputs in production, and how
this
relates to their relative costs.&nbsp; That should lead right into
factoral distribution, but this aspect is soft-pedaled or omitted
entirely.&nbsp; This omission alone is a fatal fault, considering that
the forces determining land rents vary inversely with those determining
rates of recturn on capital (cf.&nbsp; <a href="#A-7">A-7</a> below).<br>
<br>
Within production economics, "variable proportions" with
"factor symmetry" replaces diminishing returns.&nbsp; The
parcel of land disappears as a unit of analysis, replaced by "the
firm," a disembodied spirit that combines resources optimally,
treating all alike as variable "in the long run." In the
"short run," land is subsumed in "fixed costs";
rising demand that raises rents is just "imputed away" silently
and lumped with other elements of "fixed cost." If that sounds
muddled, it is because what it describes <span
 style="font-style: italic;">is</span> muddled.'<br>
<br>
Common micro theory finesses Time.&nbsp; It deals with economic
relations

 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">(and space as well); as though they
were relations of coexistence, rather than a cavalcade of events in
sequence</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes two points
are allowed (short run and long).&nbsp; Thus micro theory can ignore
the
birth of capital, its growth, maturity, senescence, death, burial, and
replacement, vital elements of its difference from land.&nbsp; Time,
and
relations of sequence,&nbsp;are hived off to the far satellite
of "finance," usually
not even taught in departments of economics.&nbsp; Time is also
referred
to under "history of economic thought," as an obsession of some
19th century Austrians who wrote quaintly of "roundabout"
(time-using) methods of production.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5&nbsp;</span></small>
Relations of sequence are found in
macro, but not firmly integrated with microtheory, which is the
enduring
core of the discipline.&nbsp; Microtheory still deals with relations of
coexistence in time, and space as well. As A. A. Milne once wrote,
"It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead." Of
neoclassical theory we may add, "It isn't really anytime, it's some
other time instead."<small><span

All that is confusing for students and others.&nbsp; Land does have
distinctive qualities for economic analysis and policy.&nbsp; This
essay
gives 10 primary reasons why land is distinct from capital (and of
course
from mankind itself) as an economic input.&nbsp; Then it gives 18
important economic consequences thereof, and their policy
implications.&nbsp; Making land markets, land policy, and land taxation
work well for the general welfare is a major challenge for economists
and
statesmen.&nbsp; They have neglected it too long by crediting and
following the peculiar neo-classical sophisms that obscure or deny all
distinctions between land and capital.<br>

</div>
<b><a name="A-1"></a>A-1.&nbsp; Land is not produced nor
reproducible<br>
</b>Land is not produced, it was created.&nbsp; It is the world, the
planet from which man evolved, with the sun that energizes it and the
orbit that tempers it.&nbsp; Land is a free gift, variously expressed
in
different philosophies as Spaceship Earth, the Big Blue Marble, God's
Gift, Creation, Gaia, The Promised Land, or nature.&nbsp; Mankind did
not
create The Earth with its space and resources, nor can we add to
them.&nbsp; We can only acquire them, often by fighting, or
rent-seeking,
or in<b> </b>other counterproductive ways.&nbsp; Man at best improves
and
develops capacities inherent in the free gift.&nbsp; It is
disappointing,
and should alert us and make us suspicious, that economic analysis
would
ever purge out this paramount, self-evident truth.<br>
<br>
"Land" in economics means all natural resources and agents,
with their sites (locations and extensions in space).&nbsp; Land is not
just the matter occupying space: it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
space. It includes many things not
colloquially called land, such as 
<ul>
  <li>water and the beds under it,</li>
  <li>the radio
  spectrum,  </li>
  <li>docks,  </li>
  <li>rights of way,  </li>
  <li>take-off/landing time slots for
aircraft,  </li>
  <li>aquifers,  </li>
  <li>ambient air (the right to breathe
it and the license to
pollute),  </li>
  <li>"air rights" to strata in the third
dimension of
cities,  </li>
  <li>falling water,  </li>
  <li>wild fish, game, and vegetation,</li>
  <li>natural scenery,  </li>
  <li>weather,  </li>
  <li>the environment,  </li>
  <li>the ecology,  </li>
  <li>the natural gene pool, etc.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Any franchise, license or
privilege giving territorial rights is a
species of easement over land.&nbsp;  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Your driver's license is a
right to
use land;    </li>
    <li>red lights remind us of the
critical value of space at central
locations, since two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same
time.&nbsp;    </li>
    <li>It is worth a lot to have the
right-of-way, as railroads
do.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Economic land <span style="font-style: italic;">excludes</span> many
things, too, that are
colloquially called land.&nbsp; It excludes land-fill, for example, by
which many cities
are extended into shallow waters.&nbsp; The site and seabed are
properly
land; the land-fill is an improvement.&nbsp; There is no "made
land" in the economic sense: it is reallocated from other
uses.&nbsp; Expanding cities take farmland from producing food and
fiber,
much of it for the expanding city itself.&nbsp; Filled land in shallow
water near cities is taken away from anglers and sailors and viewers
and
ecologists, who now routinely&nbsp; organize to prevent it being "made"
away with.&nbsp; Drained and filled
wetlands are taken away from endangered species, as well as from their
primal role as
filters protecting coastal waters from river trash and
pollutants.&nbsp;
Thanks to the myopia and dereliction of economists, it has taken
militant
environmentalists to carry home this truth, developing in their
struggle
to be heard and understood a deep skepticism of economists and their
"way of thinking." Some economists and environmentalists are now coming
to terms with each other, after decades of mutual shunning.&nbsp; Too
many modern economists, however, still use their "way of thinking" to
seal out important new evidence that doesn't fit the model. <br>
<br>
Capital (K) is that which has been produced but not yet used up.&nbsp;
Capital is formed by human thrift, forbearance, investment and
production.&nbsp; Only after mankind forms and makes capital does it
bear
much likeness to land, in that they coexist.&nbsp; Ordinary
micro-economics obscures the differences because it deals mainly with
relations of coexistence, ignoring the continual formation and
destruction of capital, ignoring time and relations of sequence.&nbsp;
Thus it excludes from its purview one of the prime differences between
land and capital.&nbsp; The life of capital, like that of people, is
marked by major sacraments of birth, growth, aging and death - all
missing from micro theory. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Economic
life is a cavalcade in which the birth and death of capital are dated
events.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Micro deals mainly with how existing
resources are allocated at a moment in time, not how they originate,
grow, flourish, reproduce, age, die, and decompose.<br>
<br>
Capital occupies space; land <i>is </i>space.&nbsp; In common micro
theory, resources and markets come together at a point not just in time
but in space.&nbsp; Again, it excludes from its purview one of the
prime
qualities of land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">6.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>It
is ironic that
economists purport or affect to ape the methods of physics, when
they delete both space and time from their subject.&nbsp; If
they have borrowed from physics, they have taken the form without the

<br>
For the reasons given, alone, land and capital are mutually
exclusive. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">There are, however,
nine more, which follow.</span><br>
<br>
<b><a name="A-2"></a>A-2.&nbsp; Land as site is permanent and recyclable<br>
<br>
</b>Land as "site" (location plus extension) does not normally
wear out, depreciate, spoil, obsolesce, nor get used up by human
activities incident to occupancy and production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In contrast, capital
depreciates from time and use, routinely and by nature.</span>&nbsp;
After
being
formed, it must be conserved from entropy by continual maintenance,
repair, remodeling, safeguarding against theft and fire, and so on.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small>&nbsp;
Like our own bodies, it returns
to dust;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">land is the dust to which it returns</span>.&nbsp;
Inventories are depleted;
moving parts wear out; fixed capital depreciates with use and
time.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">7.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>"Something
there is that does not love a wall, that sends the frozen groundswell
under it, and spills the upper boulders in the sun." Robert Frost,
"Mending Wall."</font></small></div>
<br>
Land normally does not depreciate as a function of time.&nbsp; Most
attributes of land also withstand use and abuse.&nbsp; Most land is,
rather, expected to appreciate in real value in the long run.&nbsp;
Values go in cycles, but the secular history is upwards as population,
capital, and demands all grow while land remains fixed.&nbsp; Capital
has
a period of formation during which it accretes value by storing up
other
inputs and changing physical form, but that is a phase.&nbsp; Once
formed, almost all capital fails with time.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most durable capital is intellectual, like the writings of
Plato.&nbsp; These, however, do not endure generations without the
continual human effort and expense of education.&nbsp; As schools
starve
and libraries close, it is sadly certain that much will be lost.&nbsp;
Under any conditions much is twisted in transmission, like classical
economics itself.<br>
<br>
Capital, however durable, also obsolesces because it is subject to
continual competition from streams of new products.&nbsp; Intellectual
capital, however classic, is subject to endless competition from floods
of new ideas and discoveries.&nbsp; Land does not obsolesce from this
cause: there is no new land, let alone modem, state-of-the-art
land.&nbsp; Both land and capital are subject to demand-obsolescence
from
changes in tastes and fashions, but overall the taste for land as a
consumer good rises as incomes and wealth grow.&nbsp; The writer has
documented elsewhere how the land share of residential real estate
value
rises sharply with its total value.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">8</span></small> The
land part of residential real
estate is a "superior good"; the building part is<b>
</b>not.<br>

Gaffney,

<br>
It follows that the demand for land arises over time with incomes, <u>but
</u>faster than incomes.&nbsp; For example the soaring demand for golf
has produced 150 golf courses in one California county (Riverside)
alone,
preempting a good bit of the usable land and a huge share of this
natural
desert's limited water resources.&nbsp; The western quarter of
Massachusetts, the Berkshires, with adjoining parts of Connecticut, New
York, and Vermont, has become one vast country estate for suburban New
Yorkers and retirees, and is priced high above its farm value.&nbsp;
Ski resorts, hunting clubs, yacht harbors, spas, beach resorts, and
such
uses increasingly outbid mere utilitarian uses for prime lands.&nbsp;
There is also a high and rising technical multiplier of demand for land
to complement modem consumer capital.&nbsp; For example,
the&nbsp;parking
demands alone of 200 million private autos in the U.S.A. preempt
an area as large as Maryland and Delaware combined.&nbsp; <span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Unlike most of Maryland and Delaware,
the parking lots are mostly on high-valued land in cities. </span>Soaring
demands
and reuse values are thus the norm in an affluent society.<br>
<br>
What can it mean to "consume" land, when it does not get used
up?&nbsp; It can only mean to occupy or preempt a time-slot of
space.&nbsp; That has the most profound implications for the meaning of
"consumption" in economic thinking, and "consumer
taxation" in fiscal policy.&nbsp; Economists have neglected and
papered over these matters almost completely.&nbsp; These are pursued
in
<a href="#B-13">B-13</a> below.<br>
<br>
Some attributes of some lands do deteriorate from some uses or
abuses.&nbsp; Extractive resources call for special analysis, which the
writer has attempted elsewhere.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">9</span></small> To
avoid lengthy repetition from
previous publications, the word "land" herein refers to the
permanent qualities of land, exemplified by (but not limited to)
site.&nbsp; Remember, land is not just matter, it is space
itself.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10</span></small>&nbsp;
It is not unusual for land first to be mined, then used
for
dumping wastes, then sealed over for urban use.&nbsp; I myself have
lived
comfortably over an old munitions dump on Lockehaven Drive, Victoria,
B.C.&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Not far away is
Butchart Gardens, a world-renowned beauty spot, fashioned in a

natural
resources are used up by consumption.&nbsp; Some even call them
"natural capital," but that is pushing it: one resemblance does
not make an identity.&nbsp; Land has many characteristics; permanence
(which characterizes site) is only one of these.&nbsp; Because of the
natural origin and limited stock, the exhaustion of some resources
causes
the appreciation of others to replace them.&nbsp; Thus, exhaustible
resources <i>in situ, </i>before they are extracted, go through a
long
period of price appreciation, distinguishing them from most man-made
capital.&nbsp; Owing to the conservation of matter, many resources are
not used up in<b> </b>consumption, but are recyclable and recycled.</small></font>
<small><br>
</small></div>
Land is reusable.&nbsp; All the land we have is second-hand, most of it
previously-owned.&nbsp; Our descendants, in turn, will have nothing but
our hand-me-downs.&nbsp; As there is never any new supply, the old is
recycled periodically, and will be in perpetuity, without changing form
or location.&nbsp; Melded briefly with fixed buildings, land survives
them to go one more round of use.&nbsp; Even while melded with capital,
land is fit for another use at any time, unlike the capital on
it.&nbsp;
Land retains a practicable, measurable, meaningful opportunity
cost.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land value in cities may
be defined as "what is left
after a good fire"; arsonists take that quite literally.</span>&nbsp;
In
Beverly Hills, California, "tear-downs" are routine as
taste-obsolescence races through fashionable neighborhoods where the
land outvalues even the elegant buildings.&nbsp; These are dated after
thirty years.<br>
<br>
The opportunity cost of capital is fleeting.&nbsp; Capital loses most
of
it the moment it is committed to a specific form, whose physical
alternative use is often only as scrap.&nbsp; Land's "opportunity
cost" is real and viable at all times.&nbsp; The scrap value of
capital is often zero or negative (radioactive waste supplying an
extreme
example).<br>
<br>
Land may be afflicted with such "negative capital," the harmful
waste from prior usage.&nbsp; An example is the spent carcass of an old
building needing costly demolition.&nbsp; Some would class that spent
carcass as a
subtraction from the site value, but "negative capital" makes
more sense, as may be inferred by considering the relations between a
landlord and a tenant in a perfect market.&nbsp; The lease holds the
tenant liable for damages he does and wastes he leaves; the prudent
landlord requires of the tenant a deposit, or in larger cases a bond,
to
assure performance.&nbsp; Both acknowledge that damage done by use is
imputed to the user, not to the land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11</span></small><small><br>
</small>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">11.
      An
example on a social scale is the bonding
imposed on nuclear generators by
the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).&nbsp; FERC
requires utility firms to set aside a percentage of their fuel budget
in
a sinking fund to pay for "decommissioning" plants at the end
of their economic lives. </font></small></div>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>Too
often, from institutional or market or human failure, the land is
left damaged, with no recourse against those responsible.&nbsp; Then,
indeed, the damage becomes part of the land, just as some of the good
relics of history may as well be considered part of the land.&nbsp;
Toxic
wastes, and endemic parasites imported with previous crops or trees,
become mixed into the dirt.&nbsp; We do not trivialize nor quibble over
what to call such damage: it happens, and it impairs the reuse value of
land.&nbsp; In such cases the site is less valuable, but still
permanent
and recyclable.&nbsp; Such cases are, fortunately, still more the
exception than the rule.&nbsp; They are at most a minor qualification
to
the major points made here.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical abuse of land is less a
problem, actually, than the fall of
value that results from social decay.&nbsp; Much of land value is a
social product.</span>&nbsp; When a society sickens, declines, and
self-destructs, as we know may happen, it lowers ground rents, which
mirror social progress and decay.&nbsp; We cannot surely forecast that
our own society will not self-destruct, as parts of cities already
have.&nbsp; However, until it does, land will outlast capital
economically.&nbsp; Even when it does, landownership may remain the
last
bastion, as happened in the feudal system.&nbsp; Even if barbarians
overrun us, it is the land they will take: little else will
remain.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="A-3"></a>A-3.&nbsp; Land supply is fixed<br>

</span>Both the overall quantity and the special qualities of specific
lands
remain fixed.&nbsp; Capital changes its form and location with each
turnover, while land remains the same.&nbsp; The Tyler Galleria
neighborhood in Riverside, California, makes an example.&nbsp; In the
last fifteen years over half the buildings have been replaced or
heavily
remodeled.&nbsp; Streets have been repaved and widened; utilities
enhanced.&nbsp; Inventories have turned over hundreds of times; cars in

<br>
The <b>fixity </b>of land has several aspects.
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a. The overall planet
is fixed.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Even the planet may change, but "fixed"
here means
"given" or "exogenous" or "outside individual

climatic changes are given, so far as man is concerned.&nbsp; Changes
caused by mankind collectively are given so far as individual
landowners
are concerned.
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">b. Land is fixed within
political
jurisdictions.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Political jurisdictions are defined as
areas of land.&nbsp; Capital
and labor cross political boundary lines; land stays put.&nbsp; An
"open economy" is open to money and goods, to capital and
labor, not to land.&nbsp; For tax consequences, cf. <a href="#A-4">A-4</a>
and <a href="#B-5">B-5</a> below.

immobile in
space, permanently.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">13</span></small> </dd>
</dl>
Much capital, on the other hand, is
physically mobile by wheel,
hoof, wing or boat.&nbsp; California calls this "unsecured"
property, and France calls <i>it "meubles ", </i>as distinct
from the other kind&nbsp; which is "secured" and
<i>"immeuble."<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">14</span></small>&nbsp;
</i>Most American Jurisdictions use the
less expressive "personal" and "real" property for
the same distinction.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">13.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Some
renewable land
resources move: air, water, wild fish and game.&nbsp; The observations
here need modifying or explicating to apply fully to them.&nbsp; Movable

space.</font></small><font size="-1"><br>
<small>14.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The
Spanish terms for
real estate are <i>bienes inmuebles and bienes raices</i> rooted goods).&nbsp; French
distinguishes land and capital: <i>inmuebles
</i>refers more to improvements and fixtures; <i>proprietefonciere </i>applies
more specifically to pure
land.&nbsp; German, too, has a separate term for improvements and fixtures, <i>unbewegliche
Eigentum </i>(immovable property), while real
estate is
Grundeigentum, obviously stressing ground alone.&nbsp; <br>
In Englsih the etymology may reveal the king's underlying ownership: "real estate" probably springs from rotal estate, "real either being
contracted from "regal" or borrowed from the French and Spanish <span
 style="font-style: italic;">real</span>, royal.&nbsp; Spanish law does
recognize "regalian" ownership of subsurface minerals.&nbsp; (In Latin
American history, this took the form of a 20% severance tax.)<br>
Our word "realize,"
meaning convert to money, likely derives from the fact that money was
issued by kings and bore their images.&nbsp; The Spanish <span
 style="font-style: italic;">real </span>was a
silver coin of wide currency.&nbsp; Spanish coin was the western
world's
hard money for four centuries. </small></font>
<small>&nbsp;<br>
</small></div>
Secured or "real" capital is capital affixed to
land.&nbsp; The
physical carcass of most buildings is rooted to the spot, leading some
to
allege buildings are as fixed in location as land.&nbsp; That would be
specious, economically.&nbsp; The capital locked up in the carcasses of
buildings is normally recovered, as they depreciate, in <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Capital
Consumption Allowances (CCAs)</span> which may be reinvested anywhere.<br>
<br>
"Basic" micro economic theory, as ordinarily ordained today, is
constructed so as to paper over this basic difference of land and
capital.&nbsp; In its "short run" land and capital are both
fixed.&nbsp; In its "long run" both are equally variable to
"the firm," the disembodied spirit used as its unit of
analysis, existing at a point in time and space.&nbsp; Thus, one can
specialize for a lifetime in "basic micro" while remaining
unaware that capital, over time, changes its form and location as it
turns
over, unlike land.&nbsp; Land yields no such mobile funds as
CCAS.&nbsp;
It does not depreciate, and is priced accordingly higher, so its income
is only enough to yield a return <span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">on</span> the
price paid, not a return of it.
(See <a href="#A-5">A-5</a>, below)<br>
<br>
Land is "mobile" only in the
limited sense that its use
may change.&nbsp; Some micro economists would have this sort of
"mobility" equate land
to capital.&nbsp; See <a href="#A-5">A-5</a>,a, below.<br>
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">d. Land is fixed in
form.</span>  </dd>
</dl>
Capital, in contrast, is Protean,
assuming one form after
another.&nbsp; Capital is also <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">fungible </span>with each
turnover.&nbsp; Capital
Consumption Allowances in money join the common worldwide pool of
disposable capital.&nbsp; Money itself is not capital, but is
generalized
command over a share of the flow of current production.&nbsp; Thus,
capital loses its specific identity with each turnover.
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">e. Acquiring land must

</dl>
No one can get more land without others
keeping less.&nbsp; One can
acquire more capital by forming it through saving and investing.&nbsp;
One can consume more by working more, while others work no less.&nbsp;
Land is different: it is the most common basis of market power,

area or neighborhood, land
cannot immigrate to meet the higher demand.&nbsp; It is true that land

"mobile" as anything else, equating land and
capital.&nbsp; It dovetails with and reinforces their paradigm centered
on
"the firm," a unit that can add unlimited inputs of all kinds
in the long run, and among which competition drives all profits to
zero.&nbsp; This rationalization overlooks the hoary adage of real
estate: "value depends on three factors, location, location, and
location." What happens then is<b> </b>not that supply rises to meet
higher demand, but ground rent rises.<br>
<br>
Robert Triffin wrote that "excess returns are either competed away,
or imputed away." Excess returns to capital are the ones that get
competed away; excess returns to land get imputed away.&nbsp; Rents and
land prices rise where demand is focused.&nbsp; Interest rates, the
cost
of capital, do not rise: capital abhors a vacuum, and rushes in to
bring
returns back down to the common worldwide level.&nbsp; If anything,
interest rates are lower in central cities because of the more perfect
markets that develop there.&nbsp; Intensive development and use of the
third dimension at the hub of a city makes it even more attractive,
through synergy (conglomerate increasing returns to scale), raising
rents
still more.<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span

continuity in space</span></div>
<br>
The price of land is closely related to that of adjoining land, for
they are usually near substitutes.&nbsp; Richard Hurd, pioneer author
of the classic<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Principles of
City Land Values</span> (1903), posited this rule, noting the
continuity is both concentric and axial.&nbsp; It is therefore possible
to map land values as one would map elevations, drawing contour lines
of equal unit value.<i><br>

<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">c. The services of land
flow and
perish with time.</span>  </dd>
</dl>
Land is "immobile in time" in the sense
that its services
flow steadily with time.&nbsp; They cannot be stored and shifted
forward
to meet anticipated higher future demand, like stored goods.&nbsp; They
cannot be bunched, like military tanks for an attack.&nbsp; One cannot
reach into the future and marshal them for present needs or
emergencies.&nbsp; They are never "on tap," for drawing down
at will; neither may they be set aside for future use.&nbsp; Rather
they flow
down the river and out the gates of time to sink forever into the dead
past.<br>
<br>
Land services may be and are used to produce capital, and the capital
is
stored up.&nbsp; An example is land used for growing timber, or raising
seedlings to bearing age.&nbsp; Another example is flowing water stored
in a reservoir.&nbsp; This does not convert land into capital, however,
any more than it converts labor into capital.&nbsp; Stored-up labor and
land-service are capital: that is what capital is, by definition. <small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">15</span></small>
Nature's services <i>per se, </i>however, come in a flow like time
itself, unbidden and uncontrollable.&nbsp; Mankind cannot advance nor
retard its services at will.&nbsp; <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">15. On the point, I recommend
the writings
of Knut Wicksell, e.g. <i>Value, Capital, and Rent.&nbsp; </i>After
praising the works of
Boehm-Bawerk, Wicksell faults him for treating capital simply as stored
labor.&nbsp; Wicksell makes it also stored land, whose distinctiveness
and importance he recognizes.</font></small></div>
<br>
Considering the improvident nature of
mankind that is perhaps a good thing, but good or bad, it is
so.&nbsp; Many polities have hit upon this trait of land to stabilize
society, by dividing up land and making it unalienable.&nbsp; The Roman
Demeter, for example, was goddess of farming, family, and social order,
which the early Roman republicans viewed as a package.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small>&nbsp;
Thus they
created a society of small citizen-proprietors who could never squander
their major asset, and who could not sell to foreigners.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">16.&nbsp; Somewhat
overlapping, the three Horae were goddesses of Justice (Dike), Order
(Eunomia), and Peace (Irene).&nbsp; </font></small></div>
<br>
Land titles serve as "stores of value" for individual
owners.&nbsp; By the common fallacy of composition, plus some
confusion,
that makes it all too easy for laymen, and economists too, to think of
land as a store of social value.&nbsp; The individual can tap this
store,
however, only by selling it to another.&nbsp; Neither of them can
advance
or retard the flow of services at will.<br>
<br>
Usually the given flow is steady or seasonal, but not always or
necessarily.&nbsp; Seasons change, climates change, environments
change,
blights and pestilences come and go.&nbsp; The essence of land service
flow is<b> </b>not steadiness, but exogeneity.&nbsp; Alfred Marshall
defined the "public value of land" as the product of three
factors exogenous to the private owner: nature, public services, and
spillovers from the use of nearby private land.&nbsp; This
"neoclassical" was classically right on this point (great
economists seldom fit snugly into tight boxes).

the<x-tab> </x-tab>firm's
nucleus and not, therefore, homogeneous.&nbsp;The added land is

marginal location means that more internal transportation cost is
required to integrate the added land with the operation.&nbsp;That is
a prime diseconomy of scale, limiting the optimal area of producing
units.
</dl>
As a firm expands it takes land from the
margins of neighboring
firms.&nbsp; As Firm A continues to expand, the zone of acquisition
moves farther from A's nucleus, but closer to that of B, its
neighbor.&nbsp; As the zone advances, the contested land becomes of
higher value to B, and lower value to A. Again, this is a matter both
of
pure quantity and specific location.&nbsp; Military Science would
produce
few winners if it aped Economics and ignored such facts.<br>
<br>
It is different when a growing firm adds labor and capital to its
operation.&nbsp; These are drawn from the margins of other operations,
but they are marginal only in quantity, not location.&nbsp; They are
homogenous units, and may be added to the core of the growing
operation.&nbsp; That continues to be so, however much Firm A grows, or
B
shrinks.&nbsp; This is because labor and capital migrate, and their
supplies are a "pool." No one neighbor is singled out for
raiding; there is no locational factor.<br>
<br>
This locational factor qualifies the idea of "factor symmetry,"
as developed by Clark and Wicksteed, and expressed in the replacement
of "diminishing returns" by "variable proportions" in
economic analysis.&nbsp; It is impossible to add "homogeneous"
land to an operation: each unit has a unique location, and added land
is
normally farther from the nucleus.<br>
<br>
This consideration, taken alone, would make landholdings tend toward
uniformity, to minimize internal transport costs.&nbsp; In fact,
however,
landholdings are less uniform than other measures of firm size, like
labor force, capital improvements, sales, and value-added.&nbsp; These
facts are consistent with an hypothesis that the acquisition of land as
a
store of value, dominated by financial forces tending toward
concentration, interferes with efficiency in land markets.&nbsp; This
hypothesis is further considered in <a href="#B-11">B-11</a>.<br>
<br>
Added land, besides being farther from a nucleus, may be farther from a
street interface.&nbsp; In retailing this is extremely weighty.&nbsp;
In retailing this is extremely weighty - cf. the rule
of 4-3-2-1.&nbsp; Land added to water front parcels may be far from the

<br>
A city that grows in capital and people generally enjoys a long stage
of increasing returns to the composite urban economy, even though each
atomistic site is improved in the stage of decreasing returns to
capital and people.&nbsp; This antinomy is due to synergy.&nbsp; Cities
exist to bring people and capital together in space.&nbsp; People
attract more people; capital attracts more capital; people and capital
attract each other.<br>
<br>
Adding land to a city, on the other hand, often results in diminishing
and even negative returns to the composite city.&nbsp; Cities are
already full of holes.&nbsp; Adding more land, especially in the
sprawled manner of modern American cities, adds to the cost of tying
the pieces together.&nbsp; There is an enormous literature on the
wastes of sprawl.&nbsp; It may be summarized in two points.&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>First, it foils the very purpose of cities, by keeping people and
capital apart, and aborting synergies among them.&nbsp;  </li>

Land division entails "packing."</span><br>
One individual parcel does not expand or contract without impacting the
whole system.&nbsp; Parcels have common boundaries and must be packed
together so that they all fit.&nbsp; Many costs like fencing and roads
and utilities are shared along the common boundaries.&nbsp; These costs
vary with the length<i>
</i>of the boundaries.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ii) Capital and labor come in
"nuclei."</span><br>
Each parcel has its nucleus, as, for example, a farm centers on its
farmstead.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small>
The nucleus is the indivisible core of
labor/capital applied to the land.&nbsp; Land division entails more
nuclei, hence greater intensity of land use, for whatever purpose.<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small><font size="-1">17.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>A
classic study of
this matter is W.I. Myers, 1920, <i>An Economic Study of Farm
Layout.&nbsp; </i>Ithaca: Cornell University Press.&nbsp; It is
indicative of the later neglect of land economics that one must go back
so far to find the classic.</font></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><br>
"Nucleus" here is a proxy for labor/capital, although one
nucleus is not a fixed quantity of labor/capital.&nbsp; Generally the
nucleus shrinks as the acreage shrinks, but in lesser proportion, so
intensity of land use rises.
</div>
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">g. Nuclei are
interdependent.</span> </dd>
</dl>
In finding the optimal resultant of these
opposing forces we are
faced with more than a standard example of diminishing returns.&nbsp;
One
could perceive land division as simply a matter of applying more people
and capital to a given area of land.&nbsp; The more intensive
application
to each acre justifies itself up to a point by added yields from each
acre; beyond that the added yields do not compensate for the added
costs.<br>
<br>
But there is more here than a simple matter of quantities and
proportions
of inputs.&nbsp; There is also a distance factor.&nbsp; The more
parcels
we add the closer are their nuclei, and the less is the cost of linking
them along the common lines.&nbsp; The cost per acre is, to be sure,
higher: that is inherent in adding more labor and capital to a given
amount of land.&nbsp; But the linkage cost per parcel drops as we add
nuclei by dividing land into more parcels.<br>
<br>
There is an asymmetry here that has been obscured in the evolution of
marginal productivity theory, with its effort to show that the
relationships among all the classical factors of production are
"symmetrical," so that diminishing returns is simply variable
proportions.&nbsp; Land is not symmetrical with labor/capital.&nbsp;
When you add nuclei of labor/capital to land, they get packed closer
together.&nbsp; But when you add land to fixed labor and capital, the
units all get farther apart -- the land units as well as the nuclei of
labor/capital.<br>
<br>
Such distancing of the active nuclei of economic life requires more
capital and land devoted to the linkages among them - "urban sprawl" is
the familiar term.&nbsp; Sclerosis is the corresponding medical
condition: an overgrowth and hardening of connective tissues at the
expense of the active tissues they link.&nbsp; It is pathological for
societies, as it is for organisms.&nbsp; <br>
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">h. Land is immobile

</dl>
Tax jurisdictions are specific areas of
land: they are defined that
way.&nbsp; Land cannot escape from taxation, therefore (cf.&nbsp;<a
 href="#A-3">
A-3</a>).&nbsp; Further, it follows that all purely local taxes are
shifted
to land, whatever the nominal base of the tax (cf.&nbsp; <a href="#B-5">B-5</a>).&nbsp;
If
the application of labor and capital to land yields no surplus or rent,
there is no tax base: any attempt to tax the labor and capital must
simply drive them away, unless the use of the taxes itself creates
rent.&nbsp; This is the "Physiocratic law of tax incidence" <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">18</span></small>
Likewise, purely local services add to land rents.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>18.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>A

<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a. Land is not
convertible into
other land.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Each unit of land is permanently
unique.&nbsp; Capital, on the other
hand, is a homogeneous "pool" over time: as each unit degrades
and yields back its substance, the owner may reinvest the Capital
Consumption Allowances in anything.&nbsp; Thus, capital is fungible:
one
specific item of capital is universally convertible into any
other.&nbsp;
Land is not at all fungible: no specific unit of land is convertible
into any other.<br>
<br>
J.B. Clark, as is well known, tried to wipe out this distinction, which
brought him into
debate with Boehm-Bawerk over whether capital has a "period of
production".&nbsp; Frank Knight, following Clark, renewed the debate
with Friedrich von Hayek.&nbsp; The intent of both Clark and Knight was
to shelter land behind the skirts of capital, to counter a popular
movement for taxing land more and capital less.&nbsp; Students are
still
required to study these dreary, mystical exchanges, which seem to have
no
other purpose.<br>
<br>
The rate of turnover of capital may vary, and does, over a wide range,
from once a day for restaurant fresh vegetables to once a century for
slow growth timber.&nbsp; Thus, the "valence" with which
capital combines with labor is highly variable.&nbsp; The land/labor
valence is not fixed, but it contains no such extreme factor as this.
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">b. Land is necessarily
versatile.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Capital is made to order for specific
needs.&nbsp; There are degrees of specialization, but all capital is
somewhat specialized: buildings cannot turn into canned goods or
forklifts.&nbsp; Existing capital goods are committed to a specific
form, and so lose most of their opportunity cost.&nbsp; Capital goods
also suffer from various kinds of obsolescence, including, when affixed
to land, locational obsolescence.<br>
<br>
Land must serve
all of man's needs of the day, and perpetual streams, waves, and eddies
of new fads and demands, with no physical change. Even land taken from
the Indians, as they keep reminding us, had a previous use.&nbsp; Even
land that is allegedly &#8220;made&#8221; by filling in underwater sites is taken
from navigation, fish, recreation, wildlife, and other previous uses.<br>
<br>
New demands and discoveries bring out new virtues in old land but it is
man that has changed, not land.&nbsp; The resources were always there
waiting. Land rarely obsolesces in the sense that specific capital
goods do.&nbsp; Land's opportunity cost remains a viable option,
because the only source of land for new uses today, as for ages past,
is to take it from its previous use.&nbsp; We tear down old buildings
mainly to salvage and recycle the land, not the capital in the
buildings: this turns into scrap and junk that is usually worth less
than the cost of hauling it away. The tribe of economists, whose
inclusions and omissions are so often a puzzle, fill their papers with
references to &#8220;opportunity cost&#8221; and &#8220;alternative uses,&#8221; but hardly
ever mention that capital goods, especially buildings, have little or
none.&nbsp; An honorable exception was Alfred Marshall, but since his
generation has passed one finds abundant lip service, but fewer and
fewer references to what Marshall actually said&nbsp; (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Principles of
Economics</span>, (New York: The Macmillan Company, orig. 1890; 8th
Ed., 1920;
7th Printing, 1959, 1948 (sic), p.441))&nbsp; the concept of
opportunity cost should apply mainly to land.<br>
<br>
Here we meet an apparent contradiction it is important to sort out,
lest we be led astray by J.B. Clark&#8217;s confusing writings on
capital.&nbsp; As specific capital goods age they yield &#8220;Capital
Consumption Allowances&#8221; (CCAs) which the owner can then reinvest in
anything.&nbsp; That makes the pool of capital totally versatile over
time, as capital turns over.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is specific concrete
capital goods that lack much opportunity cost and versatility.<br>
<br>
Land never turns over the way capital does, and so lacks the extreme
and Protean versatility of the pool of capital in the long run.&nbsp;
It is before capital turns over through its CCAs that land is more
versatile than capital.&nbsp; This is relevant to tax matters because
the assessor can not value an existing building by its opportunity
cost, but he or she can always value land that way.<br>
<dl style="text-decoration: underline;">
  <dd>c. Land <i>per</i><em> se</em> is
economically divisible, unlike
capital. </dd>
</dl>
Since land does not have to be produced,
it can<b> </b>be
divided into parcels as small as you please.&nbsp; Capital is
economically indivisible, an economist's word which does not mean quite
what it appears to.&nbsp; One can produce very small trucks or ships or
buildings, but the cost per unit of useful capacity rises as they get
smaller: that is "Indivisibility." Its converse is economy of
scale.<br>
<br>
Economies of scale are inherent attributes of capital and labor, not
land.&nbsp; They spring from using large units of capital; or large
teams
of workers with specialized members.&nbsp; For this large lands are
required, but the scale economies are not in the land.&nbsp; It is
usually a social diseconomy to acquire large lands because they impinge
on others and push them out of the way.&nbsp; Thus a large truck
requires
more street space which may require widening streets which take land
from
the buildings between the streets.&nbsp; Large buildings require either
land assembly, or prior withholding of land over long periods, or going
to bad locations on cheap land.&nbsp; All of these are costly.<br>
<br>
In subdividing land into small parcels there are, it is true, extra
costs, but the cost per lot falls.&nbsp; Of course the cost per square
foot rises, but the cost per dollar of value created generally also
falls, which is why it is done.&nbsp; Apartments, condominia, strata
titles and time-sharing represent extreme subdivision without
increasing
cost.<br>
<br>
Those who require much land normally have limited choice of locations:
they must go where land may be had in large pieces.&nbsp; It is either
that, or buy it already assembled by others.&nbsp; That is not so true
of
those who need large labor or capital inputs.<br>
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">d. Capital evinces
"economies of
simultaneity" in construction.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Capital, unlike land, has to be
built.&nbsp; Normally capital will
retain through I life its original scale, and other basic
characteristics, because it is so costly to add-on after
construction.&nbsp; Buildings are adapted to particular sites when
built,
and are seldom raised or lowered after construction. (Capital in its
making has economies both of scale, and "simultaneity".)<br>
<br>
<b><a name="A-6"></a>A-6.&nbsp; Land is not interchangeable with capital<br>
<br>
</b>Land is not convertible into capital, nor <i>vice versa.&nbsp;
</i>Exchange of land for capital has misled many into equating them,
but
only through inadvertence and the fallacy of composition.&nbsp;
Exchange
is not interchange: exchange does not change the quantity of either
land
or capital.&nbsp; Capital is convertible into any other form of capital
each time it turns over, by using Capital Consumption Allowances, the
proceedings of turnover, to hire people actually to produce new
capital.&nbsp; Capital may also be disinvested and consumed, or
augmented
by new saving and investment.&nbsp; None of those is true of
land.<br>
<br>
The fact above seems simple when laid out overtly, yet economists
overlook it in framing tax policy.&nbsp; Nonconvertibility gives a new
meaning to the old goal of "uniformity" in taxation.&nbsp; It belies
the notion that uniformity makes for a "level playing field," or
neutrality in taxation.&nbsp; Uniformity is desirable to avoid "excise
tax" effects, or tax-induced misallocation of resources; but those
worthy ends do not require uniformity as between land and
capital.&nbsp; The Federal tax &#8220;reform&#8221; of 1986 was informed by the
spirit of uniformity, to great applause but with damaging
results.&nbsp; Effective rates were raised on new investing (by
lengthening tax lives), while basic tax rates (which would catch land
income) were cut sharply.&nbsp; It is probably no accident that a
recession soon followed.<br>
<br>
It is doubtful if uniformity within each class leads to neutrality,
either.&nbsp; Uniformity among different land uses seems desirable,
yes: if taxes vary with the use to which land is put, they bias the
owner against the use more heavily taxed.&nbsp; However, what does that
say about taxes on capital?&nbsp; If the tax on a parcel of real
estate, including land and buildings, varies with use, it biases the
owner against the use more heavily taxed.&nbsp; A uniform tax on
buildings is a tax that varies with the use to which land parcels are
put.&nbsp; Once we assume, or deduce, or observe, or otherwise conclude
that taxes on buildings are shifted to land, then a uniform ad valorem
tax on buildings is a tax that varies with the use to which land is
put.&nbsp; It has "excise tax effects": it makes owners favor smaller,
older buildings against larger, newer ones.&nbsp; Cf. <a href="#B-6">B-6</a>.<br>

<br>
</b>Interest rates around the world rise and fall in sympathy.&nbsp;
They
are subject to common, interconnecting forces of supply and demand,
transmitted swiftly even in past centuries, and today
instantaneously.<br>
<br>
Land rents, too, rise and fall together in response to common
forces.&nbsp; However, the forces are different for land rents than for
interest rates, so they do not vary in sympathy.&nbsp; Even though the
lands are not mutually convertible, they are subject to common forces,
the greatest of which is the interest rate itself.&nbsp; Capital and
land
are rivals for the same pie, so usually their returns vary
inversely.&nbsp; Ground rent equals operating cash flow <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">less interest on
the cost of building</span>, and less building depreciation.&nbsp; A
rise of
interest rates lowers ground rents.<br>
<br>
It is hard to see how any forecast of the results of economic policy,
or any forecast for investment purposes, could have any value without
keeping focused on this distinction.&nbsp; Sometimes it is handled by
distinguishing old" from "new" assets or issues.&nbsp;
Yet, in general, neoclassical doctrine tells us to meld land and
capital
in economic thinking of all kinds.<br>

<br>
</b>High land price guides investors to prefer kinds of capital that
substitute for land.&nbsp; Although capital cannot be converted into
land, it can substitute for land, and does so when rents and land
prices
are high.&nbsp; John Stuart Mill long ago pointed out that the
structure

Such substitution is an integral part of the

attained its present numbers and density without it.&nbsp; High wages

substitution of capital for land, shaping the capital stock in

<b><a name="A-9"></a>A-9.&nbsp; Land is limitational<br>
</b>As suggested in the Introduction, land and capital are mutually
exclusive.&nbsp; Each is also
limitational, meaning all human activity requires at least some of
each.<br>
<br>
Land is indispensable to life, hence to economic activity.&nbsp; The
same
is generally true of labor and capital, but less
"absolutely".&nbsp; Land can exist perfectly well without
labor or capital, and support timber and wildlife, but labor and
capital cannot exist at all without at least some land, and often a
great
deal of land.&nbsp; Substitution is limited.&nbsp; It will not do just
to
have 57 varieties of labor, or of capital.&nbsp; There must be at least
some land.&nbsp; Remember, land includes space itself, and a time-slot
in
it.&nbsp; It includes air and water, the environment and the ecology
and
all original matter itself.&nbsp; Without land there is nothing.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small>
Coupling&nbsp; this with the non-reproduceability of land, and its
fixity, land is distinctive.<br>

"Homelessness," a modem plague, is essentially
landlessness.&nbsp; A popular ditty from the 1930s includes the catchy
line, "If you can't pay the rent, you can live in a tent," but
you can't do even that without a campsite.&nbsp; Perhaps this is why
modern economists have so little to say about homelessness.&nbsp;
Joblessness they have dismissed as part of the vital economic function
of
"job-seeking," with which they have persuaded at least
themselves.&nbsp; The next logical step is that the person sleeping in
the doorway is not really homeless, but just engaged in the vital
market
function of "home-seeking".&nbsp; Rather than seem totally
absurd they are simply silent, except to stress the "exclusionary
principle" of private property as the bedrock of their system, and
their system as a panacea.<br>
<br>
In this they are out of step with general thinking.&nbsp; In France, at
least, polls have shown for several years the two most respected and
popular figures are the Abb Pierre, who crusades for the homeless, and
Jacques Cousteau the environmentalist, who also preaches on the folly
of
ignoring the limitational nature of land.<br>
<br>
There is scope for massive <span style="text-decoration: underline;">substitution
</span>of land for labor and capital,
and labor and capital for land.&nbsp; That is, the proportions in which
we combine the factors are variable.&nbsp; This substitution cannot,
however, be carried so far as to dispense with land altogether: this is
the meaning of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">limitational</span>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small>
Piling more capital on the same land is
limited by diminishing returns.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><x-tab><font size="-1">2</font></x-tab><font size="-1">1.
It has been suggested that satellites and space stations work without
land but of course they are launched and powered and controlled and
supplied from the earth.&nbsp; Every one to date makes extensive use of
the radio spectrum, a scarce bit of economic land.&nbsp; Even a dead
satellite uses an orbit, and one of these days there will be
interference
-- already there is talk of star wars, and the crowded skies. </font></small><font size="-1"><br>
<small>&nbsp;It has
further been advanced that micro-chips and such use so little land that
land is irrelevant.&nbsp; This overlooks that these items are made and
assembled and used in plants that spread out and produce toxic wastes,
by
people who arrive in autos riding over rights-of-way from homes on
residential lots.&nbsp; Land prices in Silicon Valley are so high, and
space so tight, that plants long since began moving in search of
cheaper
land in northern Sonoma County, Sacramento County, etc.</small></font></div>
<br>
Therefore the three factors are always found working in combination,
and
much of economic theory used to deal with how they are combined.&nbsp;
Some of it still does; the rest floats in outer space, perhaps
communing
with the ghost of Plato.<br>
<br>
<a name="A-10"></a><b>A-10.&nbsp; Land value is not an </b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">economic </span><b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fund<br>
<br>
</span></b>Economists teach that all economic values are either funds
or
flows.&nbsp; It is a seductive division, and often useful, but too
simple
by far.&nbsp; Land value is neither, but a third kind of value, <i>sui
generis.&nbsp; </i>Mankind cannot add to it,<b> </b>nor draw from it
as
from a true fund.&nbsp; Individuals can and do, by exchange.&nbsp; Even
nations can, by selling to aliens.&nbsp; Thanks to the fallacy of
composition that lets us forget that these are merely intermediate
transactions which collectively accomplish nothing.&nbsp; In famine, or
war, or capital shortage, society cannot live on land values.&nbsp;
These
are not accumulations of stores, but merely the present value of
anticipated future service flows which cannot be hastened.<br>
<br>
Further divisions are distinctive too, in other contexts.&nbsp;
Exhaustible resources (excluded from this discussion) could be called
"natural funds." Fixed capital, slowly depreciating with time,
is a "flowing fund." Soils have additional components.&nbsp;
But basic permanent location value, our present focus, is in no way an
economic "fund."<br>
<br>
<div align="center">SUMMARY AND REPRISE<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">Land and
capital<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small>
are mutually exclusive categories, provided that "exclusive
is understood properly.
</div>

</dl>
They are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">substitutable </span>(see
above),
but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">convertible </span>is
different.&nbsp; Capital and labor in the long run (not very long, for
most capital) are fungible pools as they reproduce and replace
themselves, generation following generation.&nbsp; That is, all capital
is convertible into any other form of capital when it is
replaced.&nbsp;
It is not convertible into land.&nbsp; That is one implication of
"mutually exclusive."<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">22.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>We
do not address
here to what extent "human capital" blurs the distinction of
land and capital.&nbsp; We do note that economists who would "tax
consumption" by taxing the formation and maintenance of human
capital, while exempting the consumption of land, are involved in
massive
contradictions.</font></small></div>
<br>
Capital is fungible in the long run, i.e. every unit or
"molecule" is convertible to any other.&nbsp; Labor is
slightly less so, and the generations are longer.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">23</span></small><small>
<br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">23.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Gene
pools may remain
distinctive over generations, partially limiting
interchangeability.&nbsp; We will not try to settle here the perennial
quarrel of heredity vs. environment.</font></small></div>
<br>
Thus, all capital tends to earn the same rate of return at the
margin.&nbsp; There is a "pool" of capital, whose returns are
subject to common influences.&nbsp; The labor pool is more
differentiated, but still, all wage and salary rates are subject to
common influences through the interflow caused by competition
and mobility.&nbsp; In the long run, replaceability of capital makes
individual "capitals" totally fungible, i.e. perfect substitutes
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">for each other </span>-- but
not for land.&nbsp; So it is, too, with labor,
without the same perfection.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Land rents tend to rise and fall
together, too, being subject to common influences: direct demand,
indirect demand via commodity prices, input costs, wage rates, and real
interest rates.<br>

<div align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold;">B. Major Economic
Consequences</span><br>
<br>
</div>
<b><a name="B-1"></a>B-1.&nbsp; The origin of property in
land is not economic</b>
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a. Politics guides the
original
distribution.</span> </dd>
</dl>
The initial distribution of land &#8212; the
origin of property in land &#8212; is military, legal, and political, not economic.&nbsp; The
prime
business
of nations throughout history has been gaining and defending
land.&nbsp;
What was won by force has no higher sanction than <i>lex fortioris,
</i>and must be kept and defended by force.<br>
<br>
After land is appropriated by a nation the original distribution is
political.&nbsp; The nature of societies, cultures and economies for
centuries afterwards are molded by that initial distribution,
exemplified
by the differences between Costa Rica (equal partition) and El Salvador
with its fabled "Fourteen Families" <i>(Las Catorce), </i>or
between Canada and Argentina.<br>
<br>
Political<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> re</span>distribution
also occurs within nations, as with the English
enclosures and Scottish "clearances," when one part of the
population in effect conquered the rest by political machinations, and
took over their land, their source of livelihood.&nbsp; Reappropriation
and new appropriation of tenures is not just an ancient or a sometime
thing but an ongoing process.&nbsp; This very day proprietary claims to
water sources, pollution rights, access to rights of way, radio
spectrum,
signal relay sites, landing rights, beach access, oil and gas, space on
telephone and power poles (e.g. for cable TV), taxi licenses, etc. are
being created under our noses.&nbsp; In developing countries of
unstable
government the current strong man, perhaps hanging by a thread, often
grants concessions to
American adventurers who can bolster his hold on power by supplying
both cash up front, and help from various US and UN agencies from the
IMF
to the United States Marine Corps.<br>
<br>
Ordinary economic thinking today would have it that a nation that
distributes land among private parties by "selling to the highest
bidder" is using an economic method of distribution.&nbsp; Such
thinking guides World Bank and IMF economists as they advise nations
emerging from communism on how to privatize land.&nbsp; The neutrality
is
specious, at best.&nbsp; Even selling to the high bidder is a political
decision, as 19th century American history makes clear.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">i)<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The
right to sell
was won by force, is not universally honored, and must be kept by
continuous use of force.<br>
<br>
ii)<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>In practice, selling
for
cash up front reserves most land for a few with front-money advantage,
inside information, good contacts, corrupt aides, etc.&nbsp; The
history
of disposal of US public domain leaves no doubt about this -- and it is
still going on with air rights, water, spectrum, landing rights,
fishing
licenses, etc.&nbsp; Choices being made currently are just as tainted
as
those of 19th century history (with never a peep from Chicago, but
heavy applause).<br>
<br>
Selling land in large blocks under frontier conditions is to sell at a
time before it begins yielding much if any rent.&nbsp; It is bid on by
those
few who have large discretionary funds of patient money.&nbsp;
Politicians, meantime, treat the proceeds as current revenues used to
hold down other taxes today, leaving the nation with inadequate
revenues
in the future.<br>
<br>
iii)<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The ability to bid high does
not necessarily come from legitimate saving.&nbsp; The early wealth of
Liverpool came from the slave trade.&nbsp; High bidders for many
properties today are middle eastern potentates who neither produced nor
saved the wealth they control.&nbsp; Other high bidders are criminals,
who find the "sanctity of property" a splendid route for
laundering their gains, and a permanent shelter against further
prosecution.<br>
</div>
<br>
Apart from such obvious cases, more generally, control over front
money,
however honestly acquired historically, is a factor separate from the
ability to use land productively.&nbsp; This is addressed below, in<a
 href="#B-8">
B-8</a>.<br>
<br>
This matter of the origins of property in land is skirted, ignored,
obscured, or trivialized by Libertarian (neo-anarchist) philosophers,
e.g. the Chicago School, and their lead is followed by the mass of
economists today.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">24</span></small>&nbsp;
It is the Achilles' heel of these and allied
philosophies.&nbsp; One of these, the contract theory of the state, was
heavily used to sell Proposition 13 in<b> </b>California in
1978.&nbsp;
Howard Jarvis, the author and protagonist, repeated daily that
"Property should pay only for services to property, not
services <i>
</i>to people." "Services to property" he construed very
narrowly indeed.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">24.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>It
is also ignored by
most of those who call themselves "Austrians" after the great
Austrian economists of the 19th Century (although one of these, Wieser,
made much of the difference between land and capital, and even Hayek
criticized Frank Knight for seeking to obliterate any distinction).</font></small></div>
<br>
Ownership and tenure rights derive only from appropriation, not saving,
investment or production.&nbsp; Capital, by contrast, is owned by those
who formed it. Only after that does capital bear much resemblance to
land in that they coexist.&nbsp; Standard micro&#8209;economics obscures the
differences because it deals mainly with relations of coexistence,
ignoring the continual formation and destruction of capital, ignoring
time and relations of sequence.&nbsp; Thus it excludes from its purview
the differences between land and capital.&nbsp; Micro deals mainly with
how existing resources are allocated at a moment in time, not how they
originate, grow, flourish, reproduce, age, senesce and die.<br>

<br>
<b><a name="B-2"></a>B-2.&nbsp; Much land remains untenured<br>
</b>Access to land is open by nature until and unless land is
appropriated, defended, bounded and policed.&nbsp; No one claims land
by
right of production; no producer must be rewarded to evoke and maintain
the supply; and submarginal land is not worth policing, unless to
preempt
it for its possible future values, or to preclude anticipated
competition
for markets or labor.&nbsp; Centuries of human customs have developed
around regulating common use of lands with open access.<br>
<br>
Tenure control of some land tends to drive the excluded population to
untenured land (the "commons"), creating an allocational bias
unless all land is either tenured or common.&nbsp; Thomas N. Carver
styled this the phenomenon of "<span style="font-style: italic;">The
Congested Frontier</span>", and he
might have added backwoods.&nbsp; Land which is partly common today
includes parks and public beaches, streets and highways, water
surfaces,
wild fish and game, and some at least of the "wide open spaces"
in less hospitable regions.&nbsp; Today there are homeless people for
whom life would literally be impossible without some form of access,
however precarious, to untenured land.&nbsp; Some of it, ironically, is
near the centers of large cities, where the price of land is
highest.<br>
<br>
No great damage is done if submarginal land is untenured: it won't be
used anyway.&nbsp; There may be damage, however, when rentable land is
untenured.&nbsp; It attracts too many entrepreneurs with too much labor
and capital, leading either to the use of private force to establish
tenure - unjust,&nbsp;dangerous, and wasteful
&#8211;
or overcrowding and waste, called the "dissipation of rent,"
when the average cost of the average firm equals the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">average </span>product of
labor and capital.&nbsp; Fisheries and open range are classic
cases.<br>
<br>
Some land of high value is untenured or underpriced because consumers
resist paying for what they think of as "free" because it has
no cost of production, and which nature continues to supply even though
the price is too low to ration the land economically.&nbsp; Examples:

<ul>
  <li>water whose natural source is in southern California (it is
tenured,
but
underpriced);  </li>
  <li>city streets for movement and parking space, even in New
York;  </li>
  <li>air and water used for waste disposal in populated areas;  </li>
  <li>housing
that is subject to rent controls;  </li>
  <li>popular beaches and trails;  </li>

When land is open to public access, so maybe the capital used to
improve
it, e.g. paving of rights-of-way.&nbsp; Such capital may also suffer
the "tragedy of the commons" of excessive congestion.&nbsp; This open
access to capital is mainly an
incident to the lack of land tenure - a characteristic more of land
than
of capital as such.<small><span

question of
public restrooms is unpleasant but essential.&nbsp; It is a question
whether to describe this as access to public capital or to the
waste-disposal aspect of land, but viewed as the latter it is as
undeniable a natural right as one can imagine.&nbsp; The late Arthur
Becker was one of the few to elevate this lowly, embarrassing topic
from
being a subject of evasive scatological humor to the

It is also possible to legislate and subsidize open access to some
kinds
of labor and capital services, e.g. public health measures, and
education.&nbsp; These differ from common lands in that they are not
open
"by nature," but by art and public expenditure.<br>

<br>
Land rent, however high, does not
raise the <span style="font-weight: bold;">rate of return (ROR)</span>
on investment in land purchase.&nbsp; It

<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a. Land rent does not
determine
interest rates.</span> </dd>
</dl>
There is a worldwide market for capital,
flawed to be sure, but
quite operational.&nbsp; Capital flows tend to create a common,
worldwide
and industrywide rate of return on capital, based on the productivity
of
capital as demand and the urge to consume as a limit on
supply.&nbsp; With this the rent of land has nothing to do,
directly.&nbsp; There is no rate of return on creating land; no common
level of land rents.&nbsp; Higher rents do not increase the return on
investments and pull up interest rates; they are capitalized into
higher
land values, using the given interest rate which is determined by the
supply of and demand for capital, not land.<br>
<br>
If the return to capital rises in a place or an industry, capital flows
in until the rate of return on new investment falls to the common
level.&nbsp; The excess returns to capital are competed away.&nbsp;
When
land rents rise, on the other hand, the excess returns are <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">imputed </span>away, meaning the
land becomes and remains more valuable.&nbsp;
Arbitrage pushes up land prices, using the interest rate borrowed from
the market for capital where it is determined.&nbsp; This creates an
illusion of a return that results from buying land, but acquiring land
does not build the asset that yields the return.&nbsp; The return comes
first, and exists regardless of what is paid for it; the price derives
from the return (cf.&nbsp; <a href="#A-4">A-4</a>).<br>
<br>
In terms of ordinary cost theory, land price is part of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fixed Cost
(FC)</span>.&nbsp;
As demand rises, <span style="font-weight: bold;">average fixed cost
(AFC)</span> rises enough to soak up all
excess
returns.&nbsp; As it is sometimes put, land's "cost" is not
price-determining, but price determined.&nbsp; Calling it a
"cost," and lumping it with other costs, has tended to hide
this difference in obscurity, ambiguity, and a touch of mystery, which
are the basic tools of sophistry.<br>
<br>
If land rents do affect interest rates it is not by increasing the
productivity of and demand for capital.&nbsp; It is likely to be the
reverse: high asking prices for land can cut into and reduce the return
to capital.&nbsp; In short, high building prices raise the demand for
investment; high land values lower it.<br>
<br>
Whether high land values do or not reduce returns to investors
depends&nbsp;on whether they are properly high -- i.e. they
reflect the high
productive value of land -- or overpriced, in a cost-push
phenomenon.&nbsp; Over-pushing building rentals does happen, but
vacancies result and correction is likely, especially when the building
is on the steep gradient of its depreciation and obsolescence
curves.<br>
<br>
Overpricing land titles is common - witness all the vacant land in and
around cities.&nbsp; It may go on for years before it is recognized and
corrected, especially when land is on the steep gradient of its
appreciation curve, and near an edge or ecotone (zones of change of
land
use) of conversion to higher use.&nbsp; Ordinary theory obscures this,
to
the extent that it treats land at all, by calling land rent a
"residual." Landowners in real life are not so passive: they
get paid up front when they sell to builders. (Demanding high ground
rents in long term leases to builders is also common and has similar
effects.) When this occurs it lowers the rate of return on
building.&nbsp; Where the land is paid or contracted for up front and
on
fixed terms, the building only gets the residual.

heavily
without discouraging capital&nbsp;formation.&nbsp; Indeed it
would certainly encourage capital formation to lower the level of land

is derived solely by discounting future ground rents, which are not a

<br>
With capital the sequence is that persons save to form capital, a lump
sum, which then yields a service flow.&nbsp; Capital formation precedes
and causes the service flow.&nbsp; With land the sequence is
reversed.&nbsp; The service flow is a free gift which simply
exists.&nbsp; The buyer does not create it, nor cause others to create
it; he simply acquires it.&nbsp; The expected service flow is then
converted by arbitrageurs (economic men) into a lump sum present
value.&nbsp; That process is called
"capitalizing," i.e. making land superficially resemble capital
for purposes of exchange.&nbsp; However, it is land price that adjusts
to
a given rent, rather than rent's being determined at a level sufficient
to
reward producing the asset.&nbsp; The interest (or capitalization) rate
at which rent is converted to price is determined by the supply of and

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">a. Relative elasticities.</span></div>
<br>
Land rent is nearly identical with taxable surplus.&nbsp; This
follows from simply observing that the supplies of labor and
capital are highly elastic, while the supply of land (within any given
taxing jurisdiction ) is totally inelastic, because&nbsp; a
"jurisdiction" is defined as a specific area of land. <br>
<br>
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and the &#8220;Physiocrats,&#8221; and their
fellow-traveler A.R. Jacques Turgot, deduced from the above that almost
all taxes, whatever the nominal base, are shifted to land rents, and
lodge there.&nbsp; Market forces tend to equalize all AFTER-tax returns
to labor and capital, because of their mobility or, in the case of some
labor, the inability of humans to survive on less than subsistence
wages.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
As a corollary, if there is no rent there is nothing to tax.&nbsp; E.R.
A. Seligman in one of his exhortations against the single tax, warned
that a
marginal community --one on land of no value -- can have no tax base if
it taxes only land. However, this hypothetical community can have no
tax base anyway.&nbsp; Whatever labor or capital it tries to tax will
leave, or never arrive, because their supplies are elastic.<br>
<br>
Capital will only appear to bear a tax if it can shift it to land in
the form of lower rent, or a lower purchase price.&nbsp; If rent and
land values are already zero, there is nowhere to shift a tax.&nbsp;
Mobile factors will not bear it, but turn away.&nbsp; Customers will
not bear it, but buy elsewhere.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seligman does not consider the interesting
possibility that public services paid by taxation might create the very
rents that are taxed to support the public services.&nbsp; That complex
question would make an interesting book, but one too long to insert
here.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">b.&nbsp; The surplus is much more
than usually stated.<br>
</span></div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The writer has dealt with this elsewhere (Gaffney,
1970, 1993), and is currently writing a book on the subject.&nbsp; Cf.
also <a href="#B-12">B-12</a>.&nbsp; The failure of modern economists,
whether
neo-classical or heterodox, to acknowledge the Himalayan Range of land
values in their faces, and to reckon its role in theory and policy, is
denial and delusion on a scale at which one can only marvel.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="B-6"></a>B-6.&nbsp; Uniformity in taxation between land and
capital is </b><span style="font-weight: bold;">not
</span><b style="font-weight: bold;">neutral </b><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">a.&nbsp; Land and capital are
non-interchangeable, and mutually exclusive. </span></div>
<br>
Refer back to <a href="#A-6">A-6</a>.&nbsp; Land is not convertible
into capital, nor vice
versa.&nbsp; Individuals may exchange one for the other but that does
not change the quantity of either.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The fact of non-convertibility gives a new meaning to the ordinary
concept that "uniformity" in taxation is neutral and desirable
in all cases.&nbsp; Uniformity is desirable to avoid "excise
tax" effects, but that end does not require uniformity between land
and capital, only uniformity within each class.<br>
(Refer to Ramsay rules, citing standard texts.)<br>
<br>
However much the capital be taxed, it will not be converted into
land.&nbsp; By definition, it cannot be.&nbsp; Likewise, however much
land be taxed, it cannot be converted into capital.<br>
<br>
It follows that "uniformity in taxation" only has merit <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">within
</span>each class, not among them.&nbsp; The ideas that we should tax
all income
uniformly, or all property uniformly, have no merit from an efficiency
standpoint.<br>
<br>
Many State constitutions are perverse in this regard, allowing
discrimination among uses of land, but not between land and
capital.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">27.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>It
is most likely
that these provisions were adopted consciously for the overt purpose of
thwarting any popular movement towards high tax rates on
property.&nbsp;
There is no cap on land tax rates that may be home without destructive
incentive effects.&nbsp; These constitutional provisions in effect
shelter land rents behind the incentive needs of building investors.</font></small></div>
<dl style="text-decoration: underline;">
  <dd>b. Taxing capital is non-neutral <i>per
se.</i> </dd>
</dl>
Heavy taxation of capital in an open
jurisdiction will abort
marginal investments and thus lower the intensity of all land
use.&nbsp;
It will thus distort the allocation of capital among Jurisdictions,
driving it away from the taxing jurisdiction, generally to its
disadvantage.&nbsp; It will also favor less intensive land uses within
the taxing jurisdiction.&nbsp; The effect of a property tax based on
the
value of capital is the same as a rise in the rate of interest.&nbsp;
The
rule is, "If a tax varies with the use to which land is put, it is
biased for the use more lightly taxed."<br>
<br>
Putting it in substitution terms, taxing capital induces substituting
land for capital.&nbsp; This occurs simply because capital is taxed,
however, and not because it is taxed more than land.&nbsp; It occurs
whether land is taxed at a higher rate, the same rate, or no rate at
all.<br>
<br>
For neutrality, the rule then is to avoid taxing anything except
land.&nbsp; Nonuniform taxation is necessary to avoid taxing capital,
and
thus to avoid nonneutrality.&nbsp; The ordinary argument for uniformity
gets it backwards.
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">c. It is impossible to
tax capital
uniformly.</span> </dd>
</dl>
The points (a) and (b) are the stronger
because capital is never
taxed uniformly anyway, and cannot be.&nbsp; No jurisdiction even tries
to include personal consumer durables in the tax base, notably
excepting
cars in some states.&nbsp; Most states exempt all personal property;
some
exempt large parts of it.&nbsp; Personal property is concealable,
movable
before assessment dates,&nbsp;and generally impossible to treat
uniformly.&nbsp; Exempting all personal
property is no solution: it opens a wide bias against things bolted to
the floor, as well as against floors themselves, and walls and
roofs.<br>
<br>
The only way to tax capital uniformly is to exempt it all.&nbsp; The
way
to exempt it all, without going completely anarchist, is to raise the
rate on land, which can be assessed uniformly.

<b><a name="B-7"></a>B-7.&nbsp; Land values are hypersensitive to
discount rates<br>
<br>
</b>The sensitivity of present values to discount rates increases as
the
value being discounted.&nbsp; Land values are
discounted from more remote future values than are values of most
capital, even most durable and "fixed" capital.&nbsp; Consider
land yielding an expected constant cash flow: let the interest rate
double and the present value is halved.&nbsp; Compare the present value
of a steer to be slaughtered in one year: let the interest rate double
from 5% to 10% and the present value drops from .95 of slaughter value
to .91.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small>&nbsp;

accurately that

<br>
Let buyers expect land's cash flow to rise annually by a growth
coefficient, G, and the valuation formula is cash flow divided by the
interest rate minus the growth rate (I-G), rather than I alone.&nbsp;
Now
let the interest rate double, and the present value is cut to less than
half.<br>
<br>
Or let land be yielding a nominal current cash flow and to be held in
anticipation of a higher use to begin 10 years down the road, and
thirty
years after that to be renewed for an even higher use.&nbsp; Let there
be
a whiff of oil, or the floating value of a shopping center, or the
possible extension of a freeway and a new water supply paid by
others.&nbsp; Let there be a fear (or hope) that Washington will
debauch
the currency sometime again in this century, or that another Howard
Jarvis will cut land taxes some more, or that future building costs
will
fall: any and all of these, which are common and familiar expectations,
make present values of land more sensitive to discount
rates than in the simple basic capitalization model which is based on
assumed constant cash flow in perpetuity.<br>
<br>
Expectations like those denoted above by G, or like the anticipated
higher future use referred to, are "a state of the public mind"
(Richard Hurd, <i>Principles of City Land Values).&nbsp; </i>They are
incapable of proof or disproof in the present and, whether proven true
or
false in the future, will have lost relevance, to be replaced by new
expectations of new futures that unfold endlessly as time
passes.<br>

<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a. Financing purchase
ranges from
difficult to impossible.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Few assets are priced so high as land,
relative to cash flow.&nbsp;
Financing a purchase of land therefore presents an unusually high
credit
barrier to the builder, new businessman or hopeful homeowner.&nbsp;
Cash
flow is seldom adequate to cover interest on a full loan, let alone the
principal.&nbsp; The buyer must find the excess elsewhere.&nbsp; A poor
credit rating raises the interest rate and increases the
difficulties.&nbsp; Even a middling credit rating is not good enough to
open entry to most businesses, and a weak one excludes a large minority
from homeownership.
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">b. Land purchase is not
self-liquidating.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Because market agents expect land to last
forever they price it
accordingly, high enough so the net cash flow just covers interest on
the
price, with nothing left over to pay for the principal.&nbsp; Thus the
land buyer will never normally (or "in equilibrium") pay for it
from its own cash flow, as he will pay for capital assets.&nbsp; The
debtor will never retire the loan from the cash flow of the land, but
only from other saving, or from new windfalls not expected at time of
purchase.&nbsp; A new buyer with no equity, therefore, is a bad credit
risk and gets short shrift at the bank.<br>

 style="text-decoration: underline;">The corollary of
high land price is high carrying cost relative to cash flow.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span>Carrying cost is interest on the price of land.&nbsp; It varies
with
one's internal interest rate (IIR).&nbsp; For those with high IIRs, the
carrying cost of land normally exceeds cash flow.&nbsp; Otherwise put,
cash flow from land seldom covers carrying cost, while cash flow from
depreciable capital covers
more than its carrying cost because it normally has to be priced low
enough for cash flow to cover both interest and depreciation.&nbsp; As
to
inventories of rising assets like steers or timber, they are like
zero-coupon bonds: there is no cash flow before sale, but the famine
leads to a feast of total recovery.<br>
<br>
Since land lasts forever while demands for land grow, the normal
expectation over long periods is that ground rents will rise.&nbsp;
Present land value includes the discounted values of expected higher
future rents.&nbsp; This makes current land values very high relative
to
current cash flows, which are less than expected future flows.&nbsp; In
stock market terms, the Price/Earnings ratio of land is high, like that
of a growth stock.&nbsp; This is more than an analogy, since a large
share of the assets of corporations consist of land.&nbsp; In the USA,
corporations are the major landholders.

  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">d. Credit barriers are

</dl>
Those of poor credit ratings are
peculiarly handicapped in the
market for land titles.&nbsp; This is because the carrying cost of land
is interest, and because there is a structure of interest rates based
on
borrowers' credit ratings.<br>
<br>
Because of the difference in carrying cost the financially strong add
land to their holdings to a lower margin of productivity than prevails
on
holdings of the financially weak, whether we measure productivity in
cash
flow or service flow.&nbsp; This is a factor independent of and in
addition to the fact that the financially strong likely place a higher
current value on service flows (i.e. the amenities of land) of given
objective quality.<br>
<br>
It is often reinforced in practice, too, by the greater political power
that accompanies financial strength.&nbsp; The combination of factors
may
lead the land market far away from anything approaching an efficient
equimarginal allocation of land among competing firms and households,
to
such a degree that traditional micro theory loses much of its
explanatory
power and the market becomes a travesty of the Platonic ideal in the

Buying with equity funds is only the beginning.&nbsp; Land is the basis
for extending credit.&nbsp; The "sections" go to the banks for
accommodation to buy the "quarters."&nbsp; As Rainer Schikele wrote,
"The basis of credit is not marginal productivity, but collateral
security." A major factor giving one a good credit rating is the prior
ownership of land.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Thus, owning land is not just dominated by, but also dominates access
to long-term credit.&nbsp; Here is a positive feedback loop: it takes
good credit to buy land, and prior ownership of land gives one good
credit. Those already owning land
have access to more
land at a lower carrying cost than those trying to enter the market
from
poverty.&nbsp; The result is a tendency for land to agglomerate in the

Thorstein Veblen never turned his acidic irony to better account than
in
his last book, <i>Absentee Ownership, </i>describing acquisition for
acquisition's sake:<br>
<dl>
  <dd>Subtraction is the aim of this
pioneer cupidity, not production; ...
being in no way related quantitatively to a person's workmanlike powers
or to his tangible performance, it has no 'saturation point'.</dd>
  <dd><br>
  </dd>
  <dd>"Their passion for acquisition has
driven them ... ; their
slavery has been not to an imperative bent of workmanship and human
service, but to an indefinitely extensible cupidity ... [which] is one
of
those 'higher wants of man' which the economists have found to be
'indefinitely extensible', and like other spiritual needs it is
self-authenticating, its own voucher.</dd>
  <dt><br>
  </dt>
  <dd>"The Latin phrase is <i>auri sacra
fames </i>(fanatical<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">30</span></small> lust
for gold), ... They [the Romans] had reached a realization of the
essentially sacramental virtue of this indefinitely extensible need of
more; ... The object of this 'higher want of man' is no longer [gold],
but some form of [certificate] which conveys title to a run of free
income; and it can accordingly have no saturation point', even in
fancy,
inasmuch as [certificates of title are] also indefinitely extensible
and
stand in no quantitative relation to tangible fact....</dd>
  <dt><br>
  </dt>
  <dd>"They have always, ... wanted
something more than their ...
share of the soil; not because they were driven by a felt need of doing
more than their fair share of work .... but with a view to ... getting
a
little something for nothing in allowing their holdings to be turned to
account.......

Land is a major basis, probably the major
basis of the concentration
of wealth.&nbsp; Political distribution, if egalitarian, may stave this
off for a considerable time.&nbsp; There is also evidence that heavy
land
taxation, where that is applied, motivates subdivision.&nbsp; However,
experience is that, in the absence of heavy taxation, the surplus of
rent
attracts absentee investors, and large concentrations reconstitute
themselves inexorably.&nbsp; The writer and others have documented such
concentration elsewhere.<small><span

<b>B-10.&nbsp; Land markets are sticky<br>
<br>
</b>Land sellers, compared to sellers of other factors, are too weakly
motivated to make very efficient markets.&nbsp; In the basic sense, the
land market is efficient if it guides land to its highest and best use,
yielding the most economic rent.&nbsp; Time was when that would go
without saying, but the semantic cleansing of theory has muddled it
up.&nbsp; I do not use "efficient market" in the tautological
sense of some rational-expectations theorists, which I have heard from
a Rochester economist, wherein markets are
efficient almost by definition because all agents are assumed to know
what they are doing, and outside observers are not allowed to question
it.&nbsp; Neither do I use efficient in the arbitrage sense, where a
land
market is called efficient if individual buyers of land make a
reasonable
return compared with their alternatives.<small><span

</dl>
The services of land perish with
time.&nbsp; This is a strong social
reason for seeing that land is well used.&nbsp; It is also a private
motivation which makes the market work, such as it does.&nbsp; If we
looked only at this factor in isolation, we would infer that land
markets
work well.<br>
<br>
Land is similar in this respect to capital.&nbsp; But capital also
suffers from depreciation, obsolescence, spoilage, theft, and
vandalism,
and requires outlays for maintenance, protection, insurance and
storage.&nbsp; Labor services also perish with time, when labor is
unemployed; but unemployed labor also starves.&nbsp; Thus seller
motivation is much higher for labor
and capital than for land.

Some of land's current service flow may
be put into storage, for
example if the land is growing timber or young fruit trees.&nbsp; In
this, land is not unique.&nbsp; The service flow of the capital in the
trees is similarly "plowed back" into the growing capital.<br>
<br>
But the flow of land service may also be stored in a way peculiar to
itself.&nbsp; Landholders may defer permanent improvements while land
"ripens" into a higher use, higher enough to repay with
interest the loss of one or more years' rent flow.<small><span

Strenuous efforts are made by some economic theorists to rationalize
land
withholding on these grounds.&nbsp; "Rational expectations"
theorists have developed a paradigm wherein any investment decision is
presumed rational and socially benign, to know all is to forgive all,
and
the burden of proof is on anyone who questions an individual
landowner's
behavior.&nbsp; Whether that kind of rationalization will long succeed,
or whether widespread "holding for the rise" will again be
recognized as evidence of market failure, there is no doubt that it
occurs on a grand scale, and much land is thus held back from current
use.<br>
<br>
Withholding is also rationalized as waiting for greater
certainty.&nbsp;
This involves a fairly transparent fallacy of composition (although it
seems to be opaque to those economists who make much of this
point).&nbsp; The waiting landholder imposes uncertainty on others who
are waiting to see what he will do, and of course <i>vice versa, </i>such
that uncertainty motivates waiting, and waiting generates more
uncertainty, in a vicious "positive feedback loop".<br>
<br>
Waiting landholders collectively also impose costs on the public, which
has at the very least a prior investment in national appropriation and
defense of the land, and usually heavy investments in public
infrastructure which await private response.&nbsp; It is a situation
where the gains of waiting accrue
to <x-tab></x-tab>the
private landholder but the costs accrue to others, a clear condition<x-tab>
</x-tab>for
market failure.

 style="text-decoration: underline;">Limited
competition.</span> </dd>
</dl>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">There is no new supply of land, as
there
is of capital due to
current capital formation (cf.&nbsp; <a href="#A-3">A-3</a>).&nbsp; It
was for this reason
that Adam Smith and other classical economists called landholding a
"monopoly".&nbsp;
They did not mean there was just one owner or seller, but referred to
the
absence and impossibility of new supplies.&nbsp;</span> They referred
to a
return, rent, in excess of costs needed to induce production.&nbsp;
They
referred to the fact that entry of competitors is limited to the
holders
of the given supply.&nbsp; Some moderns belittle the classicals for
using
monopoly in a different sense than what has become customary long after
their funerals, but such an anachronism is patently unfair.&nbsp; They
knew what they were saying.<br>
<br>
Land rent is not wiped out by competition.&nbsp; Instead, it is imputed
away, silently disappearing into "Fixed Cost".&nbsp; Higher
demand for land in general evokes no supply response: rather, it simply
raises the whole structure of rents.&nbsp; There is usually increased
supply of the gross produce or service from land owing to more
intensive
use, but it comes from the same land.&nbsp; The additional output
results
from increments of labor and capital applied to the same land.&nbsp;
Cf.&nbsp;<a href="#B-4"> B-4</a>.
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">d. Lags in reallocation.</span>  </dd>
</dl>
There is a sort of supply response to
increased demand for one use
of land, and reduced demand for another, because land use can be
changed
in response to a new structure of rents.&nbsp; Many micro theorists,
focusing narrowly on economics as "the allocation of limited
resources among competing ends," advance this to aver that land is
as mobile as capital.&nbsp; However, reallocating land has tight
limits.&nbsp; It is uncommonly slow because land is mostly committed to
existing uses, encumbered with durable capital specialized to the
existing use, and as yet not fully depreciated.&nbsp; Only a fraction
of
the potential change occurs in one year.&nbsp; In addition, potential
reallocation is often limited by the spatial fixity or other
qualitative
peculiarity of specific lands.&nbsp; Tundra and Alpine meadow cannot be
converted to the loams and warm climate of the corn belt; Utica cannot
move to Manhattan, nor Dubuque to Chicago, nor Death Valley to Newport
Beach.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The essence
of land value is location; it is not easily duplicated, and of course
totally stationary, by definition.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The most favorable case for supply response is where the growing use is
of high value and the shrinking one of no value, as with a city growing
out into a desert.&nbsp; Here the change of land use is even tantamount
to increasing the aggregate supply, it is said or implied by some
Chicago
School theorists.<br>
<i><br>
</i>One problem with such a model is that deserts do not spawn great
cities: even Denver, Phoenix, Albuquerque, Salt Lake City and Los
Angeles
all developed in oases of intensive farming.&nbsp; As cities spread
they
destroy part of what they serve and what serves them, and the
reverberations ripple out vastly.&nbsp; Land boundaries are common and
interdependent, so a change in one ecotone entails "repacking"
entire regions, a long, sticky, disruptive process indeed.&nbsp;
Expanding cities send out shock waves into the surrounding farms that
travel through the entire hierarchy of farm land uses, as higher uses
displace lower uses, from market gardens down to sheep grazing.&nbsp;
Even grazing is not the lowest use: it then pushes on forestry and
recreation where it finally meets the wrath of the Sierra Club (with
headquarters in downtown San Francisco and offices in Washington,
D.C.).
Growing cities also destroy part of the natural beauty that many people
value so highly that they devote their lives to protecting it.
<dl>
  <dd><span style="text-decoration: underline;">e. Lack of homogeneous
land.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Las Vegas, not a typical city, is the
largest I know of that indeed
grows in worthless desert.&nbsp; Here another factor stands out
clearly:
new lands are peripheral and only imperfect, partial substitutes for
central land.&nbsp; The city must range farther for water, power, waste
disposal, raw materials and markets.<br>
<br>
The high marginal cost of adding to spreading cities, and the low true
net value of the additions, are concealed, in our culture, by an
elaborate and pervasive system of subsidies and cross-subsidies built
into our institutions and political power structures.&nbsp; These drain
the old centers to feed the fringes.&nbsp; In a systemwide accounting
we
find the true social cost of urban sprawl as we know it today to exceed
the gains at the margins.&nbsp; We are not so much adding land to
cities
as wasting capital, dissipating central rents to do it.&nbsp; Thus the
private rent gradient and resulting land-value gradient that we observe
in the marketplace is much flatter than the true gradient that is
hidden
under the subsidies.&nbsp; Even so, the visible gradient remains
impressive: values rise to $2,000/psf in San Francisco, Chicago and
Manhattan, and $25,000/psf in Tokyo.<br>
<br>
Land of rare and limited qualities is often the basis of market
control:
retail sites, rights-of-way, rare ores, water rights, are familiar
examples.&nbsp; Even land of less rare qualities is often used for
market
control.&nbsp; American farm output is controlled by means of acreage
limitations; Texas and now&nbsp;OPEC oil production by oil well
protates; and so
on.<br>

</dl>
Now consider the market for land
titles.&nbsp; This is the more
relevant market as to building, transferring land between
uses, and changing parcel sizes.&nbsp; If the market for land services
is
slow, the market for land titles is viscous.&nbsp; There is no flow of
supply, none at all.&nbsp; There is no real turnover in the sense of
producing and using up.&nbsp; There is only ownership turnover: the
market only transfers existing titles.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">34</span></small>&nbsp;
(There is a supplemental
market in long leases, not addressed here.)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>34.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>New
titles are created,
too, but they only transfer land from common to tenured ownership.
There
is no real turnover of land.</small></font></div>
<br>
There are few highly motivated sellers, as there are motivated sellers
of spoiling
produce and obsolescing computers and vehicles.&nbsp; Median
home-owners
are motivated, when transferred to
another region.&nbsp; Few other land sellers come close to that degree
of
motivation (and the median home represents more capital than
land).&nbsp;
Capital depreciates; goods spoil and obsolesce; idle labor starves; but
land silently rises in value.<br>
<br>
The aggregate of all land changes hands slowly, with one or two percent
turnover of ownership annually (measuring the stock by value, not
number
of parcels - smaller, cheaper parcels turn faster).&nbsp; But buyers
often need adjacent land, or land in particular districts or with
particular qualities, and find little or no land on the market, or land
controlled by one seller.<br>
<br>
The slow ownership turnover cited above applies to total real estate,
i.e. land including any buildings on it.&nbsp; Ownership turnover is
even
slower for bare land.&nbsp; If the average building lasts 50 years,
only
2% of the land is available for re-use in any given year.&nbsp; Only a
fraction of that 2% is for sale; the rest is renewed by the same
owner.&nbsp; Whoever wants to buy available land in any particular area
is unlikely to be faced with the "many sellers" premised by the
competitive model.<br>
<dl>
  <dd>g. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hoarding for
vertical integration.</span>  </dd>
</dl>
A common precaution against sticky
markets is buying excess land for
possible future expansion.&nbsp; This behavior makes markets that much
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">more </span>sticky.&nbsp; It
is one of those things that necessitates and
justifies itself, considered in the aggregate: it is self-aggravating
and
self-authenticating.&nbsp; When anyone buys and holds for his own
future
expansion, everyone has
to:<x-tab>&nbsp; </x-tab>it is a
positive feedback loop of possessiveness run wild.<br>
<i><br>
</i>The composite result of individuals' buying for future contingent
need
is that the market in raw land is turned to glue.&nbsp; It ceases to
serve the median person in time of need.&nbsp; The effect is a species
of
vertical integration and, like all vertical integration, it destroys
the
free market in raw materials and vastly inflates the aggregate need for
holding raw materials.&nbsp; This is because the pooling effect such as
the market provides inherently.&nbsp; That is, the
grocer obtains, stores and keeps a wide variety of food and sundries on
tap for thousands of customers.&nbsp; Lacking a grocer, each customer
would have to maintain her own stores, and the aggregate required would
far exceed that in the common grocery store.&nbsp; A good land market
would likewise keep land on tap for the contingent needs of all,
greatly
lowering aggregate needs.
<dl>
  <dd>h. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assembly.</span> </dd>
</dl>
In certain ecotones (zones of change of
land use) the technical need
is to assemble small parcels into larger ones, as where commerce,
industry and high rise are moving into a district of single homes on
small lots.&nbsp; This condition maximizes market failure.&nbsp; It
normally takes years to assemble an optimal parcel: one holdout can
spoil
years of negotiating and financing.<br>
<br>
Straw buyers and front men are used to keep principals and their
intentions secret.&nbsp; Speculators are everywhere, trying to assemble
large plots or hold up other buyers.&nbsp; Whole districts are held by
anonymous absentees; buildings deteriorate, neighborhoods lose their
natural leaders and stabilizers, and communities disintegrate leaving
slums and blight, crime and arson, public charges and vandalism.<br>
<br>
The sum of those factors makes for an inefficient market in land
titles.&nbsp; Everyone who can tries to acquire land for his own future
expansion.&nbsp; Timely subdivision may be foregone in anticipation of
future assembly problems, skipping an entire generation of optimal land
use.&nbsp; Neighbors adjusting lot lines have only each other to deal
with. Aggregate landownership is highly concentrated because of the
small
numbers who can invest for deferred yields; the number of sellers in
one
district or for one use is more narrowly limited because of spatial
immobility and low turnover and impossibility of new land
creation.&nbsp;
Financing is especially difficult because the asset is not
self-liquidating.&nbsp; Many holders are waiting for the rise, and/ or
for greater certainty to be provided by the advance commitments of
others
who are in turn waiting for them.&nbsp; Net result: wasted,
underutilized
land.

  <dd>i. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Institutional

</dl>
Land is traditionally subject to a host
of legal and customary
limits on use and ownership.&nbsp; Covenants are found in land titles:
seldom in titles to cars or canned goods.&nbsp; Divided ownership is
common, there is so much about land to be owned.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are
easements through, air rights over, mineral
rights under, and neighbors and zoning all around any parcel of
land.&nbsp; Changing lot lines is unavoidably a social process, there
is
no other way.<br>
<br>
A large share of the more valuable land in cities is held by
estates.&nbsp; Public and eleemosynary [non-profit] holders are
preferentially tax
exempt and often without any visible motive to economize.&nbsp; Water
licenses are held subject to "use it or lose it" traditions
leading to appalling waste.&nbsp; Broadcasting/telecasting licenses are
highly political.&nbsp; And so on.&nbsp; Only a resource with the
characteristics of land could be subject to such a wide range of
non-economic pressures.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="B-11"></a>B-11.&nbsp; Land is a major basis of market power<br>

We have seen that landownership conveys superior bargaining power

accretes around existing nuclei (<a href="#B-9">B-9,</a>a), and is
highly concentrated
(<a href="#B-9">B-9</a>,b).&nbsp; We have seen markets are

<dl>
  <dd>a. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Expansion is
zero-sum</span>. </dd>
</dl>
Amassing land is always done, can only be
done, by shrinking the
holdings of others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt.&nbsp; If A is to
have
more then B, C, D <i>et al. </i>must have less, there is no other
way.&nbsp; A can amass more capital by saving, creating new capital,
leaving B, C, D <i>et al. </i>with as much as before.&nbsp; A can
increase his labor income by working longer, or harder, or smarter,
producing more, leaving others with as much as before.&nbsp; He and she
together can also spawn more children: labor, like capital, is
reproducible, and indefinitely augmentable.&nbsp; Possessing land,
however, means just one thing: bumping others.<br>
<br>
In the region of the mind, the thing possessed may be shared by all
with
no diminution to anyone.&nbsp; No one's pleasure In Shakespeare, or
Beethoven, or understanding physics is any less because at the same
time
millions of others have the same pleasure.&nbsp; Art, letters and
science
are the common property of mankind, open to all who care to acquire
them.&nbsp; The
creative producer's pleasure is in proportion to the number with whom
he
shares.&nbsp; The gratification is from sharing, not excluding.&nbsp;
The
contrast with landholding is nearly total.<small><span

<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
Amassing claims on wealth by creating and producing is not, therefore,
a
threat to others.&nbsp; Amassing capital through saving does not weaken
or impoverish others.&nbsp; Producing goods does not interfere with
others' doing the same.&nbsp; One producer may drive another from a
particular limited market, but glutting one market increases real
demand
for the products of other markets, and raises the real value of others'
incomes by lowering prices.&nbsp; Amassing land, however, has to
deprive
others, both relatively and absolutely.&nbsp; Concentrated holding and
control of land, therefore, have always been threats to the well-being
of
those left out.<br>
<br>
Conversely, the only way the landless, e.g. in South Africa, can get
land
is from those who now have it.&nbsp; "Growth" is often advanced
as the solution to maldistribution, injustice and poverty, but that is
mere temporizing because land does not grow.&nbsp; When production and
demand grow, land rents rise.&nbsp; Of land it is starkly true, "the
problem is not production, but distribution".&nbsp; There is no
production; only distribution.
<dl>
  <dd>b. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land is a natural
base for
monopoly and monopsony.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Massed control of land is the most
natural base for monopolizing
markets because land is limited.&nbsp; Buying land always does double
duty: when A expands he <span style="font-style: italic;">ipso facto</span>
preempts opportunities from B. For
example, a chain of service stations with most of the best comers in a
town has market power, the more so if it also holds a large share of
oil
sources, of refinery sites, of "offset rights" to pollute air,
transmission rights of way, harbor sites, and other such limited
lands.<br>
<br>
Preemption is not always just a by-product of expansion; it may be the
main point.&nbsp; For example, in 1993 Builders'
Emporium, a large chain of California hardware stores with large
parking
lots in good locations, closed down and sold out.&nbsp; The sites were
bought up by the largest grocery chain in southern California, Vons
Company.&nbsp; According to news reports, this is "a shut-out strategy
against competitors."&nbsp; Vons will convert 6-8 Emporium stores to
Vons' markets, and "hold onto the others until commercial rents rebound
-- then market them to non-rivals."<br>
<br>
Salomon Bros. analyst Jonathan Ziegler, far from being shocked, praises
this as "ingenious."&nbsp; "You're controlling who's in your market
area."&nbsp; Ralphs, another grocery chain, had been looking for sites
and is now shut out.&nbsp; The stores
remain empty today; the land idle.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
At the same time, the two largest warehouse retailers in southern
California have merged and shut stores.&nbsp; These are Costco and The
Price Club.&nbsp; In a third case TCH, the parent of Thrifty Drug
Stores, is buying up PayLess Drug chain from its parent, KMart, making
a chain of over 1,000 stores.&nbsp; They are shutting many of the
stores.&nbsp; An independent retail consultant believes they are
shutting them as part of the sale negotiations.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The social purpose and rationale for private property and land markets
is
to get land into its best use.&nbsp; When preemption overrides use,
market failure is total; private property is discredited.

If monopoly were based simply on owning a
particular form of
capital, all the other capital in the world could be converted into the
monopolized form each time it is liquidated and the proceeds are
reinvested.&nbsp; The same is not true of land, whose specialized
qualities are permanent (see <a href="#A-3">A-3</a> and <a
 href="#B-10">B-10</a>).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Land with differentiated special
qualities is fixed</span>, e.g. land on Wall
Street, or land suitable for growing macadamia nuts, or unloading
ocean vessels, or relaying radio signals; or residential land within
the New Trier Township High School District, or with ocean views and
breezes.&nbsp;
Substitution is generally possible but only at higher costs, resulting
in
rent gradients out from the best locations.&nbsp; This phenomenon is
well
studied and associated with the names of Von Thunen, Ricardo, and
many modem location theorists.<br>
<br>
This quality makes land a natural basis for oligopoly control of
markets,
or attempts at control.&nbsp; Land bearing certain minerals, like
diamonds or oil, is fixed and limited, in spite of new discoveries and
technologies.&nbsp; Sites most suitable for refining oil are limited:
they must be near markets, with access to cheap water transport and
pipelines, with "offset rights" to pollute air, with
"grandfather rights" to endanger or downgrade surrounding
residential lands and occasionally spill oil, with access to rails and
a
freeway system and a labor pool, with vast backlots for tank farms,
inside supportive political jurisdictions, and so on.<br>
<br>
The fixity of land also lends itself to stability of association among
oligopolists.&nbsp; People come and go; capital turns over, flows in
and
out; corporations, partnerships and syndicates are collapsed, merged,
refinanced, bankrupted and reorganized.&nbsp; Land remains: it is
always
in the same place, unmistakably identifiable and findable.&nbsp; It is
the permanent, underlying resource whose control is always the
objective
of the shuffling and roiling and strife above it.&nbsp; Its owners,
whoever they may be, will reliably join and support the local
employers'
association and their respective trade associations.

  </dd>
</dl>
Tip O'Neil, the former Speaker of the US
Congress, is oft-quoted that "All politics is local politics." One
might say the same
of market power. Some lands are sold or leased with covenants against
competition, as Gimbel's Department Store holds a covenant
on a lot adjoining its parent store on 3rd Street and
Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee.&nbsp; Such anticompetitive
arrangements, however blatant, are intra-state, and apparently
immune from sanctions under US Federal anti-trust laws.&nbsp;
Scholars of industrial organization, many of them doing
outstanding work otherwise, pay these grass-roots matters little
heed.&nbsp; Researchers and activists concentrate on commodity markets
at national and world levels - the ones subject to Federal
sanctions, such as they are.&nbsp; They could probably find more
severe and blatant market failure in local land markets.<br>
<br>
Bargaining power increases with the number of options one
has.&nbsp; A large landowner with a chain of holdings in different
jurisdictions is positioned to bargain, to play off one against the
other.&nbsp; Thus, the Disney Corporation, 1991-93, considered
rebuilding
and expanding Disneyland at its current site in Anaheim, or in Long
Beach
where it had tenure over another suitable site.&nbsp; Using this
leverage
it won concessions from both cities, "finally" choosing to
expand in Anaheim.&nbsp; It has yet to do so, however, and nothing is
really final.&nbsp; Disney has many other sites around the world.<br>
<br>
Likewise, land is a basis for oligopsony power in local labor markets.
A city's labor pool is often faced with a local employers'
association whose membership is limited by the amount of industrial
land
within reach of the labor pool.&nbsp; Migrant farm labor is
faced with statewide employers' associations who have the advantages of
limited numbers, wealth, ancient roots and stability.&nbsp; Labor
unions that organize a local plant are faced with the threat of
the "runaway shop", or merely reallocating work among
plants, when the employer owns plants elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Custom has dulled us to it, but a corporation is a pool of separate
individual landowners bargaining in concert.&nbsp; A century ago,
corporations and limited liability were viewed with suspicion and
apprehension.&nbsp; Today, hundreds and thousands of separate
landowners
pool their corporate strength against labor, as a matter of
course.&nbsp;
Some employees bargain through unions, but not as a matter of
course, and hardly ever with international options.&nbsp; In the
US, less than 20% of the labor force is unionized, yet many,
probably most economists treat labor as the only threatening
monopoly.&nbsp; They see corporations as benign; a prime cause
carried by many economists today is to eliminate the corporate
income tax completely.&nbsp; Would we saw such support
for eliminating the payroll tax, the most obvious cause of unemployment.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">e. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Land is the basis of
cartels.</span></div>
<br>
There is too much farmland to permit of monopoly control through
private
action.&nbsp; However, production controls are exerted through public
action and force of law.&nbsp; These controls operate through control
of
land, limiting the allowable acreage in certain crops.&nbsp; Seldom is
there any attempt to control other farming inputs like labor,
fertilizer, farm capital or pesticides.<br>
<br>
The best-known world cartel, OPEC, also works through control of a
natural resource.&nbsp; It is important in its own right, obviously,
but
only one of a whole genus that it represents so
conspicuously.&nbsp; There is a tendency for cartels to overexpand
under
the price umbrella they support, and then collapse, taking with them a
lot of wasted capital.&nbsp; The effect of short-run monopoly may thus
be
long-run instability (cf.&nbsp; <a href="#B-17">B-17</a>).&nbsp;
Either way, the effects
are harmful and impoverishing.

A monopoly that limits output to raise

limits hiring, both throw workers on the street, and release other
resources too.&nbsp; Why do not these workers and these raw materials
combine in new firms?&nbsp; The monopoly would defeat itself if they
could.&nbsp; Clearly the monopoly must preempt some key
bottleneck.&nbsp; Land is the most likely one, because of
limited supply and non-reproduceability.&nbsp; Somehow, ordinary micro
"price theory"
never addresses this question.<small><span

The income of depreciable capital is cash

 style="text-decoration: underline;">plus
</span>appreciation.&nbsp; That is quite a difference.<br>
<br>
With land held for appreciation there is no cash flow to disclose the
high
values and the steady accrual of gains in wealth.&nbsp; This quality of
"silent accrual" is found in land surrounding cities, or
growing retail centers, as well as in land
considered potentially mineral-bearing.&nbsp; Other land is valued
for expected higher future cash flows in its present use, or some
higher
use to come.&nbsp; Some land is valued for future "plottage"
increments from assembly, or "negative plottage" from
subdividing.<br>
<br>
Professors Haig and Simons have given their names to the standard
definition of income which includes unrealized appreciation of
durable assets like land and corporate shares as <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">current </span>income.&nbsp;
Stock brokers and real estate brokers habitually do the same thing for
the trade.&nbsp; They may appear to question it when lobbying for tax
breaks, at which time some say it is "double taxation" to tax
both current cash flow and appreciation.&nbsp; When <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">selling </span>stock or real
estate, however, unrealized appreciation is unequivocally touted as
current income, and correctly so.<br>
<br>
Some even deny that appreciation should be taxable income at all.&nbsp;
Yet, no one denies that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">de</span>preciation
should be a deduction from current
taxable income.&nbsp; This asymmetry and glaring contradiction
generally
passes unremarked.&nbsp; It could only survive if never challenged in
the
profession, which apparently it is not.&nbsp; "Land," with its
tendency to appreciate, is<b> </b>not in the abridged lexicon.
<dl>
  <dd>b.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Landowning yields
large non-cash
service flows.</span> </dd>
</dl>
Land income also includes service flows
other than cash.&nbsp;
Because of its versatility, and fundamental character, land often
yields
service flows in kind, that never pass through the market place.&nbsp;
For
example, land used for homes and owner-recreation yields no cash flow
at
all, but has high value.<br>
<br>
It is common for economists to write of the "imputed income of
durable consumer capital." especially owner-occupied houses, and
occasionally to persuade some political candidate to advocate including
their imputed income in the income tax base, or at least to end the
deduction of interest and property taxes paid on house values.&nbsp;
Those making such proposals, unfortunately, fail to exercise reasonable
care in distinguishing houses from land.&nbsp; Much or most of the
non-cash service flow received from consumer <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">capital </span>proper is not
income
at all, but two other things: a return from operation, maintenance, and
upkeep; and a return <span style="text-decoration: underline;">of</span>
capital.&nbsp; Depreciation and expenses offset
more than half the service flow from most owner-occupied houses,
especially middle-aged buildings on the steep slope of the depreciation
curve.&nbsp; The service flow from land, on the other hand, is pure
income.<br>
<br>
The measure of this imputed land income is not subjective nor
fuzzy.&nbsp; It is interest on the market price of the land, a measure
of
its opportunity cost (cf.&nbsp; <a href="#B-14">B-14</a> and <a
 href="#A-2">A-2</a>).&nbsp; Alternatively, it
is
the periodic ground rent on comparable lands.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small>
This could easily
be
included in the base of the present income tax, converting it in one
stroke into a national land tax.
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">&nbsp;<small> 37. In 1992 the
      US
Congress passed an energy
policy law including a provision that the worker who receives a parking
space from his or her employer must pay income taxes on its imputed
value
in excess of $155/month.&nbsp; The imputed value is simply what nearby
or comparable parking lots charge.&nbsp; Employers are supposed to
figure the value and include it on W-2 forms, beginning with 1994
taxes.&nbsp; (David E. Rosenbaum, 1994, "IRS eludes parking tax
law."&nbsp; New York Times News Service.&nbsp; Riverside, California,
The Press-Enterprise, 24 Feb., p. A-12.) </small></font></div>
<br>
Forest land yields cash only once in decades.&nbsp; Some land is valued
mainly for ancillary benefits like the preferential access it gives to
adjoining lands for grazing, recreation, water rights, waste disposal,
information gleaned from mining, etc.&nbsp; Other land is held for its
contingency value, for example for possible future expansion.&nbsp;
Some
is held preemptively to freeze out competition, and some is used (under
current US income tax laws) to yield non-cash tax shelter
benefits.<br>
<br>
Part of farmland value is an amenity, especially of course in pleasant
places. The value of lands held for the owner's recreational pleasure
is
non-cash.&nbsp; Part of the value of media ownership -- spectrum or
newspaper sites -- is power and prestige.&nbsp; Business
sites in Newport Beach give access to water recreation; in Cambridge,
Mass., to intellectual stimulus and hobnobbing.&nbsp; The list of
non-cash service flows from land is much longer and is limited only by
one's observation and insight.<br>
<br>
A 19th Century Briton put it like this.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"The
objects which men aim at when they become possessed of land in the
British Isles may, I think, be enumerated as follows: (1) political
influence; (2) social importance, founded on territorial possession,
the
most visible and unmistakable form of wealth; (3) power exercised over
tenantry; the pleasure of managing, directing and improving the estate
itself, (4) residential enjoyment, including what is called sport; (5)
the money return -- the rent."<br>

Throughout history the prime business of
national governments has
been to gain and keep land, mainly by force and threats (cf.&nbsp;
<a href="#B-1">B-1</a>).&nbsp; The prime business of politics has been
to apportion lands
among the winners.&nbsp; A third business is then to subsidize them in
various ways.&nbsp; It is most inconsistent, then, when the winners of
all three battles counter tax proposals by pleading poverty, saying
their
land has little value.&nbsp; How little value it has may be gauged by
playing "what if?" What if the English, with all their capital,

</b>To consume most goods and services is to use them up.&nbsp; Land is
not used up.&nbsp; "Consuming" land must have some other
meaning, therefore, than the intuitive and common idea that consuming
means turning-to-waste.&nbsp; To consume land is rather to preempt its
service flow without impairing its substance.&nbsp; To consume land is
to
occupy it for a time-slot, which may be as brief as
beating a red light or (rarely) as long as the pyramids last.<small><span

<br>
How shall we measure land-consumption by owners, where no rent is
paid?&nbsp; Is it purely subjective?&nbsp; Does it vary with the
owner's
mood and health?&nbsp; It is simpler than that, and fully
practicable.&nbsp; The essence of consuming land is preempting the
time-slot from others.&nbsp; Thus, holding land without using it, or
using it below capacity, is a form of consumption.&nbsp; The measure is
the market opportunity cost of land, i.e. the price times the interest
rate.<br>
<br>
Holding an urban site has been likened to holding a reserved seat at a
play, sporting event, or concert.&nbsp; The ticket holder properly
helps
pay for the event, whether or not he is there to enjoy it.&nbsp; As a
result, very few paid customers fail to show up.&nbsp; Likewise, people
who pay cash rent for land seldom leave it vacant.&nbsp; Doubtless if
people paid regular cash taxes to hold land, they, too, would consume
(preempt) less.<br>
<br>
Proponents of "consumer taxation" almost universally overlook
this point.&nbsp; I am not aware of one who has proposed including
land-consumption in the tax base.&nbsp; Aaron and Galper, propounding a
"cash-flow tax," explicitly allow for letting each succeeding
owner expense land purchase, effectively exempting land rents from
taxation 100%.<br>
<br>
Theirs, and other proposals, and consumer taxes actually imposed now
and in the past, bear heavily on the necessities of median
families.&nbsp; We deride the salt tax of the French <i>ancien regime,
</i>and of pre-Ghandian India.&nbsp; We recognize them as instruments
of
tyranny and class warfare, even as we tolerate modem legislators who
impose comparable burdens on ourselves, and economists who rationalize
such taxes by belittling the necessities of life.<br>
<br>
Doing so, they compound the deception in the label "consumer
taxation".&nbsp; Much of what is taxed in the name of taxing
consumers is actually used for capital formation: <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">human </span>capital
formation.&nbsp; The same economists who say human beings are or
contain
capital, turn around and tell us to tax the formation and maintenance
of
such capital, by calling it "consumption'. Coupling this
with their proposed exemption of land-consumption we have the ultimate
victory and application of semantic cleansing.&nbsp; Inconstancy, thy
name is -- neoclassical economist?<br>
<br>
<b><a name="B-14"></a>B-14.&nbsp; Land's rent is its opportunity cost,
regardless of
use<br>
<br>
</b>Land is a prior claimant on the product.&nbsp; This has been
obscured by calling rent "a residual."&nbsp; Land income is not a
residual, but a prior claimant.&nbsp; This means land rent is a much
larger share of national income than national. accounts presently show.<b><br>

using a time-slot is to consume it.<br>
<br>
A great deal of land in fact is not allocated to its highest and best
use.&nbsp; The value of preempting this land is the highest and best
use
that might have been made of the land preempted.&nbsp; That is the
economic cost.&nbsp; The land is not responsible if the manager
fails to realize its value at optimal capacity.&nbsp; Neither are the
persons who are excluded.&nbsp; Only the preemptor is responsible, as a
manager.&nbsp; This person is the residual imputee who deserves credit
for performing above par and blame for failing below.<br>

Most economic theorizing has failed to bring out this point.&nbsp; The
tendency is to treat ground rent as a residual, a waste basket for all
the errors and dereliction of responsible economic actors.&nbsp; (Note
dereliction of those who say cost is opportunity
cost, but fail to apply that properly to land, when estimating its
value.)&nbsp; This has resulted in greatly understating the value of
land relative to other factors of production.&nbsp;
Institutional and social factors, too, often obscure the opportunity
cost
of land.<br>
<br>
This is a case where theorizing lags behind practice.&nbsp; In dividing
value between land and a building affixed to it the standard practice
of
appraisers, and speculative buyers too, is the "building-residual
method." The land is appraised as though vacant; the building gets
the remaining value, if any.&nbsp; The building, once attached to a
specific site, loses the mobility of place and form that fluid capital
possesses and has no opportunity cost but scrap value, which is often
negative.&nbsp; Land, always lacking mobility of place, retains
mobility
of reuse because of its versatility, permanence, and irreproducible
location.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="B-15"></a>B-15.&nbsp; Land value is hypersensitive to the
environment (Canary

locational and the affected land cannot escape the bad, nor avoid

<br>
The value of durable capital is based on expected future cash flow, and
so is that of land, but there are three big differences at least.&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>The future of most capital is short; that of land is
infinite.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>The future of most capital is limited to the specialized use for
which
it was built; that of land is varied and unpredictable.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>The
future cash flow of capital is limited by potential competition from
new capital with a known cost of production; that from land is limited
only by future demand and is likely to rise.&nbsp; It is, as Richard
Hurd wrote in his classic <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Principles of City Land
Values</span>, "a state of
the public mind."</li>
</ul>
As to allocation of land it gravitates not just to the financially
strong but to the psychologically susceptible, that is those most prone
to overestimate future incomes, for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
There is too little in objective reality to limit expectations.&nbsp;
Many buyers have little understanding of valuation theory.&nbsp; Loan
officers should be better trained than naive new buyers, but the recent
history of U.S. and Japanese banking suggests otherwise.&nbsp; Without
understanding, there is little basis for pricing other than the
behavior of other buyers and sellers.&nbsp; "A nerd follows the
herd."&nbsp; But then valuation is purely circular and loses its anchor
in reality.&nbsp; The history of land values, accordingly, is one of
manic&#8209;depressive mob psychology with swings of high amplitude.<br>
<br>
Suppose one decides to consult a professional real estate appraiser, to
make sure he does not overbid.&nbsp; What do appraisers do?&nbsp; They
locate comparable properties that have sold recently, and advise you
accordingly.&nbsp; The buyers of those other properties hired
appraisers who did the same thing.&nbsp; If there is a building, he
tells you it is not worth more than its reproduction cost, a known
figure in the trade.&nbsp; With land, however, value is based mainly on
what others are paying, i.e. the general opinion.&nbsp; Everyone is
setting his watch by everyone else's.<br>
<br>
There is one important party whose following the herd will actually
restrain the herd, and temper its excesses.&nbsp; This party is the
assessor of land taxes.&nbsp; If land assessments rise with a herd
mania, land taxes will also rise, dashing freezing water on the mania
and stabilizing the market.&nbsp; Here is compensatory fiscal policy in
the best and original sense.&nbsp; This can really work.&nbsp; It did
work in the Progressive Era, 1900-17, when reliance on property taxes
was at an all-time high in the U.S.&nbsp; The major crash that was
"due" in 1913 or so never happened.<small><span

</b>During a land boom, financial institutions lend freely on
land.&nbsp;
After a while, mortgages secured by real estate (either directly or
through the corporate veil) become the major asset of banks.&nbsp;
Credit
follows collateral, and then helps boost its collateral value in a
positive feedback loop.&nbsp; In periods of high and rising land
prices,
borrowers get used to pledging land to secure loans, and lenders get
used
to demanding it.<br>
<br>
The credit is often used to buy still more land, to reserve for
possible
future use and at the same time to withhold from competitors.&nbsp;
Such
concentration and market control form the ugly side of extant western
"capitalism, when enterprise degenerates into greed and acquisitions
supplant innovations.<br>
<br>
As Rainer Schikele wrote, "the basis of credit is not marginal
productivity but collateral security."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small>&nbsp;
He meant that lenders are
concerned not with the productive use of their loans, but with the
security provided by borrowers' ownership of old wealth.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small></small><br>
</div>
As Keynes put it in his <i>General Theory, </i>there are two kinds of
risks: investment risk proper, and lender's risk.&nbsp; Investment risk
depends on the productivity of new capital; "lenders' risk"
depends on borrowers' old collateral, like land.&nbsp; The social
purpose
of investing is to create capital; the individual purpose is to buy
income with security.&nbsp; The second purpose leads lenders to lend to
the rich in preference to the productive.&nbsp; The principles
are at odds; the productivity principle is clearly better from the
viewpoint of basic micro efficiency.<br>
<br>
The marginal productivity basis of lending is also better in terms of
macro stability.&nbsp; Flows of credit dominated by cycles in the land
market are highly unstable.&nbsp;
The savings and loan industry calamity in the
US in the 1980s exemplifies and should settle the point.&nbsp; It has
many precedents, going back at least to the golden age of Florentine
banking, the Dutch Tulip Bubble of 1634 and the French-English
Mississippi and South Sea Bubbles of 1720.&nbsp; The rule has been that
following each collapse the hung over lenders woke up penitent.&nbsp;
Reacting to the excesses they adopted something like the English
Banking
School philosophy of avoiding real estate loans and sticking with
self-liquidating commercial loans, only to fall off the wagon in the
next
land boom thereby helping to repeat the cycle.&nbsp; How easily one
generation forgets the hard lessons life taught the one before.&nbsp;

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> <font size="-1">43.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>It
would help if
historians recorded the details more scrupulously and reminded the
world
more cogently.&nbsp; University of Chicago banking historians Lloyd
Mints, Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz have done much to belittle and
bury the matter completely, a tribute to their influence but not their
sagacity.&nbsp; Friedman and Schwartz' history of banking came at the
right time to fulfill the wishful thinking of a generation wanting to
be
free of the fear that something other than human error by a few
Directors
of the Federal Reserve Board brought on The Great Depression.</font></small><br>

where lower uses give way to higher uses. Each is an economic
frontier.&nbsp; Thus, land enhancing also means converting rangeland to
plowland, dryland to irrigated land, irrigated pasture to horticulture,
and furrow irrigation to drip irrigation.&nbsp; In urban growth, it
means
converting farmland or wasteland to dwelling units, low-density estates
to subdivisions, single-family detached units to garden apartments,
garden apartments to high-rise apartments, residential to commercial,
and
obsolete structures to modern ones.</div>

This is "forcing the
future".&nbsp; It occurs because there are "<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">economies of
simultaneity</span>" in building.&nbsp; It is hardly ever economical to
add
stories to buildings one at a time.&nbsp; If you are going to build to
four stories, you have to do it all at once.&nbsp; Suppose today's
demand is high enough to justify a two-story building, but you see the
demand rising steadily over the 60-year life of the building.&nbsp; You
build a four-story building today, and absorb early losses on the upper
two stories, as an investment for future years.&nbsp; A city builds a
four-lane street, where two would do today, anticipating higher future
usage.&nbsp; It puts excess capacity in its water and sewer lines, for
future growth.&nbsp; Such examples are legion.<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">Economies
of simultaneity are related to <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">economies of scale</span>.&nbsp;
Building higher, taken by itself, suffers diseconomies, also known as
increasing costs.&nbsp; On the other hand, building larger, with
horizontal expansion, evinces economies of scale.&nbsp; It also
requires
more land, meaning more land rent.&nbsp; It comes into style during
periods of rent-leading capital building.<br>

In a speculative land boom, land prices go prematurely high.&nbsp;
Premature high land values profoundly distort the character of capital
investment.&nbsp; High land prices stimulate land-saving,
land-enhancing
and land-linking investments.&nbsp; This is a rational economic
response
when and if the market is sending the right signals.&nbsp; Ideally, an
optimally high level of land rents and values serves as a community
synchronizer, causing everyone to build <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">as though others were going to
build complementarily in synchronized fashion</span>.<br>
<br>
However, in the frenzy of a speculative boom the market sends the wrong
signals.&nbsp; Land is peculiarly subject to irrational speculative
pricing&nbsp;
in booms because of its subjective pricing - see <a href="#B-16">B-16</a>.<br>
<br>
Overpricing of land reserves land for two contrasting kinds of buyers
and
holders.<br>
<br>
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Type
A buyer</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">s would "force
the future" with
"rent-leading" buildings.&nbsp;</span> They plan to and do develop
land for a future demand higher than present demand.&nbsp; In Chicago,
1835, this was exemplified by building four-story buildings outside The
Loop (the city center).&nbsp; Overpricing and consequent
over-improvement
gets greater, the further out you go.<br>
<br>
When that demand fails to materialize, Type A buyers cannot recover
their
money.&nbsp; They cannot rent out all their floor space, if that is
what
they built.&nbsp; Or they cannot use the full capacity of their
tannery,
harbor, shipyard, sawmill, packing plant, soap factory, brickyard, or
whatever they overbuilt.<br>
<br>
When Type A buyers develop land beyond the reach of existing
infrastructure, they force extensions of same which are often losers,
cross-subsidized by the whole system.<br>
<br>
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Type
B landowners</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> just hold
land unused or underused.</span>&nbsp; Rather than
force the future, they would free-ride on the future.&nbsp; They are
usually looking or expecting to sell for a rise.&nbsp; Type B-1 is the
aggressive outside buyer, the stereotypical "land speculator"
who does this calculatingly, cold-heartedly, as a purely pecuniary
investment.&nbsp; Type B-2 is the ancient owner whose land just happens
to lie in the way of growth.&nbsp; Type B-2 owners are sympathetic
figures in popular drama and sentiment.&nbsp; They are passive victims
of
change, clinging to old values against mechanistic, impersonal,
exogenous, amoral, modernizing forces.&nbsp; However, their market
behavior has much the same economic consequences as that of Type B-1.
Many turn out to be ambivalent, resisting change for a few years while
quietly expecting to sell out for the top dollar for their
retirement.<br>
<br>
The land of Type B landowners absorbs no capital directly, but much
capital indirectly, by forcing the stretching-out of all land-linking
investments in space, and generating no traffic or use to justify those
that are built to and past them.&nbsp; Empty land also generates no
synergistic spillover gains to raise the cash flow of surrounding,
complementary lands.&nbsp; Thus it helps freeze capital sunk in
improving
them.<br>
<br>

 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </x-tab><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Land-saving
capital
is well above average in durability.&nbsp; </span><br>
</div>
<br>
Following an argument
developed by Smith, Ricardo, Mill, Wicksell, Spietboff, Hayek, and
others, an excess commitment of capital to fixed forms
with slow recovery rates brings on a shortage of job-making
investing.&nbsp; See the summary in Haberler, <i>Prosperity and
Depression.<br>

<div align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br>
</div>
In summary, we have reviewed ten primary
reasons why economic theory
should treat land as a distinctive factor of production; and nineteen
practical inferences therefrom.&nbsp; Making land markets, land policy,
and land taxation work well for the general welfare is a major
challenge
for economists and statesmen.&nbsp; They have neglected it for too long
by swallowing the peculiar neoclassical sophisms that would obscure or
deny all distinctions between land and capital.<br>
