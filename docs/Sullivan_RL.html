<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Are you a Real Libertarian, or a
ROYAL Libertarian?</b></p>
<center>by Dan Sullivan <br>
founder, geolibertarian society, and former
chair, <br>
Libertarian Party of Allegheny County, (Pittsburgh)
Pennsylvania</center>
<p>We call ourselves the "party of principle," and we base property
rights on the principle that everyone is entitled to the fruits of
his labor. Land, however, is not the fruit of anyone's labor, and our
system of land tenure is based not on labor, but on decrees of
privilege issued from the state, called titles. In fact, the term
"real estate" is Middle English (originally French) for "royal
state." The "title" to land is the essence of the title of nobility,
and the root of noble privilege.</p>
<p><a name="The royal free lunch"></a><b>The royal free lunch</b></p>
<p>When the state granted land titles to a fraction of the
population, it gave that fraction devices with which to levy, and
pocket, tolls on the fruits of the labor of others. Those without
land privileges must either buy or rent those privileges from the
people who received the grants or from their assignees. Thus the
state titles enable large landowners to collect a transfer payment,
or "free lunch" from the actual land users.</p>
<blockquote><i>The widow is gathering nettles for her children's
dinner; a perfumed seigneur, delicately lounging in the Oeil de Boeuf,
hath an alchemy whereby he will extract the third nettle and call it
rent.</i> --Carlyle</blockquote>
<p><a name="Tortured rationalizations"></a><b>Tortured
rationalizations</b></p>
<p>According to royal libertarians, land becomes private property
when one mixes one's labor with it. And mixing what is yours with
what is not yours in order to own the whole thing is considered great
sport. But the notion is filled with problems. How much labor does it
take to claim land, and how much land can one claim for that labor?
And for how long can one make that claim?</p>
<p>According to classical liberals, land belonged to the user for as
long as the land was being used, and no longer. But according to
royal libertarians, land belongs to the first user, forever. So, do
the oceans belong to the heirs of the first person to take a fish out
or put a boat in? Does someone who plows the same field each year own
only one field, while someone who plows a different field each year
owns dozens of fields? Should the builder of the first
transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn't we at least
have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to
the earth at all? To royal libertarians there are not, but classical
liberals recognized that unlimited ownership of land never flowed
from use, but from the state:</p>
<blockquote><i>A right of property in movable things is admitted before
the establishment of government. A separate property in lands not till
after that establishment.... He who plants a field keeps possession of
it till he has gathered the produce, after which one has as good a
right as another to occupy it. Government must be established and laws
provided, before lands can be separately appropriated and their owner
protected in his possession. Till then the property is in the body of
the nation.</i> --Thomas Jefferson</blockquote>
<p><b>"<a name="But we're used to it"></a>But we're used to
it"</b></p>
<p>A favorite excuse of royal libertarians is that the land has been
divided up for so long that tracing the rightful owners would be
pointless. But there can be no rightful owners if we all have an
inalienable right of access to the earth. It is not some ancient
injustice we seek to rectify, but an ongoing injustice. The piece of
paper granting title might be ancient, but the tribute levied on the
landless goes on and on.</p>
<p>One might as well have accepted monarchy under the excuse that
whatever conquest led to monarchy occurred centuries ago, and that
tracing the rightful monarchs would be pointless. Indeed, landed
aristocracy is the last remnant of monarchy.</p>
<p><a name="Phony Laissez Faire"></a><b>Phony Laissez Faire</b></p>
<blockquote><i>AFTER conquest and confiscation have been effected, and
the State set up, its first concern is with the land.... In its
capacity as ultimate landlord, the State distributes the land among its
beneficiaries on its own terms</i>. --Albert J. Nock, Our Enemy the
State</blockquote>
<p>The English free-trader Cobden remarked that "you who free the
land will do more for the people than we who have freed trade."
Indeed, how can anyone speak of free trade when the trader has to pay
tribute to some favored land-entitlement holder in order to do
business?</p>
<blockquote><i>This imperfect policy of non-intervention, or
laissez-faire, led straight to a most hideous and dreadful economic
exploitation; starvation wages, slum dwelling, killing hours,
pauperism, coffin-ships, child-labour -- nothing like it had ever been
seen in modern times...People began to say, if this is what State
abstention comes to, let us have some State intervention. </i>
  <p><i>But the state </i><b><i>had</i></b><i> intervened; that was
the whole trouble. The State had established one monopoly--the
landlord's monopoly of economic rent--thereby shutting off great hordes
of people from free access to the only source of human subsistence, and
driving them into factories to work for whatever Mr. Gradgrind and Mr.
Bottles chose to give them. The land of England, while by no means
nearly all </i><b><i>actually</i></b><i> occupied, was all </i><b><i>legally</i></b><i>
occupied; and this State-created monopoly enabled landlords to satisfy
their needs and desires with little exertion or none, but it also
removed the land from competition with industry in the labor market,
thus creating a huge, constant and exigent labour-surplus. </i>[Emphasis
Nock's] --Albert J. Nock, "The Gods' Lookout" February 1934</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="State land vs. common land"></a><b>State land vs. common
land</b></p>
<p>The distinction between common property and state property is lost
on royal libertarians. Common property is that to which we all have
inalienable rights. State property is that which the state actually
owns, and can dispose of as it sees fit. For example, a public right
of way is literally a right of way. Under principles of common law,
nobody, not even the king, could close a traveled road and make it
private property. A state maintenance truck, on the other hand, is
state property, which can be sold if it no longer suits state
purposes.</p>
<blockquote><i>The earth, therefore, and all things therein, are the
general property of all mankind, from the immediate gift of the Creator.</i>
--William Blackstone</blockquote>
<p>It is a royal libertarian notion, and not a classical liberal
ideal, to treat land as state property, for if land did not
rightfully belong to the state, how could the state have granted it
to favored citizens?</p>
<p>Classical liberals, not royal libertarians, are the ones who deny
the state's right to appropriate the earth and allocate it to
privileged individuals on favored terms. Classical liberals also who
hold the key to abolishing taxation, by suggesting that the community
(not the state) charge a user fee to landholders based on the value
of the land.</p>
<p><a name="The ultimate user's fee"></a><b>The ultimate user's
fee</b></p>
<p>Classical liberals recognized that exclusive access to land, and
especially to more land than one was using, was a privilege that
should be paid for, thereby eliminating the need for taxes. It is not
a fee for using land, but a fee for the state privilege of denying
use of that land to everyone else.</p>
<blockquote><i>Men did not make the earth.... It is the value of the
improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is individual
property.... Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for
the land which he holds.</i> --Tom Paine, "<a
 href="http://geolib.pair.com/essays/paine.tom/agjst.html">Agrarian
Justice</a>," paragraphs 11 to 15
  <p><i>Another means of silently lessening the inequality of [landed]
property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to
tax the higher portions or property in geometrical progression as they
rise.</i> --Thomas Jefferson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today's land value tax advocates consider graduated land value tax
to be unnecessary and problematic, leading to artificial subdivision
(and phony subdivision) of land. The point is that Jefferson, to whom
libertarians pay homage, considered land monopoly a great evil and
land value tax a remedy, as did many other classical liberals:</p>
<blockquote><i>Ground rents are a species of revenue which the owner,
in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Ground
rents are, therefore, perhaps a species of revenue which can best bear
to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them.</i> --Adam Smith
  <p><i>Landlords grow richer in their sleep, without working, risking,
or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it does
from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
and not to the individual who might hold title.</i> --John Stuart Mill</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="Two different kinds of indirect"></a><b>Two different
kinds of indirect taxation</b></p>
<p>One of the most perverted twisting of concepts is reflected in
what Hamilton called "indirect taxation." To him, and to many royal
libertarians, indirect taxation is "hidden" taxation, as a
value-added tax or sales tax that is buried in the price of purchased
goods. This kind of indirectness is hardly admirable, and is similar
to the kind of indirectness involved in chicanery and duplicity.
Small wonder Jefferson called Hamilton a monarchist.</p>
<p>The Articles of Confederation embodied an entirely different
concept of indirect taxation. The United States was to levy a tax,
not on individual property holders, but on each state, based on its
aggregate land value. The assumption was that each state would levy a
similar tax on each county, and so on down to the individual. In this
way, the individual would never have to face a federal tax agent
directly, and if the federal government did not have the full support
of the states, it could not bully them as easily as it could bully
individuals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, states did not support the federal government to
its satisfaction from the beginning (being strapped from the war).
Rather than working things out patiently, Hamilton introduced
power-centralizing measures into the new Constitution. One was the
other kind of indirect taxation, the mosquito-bite kind that you
don't see happening. Royal libertarians trumpet this covert taxation
as a virtue over direct real estate taxation, even when it means that
"free trade" is being taxed.<br>
</p>
<a name="Socialist Confusions"></a><b>Socialist Confusions</b>
<p>The classical liberal distinctions between land, labor and capital
were greatly confused by socialists, and particularly Marxists, who
substituted the fuzzy abstract term, "means of production," for all
three factors. They also blurred the distinction between common
property and state property, for socialists believed, as royalty also
believed, that they were the people.</p>
<p>Today, the confusions between land and capital and between state
property and common property are shared by socialists and royal
libertarians, and only classical liberals keep these distinctions
clearly defined. Yet royal libertarians frequently duck the land
issue by charging that it is the classical liberals, not the royal
libertarians, who have embraced socialist ideas.</p>
<p><a name="Blocking Locke"></a><b>Blocking Locke</b></p>
<p>John Locke is often misrepresented by royal libertarians, who
quote him very selectively. For example, Locke did say that:</p>
<blockquote><i>Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature
hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and
joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his
property.</i></blockquote>
<p>But Locke condemned anyone who took more than he needed as a
"spoiler of the commons":</p>
<blockquote><i>...if the fruits rotted, or the venison putrified,
before he could spend it, he offended against the common law of nature,
and was liable to be punished; he invaded his neighbour's share, for he
had no right, farther than his use called for any of them, and they
might serve to afford him conveniences of life. </i>
  <p><i>The same measures governed the possession of land too:
whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it
spoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could
feed, and make use of, the cattle and product was also his. But if
either the grass of his enclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of
his planting perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of
the earth, notwithstanding his enclosure, was still to be looked on as
waste, and might be the possession of any other. </i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Locke also restricted appropriation of land by the proviso,
ignored by royal libertarians, that there must be still enough, and
as good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in
effect, there was never the less left for others because of his
enclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make
use of, does as good as take nothing at all.</p>
<p>Now if the situation is that there is enough free land, and as
good, left after you take and cultivate your land, than your land has
no market value, for who would pay you for land that is not better
than land that can be had for free? So, besides the fact that Locke's
justification of privatizing land is far more limited than royal
libertarians portray it to be, it is irrelevant to the question of
land value tax, as it applies only to land that has no value.</p>
Furthermore, Locke based his scenario on pre-monetary societies,
where a landholder would find that "it was useless, as well as
dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed."
With the introduction of money, Locke noted, all land quickly became
appropriated. Why? Because with money, those who can take more land
than they have personal use for suddenly have reason to do so, as
between them they will have taken all the land, and others will
have to pay rent to them. So, with the introduction of money, the
Lockean rationale for landed property falls apart, even according to
Locke.
<p>And while Locke did not propose a remedy specifically for to this
problem, he repeatedly stated that all taxes should be on real
estate.</p>
<p><b>The <a name="tragedy of the common misunders"></a>tragedy of
the common misunderstanding</b></p>
<p>In their search for excuses to deny any common right to land,
royal libertarians are fond of citing Garrett Hardin's work, "<em><strong>Tragedy
of the Commons</strong></em>." Or at least they cite the title, which is all most
royal libertarians are familiar with. Hardin is himself an advocate
of land value taxation, and has criticized misinterpretations of his
work with the lament that "The title of my 1968 paper should have
been `The Tragedy of the <b><i>Unmanaged</i></b> Commons.'"
[Emphasis Hardin's]</p>
<p><a name="Thoughtful Libertarian Party le"></a><b>Thoughtful
Libertarian Party leadership</b></p>
<p>Fortunately, the bias toward royal libertarianism has been shaken
off by many of the philosophical leaders of the party. Founder David
Nolan supports land value tax as the only tax that does not fall on
productivity, and the late Karl Hess often described land value tax
as the one tax to levy until the state could be abolished entirely.
It is mostly the von Miseans, the Objectivists, and the wishful
thinkers who adopt the royal rationalization that they can hoard all
the land to themselves with impunity.</p>
<p><a name="The red, red herring"></a><b>The red, red herring</b></p>
<p>Royal libertarians are fond of confusing the classical liberal
concept of common land ownership, particularly as espoused by land
value tax advocate Henry George, with socialism. Yet socialists have
always been contemptuous of George and of the distinction between
land monopoly and capital monopolies. However, Frank Chodorov and
Albert J. Nock (the original editors of The Freeman) were both
advocates of George's economic remedies as well as lovers of
individual liberty.</p>
<blockquote><i>The only reformer abroad in the world in my time who
interested me in the least was Henry George, because his project did
not contemplate prescription, but, on the contrary, would reduce it to
almost zero. He was the only one of the lot who believed in freedom, or
(as far as I could see) had any approximation to an intelligent idea of
what freedom is, and of the economic prerequisites to attaining
it....One is immensely tickled to see how things are coming out
nowadays with reference to his doctrine, for George was in fact the
best friend the capitalist ever had. He built up the most complete and
most impregnable defense of the rights of capital that was ever
constructed, and if the capitalists of his day had had sense enough to
dig in behind it, their successors would not now be squirming under the
merciless exactions which collectivism is laying on them, and which
George would have no scruples whatever about describing as sheer
highwaymanry.</i> --Albert J. Nock "Thoughts on Utopia"</blockquote>
<p><a name="Von Mises misses"></a><b>Von Mises misses</b></p>
<p>Ludwig von Mises acknowledged in several places wholly unique
distinctions between land and capital, but in his zeal to denounce
land value tax, stated that,</p>
<blockquote><i>Classical economy erred when it assigned land a distinct
place in its theoretical scheme. Land is, in its economic sense, a
factor of production, and the laws determining the formation of the
prices of land are the same that determine the formation of other forms
of production.</i></blockquote>
<p>Or, paraphrasing of Jay Leno, go ahead and buy up the land. We'll
make more. The difference between land and capital is huge, and
explains why the cost of silicon chips goes down as demand goes up,
while the cost of Silicon Valley goes up as demand goes up. There is
no natural monopolization of capital, but, with state sanction, there
is monopolization of land. But von Mises would sooner obscure these
distinctions in socialist fashion than to embrace a proposal he
mistakenly thought to be socialist.</p>
<p>In his first edition of Human Action, von Mises attacked land
value tax as based on the socialist principle that legitimate
property flows only from labor. But that is also a libertarian
principle, a classical liberal principle, an Austrian principle, and
even the von Misean principle behind private property! So, by the
third edition, von Mises changed his text to read that land taxers
claim legitimate property flows only from manual labor.</p>
<p>This is much more logically consistent, but factually incorrect.
It is a correct assessment of what many socialists believe, but it is
not a correct assessment of what land taxers believe. Henry George,
the most prominent land taxer of all, wrote in his magnum opus,
<b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></i></b>,</p>
<blockquote><i>Thus the term labor includes all human exertion in the
production of wealth, and wages, being that part of the produce which
goes to labor, includes all reward for such exertion. There is,
therefore, in the political-economic sense of the term, no distinction
as to the kind of labor, or as to whether its reward is received
through an employer or not.... </i></blockquote>
<p>George also defended the ownership of property that flows from the
employment of capital.</p>
<p>Perhaps von Mises was biased by his location in Europe, where
classical liberalism had not fared as well as in America. He might
also have first seen land value tax in the Communist Manifesto, and
not realized that it was there as a socialist ploy to co-opt support
from classical liberalism. (Marx expressed contempt for land value
tax as a reform in its own right, and openly stated that his support
of it was only to draw people to what he really wanted, which was to
control capital.) If this is where von Mises got his first exposure
to the idea, it would not be surprising to see him close his mind to
it.</p>
<p><a name="Ayn Rand comes sooo close!"></a><b>Ayn Rand comes sooo
close!</b></p>
<>Ayn Rand made arguments against perpetual intellectual property
that are remarkably similar to arguments against perpetual landed
property. She also saw the distinction between land and capital in
terms of common vs. private property, but fell back into confusion at
other
times. She rightly chastised the Encyclopaedia Brittanica's
definition of capitalism for confusing land and capital, which she
quoted as follows:</>
<blockquote><i>Fundamental to any system called capitalist are the
relations between private owners of nonpersonal means of production
(land, mines, </i><b><i>industrial</i></b><i> plants, etc.,
collectively known as capital)</i> [emphasis Rand's]</blockquote>
<p>Then she quoted a John Galt speech in Atlas Shrugged in which Galt
stated sarcastically, "A factory is a `natural resource', like a
tree, a rock or a mud puddle."</p>
<p>By Jove, I think she's...</p>
<p>But are the heroes of <b><i>Atlas Shrugged</i></b> real
capitalists? The inventor John Galt is, and perhaps Hank Rearden of
Rearden Metals is, too, although one wonders where he got his ore and
fuel. But Taggart Railways enjoys extremely valuable right-of-way
privileges from the state. (Once land is parceled out, it is
virtually impossible to build a railroad without either land value
tax or eminent domain.)</p>
<p>Then there is Francisco D'Anconia, who owned the world's richest
copper deposits, and who took delight in blowing up his mines and
driving the price of copper through the roof_something that would not
work nearly as well for a capitalist as for a resource monopolist, as
there is no way competitors can make copper ore that doesn't already
exist, and, buried or not, D'Anconia's copper ore still belonged to
him.</p>
<p><a name="The economics of Galt's Gulch"></a><b>The economics of
Galt's Gulch</b></p>
<p>Most revealing of all is the Randian utopia, Galt's Gulch, which
was financed entirely from, yes, land rents. Midas Mulligan owned the
whole place, and was, in essence, the government. All the common
services, from Galt's magic energy machine to Hank Rearden's village
railroad, to their defense system (some sort of jammer that made the
valley invisible to passing planes) were financed from ground rents
collected by Mulligan from the landholders. Although politically
Galt's Gulch was a monarchy, economically it was a Georgist
Single-Tax community, with all community services paid for from the
rent of land.</p>
<p><a name="Who has the authority to collec"></a><b>Who has the
authority to collect land rent?</b></p>
<p>Many libertarians struggle with the legitimate question of how any
governing body achieves rightful jurisdiction in a community, and we
join them in opposing collection by such super-statist organizations
as the United Nations, which is substantially a federation of
tyrannies. However, royal libertarians raise the question selectively
and rhetorically in regard to community collection of land rents.
They acknowledge that there must be courts to settle, among other
things, property disputes. It seems rather obvious that whatever
entity has authority to rule on who gets the land also has authority
to rule on who gets the land rent.</p>
<p><a name="Fear of a funded government"></a><b>Fear of a funded
government</b></p>
<p>There is also a well founded libertarian concern that land rent
could provide funds enough to support a corrupt and oppressive
government. Most libertarian supporters of the governmental
collection of land rent therefore fall into two camps. One would give
the people power to limit how much money the government can take, but
would stipulate that all such money come entirely from ground rents
and natural resource severance royalties. The other would take the
full rent, but would stipulate that the government can still only
spend what the citizens authorize it to spend. The rest would be
distributed on a per-capita basis.</p>
<p><a name="Ending excuses for big governme"></a><b>Ending excuses
for big government</b></p>
<p>Much of the government spending to which libertarians strenuously
object is made necessary by its taxing productivity instead of land
values.</p>
<p>The property tax falls mostly on improvements, so less housing is
built, giving the government an excuse to build public housing.
Profits are taxed, leading to less employment and giving government
an excuse to spend money on economic stimulus projects. Family income
is taxed to the point that they have difficulty buying a house or
sending their children to college, so government institutes
subsidized mortgages and student loans.</p>
<p>Even the indirect effects are substantial. Land speculations gone
sour chew up inner cities, so poor people turn to crime (if drug
selling and prostitution be crimes) and the government gets an excuse
to beef up the police state.</p>
<p>Politically connected real estate interests see that they can buy
up land in the boondocks for a pittance and then get other taxpayers
to build them a superhighway, increasing the value of their holdings
by orders of magnitude. With land value tax they would have
ultimately paid for their own highway or more likely would not have
had it built in the first place.</p>
<p>Even welfare increases do not stay in the hands of welfare
recipients, but are quickly greeted by higher rent demands from
ghetto landlords. (The War on Poverty did little to end poverty, but
it did a lot to enrich absentee owners of poor communities.)</p>
<blockquote><i>All goes back to the land, and the land owner is enabled
to absorb to himself a share of almost every public and every private
benefit, however important or however pitiful those benefits may be. </i>
--<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Churchill_TMOAM.html">Winston Churchill</a></blockquote>
<p><a name="Isn't there some other way?"></a><b>Isn't there some other
way?</b></p>
<p>There are two models that tie land ownership with use. One is
replacing all taxes on productivity, that is, on land use, with taxes
on the value of land itself. The other is the Lockean pre-monetary
system. It would have to rely on a judicial mechanism, whereby you
assert your claim to land by demonstrating that you are using the
land. While the latter method does not provide any community funds (a
mixed blessing, perhaps), it does subject your landhold to the
discretion of that judicial mechanism. It is far less intrusive into
your business for the community to assess the market value of land
than to assess the validity of what you are doing on that land.</p>
<p><a name="Can't we do this without the st"></a><b>Can't we do this
without the state?</b></p>
<p>There are, in fact, proprietary communities operating on the
single tax model. Arden, Delaware, with a population of 4900, has had
no local taxes since 1900. The Arden Corporation collects a fair
market rent on each land parcel, which is reappraised annually. (They
actually collect only about a fourth of the rent to which they are
entitled.) From that they not only pay for all the municipal
services, but rebate all property taxes levied by the county and
school district.</p>
<p>There are excellent reasons for libertarians to prefer the land
trust route over the political route. Private communities can be
built on explicit contracts (leases) with the citizens, can have
internal democratic processes that are vastly superior to electoral
democracy, can be far more flexible and free of state intervention,
and can be downright profitable (even with trust investors pocketing
a mere fraction of the rent). Most of all, dealing with investors is
far more pleasant and self-affirming than dealing with
politicians.</p>
<p><a name="Geolibertarians"></a><b>Geolibertarians</b></p>
<p>We are libertarians who make the classical liberal distinction
between land, labor and capital. We believe in the private possession
of land without interference from the state, but in the community
collection of land rent to prevent monopolization of land.</p>
<p>We believe that all government activities should at least be
limited to those which increase the value of land by more than what
the government collects, and that government should be funded
entirely from the land value increases it creates.</p>
<p>We oppose direct state monopolization of land as well as
state-sanctioned private monopolization of land, and advocate that
state and federally held land pay land rent to the communities the
same as private land.</p>
<p>We advocate that government be allowed to spend only what is
authorized by voter referendum or similar device and that it take for
itself the minimum it is authorized to spend. Those who advocate
collection of the full rent stipulate that the proceeds be divided
among community members on a per-capita or similar basis, for the
land, and the rent, belong to the people, not the state.</p>
<p>We condemn the taxation of property improvements, and of all
activities, productive, consumptive, or recreational, as invasions by
the state into the private affairs of free individuals.</p>
