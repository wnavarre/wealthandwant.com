<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ethical
Land Tenure</span><br>
by Alanna Hartzok<br>
Scotland, PA<br>
</div>
About 20 years ago I put together a paper called "Ethical Land Tenure"
distributed as a resource directory.<br>
<br>
I want to tell you the story of Charles Avilla. A while back I came
across a book called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ownership, Early
Christian Teachings</span>. Avilla was a divinity student in the
Phillipines. One of his professors had a great concern about poverty
conditions in the Phillipines, and was taking students out to prisons
where the cooks were the land rights revolutionaries in the
Phillipines. Because they kept pushing for land reform for the people,
they had ended up in jail. So they were political prisoners who were
reading the Bible and were asking the question, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who did God give this earth to? Who does it
belong to?</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It isn't
in the Bible that so few should have so much and so many have so little.</span>
In the theological world in this upscale seminary he was trying to put
this together about poverty and what the biblical teachings were. He
had a thesis to write and he was thinking he would do something about
economic justice. One of his professors thought there would be a wealth
of information from the church's early history, the first 300 years
after Jesus. So he actually went back to read the Latin and Greek about
land ownership and found a wealth of information about the prophetic
railings of the people in that early time on the rights of the land.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a few quotes from that early period.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Nehemiah 5:11, "Restore, I pray you, to
them this day their lands, their vineyards, their olive yards, and
their houses."<br>
<br>
Ezekiel 33:24, "The land is given us as an inheritance."<br>
<br>
Ecclesiastes 5:9, "The profit of the earth is for all."<br>
<br>
And Isaiah 5:8, "Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field
to field til there be no place ..." Leviticus 25:23, "The land is mine,
for you are strangers and sojourners with me."</div>
<br>
In the Judaic tradition, and the Talmudic tradition, how much of the
Jubilee justice was actually implemented is a subject of discussion.
Some say it was a good idea but not put in place. Others say it was
substantially put into place.<br>
<br>
The Talmudic rabinical discussion is of interest to Georgists because
they tried to allocate the land according to the richness of the soil
for agriculture. For better soil, richer for agriculture, maybe an acre
of that would be allocated. On the poorer soil, these tribes could get
five acres.<br>
<br>
The other thing was some lands were closer to the market. Some land was
closer to Jerusalem. That is an advantage over those who would have to
travel a longer distance to get to the market. How do you have an equal
rights distribution of land allocation with reference to the market
problem? For those more advantageously situated, the adjustment was to
be made by money. Those holding land nearer the city should pay in to
the common treasury the estimated excess of value attaining to it by
reason of superior situation. While those holding land of less value by
reason of distance from the city would receive from the treasury a
money compensation. On the more valuable holdings would be imposed a
tax or a lease fee, the measure of which was the excess of their
respective values over a given standard, and the fund thus created was
to be paid out in due proportion to those whose holdings were in less
favorable locations.<br>
<br>
In this, then, we see affirmed the doctrine that natural advantages are
common property and may not be diverted to private gain. Throughout the
ages when wisdom is applied to land problems, we see this emerge.<br>
<br>
Charles Avilla in his book <span style="font-style: italic;">Ownership,
Early Christian Teachings</span> mentioned Henry George twice as being
the prophetic voice of recent times that is most closely attuned to
these ancient truths.<br>
