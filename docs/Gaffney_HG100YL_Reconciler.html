<center><b>Henry George 100 Years Later: The Great Reconciler</b>
<p>By M. Mason Gaffney, Ph.D.</p>
</center>
<p>Henry George (1839-1897) is best known today for <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b></a> (1879). Eloquent, timely and challenging, this
book soon became and remains the all-time best-seller on economic
theory and policy.</p>
<p>In 1879, George electrified the world by identifying one
underlying cause for two great economic plagues: </p>
<ul>
  <li>chronic poverty arising from insufficient demand for labor, and </li>
  <li>cycles of boom and bust. </li>
</ul>
<p>These twin plagues arose from concentrated ownership of land,
compounded by land speculation. Large landowners and speculators
(often one and the same) held the best land idle or underused,
forcing labor onto marginal land and driving down wages. Collapse of
speculative land price bubbles caused periodic slumps.</p>
<p><i>(By "land" George meant exclusive rights to use natural
resources in a specified territory. It included mining, water,
fishing, and timber rights, road and rail rights-of way, and some
patents. George emphasized the high value and productivity of urban
land, which facilitated communication and trade. Today, we would add
to "land" such items as taxi medallions, telecommunications licenses
and pollution "rights".)</i></p>
<p><b>George followed his analysis with a plausible, practicable
remedy: eliminate all taxes except for a tax on land values.</b> The
"single tax," as it later became known, would invigorate the economy
by breaking up large idle holdings, making land available to those
who would use it. And it would suck the air out of speculative
bubbles, damping the boom and bust cycle. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Taxing land is very progressive because land ownership is highly
concentrated among the most wealthy, far more concentrated than income.
  </li>
  <li>Taxing land is fair, because the community rather than the
individual landowner creates land values. </li>
  <li>Taxing land is economically efficient, because the owner cannot
avoid a land tax ("shift" it) by choosing less-taxed options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both George's analysis and his remedy sprang directly from
classical economic theory. Such giants as Adam Smith, David Ricardo,
and John Stuart Mill, had already decried the evils of concentrated
land ownership, which they called "land monopoly." George carried
classical economics to its logical conclusion -- and popularized that
conclusion with stunning effect.</p>
<p>George emerged from a raw new colony, California, as a scrappy
marginal journalist. Yet his ideas exploded through the sophisticated
metropolitan world as into a vacuum. <a style="font-weight: bold;"
 href="../George_P&P.html"><i>Progress and Poverty</i></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> sold
millions of copies worldwide, in dozens of translations, second only
to the Bible. </span>Returning from Ireland as reporter for <i>The
Irish
World</i> of New York, George was lionized by Irish-New Yorkers for
his stand on the Irish land question. With ethnic, union and
socialist backing, he formed the United Labour Party in New York, and
ran for mayor in 1886. Seven short years after leaving California,
George nearly took over as Mayor of New York City, the financial and
intellectual capital of the nation. He beat Theodore Roosevelt, but
lost to the Tammany candidate, Abram S. Hewitt &#8212; by electoral
fraud.</p>
<p>In three more years, George had become a major influence in
sophisticated Britain, as "adviser and field-general in land reform
strategy" to the Radical wing of the Liberal Party. He was not even a
British subject. In 1891, the Party adopted a land-tax plank, the
"Newcastle Programme." Successive Liberal Governments of
Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith, and Lloyd George carried forward
modified "Georgist" policies.</p>
<p>George<a href="../HG/writings.htm"> toured the world</a> as
an immensely popular political
activist, orator and folk hero. He died suddenly in 1897, while
running a second time for Mayor of New York City. A hundred thousand
mourners marched at his funeral.</p>
<p>In the US, "Georgism" melded into the populist movement, and later
into the Progressive Movement. At the national level, the Progressive
Movement dominated both major political parties for 17 years,
1902-19. At the local level, its influence continued through the
early 1920s. Local property taxation was modified along Georgist
lines: land assessments were raised relative to improvements and
rates were increased substantially. California water districts
financed by land taxes catapulted California to the top-producing
farm state in the Union, using land that had been desert or range.
California generated farm jobs and homes, while other states
destroyed them by allowing well-connected speculators and "robber
barons" to grab large tracts of land. A Georgist, Congressman Warren
Worth Bailey of Pennsylvania, drafted <b>the first Federal personal
income tax law on Georgist lines: falling mainly on very high incomes
from property.</b></p>
<p>In 1913 William S. U'Ren, "Father of the Initiative and
Referendum," created this system of direct democracy expressly to
push single-tax initiatives in Oregon. In 1910, as a by-product of
U'Ren's single-tax campaigns, Oregon had adopted the first
residential primary law. This law was quickly imitated by many other
states. The passage of these major electoral reforms during Woodrow
Wilson's Governorship of New Jersey allowed him to win populist
support and the Democratic nomination for President in 1912, and then
defeat Taft. Wilson's mentor in New Jersey was an earnest Georgist,
George L. Record. Record had gotten railroad lands up-taxed to the
great benefit of public schools in New Jersey, and to the
impoverishment of special-interest election funds. President Wilson
included Georgists in his Cabinet (Newton D. Baker, Louis F. Post,
Franklin K. Lane, and William B. Wilson), and collaborated with
single-tax Congressmen like Henry George, Jr., and Warren Worth
Bailey.</p>
<p><a href="Fels.html">Joseph Fels</a>, an idealistic American
manufacturer, threw himself
and his fortune into the English land tax campaign, culminating in
the Parliamentary revolution of 1909, which stripped the House of
Lords of its power to veto tax bills. Subsequently, he threw millions
into single-tax campaigns in the US. In 1916, a "pure single-tax"
initiative, led by <a href="North_SotGA.htm">Luke North</a>, won 31% of the votes in California.
Even while "losing," campaigns like these kept the issue highly
visible. Assessors consequently focused more attention on land. <b>By
1917 in California, land value constituted 72% of the assessment roll
for property taxation -- a much higher fraction than today.</b></p>
<p>George's ideas were carried worldwide by such towering figures as
David Lloyd George and George Bernard Shaw in England, Leo Tolstoy
and Alexandr Kerensky in Russia, Sun Yat-sen in China, Billy Hughes
in Australia, Rolland O'Regan in New Zealand, Chaim Weizmann in
Palestine, Francisco Madero in Mexico, and other leaders in Denmark,
South Africa, and around the world. In England, parts of Lloyd
George's budget speech of 1909 could have been written by Henry
George himself. Some of Winston Churchill's speeches were written by
Georgist ghosts.</p>
<p>Twentieth century historians Raymond Moley and Eric Goldman
emphasize George's impact. According to Moley, George "touched almost
all of the corrective influences which were the result of the
Progressive movement. The restriction of monopoly, more democratic
political machinery, municipal reform, the elimination of privilege
in railroads, the regulation of public utilities, and the improvement
of labor laws and working conditions -- all were ... accelerated by
George." According to Goldman, George inspired most of the major
reformers of the early 20th Century: "... no other book came anywhere
near comparable influence, &#8230;[it was] a volume which
magically catalyzed the best yearnings of our grandfathers and
fathers."</p>
<p>Where is the Georgist movement today?</p>
<p>World War I broke the momentum of the Progressive movement in the
U.S. and the Liberal movement in England, allowing Georgist enemies
to regroup. And enemies there were, for of course Georgism aims a
dagger at the heart of unearned wealth and privilege. Enemies
ultimately succeeded by a dual strategy. They tarred Georgism with
the brush of Socialism or Communism, evoking images of the terrifying
new regime in Russia. And they redefined economic theory, eliminating
land as a significant category. In the US, the robber barons even
financed the establishment of anti-Georgist economics departments at
several major universities, including Columbia and Chicago, a story
detailed by Mason Gaffney in <a href="Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The
Corruption of Economics</a>. Today an
army of neo-classicists preach dourly that we must sacrifice equity
on the altar of "efficiency." Thus they would stifle the demand for
social justice that runs like a thread through the Bible, the Koran,
and other great religious works.</p>
<p><b>Yet George's ideas are with us still. As historians often note,
the Populist and Progressive movements faded out partly because they
were co-opted by the leading parties. Ideas that we associate today
with "liberal" Democrats -- belief in the fairness of progressive
taxes (especially on "unearned" income), concern for "root causes" of
poverty and unemployment, concern for social and racial justice --
these ideas have strong Georgist roots. Likewise, ideas we associate
today with free-market Republicans and Libertarians -- the productive
power of capitalism, the need for free trade, the need to liberate
labor and capital from burdensome taxation and regulation -- these
ideas have equally strong Georgist roots.</b></p>
<p>There are also today's Georgist success stories, rarely recognized
as such: the Asian "tigers:" Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and
Singapore. Founded on the twin principles of access to land --
implemented by land reform, land taxes and land leasing -- and
universal education and health care, the tigers' booming economies
make them models for developing countries. Mainstream economists may
have forgotten land taxes, but development economists still advocate
them -- circumspectly of course, lest they offend the third world
rulers they hope to influence.</p>
<p>Today, Georgists face both danger and opportunity:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Danger.</b> The great Georgist reforms steadily erode,
undefended by those who do not understand their significance. Property
taxes, once the mainstay of local and state governments, increasingly
give way to local and state sales and income taxes. Generations of
propaganda have convinced even good liberals that property taxes fall
squarely on the poor -- to the mega-million dollar benefit of
corporations like Standard Oil of California, the largest beneficiary
of Proposition 13's 1979 property tax rollback and freeze. The federal
income tax, which once targeted unearned income from land, now devolves
steadily into a payroll tax.</li>
  <li><b>Opportunity</b>. Over the last twenty years, wealth and wages
have grown ever more unequal, while the death of the Communist bogeyman
reveals the ugliness of capitalism without fair laws or equal
opportunity. Neo-classical economists, trundling through a Mars-scape
of dusty statistics and forbidding formulas, can proffer only
unpleasant tradeoffs. In the debate over the newly-passed 1997 income
tax "reforms," Democrats complained that cuts in estate taxes and
capital gains taxes for the rich were "unfair." Republicans argued --
successfully -- that such tax favors are essential to investment and
growth.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Neo-classical economists give us only a
hard choice: we may have
equity, or efficiency, but not both. By contrast, George's program
reconciles equity and efficiency. Think of it! George takes two polar
philosophies, collectivism and individualism, and composes them into
one solution. He cuts the Gordian knot. Like Keynes after him, George
inspires us by saying, "Forget the bitter tradeoffs; we can have it
all!"</p>
