<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">JUDGE SEABURY</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Through four generations of clergymen, Samuel Seabury is a direct descendent
    of the Right Reverend Samuel Seabury, first Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal
    Church in America.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">In 1901 Samuel Seabury was elected Justice of the City Court of New York;
    in 1906 the ballot carried him to the State Supreme Court, and in 1914 he was
    chosen for the Court of Appeals--the highest tribunal of the state. Two years
    later he was the Democratic nominee for Governor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">In 1930 Judge Seabury was summoned, while on vacation in Europe, to head an
    inquiry into corruption in the magistrates' courts of New York City. His relentless
    exposure drove six magistrates from the bench. Later, when the State Legislature
    ordered its own investigation into conditions prevailing in the government
    of the city of New York, Judge Seabury served as chief counsel. One grafter
    after another was exposed and the Mayor himself resigned under fire.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Due directly to the work of Samuel Seabury, the reform administration under
    Fiorello LaGuardia swept in, and a new charter was given to the city.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Samuel Seabury is one of the great. citizens of the country,
    a man of superb record in public service and vigorous Americanism.    This is his estimate and tribute to Heny George.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
  We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
  which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
  men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
  contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
  adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
  did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
  which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
<p>Although men have not as yet adopted specific remedies which he proposed,
  they have, nevertheless, absorbed much of his philosophy, and that fact has,
  of itself, enriched the thought of those throughout the world who believe in
  democracy.<br>
    <br>
  Henry George's teachings involved more than the prescription of specific remedies
  for particular evils. The specific remedies which he proposed were means to
  an end. The end was the philosophy of freedom as applied to human relations.
  I do not say that the majority of the people of the world have given acceptance
  to many of his most important teachings. Indeed, in view of the world tendency
  since his death to aggrandize the powers of the political state and limit and
  subordinate the power of the people, it is self-evident that in this environment
  the principles of Henry George could not have won general acceptance. Had they
  done so, the world would have made greater progress toward the attainment of
  the goal of human freedom and economic contentment which is still the unrealized
  aspiration of humanity.</p>
<p>Moreover, many who have believed in the necessity for basic social changes
  preferred to ignore the simple and fundamental teachings of Henry George, and
  to adopt, instead, the philosophy of Marx and Lenin. It is the wide acceptance
  of the doctrines of these false prophets which has contributed to making the
  economic condition of the masses worse, has reduced their standard of living
  and has made of Europe an armed camp. It is their disciples who are now attempting
  to introduce here the political and economic theories which in other countries
  have culminated in the totalitarian state, together with the host of iniquities
  which are inseparably connected with it.</p>
<p>Henry George never wrote a line which could be tortured into the support of
  the principles of the totalitarian state, or that gave sanction to the theory
  that men in their individual and social activities should be regimented and
  directed by great bureaucracies such as all our modern states, including our
  so-called democracies, have set up.</p>
<p>Henry George believed in the state, but it was a state that was the servant,
  not the master, of the people: a state that was to be kept within bounds, and
  whose powers were strictly limited and to be exercised in subordination to
  the will of the people &#8212; a state, in short, such as is defined in our
  national and state constitutions.</p>
<p>Machiavelli and Hobbes in their writings expressed the foundations for despotism,
  and disclosed the cruelties, subterfuges and deceits by which alone a despotism
  can be achieved.</p>
<p>Marx and Lenin, because of their belief that the rights of the individual
  were fictional rather than real, built upon those principles of Machiavelli
  and Hobbes which constitute the foundation of the modern totalitarian state.
  'The whole idea of the totalitarian state, whether it finds expression in a
  system of fascism, either of the Italian or the German variety, or in the equally
  odious system of a dictatorship of the proletariat, rests upon a disregard
  of fundamental human rights and the substitution of an autocratic will for
  the encouragement of individual initiative among the people. The tragic menace
  implicit in the despotism of the totalitarian state, which makes it an offense
  to God and man, is its claim of absolutism to crush the individuality and destroy
  the conscience of men.<br>
    <br>
  The principles of freedom enunciated by Henry George are utterly inconsistent
  with the Marxian creed which ends in state socialism or in the totalitarian
  state, in principle identical with it. Indeed, the great French economist,
  Charles Gide, in his lecture on the cooperative program, contrasts a voluntary
  cooperative system, which retains individual initiative as the basis of all
  economic activity and preserves the spontaneity and inexhaustible reserves
  of invention and creation, with state socialism, which is proving daily more
  sterile both in economic production and in affording protection to public and
  private freedom.</p>
<p>We must not delude ourselves with the belief that the great battle now going
  on between the dictatorships and the so-called democracies is merely a matter
  of the nominal form of government. It is not. The difference is much more fundamental.
  Opposing and diametrically opposite philosophies confront one another. The
  contest is between the philosophy of dictatorship and the philosophy of freedom.
  Irrespective of the name we give our form of government, or the method by which
  we choose its administrators, the philosophy of freedom cannot be realized
  unless the world recognizes the common rights of men in the resources of nature,
  unless it recognizes the right of every people to trade with other peoples,
  unless it safeguards the individual rights of life, liberty and property and
  unless it insures tolerance of opinion. These principles are the essential
  life-giving attributes of freedom: without them there can be no civilization
  in the sense in which that term is used by a free people.</p>
<p>The modern world is so closely knit together by reason of the new inventions
  which have eliminated distance and made communication easy, that a world divided
  against itself cannot stand.</p>
<p>The issue is vital to the welfare of mankind. The conclusion of the coming
  struggle cannot be forecast with certainty. Often before in the world's history,
  opposing and mutually destructive philosophies of life have clashed. One of
  these ways of life must prevail over the other. If the rule of despotism shall
  triumph by the use of modern armaments &#8212; and if it triumphs it can only
  be by resort to these agencies of destruction, because the rule of reason and
  justice is necessarily outlawed in every despotism &#8212; then the light of
  our civilization may be extinguished and mankind may for a long night relapse
  into barbarism.</p>
<p>But if we shall be true to the philosophy of freedom; if we shall make our
  democracies in fact democratic, so that they shall express and recognize the
  principles of freedom, no dictatorship can prevail over us or destroy our civilization,
  and in this age of marvelous invention, with its capacity to produce wealth
  in abundance, force the people of the world to adopt a lower standard of economic
  social life.</p>
<p>The most serious threat to democracy which exists is that the democracies
  themselves have not as yet achieved social justice for their own people. If
  they would achieve it, they would have nothing to fear from the dictatorship
  states. In this country we have approximately eleven million unemployed and
  are now in the tenth year of an acute economic depression. We certainly cannot
  claim to have achieved social justice. True, we offer many advantages over
  what the despotisms offer, but in any country people will submit to regimentation
  and political and social despotism rather than go without food and shelter.
  In such circumstances, ignorant of the value of the liberty they surrender,
  they will sell their birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>
<p>Instead of addressing ourselves seriously to the task of establishing social
  justice &#8212; the most momentous task which has ever confronted this country
  in all its history &#8212; we have wasted our energies and resources in adopting
  shallow and superficial measures not in harmony with the realities of social
  life and which ignore its natural laws; erecting great bureaucracies which
  have attempted to regiment our people, while the mass of regulations which
  they have prescribed have served only to demoralize industry, prevent its recovery
  and obstruct the cooperation between labor, capital and consumer which the
  interests of all require.</p>
<p>As we look at the complications of our social and economic system, no fair-minded
  student can avoid the conclusion that many of the principles which Henry George
  expressed are applicable to it. The philosophy of Henry George is so far-reaching
  in its implications that hardly any accurate conception of it can be gathered
  from such brief remarks as are appropriate to an occasion like that which brings
  us together today. It is, therefore, possible to refer to only three fundamental
  principles which Henry George enunciated, and which are as vital and important
  in our world of today as they were at the time that he affirmed them. Indeed,
  if we try to envision, in view of our present location this afternoon, &quot;The
  World of Tomorrow,&quot; I have no hesitation in saying that if the world of
  tomorrow is to be a civilized world, and not a world which has relapsed into
  barbarism, it can be so only by applying the principles of freedom which Henry
  George taught. The principles to which I refer are:</p>
<p>First, that men have equal rights in natural resources, and that these rights
  may find recognition in a system which gives effect to the distinction between
  what is justly private property because it has relation to individual initiative
  and is the creation of labor and capital, and what is public property because
  it is either a part of the natural resources of the country, whose value is
  created by the presence of the community, or is founded upon some governmental
  privilege or franchise.</p>
<p>Henry George believed in an order of society in which monopoly should be abolished
  as a means of private profit. The substitution of state monopoly for private
  monopoly will not better the situation. It ignores the fact that even where
  a utility is a natural monopoly which must be operated in the public interests,
  it should be operated as a result of cooperation between the representatives
  of labor, capital. and consumers, and not by the politicians who control
  the political state.<br>
    <br>
  We should never lose sight of the fact that all monopolies are created and
  perpetuated by state laws. If the states wish seriously to abolish monopoly,
  they can do so by withdrawing their privileges; but they cannot grant the privileges
  which make monopoly inevitable and avoid the consequences by invoking anti-trust
  laws against them.</p>
<p>It is strange that the state, which has assumed all sorts of functions which
  it cannot with advantage perform, still persists in neglecting a vital function
  which it should and can perform &#8212; the function of collecting public revenues,
  as far as possible, from those who reap the benefits of natural resources.
  In view of public and social needs, it is remarkable that no effort has been
  made by governments to reduce the tax burdens on labor and capital, which are
  engaged in increasing production, by transferring them to those who restrict
  production by making monopoly privileges special to themselves.</p>
<p>These monopolistic privileges are of course disguised under many different
  forms, but the task of ascertaining what they are, and their true value, is
  a task within the competency of government if it really desires to accomplish
  it.</p>
<p>The second principle to which I wish to refer is Henry George's advocacy of
  freedom of trade among the nations &#8212; not free trade introduced overnight,
  but freedom of trade as an end toward which the nations should move. When he
  wrote his great work on &quot;<a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/trade/pftindex.htm">Protection
  or Free Trade</a>,&quot; he demolished the protectionist argument and in chapter
  after chapter he showed the absurdities to which the protectionist principle
  led if carried to its logical conclusion. But even he, penetrating as his vision
  was, could not foresee that mankind was heading for a world order of economic
  nationalism and isolation, based upon the principle of protection carried to
  its utmost extreme. And yet that it is precisely the doctrine which is now
  currently accepted. If it becomes general, it can serve only to sow the seeds
  of destruction of that measure of civilization which we now have and force
  a lowering of the standard of living throughout the world.</p>
<p>There are two ways by which the people of one nation can acquire the property
  or goods of the people of another nation. These are by war and by trade. There
  are no other methods. The present tendency among civilized people to outlaw
  trade must drive the states which prescribe such outlawry to acquire the property
  and goods of other peoples by war. Early in man's struggle for existence the
  resort to war was the common method adopted. With the advancement of civilization
  men resorted to trade as a practical substitute for war. The masses of men
  wish to trade with one another. The action of the states alone prevents them
  from so doing. In prohibiting trade, the state gives an importance to territorial
  boundaries which would not exist if freedom of trade existed. In accentuating
  the importance of mere boundary disputes, rather than assuring the right of
  peoples to trade with one another, the nations put the emphasis upon the precise
  issue which is, itself, one of the most prolific causes of war.</p>
<p>All the great modern states are turning away from freedom of trade, and indeed,
  from trade itself, and forbidding their people the right to earn their own
  livelihood and to associate freely with one another in industry. In order to
  accomplish this end they are compelled to regiment the lives of their people
  under state bureaucracies and this can be accomplished only by a despotic state.
  If the powers of the modern states are to be augmented by conferring upon them
  the right to run all industry, despotism is inevitable. A dictator may, by
  reducing the standard of living and regimenting the people, run all industry
  within the state over which he rules, but a democracy, which, if it is to be
  true to itself, must preserve individual initiative, can not do so without
  transforming itself into a dictatorship.</p>
<p>The third great principle which Henry George gave his life to promote was
  the necessity for government, especially in democracies, to free its processes
  from the influence of corruption. Indeed, in the great municipal campaign in
  New York City in 1897, Henry George waged a relentless warfare upon the corruption
  in both the Democratic and Republican parties of that day. The people of New
  York flocked to his standard. He had stirred them to their very depths; but
  his physical strength was not as strong as his indomitable spirit, and a few
  days before Election Day of that year, after three wonderful speeches the night
  before calling upon the people of New York City to free themselves and their
  city from the corruption which debased and degraded them, he died. He laid
  down his life in that great campaign &#8212; the corruptionists won that battle,
  but his leadership in this direction generated a spirit which has asserted
  itself many times since then, and Henry George's stirring words in that memorable
  campaign made an impression upon many of the young men of that day who had
  been proud to enlist under his banner.</p>
<p>Since that glorious but tragic battle the spirit and the ideas embodied in
  Henry George's philosophy of freedom have gone marching on. Throughout the
  world he is known and his influence is profoundly felt. The truths which he
  enunciated have not yet been adopted, but they can never be forgotten. Those
  of us who believe in the Democratic ideal believe that they will triumph.</p>
<p>The life which came into the world in Philadelphia 100 years ago today, in <a href="http://www.geocities.com/henrygeorgeschool/">a
    small house</a> not far from the place where the Declaration of American
    Independence was signed, rendered a great service to humanity &#8212; a service
    which is destined to become greater and more far-reaching as time goes on.</p>

<p>An earlier speech by Judge Seabury, at a commemmoration of the 60th anniversary
  of Henry George's birth, was misreported in the <em>New York Times</em> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Samuel Seabury, President of the club, presided. He made a short speech, in
      which he said that Henry George, &quot;the world's greatest democrat,&quot; as he called
      him, had carried to a logical conclusion the theories of Thomas Jefferson,
      and that private property is a greater crime than slavery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next day, his 
      letter
      to the
      editor made the distinction clear:</p>
<p><em>To the Editor of The New York Times:</em></p>
<p><em>In your paper of Sept. 4, 1899, in reporting the meeting held in Grand
    Central Palace, on Sunday, to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the birth
    of Henry George, you state that in my address, as Chairman of the meeting,
    I said that &quot;private property is a greater crime than slavery.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Permit me to say in your columns that I did not make any such statement.
    I compared the institution of private property in land with the institution
    of chattel slavery, and stated that the crime of private property in land
    was greater than chattel slavery. This I believe to be true. Land is the
    gift of the Creator to all mankind in common, and no one individual has the
    right to make special to himself that which belongs to all, unless he shall
    pay to all the value of this special privilege.</em></p>
<p><em>Only those things which are produced by labor -- not those things which
    are the gift of the Creator to all -- are justly subject to private property.
    Production give the true right of property, and I believe, with Henry George,
    that &quot;this right of property, originating in the right of the individual
    to himself, is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches
    to things produced by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Samuel Seabury<br>
  New York, Sept. 5, 1899.</em></p>
