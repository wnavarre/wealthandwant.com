<p align="center">H. William Batt, Ph.D.<br>
  April, 2005</p>
<p>  <strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Real tax reform could do away with those taxes that are resented by the large
  proportion of our population. We could replace all taxes on wages and on interest
  by instead taxing economic rent. Rent is windfall income; it is income that
  arises not from the efforts of any person or corporation; it comes about as
  a surplus gain from common social enterprise. There is ample moral warrant
  for society to lay claim to that which it has created, as well as to that which
  no individual or party has earned. Analysis increasingly makes clear that economic
  rent in all its forms is far larger than official government figures indicate;
  in fact it is likely sufficient to supplant all current taxes on labor and
  capital (wages and interest) which are acknowledged to have so many negative
  effects. Recovering economic rent in all its manifestations by taxing its various
  bases actually can foster economic performance and yield other benefits that
  make it the natural source of revenue for governments. Such a tax is essentially
  painless.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Under current tax regimes, some people get hit with onerous bills while others
  get windfall gains.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[1]</em></strong></font> If taxes only on windfalls were collected, we could
  eliminate those burdens that fall unfairly upon people who have rightfully
  earned their income and wealth, and the total would likely remain revenue neutral.
  This is my thesis here, one which should compel the attention of those who
  would redesign our tax system.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">1. A windfall, usually defined, is &quot;an unexpected financial
      gain, or a stroke of luck.&quot; But, as one exhaustive study makes clear,
      it is typically the consequence of some public policy decision. Donald Hagman &amp; Dean
      Misczynski, Windfalls for Wipeouts: Land Value Capture and Compensation,
      (Chicago: APA Planners Press, 1978). This is illustrated in one widely read
      story in William L. Riordan's Plunkitt of Tammany Hall, (New York: Dutton,
      1905): &quot;Honest Graft and Dishonest Graft.&quot;</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">There's an honest graft, and I'm an example of how it works.
          I might sum up the whole thing by sayin': &quot;I seen my opportunities
          and I took 'em.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Just let me explain by examples. My party's in power in
          the city, and it's goin' to undertake a lot of public improvements. Well,
          I'm tipped off, say, that they're going to lay out a new park at a certain
          place.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">I see my opportunity and I take it. I go to that place and
          I buy up all the land I can in the neighborhood. Then the board of this
          or that makes its plan public, and there's a rush to get my land, which
          nobody cared particular for before.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Ain't it perfectly honest to charge a good price and make
          a profit on my investment and foresight? Of course, it is. Well, that's
          honest graft.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It is astounding how shameful our tax system has become; one might guess that
  its designers &#8212; legislatures at all levels of government &#8212; deliberately
  conceived it just so that they might score cheap points by taking aim at it.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[2]</em></strong></font> But
  perhaps this time some chosen leader, some deliberative body, or some civic
  constituency
  will rise to the challenge of making clear some basic starting points rather
  than pandering to prejudice and low motives. Perhaps. It leads me to write
  this.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">2. Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter called the American
        tax system, &quot;a disgrace to the human race.&quot; A recent estimate is
        that one-third to half of all Americans cheat in some way on their federal
        tax returns, and far more feel it would be all right to do so if they could
        get away with it. Donald L. Bartlett &amp; James B. Steele, The Great American
        Tax Dodge (Boston: Little, Brown, Inc., 2000).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>    <strong>Tax Principles</strong></p>
<p>The starting points should be the lessons that have been learned over the
  course of the past three hundred and more years about what is a good tax. Most
  basic textbooks in public finance enumerate them in very clear form, and they
  constitute benchmarks against which to measure the soundness of any particular
  tax. They are listed as few as three or as many as eight such principles but
  little disagreement exists as to their substance, regardless of ideology or
  government. Most commonly enumerated are neutrality, efficiency, equity, administrability,
  simplicity, stability, sufficiency.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> Tax theorists typically measure revenue
  structures according to any or all of these criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tax neutrality</strong> refers to the influence (or absence of
    such) that any particular design has on economic behavior. Typically taxes
    are perceived as a damp on
    economic activity &#8212; taxing income reduces the incentive to work, taxing
    sales discourages retail transactions, and taxing savings reduces the propensity
    to save. The more a tax is perceived to be neutral the less the identifiable
    distortions it imposes on the economy. The common assumption of most tax
    theorists
    is that all taxes impose distortions; it's simply a matter of which ones
    are least burdensome to economic health. A tax which imposes no distortions
    is
    ideally best.</li>
  <li><strong>Tax efficiency</strong> is much like tax neutrality, and is the
    measure of how much shifting of behavior it imposes, resulting in what is
    called &quot;excess burden,&quot; or &quot;deadweight
    loss&quot; on the economy. Tax economists usually hold that the best taxes
    are those that are shifted little if at all. Because the elasticities (a
    technical word for the slope of supply and demand curves) of each are very
    different,
    a tax on land values and a tax on improvement values have very contrastive
    effects on economic choices. Using a tax base that has little or zero elasticity
    is the best way of assuring that taxes are not shifted. Zero elasticity is
    another way of saying fixed supply.</li>
  <li>The principle of <strong>equity</strong> is central to any discussion of
    tax design. Tax design requires concern with both what is fair and the extent
    to which it must sometimes
    be compromised to satisfy the other principal criteria. Fairness can be evaluated
    according to what is termed &quot;horizontal equity&quot; -- the extent to
    which those in similar circumstances will pay similar tax burdens, and &quot;vertical
    equity&quot; -- how well those in different classes bear different burdens
    in the tax structure. It is this latter perspective that leads to the use of
    terms like &quot;proportional,&quot; &quot;progressive,&quot; and &quot;regressive&quot; in
    referring to tax structures. A tax is progressive with respect to income
    if the ratio of tax revenue to income rises when moving up the income scale,
    proportional
    if the ratio is constant, and regressive if the ratio declines. There is
    an ancillary question of whether taxing to reach greater equity should employ
    measures of income or of wealth, difficult as this is to measure. Such questions
    of equity are a matter particularly central when discussing the property
    tax.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrability</strong> refers to the ease with which a tax can
    be administered and collected. Taxes which distort the economy are inefficient
    but so are taxes
      that cost lots to administer. This is measured not only in the direct costs
      of tax avoidance and accounting expenses, but in the level of evasion and
    cheating, and by the cost of government auditing and policing. When the taxpaying
    public
      perceives that a tax is easily evaded, cumbersome, and unfair, it loses
    its legitimacy and calls government itself into question.</li>
  <li>This is why the principle of <strong>simplicity</strong> is important:
    the more complex the tax design, the more lawyers and accountants will find
    loopholes, encourage
      the appearance of unfairness, and drive up the cost of its administration.
      People know that with simple taxes other parties are also paying their
    fair share, and all this enhances the legitimacy and therefore the compliance
    of
      the tax system.</li>
  <li><strong>Stability</strong> refers to the ability of a tax to produce revenue
    in the face of changing economic circumstances. Income and sales taxes, for
    example, vary
      greatly according to phases in the economic cycle; the property tax, in
    contrast, is highly stable regardless of the state of the economy. This is
    one reason
      why school administrators have typically been supportive of using the property
      tax base rather than some other tax to support school services.</li>
  <li>The <strong>certainty</strong> of a tax's collection ensures that the number
    and types of tax changes be kept to a minimum. Frequent changes in tax rates
    and bases interfere
      with business decisions and the ability to make long-term financial plans.
      This concept reinforces the need for stability because an unstable revenue
      system is more likely to require continual adjustments.</li>
  <li> In assessing the value of a tax it is also important, of course, to understand
  its potential to bring in revenue for the purposes of government, usually deemed
  revenue <strong>sufficiency</strong>. Income, sales and property taxes, along with corporation
  taxes to a lesser extent, have come to be regarded as the workhorses of the
  American revenue structure. But, as anti-tax politicians are quick to note,
  the higher these taxes are, the more they impose a drag on the economy. This
  is why one should ponder whether to consider raising taxes which have demonstrable
  distorting effects.
  <p><font size="-1">3. For a discussion of what students of tax policy regard
      as the principles which should guide their design, see, for example, George
      Break, &quot;Taxation,&quot; Encarta Encyclopedia by Microsoft, 1993; &quot;Principles
      of Taxation, in Light of Modern Developments,&quot; Washington: Federal Tax
      Policy Memo, The Tax Foundation; &quot;Principles of a High Quality Revenue
      System,&quot; Tax Notes, March 21, 1988; David G. Davies, United States Taxes
      and Tax Policy, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986), pp. 17-19;
      and David Brunori, State Tax Policy: A Political Perspective. Washington:
      Urban Institute Press, 2001, Ch. 2. State studies cited above also typically
      list any or all of these criteria. I have seen accountability, balance, certainty,
      competitiveness, and complementary included as well.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>    <strong>The Tax Base</strong></p>
<p>The next concern should be upon what base to impose a tax &#8212; not about
  taxing whom but taxing what. There are only three possibilities, as all revenue
  streams
  necessarily come from one of three factors of economic production &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 1)
      upon resources found raw in nature (what was classically called land), <br>2)
      upon our
        labor, or <br>
  3) upon things created by human hands or minds (capital). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No
      other source exists; every possible tax must be on one or some combination
      of these
          parts. Each of these factors has its price: the price of land is counted
        in economic rent; the price of labor is in wages, and the price of capital
        (its
    liquid form) is in interest.</p>
<p>Any tax on capital has its downside effects, so that taxing savings causes
  people to save less, taxing consumption causes people to buy less, and taxing
  buildings causes people to build less. The result is that economists as well
  as businessmen usually frown upon taxing capital. Another alternative is to
  tax labor, but it is even more widely understood that taxing labor normally
  discourages people from working as much as they would in the absence of a tax.
  From this comes sentiment against taxing labor, even though for want of any
  alternative, people have today commonly come to accept it as a necessity. But
  electing to tax labor, just as for taxing capital, forecloses a discussion
  of the virtues of taxing land &#8212; not necessarily land as earth, but rather
  land as location. Yet land rent is the most attractive tax base of all, as
  rent
  is not earned; it is windfall income, entirely the result of being well situated
  in any market of scarce natural resources and where community demand (rather
  than one's own efforts) leads to an appreciation of that land's price. To be
  sure many people have learned to position themselves in situations where a
  land's market value is likely to rise &#8212; indeed these people come to think
  of themselves as astute investors. But the fact is that that market gain is
  not
  of their own doing at all; it is the result of common enterprise creating a
  surplus that comes to settle on land sites. An investment in land, in any form
  it might take, is speculation in greater or lesser degree.</p>
<p>Land in all its forms is a tax base that also conforms well to all the classic
  principles of sound tax theory as enumerated above. Land is classically taken
  to mean not just surfaces of the earth but places in time, in space, in any
  medium whether it be solid, liquid or gas, and even as a form of light, in
  the electromagnetic spectrum, and in life forms. One needs to return to 19th
  century classical economic definitions of the factors of production to appreciate
  the separate significance of land as it was understood in its manifold forms.
  One should ask how it is that land, so important to 19th century classical
  economic theory, has been given so little attention today in neoclassical economics.
  This is a story only now recovered from the dusty archives of academic economic
  history. Once understood and appreciated, it may be one of the greatest, if
  very silent, political revolutions of world history.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">4. For an extensive discussion of this shift in direction
        from the three-factor economics of land, labor and capital, to the more recent
        framing of economics largely in terms of labor and capital, see Mason Gaffney,
        <a href="Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">The Corruption of Economics</a> (London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 1995). Some of its
        implications are explored in H. William Batt, &quot;<a href="Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">How
        the Railroads Got Us on the Wrong Economic Track</a>,&quot; The Torch, Winter,

</blockquote>
<p>The conventional wisdom of most contemporary tax designers, despite lip service
  to the enumerated principles above, is that the best tax regime relies essentially
  upon three tax bases &#8212; property, sales, and income &#8212; perhaps ideally
  in equal weight.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> But it is very questionable why, given the measurable and demonstrable
  virtues of taxes upon land bases, one would resort to any other revenue stream.
  When it becomes clear that taxes imposed upon other factors of production effectively
  work their way through the economy to settle ultimately upon land in any case,
  one sees that it simply hamstrings the economy, distorts its natural equilibrium,
  and fosters resentment and challenges to political legitimacy every step of
  the way.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p>    <strong>The Possibility of Land (Rent) Taxation</strong></p>
<p>The key to understanding how taxing various forms of land conform to sound
  tax theory comes with an appreciation of the importance of economic rent. Largely
  discarded in 20th century economic analysis, rent is the price for the use
  of land. Just as the price of labor is paid in wages and the price of capital
  is paid in interest, land rent is the unearned increment that attaches to land
  in the form of a surplus when its price is not paid by its users. All taxes,
  ultimately, come out of rent; however, by collecting revenue from other sources,
  the rent is left to settle in ever increasing encrustations on land sites,
  i.e., capitalized, ultimately raising their market price. In so doing, these
  land prices are distorted so that their optimal use is not secured.</p>
<p>Examples of such distortion are not difficult to identify. Consider, first
  of all, the use of locations in our urban environments, many of which are underused
  while prospective entrepreneurs are driven to second-best locations because
  titleholders opt to let the rent accrete and passively raise their market price.
  Land speculation is rife most of all in instances where there is a great disparity
  between the tax rate on these sites and the rate of rent appreciation. When
  the holding costs of ownership are nominal, there is no incentive for improving
  them or selling to others who will, and urban environments suffer as a result.
  Another example is rent that collects to the electromagnetic spectrum, making
  it attractive for owners of electronic media, communications networks and so
  on, to rely on returns to their investments even when the resource itself is
  sparsely used. So also with the time slots for take-offs and landings at airports.
  These opportunities are respected as private property, even while they gain
  in market value in response to the general traffic volume of the facility.
  This occurs regardless whether the particular airlines use their slots or not.
  London Mayor Ken Livingstone has proposed to tax the rent from Heathrow and
  Gatwick both for their revenue advantage and to assure their more optimal use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7]</em></strong></font>  One could go on, pointing to any number of instances where economic rent is
  available to be had for the support of public services in lieu of conventional
  taxes which we recognize as destructive in their effects.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8]</em></strong></font> It is not surprising
  that when pressed even conventional (neoclassical) economists are often willing
  to concede that the best possible tax of all is one placed on land rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font></p>

          philosophies run the gamut from Right to Left: </font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1"><strong>Milton <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Friedman</a></strong>: &quot;I share your view
            that taxes would be best placed on the land, and not on improvements.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1"><strong>Paul Samuelson</strong>: &quot;Pure land rent is
            in the nature of a 'surplus', which can be taxed heavily without distorting
            production incentives or efficiency.&quot; A site value tax can be called &quot;the
            useful tax on measured land surplus.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1"><strong>Franco Modigilani</strong>: &quot;It is important
            that the rent of land be retained as a source of government revenue. Some
            persons who could make excellent use of land would be unable to raise money
            for the purchase price. Collecting rent annually provides access to land
            for persons with limited access to credit.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1"><strong>Robert Solow</strong>: &quot;Users of land should
            not be allowed to acquire rights of indefinite duration for single payments.
            For efficiency, for adequate revenue and for justice, every user of land
            should be required to make an annual payment to the local government equal
            to the current rental value of the land that he or she prevents others
            from using.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1"><strong>William Vickrey</strong>, &quot;It guarantees that
            no one dispossesses fellow citizens by obtaining a disproportionate share
            of what nature provides for humanity.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1"><strong>James Tobin</strong>: &quot;I think in principle
            it's a good idea to tax unimproved land, and particularly capital gains
            (windfalls) on it. Theory says we should try to tax items with zero or
            low elasticity, and those include sites.&quot;</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1"><strong>James Buchanan</strong>: &quot;The landowner who
            withdraws land from productive use to a purely private use should be required
            to pay higher, not lower, taxes.&quot;</font></li>
  </ul>

<p>Although one can infer innumerable instances where economic rent inheres in
  land factors, the econometric data maintained by public agencies has not been
  compiled in a way that makes it easily identifiable. In fact the US Census
  of Housing ceased to keep records on the assessed value of land in 1987, reasoning
  that the quality was so poor that it was more misleading than it was helpful.
  The actual account of the &quot;rental income of persons&quot; in the US government
  National Income and Product Accounts is estimated at less than 2%,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[10]</em></strong></font> yet
  this figure is widely acknowledged to be so unrealistic an estimate that it
  is ludicrous by itself. What studies have been performed to calculate economic
  rent suggest that the amount for real property alone is in the neighborhood
  of 30 percent of a nation's GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font> This realm of research begs for attention,
  but it will not likely be more than approximate as long as government statistics
  are so lacking and unreliable.</p>

<p>The growing availability of data, and of computer power, increasingly offers
  the promise that researchers will be able to &quot;back into&quot; some estimates,
  even if they are suggestive more than they are conclusive. With such inviting
  questions, there may well arise the prospect of better data collection, and
  which will allow for even better analysis.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that a transition to a tax on land rent would not
  be not difficult. In lieu of the conventional real property tax, it is already
  widely used,<font size="-1"><strong><em>[12]</em></strong></font> and many localities are presently phasing in such a shift,
  downtaxing improvements and uptaxing land.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font> As for taxes at other levels
  of government, it is already conceded, for example, that &quot;The Public Owns
  the Airwaves,&quot; a statement that is belied by the fact that the media and
  communications industry treats its rights to the use of frequency licenses
  as private property and whose market value is typically reflected when such
  corporations are sold.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> One should also note as another example the case
  of the Alaska Permanent Fund, which provides a reliable citizen's dividend

<p>    <strong>A New Tax Ethic</strong></p>
<p>Beyond the greater conformity to sound tax principles as noted earlier, the
  taxation of economic rent that accretes as a surplus upon land can offer two
  additional advantages. The first of these is the removal of the distortions
  wrought upon urban land use configurations and the negative environmental impacts
  which are presently apparent. The greatest of these effects is in the form
  of suburban sprawl, a phenomenon viewed with increasing alarm not only by its
  degradation of life quality but in the increased expenditures of time and resources
  (especially energy). Land use patterns, as intractable as they tend to be,
  will have to modify simply on account of the evolving limitations of future
  life. There are likely to be changes also in the way by which air, water, and
  other public goods are exploited. Treatment of these resources as &quot;free
  goods&quot; or as captive property of private parties will end if it is realized
  how generous the rental flow to public treasuries can be.</p>
<p>The second benefit to be obtained by the recovery of socially created economic
  rent is the restoration of a moral dimension to taxation and to economics generally.
  Taxation policy today is faced with a loss of legitimacy, and it is not sufficient
  to rely on totems that have sustained its design until now. A groundswell of
  resentment has occurred in all realms of tax policy &#8212; for income taxes,
  for sales taxes, and for real property taxes. All levels of American government
  are suffering on account of our impoverished fiscal design. Stalemate has reached
  such proportions that nothing is being accomplished. Infrastructure is deteriorating;
  educational quality is perceived to be declining, environmental ambience is
  threatened, and public safety services are curtailed.</p>
<p>To be sure, by replacing taxes on labor and capital with taxes on land rent,
  people will enjoy greater returns for their enterprise and will be able to
  keep what they have earned. But people will also cease, at least those few
  who have been so lucky, to be able to rely on windfall unearned gains that
  they have in many cases come to regard as their entitlements. The greatest
  forfeiture of such windfall gains will be homeowners who have come to see their
  title to a home as an investment, and not a place to live. But whereas some
  residential locations have seen enormous increases in market prices &#8212; as
  much as 20 percent yearly on occasion &#8212; others have enjoyed no such fortune.
  People
  may come to understand that houses depreciate just like cars, refrigerators
  and computers. They may also see that it is only land value that increases,
  and realize that any gain which their land has is due to the general vitality
  of their community and region. It may help them to realize that they are linked
  to and dependent upon the society as a whole, and that their fortune is not
  in this dimension of their own making.</p>
<p>Well over a century ago, John Stuart Mill recognized that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> landlords grow richer in their sleep without working, risking or economizing.
    The increase in the value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of an
    entire community, should belong to the community and not to the individual
    who might hold title.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17] </em></strong></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">17. John Stuart Mill, Principles of Political Economy, bk.
          5, chap. 2, sec. 5.</font></p>

<p>A more appropriate ethic for the 21st century is &quot;Pay for what you take,
  not for what you make.&quot; &quot;Tax bads, not goods,&quot; or &quot;Tax
  waste, not work,&quot; is another way. At the heart of this approach is a very
  profound message:<em><strong> the earth is the common heritage of humanity; it
  belongs to everyone.</strong></em> That which grows out of our own personal efforts and ingenuity
  is ours to keep, and no part of it should be subject to taxation. Taxes on
  income, sales, savings, structures, and things that come from the sweat of
  our brow can be replaced by taxes on land rent &#8212; which, when all forms
  of it are included, is a revenue source that can fully pay for the full services
  of government and is nonetheless essentially burdenless to taxpayers. John
  Houseman, an actor perhaps most widely known as Professor Kingsfield in the
  film and long-running television series, The Paper Chase, later became the
  pitchman for Smith Barney. In that advertisement, his
  tag line was &quot;They make  money the old-fashioned way &#8212; they
  earn it&quot; That
  we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts of others seems a
  simple
  enough moral tenet.</p>
