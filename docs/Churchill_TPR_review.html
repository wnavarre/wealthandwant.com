<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; What would have happened had
Churchill's Liberals succeeded <br>
in
their original plan for reform?<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ANDREW MacLAREN:</span> Born in
Glasgow in 1883, Andrew MacLaren was active in
the Scottish Liberal Party and was working with the United Committee
for the Taxation of Land Values in London when Churchill sent for
copies of Henry George's works at the time of the great battle over the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">People's Budget</span>." He was in
1970 one of the few alive who could speak
from personal and intimate knowledge of the events and personalities of
that time. As Labour Member for the Burslem Division of Stoke-on-Trent,
MacLaren was a fervent advocate of Land Values Taxation and Free Trade
and -- to the consternation of many socialist colleagues -- fiercely
opposing the Welfare State and nationalisation of industry as an
alternative to dealing with the basic causes of poverty and
injustice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">EDITOR'S
NOTE: In 1970, Jonathan Cape published a new edition of
Churchill's rare work, </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The People's
Rights</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> (Woods A16). We have
recently come across a copy
containing </span><span

publishers pamphlet</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> we had
never seen before,
the contents of which we publish herewith. The author owned a first
edition he had bought new in 1910, possibly the copy Cape used for the
offprint. Mr. MacLaren (see biographic note) was Labour MP for Burslem
during 1922-45. His argument is akin to that of Malcolm Hill in </span><a

<br>
============<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The republication of any Churchill work after sixty
years is an event commanding widespread public interest. Such attention
is owed the rich desert of <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The People's Rights</span>,
last published at the
culmination of the election campaign of 1909/10, when the speeches from
which Churchill compiled the book were delivered.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many a reader will find himself astonished that so
vivid a portrayal of one of the great men of our time should have lain
so long out of print. Yet modern readers will miss much of the value of
the book if it is read only for the brilliant and sometimes surprising
insight into this vital stage of Churchill's political development.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the principles and aspirations set out here are
not those of the individual, but the life force of the great movement
that reached its zenith in the Liberal Governments of Sir Henry
Campbell Bannerman and Herbert Asquith that followed the landslide
Liberal victory of 1906. If one dares to summarise the purpose and
vision of Liberal leaders of that time, it was to bring in a society in
which the poverty and social injustice of the previous century would be
eradicated without diminishing the liberty and independence of the
individual. The incentive would remain to develop his abilities to the
full for the good of himself and of the community.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In seeking and proclaiming the steps which were to
be taken, Churchill and the other leaders of the radical wing of the
Liberal Party encountered fierce opposition from powerful vested
interests, even within their own party, and in particular from the
House of Lords. The struggle with the Lords, following their rejection
of the so-called "People's Budget" in 1909, led of course to the
introduction of the Parliament Act.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Churchill himself had crossed the floor of the House
in 1904 on the Free Trade issue and his passionate advocacy of Free
Trade found brilliant expression in the 1909 speeches. It was not long
however before he became the equally fervent and conscientious exponent
of other great Liberal causes, many of which are now little remembered.
Apart from Free Trade, the great economic and social issues were
taxation and the alleviation of poverty. The Liberals were concerned to
remove the basic cause of the problem -- not just to mitigate its
undesirable effects.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the American economist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George</span> who, towards the end of
the 19th century, had examined the paradox of the age in his <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span>.</a>His principles had a major impact, first upon the radicals of Scotland
and Ireland, including Campbell Bannerman himself; and later upon the
policy of the Liberal Party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George
propounded that whilst people have the right to possess what they
produce, or receive in exchange for their work, there is no such right
to private ownership of the elements upon which all depend -- air,
water, sunshine and land. Indeed, George held the right of access to
these basic elements as strong and equal as the right to life itself,
and that if private ownership of basic elements is permitted,
suppression and exploitation of one class by another is inevitable. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The consequent injustice must
become more acute as the community develops.</span></span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it became a major point of Liberal policy to
shift taxation from production, and to raise taxation upon the value of
land, on the basis that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this value, as
witnessed by the tremendously high prices even then demanded for
commercial land, is created not by any individual but by the existence
and work of the whole community.</span> A natural source thus arises
from which the community may meet its growing needs without
discouraging production or inhibiting the growth of earnings.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The justice and
practicality of this proposition can rarely if ever have enjoyed a more
brilliant advocate than Winston Churchill, and today's reader is left
to wonder how different might be the present state of Britain had the
forces of social change pursued these principles to their enactment. </span>As
it was, the great power and intellectual prowess of the Liberal
Movement, which had commanded worldwide admiration for the breadth and
nobility of its vision, was soon to be dissipated by war, internal
feuding and the fear of Bolshevism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Under the cruel
heel of war and unemployment, Britons came to value security more and
independence less. The emphasis in social advance shifted to the
massive provision of public benefits, and the increasing intervention
of the State in almost every area of human activity.</span> The two
World Wars and the great depression between them severed, to a great
extent, the line of liberal thought that had developed over the
previous century.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Churchill himself, one can only feel that he was
fated to be the great war leader. Certainly, opposition to communism
and later to the rise of European tyrannies dominated the remainder of
his political life. It is perhaps ironic that a reason so often given
for his dismissal in 1945 is that he was not capable of dealing with
social problems, and thus was unfit to be a peacetime leader.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The
People's Rights</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> tells
a very different story and comes now not as a document of historic
interest but as a challenge to politicians, indeed to the entire
electorate, to consider again the causes of poverty and the basic
issues of social and economic justice.</span> Perhaps current
disillusionment with politics springs from a sense that if justice in
the community can only be achieved at the expense of individual
liberty, the price -- especially in terms of ever-increasing taxation
and bureaucracy -- is too high to pay.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a proposition that justice in the community and
the freedom of the individual are complementary and that taxes may be
raised without undermining either, The People's Rights comes as a major
contribution to current political and economic thought. Indeed it
deserves a place in the annals of Man's struggle for freedom and
yearning for a society in which the genius of every person would be
nurtured and the liberty of every person respected.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Winston Churchill<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By John P. Nixon, Jr.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Published in <span style="font-style: italic;">Finest
Hour</span> 56, Summer 1987<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Churchill as Classical Liberal</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Churchill's pre-World War I books tend to be
overlooked by casual students of The Great Man. which is unfortunate as
they are well written and present a great variety for the reader: four
war histories, a novel, a biography, a travelogue, three speech
compilations, and a political campaign statement, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The People's Rights.</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third and longest of the speech compilations,
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Liberalism and The
Social Problem</span>, was published on 26 November 1909.
Less than a week later, Prime Minister Asquith dissolved Parliament
following rejection of the Liberal Government's budget by the
Conservative-dominated House of Lords. Churchill, a cabinet member, as
President of the Board of Trade, immediately hit the campaign trail
with a series of stirring speeches, given during the period 3-11
December 1909.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">1. See WSC - HIS COMPLETE
SPEECHES, VOL 2: edited by
Robert Rhodes James, Chelsea House, 1974. The speeches are identified
by dates: Dec. 3.4 (3 speeches), 6,7 (2 speeches), 8.9, and 11. Many
paragraphs are taken verbatim from the speeches and the book.</font></small></div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During or shortly after this brief span, the
decision was made by Hodder &amp; Stoughton to publish a volume by
Churchill as soon as possible "as a guide for some and as an armoury
for others in the general election campaign." Originally titled <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The
People's Rights Defended</span>, the book was eventually published in
January
1910 (Churchill's preface is dated 29 December 1909) as <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The People's
Rights</span>. A companion volume written by David Lloyd George, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The People's
Budget</span>. was published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton somewhat
earlier, as
the advertisements in the first and only edition (until 1970) of
Churchill's work states "Third Large Edition" for Lloyd George's book.
Several other related volumes were published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton
during this period.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small><small>
<br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">2. A pamphlet written
      by WSC
titled: "What a 10% Tax
on Imports Really Means" was advertised by Hodde' &amp; Stoughton on
the inside cover of The People's Rights but has apparently not survived
(If actually published at all)</font></small></div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The
People's Rights</span> is a distillation of Churchill's speeches during
the nine-day period. It follows a textbook or outline form: six
chapters, each broken down into short paragraphs, headlined in bold
face by a statement or question. This format is quite unlike his other
writings, but is most effective in emphasizing his points. Although he
most likely had this in mind, this format was probably used because of
the alacrity required to complete the book and get it to the printer. A
letter to Churchill by the chairman of H&amp;S written 16 December
indicates the printers had already received the text and had suggested
deletions of repeated matter! Churchill was obviously waiving his usual
custom of meticulously proofreading and rewriting where necessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book opens with a rather lengthy criticism of
the House of Lords. and continues with a plea for a balanced budget
(back when such an idea was fashionable). The role of Free Trade in the
scheme of things is examined. along with a case for graduated income
taxes, luxury taxes, and surtaxes on unearned income. Churchill then
advocates the need for improving the plight of the working classes. He
shows a paternalistic but genuine concern here, and proposes along with
the taxes mentioned above "a complete ladder...of various insurance
schemes... along which the whole body of people may move with a certain
measure of security and safety against hazards and misfortunes."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all his liberal beliefs, however, Churchill is
quite clear on maintaining control under the existing parliamentary
system, other than decreasing the influence of the House of Lords.
Socialism is mentioned only once, and abruptly dismissed. Trade unions
and the labour movement are not mentioned at all -- clearly he felt
that
a government-operated system of "labour exchanges" along with the
liberal programs being advocated would adequately improve the lot of
the masses without relinquishing control of the government.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of the political campaign was a narrow
victory for the Liberals. The budget was issued by the House of Commons
in April 1910 and assented to by the House of Lords. A watered down
Parliament Bill, designed to reduce the power of the House of Lords,
was not enacted for another year. The National Insurance Act was
finally passed in December 1911 but by that time Churchill was
preoccupied with other matters - he had passed from President of the
Board of Trade to Home Secretary to first Lord of the Admiralty. The
liberal bills were passed primarily through the efforts of Lloyd
George. but despite these victories the seeds of discontent had been
sown. The long descent of the Liberal party coupled with the rise of
Labour had begun.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The
People's Rights</span> remains as evidence of
Churchill's contribution in this great turning point in Britain's
history. Original copies of the 1910 edition are scarce, expensive,
and very fragile as all but a handful of the surviving copies exist in
lightweight wrappers and pulp paper. The original printing was in
unknown quantities, certainly rather small. The next editions were not
published until 1970 (by Cape and Taplinger), and are recommended they
avoid the above difficulties, and contain an excellent contemporary
introduction by Cameron Hazlehurst. Unfortunately this edition is also
out of print but copies can be obtained from Churchillbooks and other
fine dealers on occasion.<br>
