<p align="center"><strong>I</strong></p>
<p>THE riddle first challenged him when he was a boy of eighteen. He had a job
    then in a printing house in Philadelphia, where he was born. As the youngest
    typesetter in the house he liked to goad the older men into debates. He used
    to stand at the case and raise all sorts of questions in politics, religion,
    travel &#8212; culled from his reading the night before.</p>
<p>They were talking of hard times one day, and an elderly printer remarked that
  wages were much higher in the United States than anywhere in Europe. &quot;That's
  because the United States is young,&quot; he explained. &quot;When a land gets
  old, like Europe, people find it hard to make a living there. Wages sink so
  low. Look at us in America: Wages are higher in California than in New York.
  That's because California is younger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why?&quot; asked Henry George. &quot;Why should the age of a country
  affect the pay envelope? Don't the people do the same amount of work whatever
  the age of their country?&quot;</p>
<p>The elderly printer did not know.</p>
<p>&quot;The older the country, the richer,&quot; persisted the young man. &quot;I
  should think its wages would be higher.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But they aren't.&quot;</p>
<p>And that was the riddle that lodged in Henry George's mind.</p>
<p>It came up again for an answer shortly after when he sat on the deck of a
  schooner in the Pacific Ocean, bound for the Fraser River in British Columbia.
  He had worked his passage out to California, in search of the higher wages
  of the new land. San Francisco was then a city of shanties stuck to sides of
  a sheaf of hills, its streets restless with, fortune hunters. There was gold
  in the hills. But when Henry George arrived in 1858, the best &quot;claims&quot; had
  already been located, and the look in the eyes of the fortune hunters grew
  day by day hungrier. He himself had taken odd jobs at his trade of printing,
  meanwhile sharing the golden dreams of his neighbors. Suddenly the news broke
  out of the discovery of placer mines on the banks of the Fraser River. The
  land was still untenanted and waiting to be staked out. At once the docks of
  San Francisco were crowded with emigrants, Henry George among them.</p>
<p>On the deck of the schooner, which took each man to his own nugget, the miners
  exchanged stories of lucky strikes, of how this or that prospector had dug
  and washed dirt for months without scraping together enough &quot;dust&quot; to
  buy a fried egg, and how one day &#8212; and, well, how he was back home now with
  the world in his pocket. Every cheek flushed. They spoke of California, how
  it had lured people from every corner of the world, even China.</p>
<p>&quot;There's the trouble,&quot; said one of the miners. &quot;The Chinese
  should be kept out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They don't do us any harm,&quot; objected Henry George. &quot;They work
  the cheap diggings. We don't care to work them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They do no harm now,&quot; admitted the miner. &quot;But wages will
  not always be as high as they are to-day in California. As the country grows,
  wages will come down, and some day we shall be glad to get those diggings that
  the Chinamen are now working.&quot;</p>
<p>Again the ominous riddle!</p>
<p>Later he encountered it on another turn in the road of Western progress. Plans
  were in the air to lay down a railroad overland between St. Joseph, Missouri,
  and Sacramento, linking the Far West to the East. In the streets of San Francisco
  men spoke of the coming of the railroad as the priests in the mission spoke
  of the millennium. The railroad would bring prosperity to the West.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet what good will it bring men like me, hired hands?&quot; wondered
  Henry George.</p>
<p>He had had no luck in the gold hunt, had come back dead broke to his old job
  of setting type. He saw no hope in further prospecting. All the good diggings
  had been staked out, every river bed and bank worked over, and only the barren
  ones left. The new prospectors turned to the dry diggings in ravines, on hillsides.
  They bored wells, sank shafts into the earth, shot columns of water against
  the hillside, and were lucky if they washed out enough &quot;pay dirt&quot; for
  a day's wages. Rumor whispered of the good pay dirt yonder, here, there. But
  the sun had set for the adventurer prowling with his shovel, pick and pan.</p>
<p>The gold fever had gone from the blood of young Henry George and left him
  depressed. He had been led on by a mirage of wealth, and found himself instead
  working long and hard for bare sustenance.</p>
<p>&quot;How I long for the Golden Age,&quot; he wrote to the folks back home, &quot;when
  the poorest will have a chance to use all his God-given faculties, and not
  be forced to drudge away the best part of his time. &#8230;Sometimes I feel
  sick of the fierce struggle of our high civilized life.&quot;</p>
<p>He worked so much of the day that he had no time or energy left for reading
  in the evening. He wore his clothes until they were rags. He economized in
  every way, yet he hadn't enough to meet his board bill. Times were bitter.
  In Sacramento the first shovelful of earth was dug for the railroad which was
  to join the East to the West and, so people said, bring good times. Henry George
  was doubtful. Why was it that the wealthier a country became, the poorer its
  people? Sphinx-like, the riddle taunted him.</p>
<p>Times grew even worse for him. He had married, and with work scarce and a
  family to support, he was frantic. The day his second baby was born, he had
  no money to buy food. He went into the street and walked along slowly, eyeing
  every passer. At last he picked his man, stopped him and spoke in a firm tone.</p>
<p>&quot;I need five dollars. Will you let me have it?&quot;</p>
<p>The man looked at him. &quot;What do you want it for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My wife is ill. I have nothing to give her to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>The stranger hesitated, then reached into his pocket.</p>
<p>&quot;What would I have done,&quot; wondered Henry George afterward, &quot;had
  he refused? I was desperate.&quot; He saw that poverty breeds criminals as
  well as beggars. That was why the riddle must be answered. &quot;Yes,&quot; he
  thought. &quot;The railroad will bring us wealth. Those who have, will have
  more; but the average person will be poorer. San Francisco will build its fine
  mansions; but along with them the slum will arise, the almshouse and the jail.&quot;</p>
<p>The riddle that stalked him threw him its last and fiercest challenge in the
  city of New York. Times had improved for him; he was now an editor of a San
  Francisco newspaper which had sent him East on business. New York fascinated
  him. He saw avenues lined with mansions, and people in coaches. But when he
  turned his head, he seemed to behold the skeleton beneath this fair complexion
  of things: homes worse than shacks in the hills, people gaunt and weary. He
  saw small dogs fed and housed, and little children in want. He saw men and
  women swathed luxuriously, and others without the daily crust of bread.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet,&quot; he thought, &quot;there is enough wealth here for the
  needs of all.&quot;</p>
<p>When he was a boy of sixteen he had gone to sea. He had sailed up the Ganges
  in India, thrilled to be in the land of soft airs and dreamy luxury. At least
  so it was described in books. But the real India before him was a bitter disappointment.
  He saw the princely luxury of a few, saw jewels blaze in the trappings of elephants.
  But most human life he saw groveling in the dirt.</p>
<p>Now New York impressed him the same way.</p>
<p>His yearning for the sea had been inspired by the tales he had read, of missionaries
  who had gone abroad to spread Light and Truth among the benighted people of
  the earth.</p>
<p>Now he longed to become a missionary among his own people, to teach them to
  stamp out the disease of poverty.</p>
<p>Pity roused him to confront the riddle once for all time. &quot;This riddle
  has its root somewhere. Wealth and want spring from the same seed,&quot; he
  believed. This seed he must find. Then, taking humanity by the hand, he would
  lead them to it, that they might destroy it. Although he had quit school before
  his fourteenth birthday, he had never stopped studying. Now he assigned to
  himself the problem: Why do a few people have so much, and most people so little?</p>
<p>A man of thirty, small and erect, with a full sandy beard and alert blue eyes,
  had undertaken to answer the riddle of the ages.</p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <strong>II</strong></p>
<p>One afternoon, not long after his return to San Francisco, he took his horse
  for a gallop in the country. The clear stretch of wild land refreshed him;
  the jolting of his mount threw off him the cares of the day. Far in the distance
  he seemed to see a row of ties and poles bobbing past: the railroad was finished.
  The ground beneath his mustang's hoofs was wild, but no longer free. It belonged
  to someone now. Everyone was in a rush to buy land. The railroad, people said,
  would raise its value. Buy land and hold it, they advised.</p>
<p>The mustang was panting and his rider drew in the reins. As they halted, a
  teamster happened along, and he, too, stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;What's land worth around here?&quot; asked Henry George.</p>
<p>The teamster pointed to some cows grazing in the distance. &quot;That man
  wants a thousand dollars an acre.&quot;</p>
<p>Something clicked in the mind of Henry George, like a door opening wide. He
  was dazed with the flood of light that streamed in over him, dazed with the
  sight of the thing he had been looking for: the answer to the riddle.</p>
<p>Home he charged. He had to be alone to work it out. He had hold of the bare
  idea. That man who wanted one thousand dollars an acre, for his land &#8212; what
  had he done to earn that money? Nothing: he was just shrewd enough to foresee
  that more and more people would settle around his land. Land is the one thing
  you cannot create. Those people would need his land; he could raise the price
  of it.</p>
<p>&quot;That is why,&quot; thought Henry George trembling with excitement, &quot;that
  is why the more our community grows, the more wealth we are forced to hand
  over to landlords. The people remain poor but the few landlords grow richer.&quot;</p>
<p>He sat down at his table to publish the thought. There flashed into his mind
  the image of the four men who built the railroad. As though in gratitude, the
  Government had given away to these men more than twenty-five thousand acres
  of the people's ground for each mile of railroad they had built. Few people
  cared. The vast empty territory of the West seemed worthless. Yet that gift
  had made the four men multimillionaires. &#8230;</p>
<p>It was wrong to give away the people's land, he wrote. True, just then, we
  had more land than we could use. That was because America was young. Land was
  still cheap; on the frontier, even free. His free land on the frontier made
  the American independent. He worked for nobody unless he was well paid for
  his work. He was cheerful and confident, because he was independent. For the
  same reason he was hospitable to strangers, to the downtrodden foreigner. He
  could afford to be. God's earth was plentiful.</p>
<p>But land had its end, Henry George pointed out. At the rate it was being fenced
  in, another twenty years would see the end of America's free ground. Already
  there were men who owned more land than a horse could gallop over in a day.
  One day we, the people, would need that land, and would have to pay tribute
  for it to the lord of the domain: rent to the landlord. We would have to give
  him a share of the crops we raised, or a share of our wages, just for the privilege
  of building our house on it. And as the country grew, the landlord's share
  of our labor would grow larger until we should become no better than his slaves.
  Such was already the case in Europe, and so it was developing in the East.
  Thus, when people said that wages were low in the old countries, they meant
  that the landlords there took away a high share of the wealth produced. That
  was the answer to the riddle.</p>
<p>&quot;But what of it!&quot; he could hear the objection come from outside
  his window. &quot;This is the country of opportunity. One man is the owner
  of a factory, another of a shop, and a third man owns a piece of land. Business
  is business.&quot;</p>
<p>Henry George was ready with his reply: &quot;Oh, no. There's a difference.
  The landlord did not earn his profit. He did no work. He merely waited until
  his land was needed by other people. The community that came to his land created
  its value. That value belongs by right to the community, to all the people.&quot;</p>
<p>How can they get it?</p>
<p>&quot;It's all very well to find fault,&quot; went on the voice of objection. &quot;But
  if there's nothing to be done about it, you're wasting time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must do something,&quot; warned Henry George. &quot;Otherwise the
  very ground which nourishes and shelters us, as vital to us as air, will be
  monopolized by a few men. Those few will own and rule us. And then democracy
  will perish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What would you have done?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One step only can safeguard us and our children: We must claim what
  is ours, every cent of ground-rent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What would happen if we so taxed the landlord?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would no longer pay him to hold on to his acres. Land would become
  cheap. Settlements of people would flourish everywhere. The worker could reap
  the full harvest of his work. No longer would children starve in the streets
  of New York, to provide the princes of the Avenue with splendor. All our people
  could then live in ease and freedom. Through that single tax on land, democracy
  would be saved.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the powerful thought with which Henry George would abolish poverty.
  It kept whirling in his mind, and developing, and upon it his spirit soared.
  He saw the planet Earth sailing through space, a well-provisioned ship. But
  it seemed whenever a quantity of food was drawn up out of the hatches a few
  officers stepped forward and laid hands on it. The rest of the crew got only
  the leavings.</p>
<p>If he could conjure up ghosts, he would summon old Ben Franklin, the man of
  perfect common sense, and say to him: &quot;The world has changed miraculously
  since your day. Hear the throb of our engines. Those are the slaves of our
  lamp. They can turn out a case of shoes in less time than one of your cobblers
  takes to put on a sole. They can spin cotton into cloth almost without the
  lift of a human finger. They can harvest our crops and build our houses.&quot;</p>
<p>He predicted the comment of the old sage: &#8212; &quot;Oh, to be alive now!
  For with plenty for everyone, life must be beautiful; your hearts pure of envy
  and greed; your bodies radiant; your minds in search of perfection. Pray, what
  means that terrifying roar?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is the cry of masses of men out of work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you not say that your engines &#8212; &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but those engines belong to few.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let the men without work do as we did. Let them go into the wilderness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That, too, belongs to a few.&quot;</p>
<p>Poor Richard would understand. &quot;Then I seem to see a land of beggars
  and criminals; a land poorer than in my day; a land of discontent and misery.&quot; And
  without a trace of regret, the shade would vanish.</p>
<p>For three years Henry George spent his happiest hours in his room on First
  Street, San Francisco, in the company of his figures and his visions. His children,
  stealing past, saw him bent over his table in the center of the room overlooking
  the Bay, his cheeks glowing and his pen gliding over the paper. During the
  night, sometimes, when the tide beat strongly against the docks, they awoke
  and there in the hall lay a yellow beam thrown by their father's lamp. At dawn
  the beam had paled, but not gone out. A little more of their father's plan
  for a better world had been drawn.</p>
<p>They tiptoed into his room, perhaps, when he went walking, or down to the
  newspaper office where he sometimes worked. They looked with awe at the sermon
  paper neatly piled on the table; at the bold letters written in blue ink. The
  words were lofty and melodious, but hard. Even the title was hard: &quot;<em>Progress
  and Poverty</em>.&quot; But now and then little stories seemed to break out over
  the page. There was one about a pioneer driving his wagon over a grassy plain.</p>
<p>The poor fellow is looking for a home. He notices that around him the soil
  is rich. He hears the rustle of game, and sees trout flashing in the stream.
  He may as well build his cabin right there, he thinks. The only trouble with
  the place is that there are no people near by. He and his family have to do
  everything for themselves &#8212; build their own house, kill their own food,
  make their own clothes. They are very poor, they have only food and shelter.</p>
<p>But presently another wagon rolls over the plain, another pioneer. He, too,
  can settle anywhere, but, since it is better for him to have a neighbor, he
  builds his house next to the first pioneer's. Pretty soon others arrive. The
  plain rings with pleasant sounds, and the men help one another in labor. Life
  is richer for everyone. Instead of each man's building his own wagon, or making
  his own shoes, one of them sets up a shop and builds all the wagons of the
  settlement, or makes all the shoes. Instead of everybody's journeying to town
  to sell his corn and buy his utensils, one man only need go back and forth;
  he opens a store. Pooling together, they hire a teacher. As the seasons roll
  over the little village, there are husking bees, apple parings, quilting parties.</p>
<p>But what happens to our hero, the first pioneer? It seems that someone says
  to him: &quot;You've built a barn and a house. You've put up fences and planted
  an orchard. Now I'll pay you all that it cost you and I'll pay you for your
  labor, too. You don't care about the land itself, do you? Beyond the village
  there's just as fertile land you can have for nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Our hero laughs loudly. Why, his land is next to the general store; a doctor
  has moved across the road; the schoolhouse is right there. He wouldn't take
  less than fifty dollars an acre for his land.</p>
<p>The village grows into a good-sized town. The spot our hero had once found
  so wild and lonely teems with a thousand people. All kinds of shops have come
  to it. A railroad puffs by. Our hero's land is worth one thousand dollars an
  acre. In time, when the town has grown into a city, an acre may be worth ten
  thousand dollars. Our hero, or his children, suddenly find themselves rich.
  And they have done nothing but sit on their acres. To the end of time other
  people, more and more of them, will have to work for his children's children. &#8230;</p>
<p>The only point the George children could make of this story was that somehow
  our hero wasn't a hero at all; he was really a sort of villain, because he
  made people pay him for nothing he had done.</p>
<p>Perhaps the children overheard their father discuss &quot;<em>Progress and
    Poverty</em>&quot; with
  his friends. &#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;We must make land the property of all,&quot; argued Henry George.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean to divide up all the land equally?&quot; asked his critics. &quot;You
  couldn't do that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is not what I mean,&quot; replied George. &quot;Let the world carry
  on exactly as it does to-day. I would merely have our Government take all ground-rent.&quot;</p>
<p>His critics had a serious objection. &quot;Yes, perhaps the world would then
  be a better place to live in. But would it be fair to take away all the ground-rent
  from people who paid money for it? Your first pioneers are no more. They have
  sold their land. Is it right to punish the people who bought it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was it right to take the slaves away from people who bought them?&quot; retorted
  Henry George. &quot;Suppose Captain Kidd, the pirate, had robbed your grandfather
  of a fortune. Now suppose that Kidd's grandson has the fortune which you would
  have had. The law says: 'Young Mr. Kidd never harmed you. You must let bygones
  be bygones.' Is that fair? Well, our early pioneers were land pirates, although
  innocent ones. They took for themselves the increasing value of the land, even
  though they had not earned it. Unearned increment of land belongs to all of
  us. Let us claim it.&quot;</p>
<p>The children wished they could hear more about the pirates &#8212; &quot;unearned
  increment&quot; were such hard words. But they liked to listen to their father
  when he spoke, with a faraway look as though fixed on some vision outside the
  room, about the new world his single tax on land would make. In that world
  nobody could be poor. In that world their father would not have had to pawn
  his watch to pay the grocer. Young boys would not have to go to work, like
  Junior; they could continue their schooling. Nobody would be out of work, and
  no workers would ever need to go on a strike because their wages would be high
  enough. Everybody then could be honest, and really have what Thomas Jefferson
  said he was entitled to have: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
  At present, as their father said, Americans had the right to vote but not to
  work. They had the ballot but no bread, and there was starvation and misery
  throughout the land of the free and equal. &#8230;</p>
<p>One night in the spring of 1879 the gleam of light lay outside Henry George's
  room, as usual. Within, shortly before dawn rose out of the bay, Henry George
  laid down his pen. He had just written: &quot;Beauty still lies imprisoned,
  and iron wheels go over the good and true and beautiful that might spring from
  human lives.&quot;</p>
<p>It was almost the last sentence of the book, &quot;<em><strong>Progress and Poverty</strong></em>,&quot; and
  the face of the author was wet with tears. He was about to send into the world
  the vision that lived in his brain. What would the world say?</p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <strong>III</strong></p>
<p>At first the world said little, and Henry George at the age of forty-two found
  himself with his book under his arm in New York, poor and unknown, in search
  of a job. But suddenly the spotlight of fame turned upon him. Throughout the
  country workingmen, in the midst of bitter strikes for wages and jobs, became
  aware of an eloquent voice speaking for them in the pages of a book called &quot;<em>Progress
  and Poverty</em>.&quot; They hailed the book as a prophecy and demanded ever more
  copies of it. They called for the author, and Henry George went on tour, lecturing
  before crowds of people in the United States and Canada. His fiery presence
  branding his message into their hearts.</p>
<p>Who could answer him? Could anyone deny the pinched faces in the streets of
  a big city? No one with a heart in his body could fail to be moved by the squalor
  and the distress in the tenements of New York or the slums of Chicago. No one
  who had seen the figures of men and women shuffling aimlessly outside a factory,
  like discards of flesh and blood, could resist joining Henry George in pleading
  for those who were racked with poverty and uncertainty.</p>
<p>There were thoughtful people who agreed with Henry George that democracy would
  die unless something were done to elevate the masses of men, but who doubted
  whether his plan of a single tax on land was the right plan. With those people
  Henry George was always willing to debate. But there were others who raised
  a hue and cry against him, who shook their fists at him and called him &quot;Robber!
  Revolutionist! Anarchist!&quot; &#8212; their fists flashing with diamonds.
  Many hesitant people, judging Henry George by his enemies, enlisted in his
  cause.</p>
<p>Abroad his fame was more intense than at home. He got his first invitation
  to cross the sea from Ireland, where the suffering of the poor was more pitiable
  than anywhere else in Great Britain. After his visit his name became Irish
  household words. But honor of him spread through all the British Isles. Next
  to the Prime Minister, he was the most talked-of person; and groups of men
  were organized to act on his plan. The great scientist, Alfred Russel Wallace,
  said that in his opinion &quot;<em>Progress and Poverty</em>&quot; was the most important
  book of the century.</p>
<p>When he returned to America, he was greeted by huge throngs of workingmen
  to whom he lectured at Cooper Union, in New York. Shortly after, it happened
  that an election for the office of Mayor was facing the city. The labor unions,
  deciding to put up a candidate of their own, were unanimous on only one man,
  Henry George, and they appealed to him to accept their nomination. The author
  of &quot;<em>Progress and Poverty</em>,&quot; just then in great demand as lecturer
  and writer, was reluctant to enter politics. But a petition of 30,000 people
  touched him and he consented to run.</p>
<p>He almost won, too, which fact frightened the wits out of some people &#8212; those
  whom it profited to believe Henry George a highwayman from the West. Nearly
  70,000 people voted for him. As they put their mark after his name on the ballot,
  what did those people signify? They seemed to say: &quot;In a world as rich
  as ours, poverty is absurd. It is not nature's, it is man's fault. Men have
  divided up their wealth stupidly and selfishly. We must re-divide it more wisely
  and more justly. Democracy, which decrees freedom for every man, is the most
  beautiful of ideals. But no man is free when he is as poor as millions of us
  are, for he is bound by hunger, by all his pangs and those of his family. From
  those he must be freed.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the basis of Henry George's politics. &quot;It is not the end of
  the campaign,&quot; he said after Election Day. &quot;We have fought the first
  skirmish.&quot;</p>
<p>His next move was to start a weekly newspaper, <em>the Standard</em>, in which
  he broadcast his protest against progress with poverty, and the Standard gave
  rise to an
  Anti-Poverty Society. Meanwhile his world popularity was growing and in 1890
  came his third call abroad, this time to the South Sea Islands continent, Australia
  and New Zealand. Once he had visited Australia, with a ship's crew when he
  was sixteen. Now, at the age of fifty-one, he came as one of Australia's most
  celebrated men. Whenever he went on the island continent he was the guest of
  honor of Single-Tax and Anti-Poverty Societies. To this day, although his principles
  of the land tax are practiced in various parts of the world, it flourishes
  best throughout Australia and New Zealand. When he returned to New York, however,
  his honor at home was rival to that abroad. He found in progress a national
  convention of &quot;single-tax&quot; men. He heard himself dubbed &quot;Saint
  George.&quot;</p>
<p>In June 1897, the labor unions again asked him to run for the office of Mayor
  of New York. This time, it was felt, the banner of Saint George could be raised
  on the City Hall. There was one fear &#8212; on the score of Henry George's
  health. He was sick from overwork. His face was ashen, his body thin. The physician
  forbade his taking part in the campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; Henry George asked the doctor. &quot;If I accept, what
  is the worst that can happen to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since you ask,&quot; answered the doctor, &quot;you have a right to
  be told, it will most probably prove fatal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean it may kill me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>The patient shrugged. &quot;I've got to die. How can I die better than by
  serving humanity?&quot;</p>
<p>He thought of the line of men standing on cold nights outside a Broadway bakeshop
  where the stale, unsold loaves of bread were given away. He would run.</p>
<p>He had to be helped to the platform of Cooper Union where, before the throng
  of workingmen, he accepted their nomination.</p>
<p>&quot;You ask me to raise the standard again &#8230;&quot; he said in a weak
  voice, &quot;for that great cause; to stand as Jefferson stood. &#8230;I accept.&quot;</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson had once said: &quot;The earth belongs to the living and
  not to the dead. The earth is given as a common stock for men to labor and
  live on.&quot; Therefore, Henry George's party became &quot;The Party of Thomas
  Jefferson.&quot;</p>
<p>His doctor was right; the strenuous campaign proved too much for him, and
  on the eve of the election he took his seat among the immortals by the side
  of Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a tribune of the people,&quot; agreed the newspapers the next
  day, &quot;poor for their sake when he might have been rich. All his life long
  he spoke, and wrote, and thought, and prayed, and dreamed of one thing only
  &#8212; the cause of the plain people. He died as he lived, striking at the
  enemies of the people. &#8230;He was a thinker whose work belongs to the world's
  literature. His death has carried mourning into every civilized country on
  the globe.&quot;</p>
<p>But Henry George has written his own portrait in the pages of &quot;<em>Progress
  and Poverty</em>.&quot; He speaks of his ideal man: &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;He turns his back upon the feast &#8230; he leaves it to others to accumulate
    wealth &#8230; to bask themselves in the warm sunshine. &#8230;He works for
    those he never saw and never can see. &#8230;He toils in the advance where
    it is cold, and there is little cheer from men, and the stones are sharp and
    the brambles thick. Into higher, grander spheres &#8230;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8230;Where Henry George comes at last, and stands fixed among the traditions
  of America.</p>
