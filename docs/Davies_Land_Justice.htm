<div align="left">
  <p align="center">by <a href="../auth/Davies.html">Lindy Davies</a><br>
    delivered at Chauttauqua, August 4, 2005</p>
  <p align="left"> I'm here today as a &quot;Single Taxer.&quot; If you don't
    recall quite what
that is, let me first say that it&#8217;s NOT Steve Forbes&#8217;s &#8220;flat
tax!&#8221; No. The Single Tax is actually a comprehensive program for economic
justice and environmental sustainability. It was stated most memorably by the
American economist Henry George in his 1879 book <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress
and Poverty</a> &#8212; and
affirmed by a great many important thinkers, before and since. The idea is for
society to collect the rental value of land for public revenue &#8212; and to
abolish all other taxes on the production and exchange of wealth. It came to
be known at the &#8220;Single Tax&#8221; because of this proposal that the rent
of land should be the sole source of public revenue. </p>
</div>
<p> Single Taxers have been ridiculed somewhat, over the years, for peddling
  a panacea, offering a cure for poverty, depressions, urban blight, potholes,
    the common
cold and the heartbreak of psoriasis. Well, I don&#8217;t claim to have a cure
for every bad thing. But I do want to talk to you making the necessary economic
arrangements to create a just society, in which there would be equal opportunity
for all, and in which we could confidently look ahead to all our children&#8217;s
futures. </p>
<p> Single taxers have also caught some grief for always saying &#8220;It&#8217;s
all about the land!&#8221;</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not going to apologize for that! I want
  to explain to you why the issues of economic justice and sustainability actually
  ARE all about the
  land.</p>
<p>The theme of this week&#8217;s program is <em><strong>Land and Justice</strong></em>. Those are two
  words that we use so often that we tend to take their meanings for granted.
  It might
be helpful to stop and think about what they truly mean.</p>
<p> Justice is often seen as the fair retribution for something done wrong, as
    in &quot;justice
was done&quot; when a criminal is sent to jail. George W. Bush vowed, for example,
to bring the 9-11 terrorists to justice.</p>
<p>  However, that conception of justice &#8212; in which one does good, in order
to avoid the consequences of not doing good &#8212; is actually an immature one.
In the stages of moral development identified by psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg,
this is called the &quot;conventional&quot; stage. Maturity comes in the &quot;post-conventional&quot; stage,
when we come to value doing good so as to contribute to our community, or, even,
doing good for its own sake.</p>
<p>  Jesus was hip to that, in his scorn for the loudly-praying pharisees on the
    street corners. They already have their reward, he said. He set much greater
    store by
good deeds done without thought of reward: &quot;whatever you do to the least
of my brothers and sisters, you to do me also.&quot; And, even more to the point,
the prophet Micah enjoins us to &quot;Do justice and love mercy.&quot;</p>
<p>  So, what is &quot;doing justice,&quot; in this positive sense? If I do
  something nice for the least of my brothers and sisters, have I done justice?
  If I send
them a handmade quilt?</p>
<p>  Not really. I think the least of my brothers and sisters, cold though they
    might be, would resent my presuming to know exactly how to handle their problem;
    perhaps
they'd rather make their own quilt, or build a fireplace, or move to a warmer
place.</p>
<p>  Justice must have to do with freedom. To do justice, then, is to secure, in
    Thomas Jefferson's words, people's inalienable rights: life, liberty and
    the pursuit
of happiness.</p>
<p>  The most basic of those rights is life. (In this day and age, though, even
    that is controversial... There's a great deal of passionate contention about
    the troubling
special cases of the very beginning, or the very end of life &#8212; but it seems
to me that we ought to pay more attention to every single human being's right
to live!)</p>
<p>  Be that as it may: we all pretty much understand basically what human life
      is, and what its basic requirements are: food, clothing and shelter.</p>
<p>  In heaven, there is no beer... And in heaven, one does not need to work for
    a living. Heaven is usually seen as an entirely spiritual place, where we
    are freed
from earthly suffering, aches and pains, and in fact, from all material needs. </p>
<p>  (I've always thought Satan was a bit of a nut. I mean, why rebel in heaven?
    But,
to each his own.)</p>
<p>  Here on earth, anyway, we have material needs. (That's why we drink the
  beer
here.)</p>
<p>  Our food, clothing and shelter have to come from somewhere &#8212; and so the
question of justice inevitably leads to the question of land.</p>
<p>  Now, what do we mean by &quot;land?&quot; The land... it usually brings
  to mind scenes of nature's bounty: fields of whispering wheat... the mighty
  river...
the rainforest... the good earth... the untamed <a href="../HG/PP/SP/03_Rent_Grows.htm">savannah</a>...</p>
<p>  We tend to have a very romantic conception of land, in this day and age. I'm
not sure why, but I suspect it has to do with how seldom modern people actually
come into contact with the stuff of the earth itself. We deal with burgers...
papers... toilets... Without thinking about the many layers of processing between
hayfield and burger, between tree and paper, between flush and water table. </p>
<p>  We think of dropping out of the modern plastic world to go &quot;back to
  the
land.&quot; &quot;The land&quot; is where we go on camping trips.</p>
<p>  This romantic conception of land can lead to some dangerously fuzzy thinking.
It leads us to think, for example, that perhaps land used to be absolutely vital
to human life, back in some halcyon, underpopulated past &#8212; but modern technology
has long since taken care of that.</p>
<p>Or has it?</p>
<p>  Let's think about this question: what is our most valuable natural resource?
  Is it<br>
&#8212; gold, diamonds, precious or strategic minerals? Nope, not even close.<br>
&#8212; Oil? Well, it's highly important to industrial civilization, of course,
  a matter of great political import &#8212; but by no means the most valuable.<br>
&#8212; Water? Now we're getting closer: necessary for life, to be sure, and
  thus a potential object of wars &#8212; but in terms of cost per cubic foot,
  not so terribly high, yet.  </p>
<p>What is it? Our most valuable natural resource &#8212; by leaps and bounds, more
  valuable than all the others combined &#8212; is urban land. Our most valuable
  natural resource is land whose natural fertility is utterly depleted, it will
  yield no gems or minerals; its soil is full of toxins. There's nothing worthwhile
about it, except for one vital attribute: where it is.</p>
<p> Technology has continually reduced the amount of land that each person needs
  to survive. But, of course, we do more, economically, than merely survive &#8212; and
  human society has continually demanded more land for all the stuff that people
  produce: all the gewgaws, gimcracks, thingamabobs and widgets...</p>
<p>It takes a whole bunch of land to produce &#8212; and transport, and merchandise &#8212; all
  that stuff. Nowadays we hear a lot about the concept of the ecological footprint:
  the overall area of land and resources needed to support a certain industry,
  say, or a certain region. The grossly huge ecological footprint of many communities
  (the United States, for example) leads to hand-wringing about overpopulation &#8212; goodness
  gracious, what if all the people in China and India start wanting to consume
  as much as we do!</p>
<p>We can analyze the ecological footprint in terms of its three distinct components:  </p>
<ol>
  <li>the <strong>subsistence</strong> footprint (what we must have to stay alive &#8212; which,
    as I said, tends to	shrink with human progress)</li>
  <li> the <strong>wealth</strong> footprint (the resources needed to make the stuff we want,
    over and above what	we actually need)</li>
  <li>the <strong>illth</strong> footprint (&quot;illth&quot; is a very useful term coined by
    ecologist and social philosopher Ralph Borsodi. It refers to the resources
    that are squandered
    on things we neither want nor need: pollution, waste, weapons, crime, preventable
    disease and malnutrition)</li>
</ol>
<p>  It is indeed possible to provide for the subsistence of more people, and to
  create more of the things we want &#8212; while cutting back on the output of illth.
  Compare today's London with the foul and unhealthy place it was in the nineteenth
  century. Or, consider the surprising re-emergence of the ivory-billed woodpecker,
  one of many threatened species whose habitats have returned in the United States.
  Indeed, it appears that environmental protection does not come at the expense
  of development &#8212; but rather gains strength as a society reaches a certain
  level of prosperity.</p>
<p>  If we just look at the &quot;ecological footprint,&quot; it's easy to be
  scared of the seemingly unavoidable damage we are doing to the earth. But seeing &quot;the
  footprint&quot; in terms of its components &#8212; subsistence, wealth, and
  illth &#8212; makes
  it clear that the fact of persistent and growing global poverty is not the
  inevitable result of population growth. I believe it&#8217;s true that the
  world cannot long support current levels of pollution, waste and habitat destruction &#8212; but
  these problems spring not from production itself &#8212; and certainly not
  from trade, itself &#8212; but from privileges, granted to individuals and
  corporations &#8212; things
  that we can correct, if we choose to.</p>
<p>  To solve the problem of land and justice is to remove unjust privilege, by
  instituting an economic system that rewards production and prohibits extortion.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about the land: not only is land necessary for all life &#8212; land
  is also necessary for all production. So, as human population increases, and
  as the production of wealth gets more and more efficient, the demand for land
  goes up, and, of course, the land factories start cranking out more land!</p>
<p>  Wait! They can't DO that, can they? </p>
<p>  Wealth &#8212; products, widgets &#8212; these things are made by human beings.
  If customers are willing to buy more of them, then manufacturers will make
  more of them. But human beings can't make land. The supply of land cannot be
  increased.
  If the demand for land increases, only one thing can happen: its price will
  go up.  </p>
<p>The owners of land see population and production go up, up, up &#8212; and
  no more land. So, they will only put their land to use if they have an immediate
  need for the cash. If they can afford to wait, they will wait, because they
  expect
  the land's value to increase with time.</p>
<p>  That, in a nutshell, is the key to the land problem &#8212; the problem of
  poverty.</p>
<p>  That is why millions upon millions of people who are willing and able to work
  cannot find work, even while millions upon millions of acres of useable land
  (city land, industrial land, farm land, you name it) are held idle.  </p>
<p>This leads to no end of problems. In the United States, it brings urban blight
  and suburban sprawl, which disrupt communities, and waste energy and resources.
  You don&#8217;t think under-use of land is that big a deal? Consider the fact
  that in the five boroughs of New York City, 7.5% of its land, or 18.6 square
  miles, is vacant. That&#8217;s buildable land, not parks or streets. And, of
  course, a great deal more land in New York, as in every other city, is used somewhat,
  but far less than the local economy would support. New York City has about 80
  people per acre of residential land. That means that New York&#8217;s vacant
  land could house another 956,000 people at current density levels, without
  even starting to use its vast stock of under-used land.</p>
<p>  Even though downtowns are underbuilt, people want to move away from the high
  prices and high crime rates they often find there &#8212; so development leapfrogs,
  using far more land than is necessary, jacking up the price of farmland near
  the city &#8212; so that local farms can no longer compete. All this sprawl creates
  more and more need for roads &#8212; provided by tax dollars, of course. With
  all these roads, and all these cars, public transportation systems become less
  popular and harder to finance. This chokes the cities with even more traffic,
  making them even less desirable places to be. Meanwhile, all these subsidized
  highways are just great for the big trucks, burning subsidized fuel, carrying
  imported merchandise to all the big-box stores and franchise restaurants of suburbia.
  In other words: two of the hugest problems that progressives are trying to address
  today &#8212; the decay of communities and the rise of the corporate big box &#8212; are
  all about the land.</p>
<p>  Around the world, it gives too much power to the banks, for land is by far
  the greatest source of collateral for loans, everywhere. The more money we
  have to
  pay for land, the more power we give to the banks. Although 66% of American
  families own their homes, the overall net equity of American home &#8220;owners&#8221; is
  only 18%.</p>
<p>  It&#8217;s all about treating the land as an &#8220;asset.&#8221;</p>
<p>In &quot;developing countries&quot; it leads to a terrible vicious circle: peasants
  lose their land to one of two groups: either, first, to land-baron cronies of
  corrupt regimes &#8212; who hold land idle for the specific reason of not allowing
  peasants to use it, thus making sure they have no place to go, and are willing
  to work for subsistence wages &#8212; or, second, to multinational corporations,
  who run huge plantations to grow crops for export. The foreign exchange thus
  gained goes for debt service, which allows the ruling regime to keep playing
  by the IMF's rules, and stay in power. Meanwhile, the peasants gravitate to
  the cities, seeking nonexistent jobs, and end up in shantytowns that lack clean
  water
  and sewers.</p>
<p>  We're told that two billion people live on less than two dollars a day. Now,
  certainly there is lots of poverty in the world &#8212; but that statistic
  troubles me. Two dollars a day? Consider your own basic needs, and ask yourself
  how far
  two bucks will go toward satisfying them. Nobody can survive on two dollars
  a day. Why haven't those two billion people just keeled over by now?  </p>
<p>This sort of paradox led the Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen to
  the studies described in his book <em>Development as Freedom</em>. Sen contends
  that the
  true measure of economic welfare &#8212; and therefore of development in any
  meaningful sense &#8212; can't be a matter of GDP and other conventional measures
  of &quot;growth.&quot;  Any true measure of economic welfare must have to do with the degree to which
  each person can set and achieve his or her own economic goals. </p>
<p>  Economic freedom for the world&#8217;s poorest people is unquestionably all about
  the land. Let's say a peasant family has a goat and a garden, and, working carefully,
  can grow enough to feed itself. Occasionally a good harvest will yield some surplus
  which can be sold &#8212; there wouldn't be much of that, but let's say it
  brought in an average of two dollars a day. With thrift, enough for school
  clothes, maybe
  even books.  </p>
<p>Now, let's imagine that the family lost their land &#8212; perhaps an injury
  or some other disaster made it impossible to keep farming it &#8212; and they
  had to go to the city, where they managed to find a combination of odd jobs,
  yielding them an income of $10 per day. Now, they had to somehow buy their
  food and every other necessity out of that ten dollars, and they had to live
  in a
  miserable shack, with open sewage running in unpaved streets &#8212; yet in
  terms of development numbers, their income had increased by 500%.</p>
<p>  In which case did the family have more freedom? Which scenario is more conducive
  to development?</p>
<p>We were talking about the tendency for landowners to use land as an investment &#8212; a
  sensible thing to do &#8212; not to use it now if they don't need to, but to
  think in terms of enjoying its increase in value over time. We even identified
  that as the key to the problem of poverty. But &#8212; good heavens, what can
  we do about that? Isn't that just how the economy works? Isn't the private
  ownership of land a basic part of a modern economy? How can we do without such
  an important
  institution?</p>
<p>  Or in other words &#8212; won't the poor always be with us?</p>
<p>  Not necessarily. It has been plain, since very earliest days of civil society,
  that the private ownership of land leads to exploitation and great extremes
  of wealth and poverty. And, since the time of the Book of Leviticus, we have
  had
  a pretty good idea of what to do about it. In that book were recorded the words &quot;The
  land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is Mine, for ye are strangers
  and sojourners with me.&quot;</p>
<p>  This ideal was codified into a remarkable three-stage program for economic
justice and social harmony: the land laws of Leviticus. The stages were:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <strong>1. The Sabbath.</strong> Every seventh day was the Lord's day;
    people were enjoined to keep it holy and refrain from work. Now, we were
    told in Sunday
    school that
      this
      was all about going to church, but, as so often happens, our teachers missed
      the deeper significance. Kids who try to get out of, say, taking out the
    garbage on the Sabbath realized that the prohibition was really against gainful
    work;
      folks were still allowed to weed the garden and stuff. <br>
      <br>
      What the Sabbath did was to force people to focus on things that had meaning
        beyond striving and striving to get ahead. Indeed, if one did work on
        the Sabbath, while one's neighbors did not, one could become wealthier,
        at
        their expense &#8212; which
        was why the Sabbath was a very big deal: one of the ten commandments.</p>
  <p>          <strong>2. The Sabbatical.</strong> Every seventh year, the fields
          were to lie fallow &#8212; thus
          recognizing the right of the earth itself to be protected against depletion
          and misuse. And, in the sabbatical year, debts were to be forgiven. A
          debt that could
          not be paid off after six years was well on the way to becoming a usurious
          burden, a guaranteed flow from the labors of one into the coffers of
          another. The canceling
          of debts in the seventh year was designed to ensure that nobody got too
          far ahead, or too far behind.  </p>
  <p><strong>3. The Jubilee.</strong> Even seven times seven years (actually,
          every 50th year), each family could return to its original allotment,
          or heritage, of land &#8212; even
          if it had been sold in the meantime. Under biblical law, then, land could not
          be sold for ever &#8212; never for more than a single generation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it is interesting to note that the economic vision presented in the bible
  is not a precursor of communism. Two of the ten commandments explicitly support
  the institution of private property, and the prophets consistently railed against
  landlords and rulers who robbed the people of the fruits of their labor. The
  laws of Leviticus, which Jesus said he &quot;came not to destroy but to fulfill,&quot;  envisioned
  a community in which everyone was secure in his own home and property, &quot;beneath
  his vine and fig tree.&quot;</p>
<p>  (Incidentally, the quote on the American Liberty Bell, from Leviticus, chapter
  25, was a direct reference to these principles : &quot;Proclaim liberty throughout
  the land and to all the people thereof.&quot; It was a reference to the Jubilee,
  and the freedom it provided was from debt and servitude.)</p>
<p>  The division is clear: there is to be a sacred right of private property in
  the things that are made by people. But people were not to own the things that
  were
  made by God. The 7th commandment sums up both principles in 4 words: <em>Thou
  shalt not steal</em>.</p>
<p>  Modern society has looked away from these principles, calling them quaint,
  naive, inapplicable to the complexities of our time &#8212; yet, modern society finds
  itself mired in chronic economic and social problems for which it can find no
  solutions &#8212; and which threaten to pull down all the advances of civilization
  into a dark age &#8212; occasioned by some combination of war, financial implosion
  or ecological collapse. </p>
<p>  If there is any way out of this dark future, it can only come by way of solving
  the problem of land and justice. </p>
<p>  Fortunately, there exists a plan for that. </p>
<p>  This plan takes the shape of a &quot;fiscal reform&quot;, because it applies
  a definition of the relationship between the individual and the society that
  is consistent with both economic efficiency and moral law. It calls for us
  to respect the right of labor to create and to save wealth, and we acknowledge
  that
  the value of land is created not by its &#8220;owners,&#8221; but by the entire
  community. </p>
<p>Therefore, we will abolish all taxes on income, products and sales &#8212; and
  collect the full rental value of land and other natural resources for public
  revenue.</p>
<p>  What would happen, if we did this?  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider the great problems we were discussing earlier.</p>
<p>  Land in cities would be used efficiently. Cities would not become over-crowded;
  regulation of land use would still be in their power, as it is now. But urban
  blight and decay would be banished. Public transportation, like other public
  services, could be provided free, funded out of the value of locational advantages
  that it created.</p>
<p>  The unnatural pressure on farm land near cities would be eliminated as development
  proceeded to &#8220;infill&#8221;. It would no longer be necessary to haul
  produce halfway across the world.  </p>
<p>Wealth production and employment would be released from the burden of taxation
  that currently weighs it down. The banking system would be freed from its unhealthy
  dependence on land for collateral. Combined with the newly-efficient use of
  urban infrastructure, unemployment could be cut or even eliminated, even while
  inflation
  decreased!</p>
<p>  But the best benefits of all would be in the developing world. If they were
  charged the market rental value of the land they hold, then neither the land-baron
  cronies
  nor the multinationals would hold onto it. Access to good farmland would be
  restored, and the disastrous migration of peasants to ill-equipped poor cities
  would be
  reversed. The resulting vitality would bring these poor nations new sources
  of domestic economic strength &#8212; no longer would they have to grovel to
  maintain foreign credit.</p>
<p>  Despite the current flood of bad news on just about every conceivable topic &#8212; and
  although I do accept that many things in my children&#8217;s world will probably
  get worse before they get better &#8212; I am optimistic about our long-term
  prospects. </p>
<p>Eventually, I believe that human society will adopt the biblical
    and georgist wisdom, and organize itself as it must, to achieve justice,
  efficiency and sustainability. </p>
<p>  Eventually we will have tried everything else. That's how <a href="Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">Clarence
    Darrow</a> &#8212; one
  of the reform's many prominent supporters &#8212; saw things. He said this: &#8220;The &#8220;single
  tax&#8221; is so simple, so fundamental, and so easy to carry into effect that
  I have no doubt that it will be about the last reform the world will ever get.
  People in this world are not often logical.&#8221;</p>
<p>  True enough. Yet I have to believe that eventually the obvious truth will
      start to dawn on us. </p>
