<p><a name="I. Ethical Principles"></a><b>I. Ethical
Principles</b></p>
<p>A. People own themselves and therefore own what they produce.</p>
<p>B. People have obligations to share equally the opportunities that
are provided by nature.</p>
<p>C. People are free to interact with other competent adults on
whatever terms are mutually agreed.</p>
<p>D. People have obligations to pay the costs that their intrusive
behaviors impose on others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="II. Ethical Questions"></a><b>II. Ethical
Questions</b></p>
<p><b>A. What is the relationship between justice (as embodied in the
ethical principles) and community (or peace or harmony)?</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: Justice is what people must settle for (if
they are lucky) when they have not achieved the sense of identification
with one another, or with a higher purpose, that might permit them to
live in harmony with one another in a structure of differentiated
opportunities and obligations.
  <p>One form of community is a voluntary association of persons who
agree to abide by rules that have no right to impose on others. The
principle of freedom allows individuals to form such communities. We
have a much better chance of achieving a peaceful world if we begin
with justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>B. How are the weak to be provided for?</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: The obligations of the strong to provide
for the weak are obligations of community, not justice. A person who
shrinks from these obligations denies his or her humanity. But justice
is the rule of division that permits us to separate ourselves from the
rest of humanity if we choose. In a just world, parents will bring
children into the world only when, through their own resources and
through insurance, the parents are able to provide their children with
the resources and opportunities needed to become independent adults.
  <p>Every adult will provide his or her own insurance. Thus a world
that reflected these principles of justice would not need coercive
taxes to provide social insurance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>C. How should natural opportunities be shared?</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: By public collection of the value of
exclusive access to natural opportunities (the rental value of land in
an unimproved condition, the interest and depreciation on extractable
resources, the value of access to limited fishing opportunities, etc.
All such value will be called rent.)</blockquote>
<p><b>D. Who should be included in the group among whom rent should
be shared equally?</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: All competent adults in the world. The
practical way to do this is to have rent collected at the local level,
and then have redistribution among localities to achieve equality in
pre-development rent per competent adult. Higher levels of government
would be financed by charges on localities.</blockquote>
<p><b>E. Is there an obligation to compensate those whose presently
recognized titles to land and other exclusive natural opportunities
will lose value when rent is shared equally?</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: Such individuals may have claims against
those who sold them land. They may have claims against those who
imposed a regime of private appropriation of rent. But they do not have
claims against future generations.</blockquote>
<p><b>F. Can a person who is occupying a per capita share of land
reasonably ask to be left undisturbed indefinitely on that
land?</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: No, what constitutes a share may vary over
time, depending, among other things, on the preferences of those who
are not adults yet. People who want a guarantee that the land they
identify as theirs will not rise in relative value must buy insurance
against that contingency.</blockquote>
<p><b>G. What is the moral status of "intellectual property?"</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: Giving inventors and creative artists the
right to exclude others from the use of the inventions and creative
works that they produce is often an attractive way to motivate them to
produce things with widespread benefits, but any such rights to exclude
others are voluntary grants by society rather than moral entitlements.</blockquote>
<p><b>H. What standards of environmental respect can people
reasonably require of others?</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: The standards desired by the median voter.
Departures from these standards should be paid for according to the
costs that are generated.</blockquote>
<p><b>I. What forms of land use control are consistent with the
philosophy of Henry George?</b></p>
<blockquote>Proposed answer: When land use controls take the form of
permission that is given to some persons and not others, the philosophy
of Henry George would require anyone with such permission to pay for it
according to its market value. Land use control might also take the
form of making no distinctions in what different persons may do, but
requiring all persons to pay for the adverse impacts of their actions.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="III. Efficiency Questions"></a><b>III. Efficiency
Questions</b></p>
<p><b>A. Would public collection of the rent of land provide enough
revenue for an appropriate public sector?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: In recent years, several economists have
written about the "Henry George Theorem." This is the proposition that,
under specified conditions, a worthwhile public activity will increase
rent by enough to pay for the activity. The conditions are: benefits
that diminish with distance from the site of the activity and
eventually fall to zero, enough people with the highest observed
valuation of the activity to more than fill the region of positive
benefits, and zero moving costs. When there are modest departures from
the conditions, the theorem is "nearly true." Thus public collection of
the rent of land might at least provide enough revenue for all
worthwhile "local public goods."
  <p>It would be good to have an empirical investigation of the extent
to which public services actually do raise land values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>B. How much revenue could public collection of rent
raise?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: Answering this question requires a detailed
model. Note first that reducing taxes on buildings and raising the same
revenue from land can be expected to raise land prices, because the
average piece of land pays as much tax as before, but can now be
further improved without being subject to additional taxes. The amount
of revenue that could be raised is roughly interest on present land
prices, plus present taxes on land, plus present taxes on buildings,
plus something for the extra value that land would have if other
factors were not taxed.</blockquote>
<p><b>C. Is it possible to assess land with sufficient
accuracy?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: This question is worthy of a detailed
investigation. At present, land tends not to be assessed accurately for
a variety of reasons. Some assessors have compassion for the owners of
unused land because they have no income from the land with which to pay
whatever taxes are assessed. Owners of large holdings of unimproved
land are sometimes able to use political influence to keep their taxes
down.
  <p>When land and building are taxed at the same rate, there is no
particular need to ensure that the total value of improved property is
divided properly between land and improvements.</p>
  <p>If only land were assessed, the task of assessment would be
simplified by the fact that land values tend to be spatially continuous.</p>
  <p>An investigation might measure the precision with which land is
assessed in different places by looking at coefficients of dispersion
in the ratio of selling price to assessed value. One might the inquire
into the techniques used by those who assessed land with the greatest
precision.</p>
  <p>Assessing the value of agricultural land poses a different set of
challenges, since unimproved agricultural land is almost non-existent.
There should be a separate inquiry into the accuracy with which the
unimproved value of agricultural land can be assessed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>D. How much growth can a community expect if it shifts taxes
from improvements to land?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: This is the subject of my current investigation
in Pennsylvania. A number of other investigations have been made as
well.
  <p>One potential source of growth, discussed by Mason Gaffney, is
that taxes on land that lower the selling price of land can be expected
to make land relatively more attractive to persons who face high
borrowing rates because of imperfections in capital markets. Gaffney
suggests that such persons tend to be more entrepreneurial, so that
giving them greater relative access to land will increase productive
activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>E. To what extent does the benefit that one community receives
from shifting taxes from buildings to land come at the expense of
other communities?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: I believe that there are reasons based on
economic theory for concluding that the loss to other communities is
extremely slight. But this needs to be worked out in detail.</blockquote>
<p><b>F. What is the impact of land taxes on land
speculation?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: Henry George and other advocates of public
collection of rent have argued that taxing land will curb land
speculation. Some economists have argued that if a tax on land is
neutral, as is often claimed, then it should have no effect on land
speculation. This apparent paradox is resolved by noting that the
conclusion that taxes on land will not affect land use rests on an
assumption of complete and perfect markets. In the absence of a perfect
futures market for land, those who believe they have superior knowledge
regarding future rent must buy land to profit from that knowledge. By
reducing the profit from land speculation, a tax on land reduces the
amount of land that speculators find it profitable to hold. It would be
valuable to see how this theoretical conclusion is borne out in
practice.</blockquote>
<p><b>G. How, if at all, does the impact of shifting the source of
public revenue to land change if it is a whole nation rather than
just a community that makes the shift?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: The larger the territory that makes the shift,
the more that territory will find that capital and labor are supplied
less than perfectly elastically. It would be interesting to investigate
the extent to which variations in income levels and growth rates among
nations can be explained by variations in tax policies.</blockquote>
<p><b>H. Is there a danger that the application of Henry George's
ideas would lead to a world of over-development?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: To avoid this danger, the social value of open
space, rain forests, etc. must be recognized, and those who use the
land they control in such ways must be rewarded for doing so, according
to the social value that they generate.</blockquote>
<p><b>I. How would natural resources be managed appropriately if they
were regarded as the common heritage of humanity?</b></p>
<blockquote>Discussion: Resources such as small petroleum deposits,
where efficient use involved rapid complete depreciation would be sold
to the highest bidder. More enduring resources would be leased on the
basis that the lessee would pay interest on the value of the resource
plus depreciation. There would be rewards for the discoverers of
resources.</blockquote>
