<center><b>Farm Land Rent and the Renewal of Rural Society: The
Self-Financing Model</b></center>
<p align="center">Nicolaus Tideman</p>
<p align="center">May 17, 1996</p>
<p><a name="Summary"></a><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>Citizens in the rural parts of the Russian Federation have strong
desires for a wide variety of local public services. They want more
and better roads, bus services, reliable electric and telephone
lines, water service, and better schools and hospitals. But money is
needed to finance any of these services. Where will the money come
from?</p>
<p>Under existing fiscal arrangements, such public services can be
provided only when money for them is supplied by those in authority
in the oblasts or in Moscow. Achieving local success is a matter of
having sufficient influence with the central authorities to have
one's local projects approved. Public funds are extremely scarce, and
competition for them is fierce. Some areas are able to succeed only
if others fail.</p>
<p>There is a better way of organizing the provision of public
services to rural areas. Instead of having localities dependent on
favors from higher authorities, localities can have the power to
raise the revenue to finance whatever public services the local
residents believe are worth their costs.</p>
<p><b>If one thinks in terms of the taxes that are usually levied (on
income, profits, value added, or on particular commodities) the idea
of financing local expenditures from local sources might seem
unpromising. Taxes raise the cost of production and discourage people
from being productive.</b></p>
<p><b>However, there is a way of raising revenue for local public
services that does not have these disadvantages. That way is to use a
combination of fees for services and public collection of the rent of
land.</b></p>
<p><b>The rent of land is the amount of money that would be bid for
the use of land in an auction.</b> It can be thought of as 100 rubles
more than the second-highest bid, that is, the amount of money that
the person for whom the use of land is most valuable must bid to
outbid the person who places the second-highest value on it.</p>
<p>What land is worth to a person who wants to use it depends on the
length of time for which he will be allowed to use it. For the
purpose of defining rent, this length of time should be indefinitely
long, but with provision for revising the rent as market conditions
change. In other words, if similar land rents for 20% more three
years from now, then the person who secures the use of a site this
year would be required to pay that additional 20% at that time.</p>
<p>The rent of land also depends on the condition of the land. The
rent of land is what people would bid for unimproved land. In a town,
unimproved land is land without any structures on it. In an
agricultural area, many things other than structures can count as
improvements--drainage, stone removal, fertilization, leveling, etc.
It might be hard to find agricultural land that had no such
improvements. Thus in agricultural areas, one must subtract something
from observed payments for the use of land, to account for the value
that is being paid for such improvements.</p>
<p>The comments above describe how one might observe the rental value
of land. Economics can also say something about how a bidder would
decide how much to bid. A bidder would decide how he could use the
land most profitably, compute the net revenue from the most
profitable use after all costs including the cost of his own
entrepreneurial effort and a premium for the risk to his finances,
and what was left would be the total rent of the land for the period
of the investment. The bidder would then estimate future rent,
subtract that from the total rent, and what was left would be rent
for the current period. </p>
<p><b>The rent of land is one of two sources for efficient financing
of local public goods. The other efficient source is fees for the use
of services.</b> The economically efficient fee for a public service
is the cost of providing one more unit of the service. If the cost of
delivering a kilowatt hour of electricity to a rural farm is 100
rubles, then that is the price that will motivate rural users of
electricity to use electricity wherever its value is greater than its
cost, and not to waste it on uses where its value is less than its
cost. If a park is never crowded, then the most efficient price for
use of the park is no price at all. At any positive price, some
people would be discouraged from using the park even though their use
would impose no costs on others.</p>
<p>Such "marginal cost" prices will generally not provide enough
revenue to pay for public services. To be economically efficient, the
remainder of the revenue that is needed to pay for public services
must be raised in a way that does not allow people to reduce their
tax bills by being less productive. The best such source is charges
on the land that benefits from the services, in proportion to the
value of the land.</p>
<p>Thus, in the rural self-financing model rural localities decide
for themselves which projects to undertake, and finance them from a
combination of public collection of rent, and user fees based on
marginal costs. This model has a number of important advantages.</p>
<p>The use of local revenue embodies the principle of justice, that
people should pay for the services they receive and not for those
that they do not receive. When charges are based on the rental value
of land, the amounts of money that people are required to pay have a
reasonable correspondence to the benefits that they receive.</p>
<p>The rural self-financing model also offers local autonomy. Instead
of asking, "How can we get the central authorities to approve all of
these things that we want?" the citizens of a community will ask
themselves, "Which of these things that we would like to have are so
valuable that we are prepared to charge ourselves the costs of
providing them?"</p>
<p>The revenue that is used to finance the public services has the
virtue of<span style="font-weight: bold;"> revenue efficiency.</span>
The fees based on marginal costs
discourage people from wasteful use of public services. And as long
as charges on land are not greater than the rental value of the land
and are independent of how the land is used, it will not be possible
for people to reduce public revenue by being less productive.</p>
<p>The rural self-financing model also offers <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">expenditure efficiency</span>.
Because localities will pay the costs of these projects themselves,
they will have an incentive to undertake good project analysis, and
proceed with only those projects for which benefits are greater than
costs.</p>
<p>Finally, the rural self-financing model offers <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sustainability</span>. If
the benefits of a local public service are in fact greater than its
costs, then the land that is provided with these services will rise
correspondingly in value, thereby expanding the public revenue base
of the community by enough to pay for the service.</p>
