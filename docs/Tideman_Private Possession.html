<p>One of the reasons that the debate is so fierce between the
advocates of rental and the advocates of private ownership of
agricultural land is that each position has important strengths as
well as important weaknesses. This paper argues that there is a third
possibility between rental and private ownership that retains the
strengths of both while avoiding the weaknesses of both. The third
possibility is private possession of land.</p>
<p><a name="one" id="one"></a><b>I. The Concept of
Private Possession of Land</b></p>
<p>Like private ownership, a system of private possession of land
involves titles to land that have no termination date and are freely
transferable. Therefore the possessor of land can be confident of
receiving the full benefit of any improvements that are made to land.
Like rental, a system of private possession of land involves an
obligation to make regular payments to the government for the use of
land. However, the payment is not for the full rental value of land,
but only for the rental value that land would have in an unimproved
condition. This collection by the government of the value that is
provided by nature and location gives recognition to the idea that
land is the common heritage of all generations, and should be
available to all generations on the same terms. It insures that
prices for titles of possession will correspond only to the cost of
improvements, and will therefore not be excessive. It eliminates the
profit from land speculation. And it provides a continuing source of
government revenue.</p>
<p><a name="two" id="two"></a><b>II. The Rental
Value of Land in an Unimproved Condition</b></p>
<p>Implementation of a system of private possession of land requires
a procedure for determining the rental value that land would have in
an unimproved condition. This would be the responsibility of an
assessor, whose job would be somewhat similar to that of property tax
assessors. However, while property tax assessors specify the sale
value of land, the task of the assessor under a system of private
possession would be to specify the rental value that land would have
in an unimproved condition. </p>
<p>Agricultural land is rarely found in an unimproved condition,
except in places that have never been farmed, or have not been farmed
for decades. Therefore the task of the assessor of agricultural land
would entail making adjustments for any improvements to land such as
drainage, irrigation, fencing, fertilization, and removal of stones.
From an economic perspective, the return to these improvements is not
rent, but rather interest on capital that has been invested. Keeping
such returns untaxed ensured that those who possess land will have an
incentive to maintain those improvements and make any new
improvements that yield adequate returns.</p>
<p>To discover the rental value of agricultural land in an unimproved
condition, assessors would monitor land rentals in the vicinity. From
an agreed rental price, the assessor would subtract amounts for
interest and depreciation on any improvements to the land. What
remained would be the rental value of the land in an unimproved
condition. However, if the assessor believed that some improvement
added less to the rental value of land than its cost as measured by
interest and depreciation, then for that improvement he would
subtract not its cost, but his estimate of what it added to the
rental value of the land. </p>
<p>Because of the unpredictable value of the ruble, it would be
necessary to have rent vary with the value of the ruble, as measured
by some more stable currency. The Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and
the Deutchmark are the most stable international currencies, but
people are probably more aware of the value of the ruble in dollars.
Any of these could be used. When rent was due, the number of rubles
that would be owed would be the number that had the same value in the
specified currency as the rent that was assigned at the time of the
assignment.</p>
<p>The assessor would specify the manner in which the rent of land
varied with soil type, slope, proximity to roads and towns, and any
additional factors that seemed to have a systematic influence, other
than improvements to the land under consideration. Using such a
specification, the assessor would assign a rental value to every
parcel of land for which he was responsible. Rent per hectare would
vary continuously with natural advantages and location of land. The
assessor would be able to explain each assessment as the application
of a formula based on observed rentals.</p>
<p><a name="three" id="three"></a><b>III. The Question
of Tax Abatements</b></p>
<p>The Russian parliament has passed a law specifying that those who
start new farms will not be required to pay any taxes for five years.
The question of how this affects a system of private possession of
land must be addressed. Part of the answer is that payments to the
government for the use of land are not taxes, but rather rent, or
compensation to society for the use of what belongs to society. The
rest of the answer is that it may be appropriate to have an exemption
for some specified amount monthly rental value, from the requirement
that rent be paid. The rest of this section elaborates on these
ideas. A tax is a payment to the government, regulated by law, of
what would belong to individuals except that the government has
declared that it needs it. </p>
<p>Examples of taxes include excise taxes, sales taxes, income taxes,
payroll taxes, value added taxes, inheritance taxes, and property
taxes. Some payments to governments are in exchange for goods and
services that are provided by government and are not taxes. Examples
are transportation fares, telephone bills, water bills, and postage
payments. Payments of rent to the government for the value of land in
an unimproved condition should also not be regarded as taxes. This is
because the rental value of land in an unimproved condition is not
produced by the possessors of land.</p>
<p>There are two sources of the rental value of unimproved land: 1)
nature; 2) location value, arising from a) public services such road,
parks and transit facilities; and b) private activities that create
opportunities for surrounding land. For the rental value that is due
to nature, the proper allocation is either to the national government
or an equal division among all citizens of the nation, because no one
can claim this value by virtue of having produced it. For the rental
value that is due to public services, the proper allocation is to the
governmental organizations that provide those services. For the
rental value that is due to private activities, the proper allocation
is to those who undertake those private activities.</p>
<p>In the case of agricultural land, the rental value of unimproved
land is due to nature and locational factors. This revenue is
properly assigned mainly to the national government. However, in the
spirit of sharing the revenue, it would be proper to have an
exemption for some specified amount of rental value. Then farmers
would pay for the use of land only to the extent that the rental
value of their land in an unimproved condition exceeded the
exemption. Such payments would not be taxes, but only the allocation
of the rent of land to those to whom it should properly go.</p>
<p><a name="four" id="four"></a><b>IV. Freedom to
Transfer Titles of Possession</b></p>
<p>Proposals for systems of private ownership of land often include a
proposal that sales of land be prohibited for some period such as ten
years. That such a restriction would be proposed suggests that the
advocates of private ownership are aware of the impropriety of large
private gains from land speculation. But a temporary ban on sales
does not solve the problem of private gains from land speculation. At
best, it postpones it. If people are permitted to rent land out, they
can profit from this and then later sell the land. And when they do
sell it, very large speculative gains can occur. If they are not
permitted to rent land out, then the system implies that land cannot
be transferred to those who could use it best. Economic efficiency
requires that the right to use land be freely transferable. A system
of private possession permits free transferability without large
speculative gains. </p>
<p>If the assessment process is accurate, then in private sales of
titles of land possession, the price that will be agreed voluntarily
between the buyer and the seller will be the value of the
improvements to that parcel of land. If land prices were observed to
depart systematically from this norm, it would be an indication that
the assessment process was deficient. Therefore, under a system of
private possession of land, it would be appropriate to have no
restriction on the right of the possessors of land to sell titles of
possession for any price to which a buyer would agree. Such freedom
has two important advantages. It makes it possible to discover
whether the assessment process is working properly, and it makes it
possible for those who can make the best use of land to obtain
possession of land.</p>
<p><a name="five" id="five"></a><b>V. Market
Determination of the Sizes of Farms</b></p>
<p>When systems of private ownership are discussed, limitations on
the sizes of private farms are often proposed. The rationale for such
limits is that there is not enough land for everyone to have as much
as they want, so no one should be allowed to have an excessive
amount. Such a rationale makes sense, however, only if people with
much land have a special privilege, while those with little or no
land are unfairly deprived. Under a system of private possession, the
possession of a large amount of land would not make a person
privileged. It means that the possessor would be obliged to pay a
proportionately larger amount of rent year after year. And the person
with little or no land is not deprived, because he can obtain as much
land as he wishes by paying a purchase price corresponding to the
value of the improvements to the land, plus a monthly price to the
government of the rental value of the land. Therefore, under a system
of private possession, it is sensible to have no severe restrictions
on the amount of land that a person can possess. Farms will be of
whatever sizes are most efficient. Those who are highly capable
managers of land will tend to have very large farms. Those who are
less capable or less experienced will tend to have smaller farms. If
technological advances change the optimal sizes of farms, people
would make corresponding changes in the sizes of holdings without any
prompting from governments.</p>
<p><a name="six" id="six"></a><b>VI. The Absence
of a Termination Date</b></p>
<p>Proponents of having the government rent land out on leases
generally propose very long leases, often as long as 50 or 100 years.
The purpose of having a long lease is to ensure that tenants have the
chance to benefit from any improvements they make to the land. But
even a distant termination date creates problems with respect to
improvements. As the date approaches, the incentive to maintain land
diminishes further and further. A set of rules by which leases can be
renewed is helpful, but it raises further questions. How is the new
rent to be determined? Will it reflect the value of the improvements
that the tenant has made? If not, how will they be excluded? A
related problem that arises when the government rents land out on
leases is the possibility that economic changes will make the agreed
rent obsolete. If technological advances lower the market rental
value of land, tenants may seek to abandon land because their leases
will require them to pay too much. If population growth or other
changes raise the market rental value of land, then the low rent of
leases will constitute an unjustified windfall for tenants. Leases of
short duration reduce the problem of uncertainty regarding the future
market rental value of land, but they worsen the problem of lack of
incentive to maintain renter-owned improvements.</p>
<p>The system of private possession of land deals with these problems
by having no termination date and by providing for regular revision
of the rent. The absence of a termination date for possession creates
an enduring incentive to maintain existing improvements and invest in
new ones that are worthwhile. The regular revision of land rent,
under rules specified in advance and designed to identify market
rental value, ensures that there will be no incentive to abandon land
and no unjust enrichment of tenants.</p>
<p><a name="seven" id="seven"></a><b>VII. The
Importance of Implementing Other Agricultural Reforms</b></p>
<p>In order that agricultural land be used most efficiently, it is
important that other agricultural reforms be implemented. Farmers
should be allowed to grow whatever they want and sell it to whomever
they want, including foreigners, on whatever terms are mutually
agreed. The Russian government should import food only if the foreign
price, plus transportation cost, is less than the domestic price.
These measures are necessary to ensure that the best possible use is
made of the land and of the efforts of farmers. These measures will
also raise the rental value of land. Therefore, if they are going to
be implemented, it is important to implement them before the rental
value of agricultural land is determined.</p>
<p><a name="eight" id="eight"></a><b>VIII. Summary</b></p>
<p>Private possession of land is a form of land privatization that
combines the attractive features of rental and private ownership
without their disadvantages. The private possessors of land are
entitled to possess and use as much land as they wish for as long as
they wish and to transfer it to whomever they wish on whatever terms
are mutually agreed. This provides incentives for efficient
improvements to land. As a condition for continuing use of land, the
private possessors are required to pay its assessed rental value in
an unimproved condition to the local government. This keeps the price
of titles of possession down to amounts approximating the sale value
of improvements, eliminates the profit from land speculation, and
provides a source of public revenue. The public collection of the
rental value of land gives expression to the idea that land is the
common heritage of all generations. The rental value of land would be
determined by assessors, who would follow rental agreements and
relate the value of each parcel to agreed rental prices of near-by,
similar land, adjusted for the contribution of improvements to rental
value. Before an effort is made to measure the rental value of
agricultural land, there should be agricultural reforms to eliminate
all restriction on what farmers grow, who they sell it to, or what
prices they receive. And food should not be imported when it is
available domestically at a lower price.</p>
<p>Payments for the use of land would be classified not as taxes, but
rather as compensation for the use of common resources. Therefore
these payments would not be affected by the law specifying that
farmers are not required to pay taxes for five years. There could,
however, be an exemption for a modest amount of rental value of
land.</p>
