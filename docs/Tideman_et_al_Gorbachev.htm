  An Open Letter to Mikhail Gorbachev<br>
  </strong>signed by <a href="#Sincerely">30 American economists</a></p>
<p>November 7, 1990
</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Gorbachev:</p>
<p> The movement of the Soviet Union to a market economy will greatly enhance
  the prosperity of your citizens. Your economists have learned much from the
  experience of nations with economies based in varying degrees on free markets.
  Your plans for freely convertible currency, free trade, and enterprises undertaken
  and managed by individuals who receive the profit or bear the losses that result
  from their decisions are all highly commendable. But there is a danger that
  you will adopt features of our economies that keep us from being as prosperous
  as we might be. In particular, there is a danger that you may follow us in
  allowing most of the rent of land to be collected privately.</p>
<p> It is important that the rent of land be retained as a source of government
  revenue. While the governments of developed nations with market economies collect
  some of the rent of land in taxes, they do not collect nearly as much as they
  could, and they therefore make unnecessarily great use of taxes that impede
  their economies &#8212; taxes on such things as incomes, sales and the value
  of capital.</p>
<p> Social collection of the rent of land and natural resources serves three
  purposes. First, it guarantees that no one dispossesses fellow citizens by
  obtaining a disproportionate share of what nature provides for humanity. Second,
  it provides revenue with which governments can pay for socially valuable activities
  without discouraging capital formation or work effort, or interfering in other
  ways with the efficient allocation of resources. Third, the resulting revenue
  permits utility and other services that have marked economies of scale or density
  to be priced at levels conducive to their efficient use.</p>
<p> The rental value of land arises from three sources. The first is the inherent
  natural productivity of land, combined with the fact that land is limited.
  The second source of land value is the growth of communities; the third is
  the provision of public services. All citizens have equal claims on the component
  of land value that arises from nature. The component of land value that arises
  from community growth and provision of services is the most sensible source
  of revenue for financing public services that raise the rental value of surrounding
  land. These services include roads, urban transit networks, parks, and public
  utility networks for such services as electricity, telephones, water and sewers.
  A public revenue system should strive to collect as much of the rent of land
  as possible, allocating the part of rent derived from nature to all citizens
  equally, and the part derived from public services to the governmental units
  that provide those services. When governments collect the increase in land
  value that results from the provision of services, they are able to offer services
  at prices that represent the marginal social cost of these services, promoting
  efficient use of the services and enhancing the rental value of the land where
  the services are available. Government agencies that use land should be charged
  the same rentals as others for the land they use, or services will not be adequately
  financed and agencies will not have adequate incentive or guidance for economizing
  on their use of land.</p>
<p> Some economists might be tempted to suggest that the rent can be collected
  publicly simply by selling land outright at auction. There are a number of
  reasons why this is not a good idea. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, there is so much land to be turned
        over to private management that any effort to dispose of all of it in a short
        period would result in an extreme depression in prices offered. </li>
  <li>Second, some
          persons who could make excellent use of land would be unable to raise
    money for the purchase price. Collecting rent annually provides access to
    land
        for persons with limited access to credit. </li>
  <li>Third, subsequent resale of
      land would
            enable speculators to make large profits unrelated to any productive
      services they offer, resulting in needless inequity and dissatisfaction.      </li>
  <li>Fourth, concern
              about future political conditions would tend to depress offers.
    Collecting rent annually permits the citizens of future years to capture
    the
      benefits of good future public policies. </li>
  <li>Fifth, because investors tend
      to be
          averse to risk, general uncertainty about the future will tend to depress
          offers.
                This risk aversion is sidestepped by allowing future rental payments
          to be determined by future conditions. </li>
  <li>Finally, the future rent of
      land can more
                  justly be claimed by future generations than by today's citizens.
          Requiring annual payments from the users of land allows each year's
    population to claim that year's rent. While the proceeds of sales could be
    invested
            for the benefit
                  of future generations, not collecting the money in advance
    guarantees the heritage of the future against political excesses.</li>
</ul>
<p> The attached <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a> provides a brief technical discussion of issues of
  the duration of rights to use land, the transfer of land, the assessment of
  land, social protection against the abuse and subsequent abandonment of run-down
  property, and redistribution among localities to adjust for differences in
  natural per capita endowments. While these issues need to be addressed, none
  of them present insoluble problems.</p>
<p> A balance should be kept between allowing the managers of property to retain
  value derived from their own efforts to maintain and improve property, and
  securing for public use the naturally inherent and socially created value of
  land. Users of land should not be allowed to acquire rights of indefinite duration
  for single payments. For efficiency, for adequate revenue and for justice,
  every user of land should be required to make an annual payment to the local
  government, equal to the current rental value of the land that he or she prevents
  others from using.</p>

<p align="center"><br />
  <strong>Appendix<a name="Appendix" id="Appendix"></a> on Technical Issues</strong></p>
<p> All individuals and enterprises should have the right to continue using the
  land they have been using, for as long as they are prepared to pay the rent
  of that land. The amount of rent to be paid will vary as the economy evolves.
  As is traditional in countries with market economies, if land is needed for
  some public purpose such as a highway, the judicial process should guarantee
  the user fair compensation for any improvements that have been made in good
  faith. Every user of land should also have the right to transfer ownership
  of the improvements on the land, together with the right to continue using
  the land upon payment of rent, to any buyer on any terms upon which they mutually
agree.</p>
<p>  For the rent of land to be collected publicly, land must be assessed, and then
  reassessed regularly. The assessment process is simplified by the fact that
  land rental values tend to change smoothly with location. Initially, a map
  of the value of land can be made by auctioning scattered sites on a rental
  basis, and then interpolating for the value of other sites, based on the experience
  of Western appraisers and assessors regarding the manner in which the value
  of land varies systematically. To update assessments in future years, the assessment
  office would auction sites that had been relinquished by their users, or sites
  with improvements that were almost fully depreciated, that had been acquired
  in voluntary transactions. Interpolation would again be used to estimate the
rent of sites that had not been transferred.</p>
<p>  With all or nearly all of the rent of land collected publicly, it would be
  necessary to guard against the possibility that users of land with fully depreciated
  improvements would abandon their property, leaving the State to demolish the
  improvements in preparation for the next use of the site. This potential problem
  can be avoided by requiring every user of land to post a government bond as
  a &quot;security deposit&quot; that the land will not be abandoned in a run-down
condition. Interest on the bond could be applied to the annual rent.</p>
<p>  Collection of the rent of land is best managed by local governments, but
      justice, as well as efficiency in migration incentives, requires that the
      part of rent
    that is attributable to nature rather than community development be shared
    on an equal per capita basis. Thus there is need of clearinghouse mechanism,
    into which all localities would deposit collections of rent from nature in
    excess of the average per capita amount, and from which other localities
      would receive compensation for their deficiencies of rent from nature,
      relative to
    the average per capita amount.<br />
