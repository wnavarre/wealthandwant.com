TO ABOLISH UNFAIR TAXATION</span><br>
- by Clarence Darrow<br>
Attorney, Philosopher<br>
<font face="arial, helvetica" size="-1">An address before a Los Angeles
audience, delivered March 1913</font><font size="-1"><br>
[SMOG: 9.32]
</font></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Clarence Darrow of Chicago became known
and respected the world round as a courageous and intelligent foe of
special privilege and monopoly. 
His social and economic philosophy rested on the same basic principles
as those of Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln.<br>
</div>
<br>
Everybody nowadays is anxious to help do something for the poor,
especially they who are on the backs of the poor; they will do anything
that is not fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor a chance
to help themselves. The reformers in this state have passed a law
prohibiting women from working more than eight hours in one day in
certain industries &#8212; so much do women love to work that they must be
stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen see fit to come here and do
work, we send them to gaol or send them back where they came from.<br>
<br>
All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects by
curing the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the world is
the product of law, and you cannot cure it without curing the cause.
Lawyers, as a class, are very stupid. What would you think of a doctor,
who, finding a case of malaria, instead of draining the swamp, would
send the patient to gaol, and leave the swamp where it is? We are
seeking to improve conditions of life by improving symptoms.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Land Basic</span><br>
<br>
No man created the earth, but to a large extent all take from the earth
a portion of it and mould it into useful things for the use of man.
Without land man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor.
First of all, he must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to
until the single tax is applied. It has been proven by the history of
the human race that the single tax does work, and that it will work as
its advocates claim. For instance, man turned from Europe, filled with
a population of the poor, and discovered the great continent of
America. Here, when he could not get profitable employment, he went on
the free land and worked for himself, and in those early days there
were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and no extremely poor
&#8212; because there was cheap land. Men could go to work for themselves,
and thus take the surplus off the labor market. There were no beggars
in the early days. It was only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when
the earth monopoly was complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to
look to a boss for a job.<br>
<br>
All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely help the poor when the
earth is monopolized. Men must live from the earth, they must till the
soil, dig the coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise men know it,
and cunning men know it, and so a few have reached out their hands and
grasped the earth; and they say, "These mines of coal and iron, which
it took nature ages and ages to store, belong to me; and no man can
touch them until he sees fit to pay the tribute I demand."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pirates Demand Tribute</span><br>
<br>
Nature prepared the earth for ages to make a mine of iron ore, which is
so useful in civilized life. It was here before man came, and will be
here after he is gone, and yet a plundering, soulless, conscienceless
band of pirates, called the steel trust, have taken possession of all
the iron in America, and they say to every man who will use it: "You
must pay us tribute." And every time two dollars is paid for their
product one dollar goes to labor, and one dollar is taken as plunder
pure and simple, because of the foolish laws of man. They can take from
the farmer and laborer all that they earn except enough to keep them
alive still to toil for the monopolist.<br>
<br>
You may make eight-hour laws, you may make laws regulating sweat shops
and factories, but so long as a few rich men own the earth, there will
be a few rich and many millions of helpless poor. As population becomes
more dense, the proportion of poor will increase.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Unions</span><br>
<br>
The laboring man takes no account of fundamentals. Millions of working
men have organized themselves into great unions to protect themselves,
to force up their side to counteract the forcing up by the other side.
These millions have organized for a most impossible purpose. They seek
to change the social life in an impossible way. Their higher wages will
be handed back to monopoly in higher prices. If a small fraction of the
energy and money that has been given by the working men to support
labor unions had been spent to change fundamental conditions, there
would be no need of a labor union in the world today. Everywhere about
us we can see that the conditions cannot change while land monopoly
continues.<br>
<br>
Most of our laws were made by the dead, and the dead have no right to
legislate for the living. The present generation has no right to bind
its legislation upon the generation still unborn. When one generation
is dead, it ought to stay dead and not reach out its dead hand to bind
the living. We have no right to fix terms and conditions for those yet
unborn; it is for each generation to fix the rules and regulations for
itself. The earth should be owned by all men, the coal mines should
belong to the people who live here, so they can take what they want
while they live, as when they are dead they won't need coal  &#8212;  they will
be warm enough without it  &#8212;  and they should not have the power to say
who shall have it when they are gone. Carnegie and Morgan cannot use or
withhold it much longer, as they will soon be gone  &#8212;  that is one
consolation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eminent Domain<br>
<br>
</span>Fundamentally, all law recognizes the right to eminent domain,
to take
the portion of any human being for the welfare of the public &#8212; that no
man's claim to any portion of the earth shall stand in the way of the
common good. This is a common law, but in practice it only applies
where a rich railroad wants to get the land of some poor widow.<br>
<br>
Everybody who works is poor; nobody would work if they were not poor,
and nobody can get rich working. I never tried it, but I have seen
others try it. The land boomer comes along and gets good car service to
this poor man's home, and then charges him ten dollars per month
instead of five. A lot of reformers are trying to get parks laid out in
the slums, which only make the poor move, for they cannot pay the
increased rent. The greater the population, the less the worker gets.
As the land becomes valuable, more and more goes to rent. The bigger
the city, the deeper the poverty; the bigger the city the more
degradation, there are the almshouses and gaols filled to overflowing.
It is better for the men who own the earth to have big cities &#8212; but for
no one else. Every man, woman, and child adds to the wealth of the land
owner; the others must secure land upon which to live, and they must
bid with each other for the right to live.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Surplus to the Monopolist</span><br>
<br>
Beyond a living all surplus goes to the monopolist, and it does go to
him. You talk about a city of a million in 1915 &#8212; who would be
benefited? Not the workingman; he would be far worse off than at
present, for the greater the city the greater the poverty.<br>
<br>
Taxes on goods are added to the price of goods and passed on to the
consumer. There is only one kind of tax that is not a curse, and that
is the land tax. If you tax a pair of shoes a dollar, the manufacturer
will add that to the price of the shoes, and thus diminish the number
of shoes the people can buy. The higher you tax the land the more land
is thrown on the market and the easier it is to secure, and it is the
only thing that increases by taxation.<br>
<br>
The higher the tax on land the more it comes into use, and so "single
tax" is a positive blessing. It is the only tax that does not come out
of labor, it comes out of the monopolist; it stays right there, and
that fact compels them to put the land to some use, and that employs
labor.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Natural Fund</span><br>
<br>
The single tax theory is that the public should take all the value of
land, as it was made by the public. Land value goes up because of
population, and not because of the owner of the title deed, and the
value should be taken by the community, and thus create a natural fund
from which to make improvements for the comfort of all, and thus make
life easier. It would abolish poverty, that crime of the century, which
has always come with civilization; inequality of wealth, which comes as
the world grows older, and which we have never been able to cure,
because man wants to hold what he cannot use, and pass on to future
generations what they will not use.<br>
<br>
The personal property tax always was a delusion, a humbug, and a snare;
it never could be administered justly. The conscientious man, the widow
and the orphans (whose fund is in trust) pay in full while the rich get
off. It is unscientific, it is bad as a fiscal measure. What we are
after is the earth, and it can be had in an easy, simple, direct way.<br>
<br>
Every right-of-way of every railroad should be owned by the people; all
public franchises, every mine and every forest, all should belong to
the community itself. Then we would not need the repressive laws we
have today.<br>
<br>
Men love peace, and if not antagonized, they will behave, and until
justice is done in that good time to come, all the gaols on earth
cannot make them behave. It never did, and it never will.<br>
<br>
The "single tax" is so simple, so fundamental, and so easy to carry
into effect that I have no doubt it will be about the last reform the
world will ever get. People in this world are not often logical; in
fact, there is never any considerable number of them that are logical.
I am pretty sure the people will never get started in the right
direction; they will go a long way around.<br>
