<center><b>Fallacies of the Slippery Slope Argument</b></center>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">The author believes the "slippery

<p style="text-align: center;">by H. William Batt, Ph.D.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>About the Author</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Bill Batt holds an A.B. from the
University of Massachusetts and a
Ph.D. in Political Science from the State University of New York at
Albany. He was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand from 1962 to 1965.
He has taught at several colleges before joining the staff of the New
York State Legislative Commission on Critical Transportation Choices
and the Tax Study Commission. Since 1992 he has been a consulting
associate on matters of tax policy as they relate to transportation,
land use and the environment. For a decade ending in 1997, he was

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</p>
During the height of debate about American involvement in Vietnam,
the argument was frequently made that, if we didn&#8217;t stop the
communists in Southeast Asia, they would be at the shores of California
in five or ten years. The challenge to America, it was proposed, was to
stop the initiatives far from where there would be any danger
threatening to us, even at great cost, and even if the immediate threat
to us was inconsequential. You will recall this as the &#8220;domino
theory,&#8221;<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small>
one of the prime arguments for American involvement in
Southeast Asia. <br>
<br>
We often hear opposition to a policy proposal because it approaches a
practice that &#8220;down the line&#8221; we find abhorrent, even though there
is nothing particularly offensive about the proposal itself. The
English language is replete with metaphors about practices which, once
started, will evolve beyond the capacity of our own control. We speak,
for example, of chain reactions (here the reference obviously to
nuclear energy), or of things being inexorable or inevitable once
begun. The metaphors are usually mechanistic and from the physical
world, even when discussing political, economic, social or
psychological dynamics.
<br>
<br>
Consider some others which you will recognize immediately. We must be
wary of &#8220;letting the genie out of the bottle,&#8221; or allowing &#8220;the
camel&#8217;s nose under the tent,&#8221; or &#8220;opening Pandora&#8217;s box, &#8220;or &#8220;leading
[anyone] down the garden path.&#8221; So we must &#8220;nip things in the bud,&#8221;
because otherwise we will &#8220;open up the floodgates&#8221; and &#8220;if we give them
an inch, they&#8217;ll take a mile.&#8221; If you can think of others, let me know;
I&#8217;m making a collection of them. <br>
<br>
These are known in philosophy as wedge arguments.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> We&#8217;re
hearing them
more and more, perhaps because public policy
matters are framed by politicians and pundits in sound bite format.
Search &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; on the web and you&#8217;ll come up with hundreds of
hits. The arguments seem, on their face, difficult to answer, even if
we&#8217;re often nonetheless vaguely uncomfortable with them. What I hope to
do here is to explore in an analytic way what in these arguments is
sound and what is fallacious or preposterous. Some recent textbooks in
logic have taken pages to analyze these patterns of thought &#8212; but how
many of us have taken a course in logic recently! <br>
<br>
In the realm of science and technology, from which most such metaphors
are drawn, there is sometimes validity to this mode of explanation.
Consider, for example, what has happened &#8212; or almost happened &#8212; at
Chernobyl or at Three Mile Island! We see the same phenomena occur in
the spread of disease and particularly now with computer viruses, which
have so many of the same attributes as biological diseases. <br>
<br>
The metaphor of the slippery slope itself comes of course from
landscaping, where mud or grass is so slick that one is hopelessly lost
once one has passed over the brink or the slide downhill has started.
More about this later. <br>
<br>
There are people who believe that the social world is just as
determined and fated as the world of physics. But for the most part
we live our lives on the daily presumption that we do have choice over
matters and that we make choices as individuals and as a society. We
believe, for the most part, in the free will of people. Few of us are
doctrinaire behaviorists or determinists, and one is hard put to find
many social scientists or philosophers that defend such approaches to
explanation today. The behavioral sciences arose in an era dominated by
assumptions of natural law and later of reductionist positivism, but
philosophy has long since transcended the impasses which provided the
underpinnings of early social science. <br>
<br>
It becomes particularly remarkable, therefore, to reflect upon our
reluctance as a society to confront certain policy matters because
in the minds of some they would &#8220;open the doors&#8221; to other ethical
choices down the line. We do indeed have choices, both as individuals
and as corporate institutions. Yet rather than openly confront each
dilemma incrementally as mature and responsible adults, many would
close such matters from discussion entirely because it would &#8220;lead us
down the garden path&#8221; to some forbidden or dangerous realm or other.
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Creeping Socialism</p>
Consider some instances where the specter of the slippery slope has
often been invoked. We all are old enough to remember &#8220;creeping
socialism,&#8221; the conservative bugaboo which we thought died after
Goldwater invoked it to damn Johnson&#8217;s Great Society programs. <br>
<br>
There was a time in this country&#8217;s history when the general public was
largely incapable
of distinguishing socialism from communism. The first great Red Scare
was inspired by A. Mitchell Palmer, the
Attorney General of Woodrow Wilson in 1919 to 1921 in the wake of the
Bolshevik revolution. With time this philosophy came to be thought of
not simply as misguided but evil! F.A. Hayek&#8217;s book <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Road to Serfdom</span>, published in
1944, was a scholarly book, published by University of Chicago Press.
But it became a manifesto of the right wing, a credo of a reconstituted
19th century economic and political liberalism, unfortunately without
all the premises which accompanied early formulations of Adam Smith,
David Ricardo, James and John Stuart Mill, and yes, the culminating
champion of the classical economic tradition, Henry George. Ironically,
this was an age that believed in human perfectibility!
<br>
<br>
Fears of creeping socialism were revived during and after World War
II, leading to McCarthyism and destroying the lives and reputations
of many artists, writers and other public figures, particularly in
Hollywood. Certain organizations had a vested interest in maintaining
confusion between the free-market social welfare state and
state-communism. Hence, whenever programs of a social welfare nature
were proposed &#8212; even to address those elements of an economy understood
as &#8220;public goods&#8221; and &#8220;natural monopolies,&#8221; the specter was raised that
a coterie of treacherous plotters sought to transform the &#8220;American way
of life!&#8221; Adlai Stevenson&#8217;s comment summed up much of the final days of
this era with his comment that &#8220;There&#8217;s something else I dislike just
as much as creeping socialism, and that&#8217;s galloping reaction.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> I
thought the phrase had disappeared from the American lexicon, but a
search on the web site turned up several recent articles and news
releases, one from the Conservative News Service in Washington just
this past March. According to that article, &#8220;The greatest threat facing
the planet
today is not AIDS, overpopulation or global warming but creeping
socialism, according to a group of conservative women gathered in
Washington, D.C. this week for an international conference.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small>
Democratic governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina had his health care
proposals met with the editorial comment that "It&#8217;s time to call a halt
to the creeping socialism that threatens to destroy this nation one
program at a time. If the goal is to provide health care for children,
there are any number of ways to achieve that desirable end other than
implementation of yet another income redistribution scheme.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5 </span></small><br>
<br>
It appears that with the demise of the &#8220;cold war,&#8221; American politics is
struggling to rediscover its philosophical moorings; conservatives,
no longer able to invoke communism as a bugaboo, are reaching back to a
pre-industrial era of laissez faire capitalism and the nightwatchman
state. One new alarmist of the right is Balint Vaszonyi, a 1959 emigre
from Hungary who by popular demand has become almost a regular on
C-Span&#8217;s Washington Journal. Vaszonyi is an accomplished musician, the
former mayor of a
Midwestern city, and the author of America&#8217;s Thirty Years War:
Who&#8217;s Winning?<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6</span></small>
Emigres to this country from regimes formerly under the
shadow and control of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Cuba most
notably, seem often to have attained unassailable credibility as
political commentators. By their concentration in certain geographic
areas they have managed to hamstring the foreign policy in this country
in significant ways.
<br>
<br>
Witness most recently our government&#8217;s attempts to deal with Fidel
Castro. Members of Congress from Miami have held high cards in this
byplay. Government to them is not the protector of the public against
rapacious private interests, or the provider of services when the
market fails to deliver them. Rather government should be opposed
at any and all costs. (This presentation was pre-Elian Gonzalez.)
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Physician-Assisted Death</p>
The debate about physician-assisted death offers another
illustration. &#8220;Euthanasia,&#8221; taken from its Greek roots, literally
means &#8220;good death.&#8221; And what person wouldn&#8217;t wish for a good death!
Socrates&#8217; taking the Hemlock was an exceptional case only insofar as
the life he foresaw was not one of physical pain and suffering but
rather the loss of his identity as a person. He was, after all,
Athenian; to be banished from Athens deprived him of his selfhood, his
dignity, and the relationships on which everything in his life
depended. To lose his citizenship and be a &#8220;guest&#8221; in another city
was too undignified and compromising. Such a life was worse than
death, so at age 70 he chose to end it then. Crito, one of the
students, offered to arrange his successful passage to the city of
Thessaly, but Socrates declined. The Pythagoreans, a minority sect,
opposed suicide, but a far larger element of the population accepted
it. Herodotus, the teacher of Hippocrates, is known to have written
that &#8220;when life is so burdensome, death has become for man a
sought-after refuge.&#8221;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small>
Thucydides, Cleanthes, and Seneca also chose to
die by their own hand when their lives became difficult. <br>
<br>
Many western philosophers have written in support of suicide,
especially in the face of pain and suffering. In our own time
Aldous Huxley, Henry Pitney Van Dusen, Peter Sammartino, and, yes,
Jacqueline Kennedy Onnasis all chose to end their lives on their own
terms. Many suicides result from the failure to find a doctor
willing to quietly help ease the passage in the face of failing health
and continued suffering, and the job is often then botched. Van Dusen,
former president of Union Theological Seminary, ended his life together
with his wife, but the drugs didn&#8217;t work immediately and their final
demise was rather difficult. So also with Sammartino, the founder and
longtime president of Fairleigh Dickinson University and the driving
force for the restoration of Ellis Island, who shot himself and his
wife in their New Jersey home. Hearing these stories shocks us!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The thought that anyone would ever choose &#8212; in any circumstances &#8212; to
die rather than to live is deeply threatening to a sizeable element
of our population. Despite polls that show that a full 75 percent would
in certain circumstances condone physician-assisted death, even in fact
choose it for themselves in certain instances, the debate has been
muddied significantly wherever it has been put before the public.
Physicians have quietly helped patients to die for as long as modern
medicine has offered the choice, but many people believe that the
practice should not be legitimized, or sanctified, in law. Better it be
done quietly, that it remain illegal as a signal to all that such
practices are not to be condoned by society as a general rule. Yet
driving the practice under the table hides it from public scrutiny and
invites abuse.
<br>
<br>
Nowhere more in recent history has the metaphor of the slippery slope
been employed than by opponents of assisted death. It has been the
most effective argument in thwarting the passage of laws authorizing
such treatment. Ironically, most opponents of assisted death don&#8217;t
employ the arguments that are most personally compelling for them. For
conservative Christians, Orthodox Jews, and Roman Catholics, the matter
is more about who decides &#8212; premises about the nature of society, about
the relationship between man and God, and about the fallibility and
vacillation of human will that are the most convincing. But these
arguments are not employed in the realm of public debate, mainly
because their advocates recognize their often religious grounding and
that arguments before the public have to be made in secular terms,
without recourse to particular orthodoxies. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
The argument has been given newcolor by the recent appointment of
Australian Philosopher Peter Singer to be the DeCamp Professor of
Applied Philosophy in the Center for Human Values at Princeton
University. Not since the appointment of free-love advocate Bertrand
Russell to the faculty of City University of New York has there been so
much hubbub in academia. The Right-to-Lifers have been there picketing
daily for months, along with a disabled group called
&#8220;Not Dead Yet!&#8221; <br>
<br>
Steve Forbes, himself a Princeton grad who sits on the University
Board, has carefully refrained from getting involved in this one so
far. But he&#8217;s being pressed hard to take a position and get reversed
the decision on Singer&#8217;s appointment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">8 </span></small>What
is threatening about
Singer&#8217;s ideas, well articulated in over a
dozen books, is his view that quality, not simply the presence of a
heartbeat, should define the value of a life.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">9</span></small> It is
personhood &#8212; the
sufficient condition of humanness, not the biological dimension which
is only the necessary condition &#8212; that should be the mark of a human
being. His book almost from the beginning provided a new philosophical
foundation of the death-with-dignity movement. Hemlock Society founder
Derek Humphry is quoted on the cover of the hardback edition,
&#8220;Brilliantly debunks old concepts and introduces honesty to modern
medical ethics. [The book] is a blast of fresh thinking that will
attract great controversy and debate.&#8221; Indeed it did.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
In an earlier philosophic venture Singer already almost
single-handedly launched the animal liberation movement,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10</span></small> and
he now
was arguing that animals in some instances should be more highly valued
than human beings. A graded continuum rather than a sharp line should
define what kinds of lives have more worth. To many people,
creationists apart, this has become the ultimate slippery slope! To
them, if we&#8217;re not going to draw a bright line between human beings and
animals, and venerate human lives in an absolute way, then we are
indeed headed down a treacherous path. The argument about the validity
of the slippery slope argument has never been more sharply posed than
in the physician-assisted death and animal liberation movements. Yet
it&#8217;s not as if he&#8217;s said things that other philosophers have not said
earlier; it&#8217;s that he&#8217;s said them more clearly, more directly, and for
a more popular audience. This mild mannered philosopher has now had to
have armed guards when he goes about in public &#8212; a claim to notoriety
paralleled only by Salmon Rushdie!
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Gun Control</p>
&#8220;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed,&#8221; reads our Constitution&#8217;s 2nd Amendment. The Supreme Court
decided in the 1939
case, U.S. v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, that possession of a firearm is
not protected by the Second Amendment unless it has some reasonable
relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated
militia. The Supreme Court has stated that today&#8217;s militia is the
National Guard. Does this mean that only for purposes of maintaining a
militia shall the people have the right to bear arms? Or does it mean
people shall be free to bear arms of any kind, for any purpose, at any
time, in any place &#8212; beyond what any militia may require? We are
beginning as a society to face up to the challenge of exploring the
meanings, and indeed the wisdom, of the second amendment in a context
very different, and with instruments very different, than the framers
ever could have foreseen. <br>
<br>
It may be wise that the Court has sidestepped earlier chances to
further interpret the meaning of the 2nd amendment; after all, it
has no means of enforcing a decision, and defining a law that can&#8217;t be
enforced makes a mockery
of government authority. Still, a consensus may be forming whereby a
decision by the Court may
be acceptable. Public opinion polls show that more than 80 percent
of the general public is supportive of gun control laws. Many people
wonder what it is about the American psyche that makes us want to
fiddle so much with guns at all! Yet our witness of the passage of the
Brady bill in 1997 was an illustration of how a relatively innocuous
provision that would require the personal registration of handguns was
vehemently opposed less on the ground that it was a questionably
effective attempt to control the sale transactions of Saturday-night
specials than as a first step in the dismantling of our Constitution,
the first step by conspirators to establish a totalitarian
dictatorship, and the first step toward the eventual confiscation of
all firearms. Adherents are frequently heard on talk shows with the
argument that Nazism arose only after guns were confiscated in Germany.
We know the political power of the National Rifle Association, and its
ability to mobilize its members to shower Congress with messages at
strategic moments in deliberation. Interesting to me is the inability
of our leaders to articulate arguments that stand up to the arguments
of the NRA, arguments which, for the most part, invoke fears of the
slippery slope.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Explanation and Determinism</span>
<br>
<br>
The slippery slope metaphor is a form of an &#8220;if-then&#8221; claim: if X, then
Y. Of course in mathematics and in formal logic these statements
are ubiquitous. Even in the physical and biological sciences, research
has given us a body of knowledge and theory such that deductive
explanations are not only possible and enduring but necessary to our
ongoing reliance in applied technology. But philosophers question the
applicability of this so-called hypothetico-deductive model of
explanation to the social world; in fact few if any would hold such
views today. Yet, at the time when the study of societies first took on
institutional form about a century ago in the form of various social
science disciplines, so impressed were its founders with the successes
of natural science that attempts were made to emulate what were seen to
be its rigorous methods. Social sciences have never fully extricated
themselves from these faulty epistemological premises and
methodological assumptions.
<br>
<br>
Today we know that scientific research is not nearly so formal as
such models proposed, and we know also that analogizing human
behavior to that of protons or trees is a form of reductionism that
ignores significant dimensions of human nature. The word &#8220;law&#8221; applied
to human behavior has very different meanings than when applied in
physical science.<br>
<br>
Traffic laws are not like Newton&#8217;s laws. Human behavior is largely
rule governed, rules which are made by human beings in their social
capacity. Roberto Michel&#8217;s famous sociological &#8220;Iron Law of Oligarchy&#8221;
is not testable in any empirical way, and is true only in the general
sense that much wisdom of human experience acquires the nature of
truth. Laws of behavior explainable by deterministic forces of nature
are largely trivial in their importance. When they are employed, such
as in game theory for example, they illustrate more often the
dimensions of interrelationships by metaphor than by any inviolate
deterministic patterns.<br>
<br>
To be sure, such metaphors applied from animal to human behavior have
achieved a certain popular fashion today, particularly in the works of
people like E.O. Wilson, Daniel Dennett, and Richard Dawkins.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11</span></small> But
it
is notable that philosophers of social science have kept their distance
from such works. Applying if-then models to human behavior is
accomplished by essentially eliminating whole dimensions of humanness,
and is reductionistic in its explanatory power. Human laws, rather, are
human creations, and are mutable, tractable, and sometimes
indeterminate. <br>
<br>
Such an approach typically commits what Alfred North Whitehead called
the &#8220;fallacy of misplaced concreteness,&#8221; and what others have often
called the fallacy of reification. It is the mistake of attributing
concrete existence to that which has only essence, that which has
reality only in our minds. When human behavior is analogized and then
concretized in mechanistic terms, it eliminates the element of choice
and motive in our behavior. Although human behavior is largely
rule-governed, the consequence of our being socialized and acting as
members of a community and society, these rules are neither cast in
stone nor inviolable. They can be both changed and disobeyed.
<br>
<br>
There is nothing inevitable or inexorable about one choice leading to
another. It may in some instances have that effect &#8212; life goes on,
after all, and &#8220;one can&#8217;t step into the same river twice.&#8221; But
irreversible human choices are not the same thing as deterministic
slides.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Yet we have to ask, doesn&#8217;t one thing lead to another? Of course. But
this is not to imply there is a logical entailment between one
event and another. The slippery slope metaphor asserts that social and
legal policies, once put in place, lead inevitably and inexorably to
other social decisions. Decisions in law or in politics are not made
this way, when they are made at all. Rather they are made individually
and incrementally, with great deliberation by any number of leaders
reflecting general public sentiments. Anyone who has worked for
political and social change in our society knows full well that it is
inordinately slow. Decisions are checked and balanced, reviewed and
revised so often that commentators far more often speak of &#8220;deadlock&#8221;
and &#8220;gridlock&#8221; than they do of automaticity. There is seldom if ever
any logical entailment at all between social events. No person who has
ever worked in the arena of public policy would ever regard decisions
and trends as inevitable. Only in one special instance might it be
argued that there is ever the possibility of slippery slopes as applied
to social decision-making: that&#8217;s in the judicial policy of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">stare decisis</span>, or the recognition
of legal precedent.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">12</span></small>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Historical Perspective and Subjectivity</p>
A second assumption of the slippery slope argument is that history is
a down hill slide, that people in the past were perhaps stronger
and more noble than we are today. Contemporary society, far from being
the march of progress in this view, is just the reverse, and that
social changes that mark turning points of history really usher in
greater depravity. History is not progress but rather the fall from a
golden age. One might note the fallacy of such thinking by using as an
example the expansion of the voting franchise in America. At the
founding of our nation, only white propertied males over age 21 were
entitled to vote, but we have seen the expansion of this privilege to
gradually include
those without property, then to freed slaves, to women, and most
recently to those age 18 and over. Or consider the evolution of medical
treatment, or the expansion of educational opportunity. All slippery
slopes?
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Technological Dependence</p>
An argument can be made, however, that in one realm of experience
there is a linkage between one event or decision and another. This
is in the realm of technology. We can all recall when it was touch and
go whether 45 rpm records or 33 rpm records were going to become the
standard, or when the VHS videotape format was completing with Betamax.
We know what happens when one standard achieves a certain dominance: it
soon becomes ubiquitous. <br>
<br>
Economists describe the outcome of situations like this with terms like
&#8220;system scale economies,&#8221; &#8220;entry barriers,&#8221; and
&#8220;quasi-irreversibility of investment.&#8221; The monopoly dominance of
Microsoft&#8217;s products may be another such
instance. It has also been described as the QWERTY phenomena. As
the story goes, a Milwaukee printer named Christopher Latham Sholes
filed a patent for a mechanical writing machine in 1867, a project he
labored over for six years without much success from keeping the keys
from jamming. His machine had its type bars on the bottom, striking
upward to leave an impression on the paper. This arrangement had two
serious drawbacks. First, because the printing
point was underneath the paper carriage, it was invisible to the
typist. Second, if a type bar became jammed, it too, remained invisible
to the operator. Sholes
worked for the next six years to try to eliminate this problem,
trying mechanical changes and different keyboard arrangements. In 1873,
the Remington company licensed the design from Scholes, first using the
name &#8220;typewriter,&#8221; and using the same keyboard layout that Sholes had
originally designed. Remington changed the keyboard layout, but it was
too late: the earliest typists had already learned to use the Sholes
design. And we&#8217;ve been stuck with QWERTY ever since.<small><span

&nbsp;<br>
Consider another pattern, which I also owe to a web site.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span></small> The
US
Standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5
inches. That&#8217;s an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used?
Because that&#8217;s the way they built them in England, and the US railroads
were built by English expatriates. Why did the English people build
them like that? Because the first rail lines were built by the same
people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that&#8217;s the gauge they
used. <br>
<br>
Why did &#8220;they&#8221; use that gauge then? Because the people who built the
trams used the same jigs and tools that they used for building
wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Okay! Why did the wagons use
that odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing
the wagons would break on some of the old, long distance roads, because
that&#8217;s the spacing of the old wheel ruts.
<br>
<br>
So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in
Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their
legions. The roads have been used ever since. And the ruts? The initial
ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their
wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. Since the chariots were
made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel
spacing. Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United
State standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the
original specification for Imperial Roman army war chariots which were
made to be just wide enough to accommodate the back-ends of two war
horses.
<br>
<br>
Some explanations reflect downright corruption. The earliest cars
manufactured in this country and in Europe were electric;
streetcars also were largely electric powered until a conspiracy of the
automobile and petroleum industry exerted its force to ensure that
fossil fuel powered motor vehicles would dominate our transportation
and land use patterns.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span></small> Our
motor-vehicle-dependent and urban sprawl
configurations can be explained by powerful interests continually
pressing for policies to make us so. One might even conclude that the
decision to drive on the right side of the road was equally as much a
defining moment. <br>
<br>
And I hope that you will forgive me for mentioning another great
conspiracy in American history, the subject of my <a
 href="Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">Torch
presentation about four years ago</a>. That story recounted how the
American railroad industry, in collusion with the banks, induced the
founders of the American economics profession to change definitions and
formulas so that they would be relieved of taxation on their land
holdings and speculation would be rewarded.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small> This
dividing line
between classical and neoclassical economics is responsible I believe
for many of our economic problems today &#8212; economic cycles, an
inequitable
tax structure, poverty and unemployment, urban sprawl and the gutting
of urban centers. Only now is this economic ideology, almost sacrosanct
for a century, falling apart and seen for what it is. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Determinism or Perception?</span> But
are these examples illustrations of a slippery slope? I don&#8217;t
think so, because they are not decisions of social policy but rather of
technical standardization or refinement. Perhaps even the
evolution of firearms is an instance of the QWERTY phenomenon. One
could argue that these latter were right or wrong, but that&#8217;s a
separate question. Our views of social reality and its explanations are
colored very much by our philosophies, and this is never more true than
with respect to our evaluation of policy alternatives. If we are
opposed to a set of policy alternatives, we are frequently likely to
argue that their implementation is not simply a mistake of the moment,
but one with irreversible and far-reaching consequences. We marshall
all the evidence and arguments we can in opposition to these courses of
action, and, since they are policy options for the future, we envision
all the possible future problems inherent in their adoption. This is
true both of the right and the
left.
<br>
<br>
There is a difference, too, between explaining things historically
and attributing unilinear causality to social events. As it
happens, if our views of human nature and of social institutions are
colored by pessimism and if we believe that we human beings are by
nature self serving and rapacious, we are likely to have one view of
matters. If, on the other hand, our view of human beings, both
collectively and individually, is more optimistic and altruistic, our
conclusions will reflect this too.<br>
<br>
This has been borne out in several studies of personality and politics
over the years. People with a dim view of human nature are more likely
to see conspiracies and negative consequences to what is often
perceived as social
engineering. And people more trusting of others and of
institutional authority are less likely to be concerned about the
negative consequences of policy proposals.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> In </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">recent
years, those wearing the popular
appellation of &#8220;conservative&#8221; &#8212; at least in the American sense of the
term &#8212; are more distrustful of others, of government, and of
institutions generally. There is a further corollary to this as well:
that people who believe that human nature is inherently selfish will
tend to believe that their own selfish behavior is only natural, and
they will attribute the same low motives to others that they use to
justify their own behavior.
</span><br>
<br>
This further reinforces their own view that they are completely
justified in acting in the way that they do. Realizing that this is
the mentality that drives such people, those who take a more benign
view of human nature and of political institutions are then compelled
to find the motives of their opposites suspect and threatening.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small> So
such escalating distrust becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
I would like to illustrate the dynamics ofthis thinking through one
widely used psychological scale, used in countless studies over the
course of
some 40 years. It is known as the &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Faith
in People
Scale</span>,&#8221; originally developed in 1956 by Rosenberg.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">18</span></small> One
point is awarded for each scaled response. A score of five identifies
you as having a very low level of trust in others. I will read the five
paired statements to you, since they are very short: <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. Some people say that most people
can be trusted. Others say you can&#8217;t be too careful in your
dealings with people. How do you feel about it?</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&#8226; Most people can be trusted. &#8226; You
  can&#8217;t
be too careful.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. Would you say that most people are
more inclined to help others, or more inclined to look out for
themselves?</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&#8226; To help others. &#8226; To look out for
themselves.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">3. If you don&#8217;t watch yourself,
people will take advantage of you.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Agree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disagree</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">4. No one is going to care much what
happens to you, when you get right down to it.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Agree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disagree</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">5. Human nature is fundamentally
cooperative.</div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Agree &nbsp; &nbsp; Disagree</p>
So that&#8217;s what it may come down to, not to a matter of validity of
the slippery slope argument as measured in logical terms, but
rather by the extent to which social decisions are made by people who
can be trusted and relied
upon to act in altruistic ways. If people expect the worst, the
worst may happen. If people look on the positive side, that trust may
engender further such feelings and be self-reinforcing.&#8220;What goes
around comes around,&#8221; as they say, applied to both conservatives with a
dim view of human nature and society as well as to progressives with
their more hopeful view. <br>
<br>
There is a further dimension to all this which offers a fascinating
area for study. The faith-in-people scale along with many other
research instruments has been used in many societies and at various
times. But time has been too short in this
country for us to be able to say very much about what has happened over
the past 250 years with respect to public sentiments. The general view
is that people have become more cynical and pessimistic; what this
portends for America&#8217;s future, and particularly the future of our
political health, is well worth pondering. <br>
<br>
We used to be a nation of optimists, at least as other nations saw us.
That may have been our greatest asset. If we lose this optimism, we
may be the worse for it as a nation. And to this extent, our declining
view of
ourselves and our motives may be the ultimate slippery slope.
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Postscript</p>
I thought, because I just read it, I should add a postscript to this
piece that shows how much the slippery slope metaphor has crept
into our way of looking at things and affected our public policy
formation. Here I quote from
Saturday&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span>,
relating the work of a Professor of
Popular Culture Joe Austin at Bowling Green State University, whose
book <span style="font-style: italic;">Taking the Train</span> will
shortly be published by Columbia University Press: [New York] City
officials believed that if graffiti went unchecked it would signal a
general lawlessness and more serious crimes would follow. This is
sometimes called the broken-window thesis, popularized by James Q.
Wilson, now a retired professor at the University of California in Los
Angeles, and George Kelling of Rutgers University in a 1982 article in
<span style="font-style: italic;">The Atlantic Monthly</span>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small> &#8220;If
you allowed one window to break in a
neighborhood and it wasn&#8217;t repaired, people would think you can do
other acts of vandalism,&#8221; Austin explained. &#8220;Eventually this would
become, &#8216;It&#8217;s all right to mug and rape people,&#8217; and a general sort of
social chaos would ensue.&#8221; <br>
<br>
The article goes on to estimate that the city spent about half a
billion dollars between 1970 and 1990 trying to eradicate graffiti.
By the mid-80&#8217;s most of the graffiti on the subway cars was cleaned up.
Austin argues that crime on the subways during those 20 years did not
significantly decrease. &#8220;The correlation between graffiti and crime had
no basis,&#8221; he said. He pointed out that most experts don&#8217;t subscribe to
the &#8220;broken windows&#8221; hypothesis, holding the economy to be the dominant
determinant. But we did spend lots of money on a theory which had
nothing more than plausibility behind it.<br>

theory takes it name from the chain reaction effect created when one in
a line of standing dominos topples, bringing the rest down, one after
another. The concept arose during the 1950&#8217;s and was popular during the
sixties as the expression most representative of the basis for American
involvement in Southeast Asia at the time.&#8221;

<p>15 This is an untold story. A trial was held in a Chicago federal
  court in 1949, resulting in an indictment of GM, Firestone, Standard
  Oil, Phillips Petroleum, and Mack Trucks among others. Their crime
  was in forming a holding company called National City Lines which
  proceeded in the preceding decade to buy up the public transportation
  services in dozens of US cities, and then scrapping them so that
  people would then become more automobile dependent. The corporations
  were fined $5,000 each, and the CEOs of each one $1. See United
  States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, 93rd Congress, 2nd
