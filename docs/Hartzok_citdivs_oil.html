<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<b>Citizen Dividends and Oil Resource
    Rents</b></div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <div style="text-align: center;">A Focus on Alaska, Norway and Nigeria</div>
By Alanna Hartzok</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This paper was presented in the U.S.
Basic Income Guarantee
Network (USBIG) track of the Eastern Economic Association 30th Annual
Conference, held February 20 - 22, 2004, in Washington, DC.</p>
<p> <b>Abstract:</b> Citizens of Alaska have been receiving
individual dividend checks from an oil rent trust fund since 1982.
Norway's citizens receive substantial social services and invest
oil rents in a permanent fund for the future. Nigeria has yet to
establish a similar fund for its oil revenue stream. This paper
explores the oil rent institutions of Alaska, Norway and Nigeria with
a focus on these questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are citizen dividends from oil rent funds
currently or potentially a source of substantial basic income?  </li>
  <li>Are
oil rent funds the best source for citizen dividends or should CDs be
based on other types of resource rents?</li>
</ul>
The paper recommends full use of information and communication
technologies for transparency in extractive resource industries,
that resource rent from non-renewable resources should be invested in
socially and environmentally responsible ways and primarily in the
needed transition to renewable energy based economies, and that oil
and other non-renewable resource rent funds should transition towards
capturing substantial resource rents from surface land site values
(ground rent) and other permanent and sustainable sources of rent for
possible distribution of citizen dividends.
<p> <a name="ALASKA"></a><b>ALASKA</b></p>
<p> The Alaska state constitution claims common heritage rights of
ownership of oil and other minerals for the people of the state as a
whole. Citizen dividend checks are distributed every year in Alaska
out of the interest payments to an oil royalties deposit account
called the <b>Alaska Permanent Fund (APF)</b> created in 1976 after
oil was discovered on the North Slope. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
APF is a public trust fund
- a diversified stock, bond and real estate portfolio - into which
are deposited the oil royalties received from the corporations which
extract the oil from the lands of Alaska. </span>The first citizen
dividend
check from the interest of the APF was issued in 1982 and was for
$1000 per every person for everyone in Alaska who had resided in the
state for at least one year. Annual citizen dividends have been
issued every year since then, for a total of more than $23,000 per
person.</p>
<p> In 2003, each of the nearly 600,000 Alaska US citizens
(residents of Alaska for at least one year) received a check for
$1,107 from the APF. The total amount dispersed was $663.2 million.
The $25 billion investment fund's core experienced stock market
losses which led to the dividend's decline this past year compared to
the several previous years. The amount was $433 less, a 28 percent
drop from the 2002 pay out of $1,540, and a 44 percent decrease from
the all-time high of $1,964 in year 2000. The amount changes based
on a five-year average of APF investment income derived from the
bonds, stock dividends, real estate and other investments.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Alaska relies on oil for about 80
percent of its revenue and
has no sales or income tax.</span> Alaska state government is mandated
to
invest 25% of its oil revenue into the APF while the other 75% of oil
royalty revenue is dispersed to other government funds to finance
education, infrastructure and social services. If 100% of
Alaska's oil royalties had been deposited into the APF, it is
conceivable that the CD this year could have been about $4,400 or
$17,600 for a family of four. But then there would have been no
funds for roads, education and other public services and no funds
available to run the state legislature - a libertarian dream
fulfillment or a social and economic disaster, which one we will
never know. If state services were to have been maintained while 100%
of oil royalties were deposited in the APF, there would of course
have been the need for income, sales and other taxes on wages and
production.</p>
<p> At the end of the 2002 fiscal year, the state of Alaska had a
deficit of nearly $400 million. State lawmakers frequently debate
whether the APF should be used to help run state government, but the
Fund is protected by law from being used for government expenditures.
Rather than cutting into the Fund and citizen dividends, others are
proposing an increase in oil rents and royalties from oil
corporations.</p>
<p> On February 5th of this year of 2004, several Democratic
Representatives filed legislation to help Alaskans recover a fairer
share for their oil. That same week former Alaska Governors Jay
Hammond and Wally Hickel stated that it is time to review the
fairness of oil tax exemptions contained in a 1989 law known as
<b>"the ELF," or Economic Limit Factor</b>. Their viewpoint is that
ELF gives unjustified tax exemptions. The Alaska Fair Share bill
would redress the Economic Limit Factor and meet the constitutional
obligation to make sure Alaska's oil provides &sup3;the maximum
benefit to the people&sup2; as mandated by the state
constitution.</p>
<p> Because of the ELF statute tax breaks, Alaska&sup1;s oil
production tax rate has plummeted from 13.5% in 1993 to 7.5% today,
and by 2013, it would be down to 4% if the law is not changed. Also
because of ELF, 11 of the last 14 fields developed since 1989 pay
none or almost none of Alaska&sup1;s 15% Production Tax. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">While the
state&sup1;s share for Alaska oil has fallen, corporate oil profits
have soared. </span>BP and Conoco Phillips reported net earnings of $9
billion and $7 billion respectively last year. According to the
Department of Revenue, at recent oil prices of $30 per barrel the
annual share corporations receive for Alaska oil would exceed total
state oil revenue by $1.2 billion.</p>
<p> The Alaska Fair Share bill establishes a modest minimum
production tax of 5% and would raise an additional $400 million in
revenue this year. That approximates the current state budget gap.
The bill raises more at higher prices per barrel, and an additional
$100 million at average prices, according to the Department. The bill
also lets the state share in profits above $20 per barrel by slowly
increasing the severance tax above that price. To encourage
development, the Alaska Fair Share bill reduces the severance tax
rate at low prices, when companies face the prospect of reduced
profits, and possible investment losses.</p>
<p> Passage of the bill would alleviate state government expense
shortfalls, and would possibly result in higher citizen dividend
payments as more funds would be deposited into the APF. We cannot
predict this for certain, however, as the CD&sup1;s come from the
investment portfolio interest, are averaged over a five year
investment period, and determined by the portfolio performance.</p>
<p> We do know that due in large part to the citizen dividend
payments combined with the happy consequences of no state income or
sales taxes, Alaska is the only state in the United States where the
wealth gap has decreased in the past decade. The citizen dividends
from the APF are an important and significant source of income,
especially for rural families maintaining more land based
subsistence lifestyles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <a name="NORWAY"></a><b>NORWAY</b></p>
<p> Norway, one of the world's richest economies, is a model of
prudent economic management of resource wealth. So states the IMF
2000 Article IV consultation with Norway. Norway is the top non-OPEC
oil exporter, the world's third-largest exporter of oil, and pumps
about 3.2 million barrels per day. Norway's oil and gas industry
underpins the economy, providing up to 25% of the country's gross
domestic product. This country of nearly four and one half million
people has a steady growth rate, almost no poverty, and negligible
unemployment. Norway has a diverse economy based on agriculture,
forestry, fishing and manufacturing, among other things, and its oil
industry has developed amid much planning, bargaining, and public
debate.</p>
<p> The most recent U.N. Human Development Report ranks Norway the
number one place in the world to live, based on a cocktail of
indicators about health, wealth and social outlook. Nearly 1% of GDP
is spent each year to fight global poverty and enhance peace. Oslo
often plays a mediating role in foreign conflicts, from efforts to
reconcile North and South Korea to the now foundering Middle East
peace process. Norway has created an economy that retained its
progressive tax structure, re-invested its oil profits throughout the
economy, and saved money to cushion future market shocks.</p>
<p> Norway struck oil in the North Sea in the 1960s. Norwegians'
best defense against the decline of the industry that has made it the
world's fourth-wealthiest country is the State Petroleum Fund which
is managed by the national Norges Bank. Parliament created the oil
fund in 1990, but the state had its first budget surplus only in
1995. Until then, oil income was used to pay down Norway's staggering
foreign debt from the tough years before North Sea riches could be
exploited. A substantial amount of the profits from the exploitation
of a resource that is viewed as belonging to all Norwegians, not just
the current generation, is invested in foreign stocks and bonds. The
state-owned fund guards against spending too freely on public sector
services in boom years so as not to lay off droves of state workers
when the economy goes bust.</p>
<p> The Petroleum Fund is an instrument designed to prevent
Norway&sup1;s sub-stantial oil profits from being taken too rapidly
into the economy. State bank officials and government leaders believe
that dispersing oil revenues directly would overheat the Norwegian
economy and suppress private sector growth. Their view is that the
resource rent collected from the sale of their natural wealth of oil
should be conserved.</p>
<p> Norway has extracted only about 30% of its known oil resources
in the three decades and reserves are expected to last 40 more years.
But the oil that's left is mostly in depths, distances and quantities
that make its extraction less likely to produce profits of the
magnitude to which the country has become accustomed.</p>
<p> From the perspective of some, Norway focuses more on how to
administer and distribute the assets already acquired than on how new
value is to be created. There are generous benefits for both men and
women of eight weeks' vacation, liberal sick leave and day care that
is reliable and inexpensive. Three-year maternity leaves, broad
part-time opportunities and creative application of telecommuting
help keep women in the work force. State assistance to single
mothers is so generous that there is no need for a father's
income.</p>
<p> Norway&sup1;s State Petroleum Fund is now worth about $60
billion. Many of Norway&sup1;s citizens fail to see why they should
pay some of Europe's highest tax rates when Norway's crude output is
worth about $7,000 a year for each citizen, about one fourth of per
capita GDP of $28,433. If the $60 billion is invested for a rate of
return of 10%, then each Norwegian citizen could receive $1333 as an
annual CD. The state&sup1;s priority instead is to conserve and build
the Fund and funnel fund revenue into social benefits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <a name="NIGERIA"></a><b>NIGERIA</b></p>
<p> Two thousand years ago, Pliny the Elder wrote that the two
greatest curses of civilization were the discovery of silver and
gold. Perhaps oil and gas should be added to the list of natural
wealth that ends up damaging more then helping people in many parts
of the world that are rich in subsoil resources. This has certainly
been the case in Nigeria.</p>
<p> There have been 28 wars waged in Africa in the past three years
over the control of mineral resources, many of them in West Africa.
Conflicts in Nigeria have been ongoing since oil was first discovered
four decades ago. Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation &shy;
home to more than 130 million people, or one-sixth of the population
of the African continent. The giant of West Africa, Nigeria has half
the area&sup1;s population and one of its most highly educated
workforces. Nigeria is the fifth-largest supplier of oil to the
United States. The Bush administration has recognized African oil as
a key US strategic interest as the country seeks more stable sources
of petroleum outside the turbulent Middle East.</p>
<p> Nigeria is potentially Africa's richest country. As the world's
sixth largest producer of crude oil, with huge reserves of mineral
and agricultural riches and manpower, it should be enjoying some of
the highest global living standards. But it has some of the lowest
living standards in Africa. Surveys conducted by Nigeria's Federal
Office of Statistics show that in a 16 year period between 1980 and
1996, Nigeria's poverty level rose from 28 to 66 percent. GDP per
person in 1982 was $860, in 1996 it as $280, and now reported to be
$290. Numerically, while 17.7 million people lived in poverty in
1980, the population living on less than US $1.40 a day, rose to 67.1
million by 1996. </p>
<p> Northern and southern Nigeria are essentially two different
countries. Some view the oil producing region of the Niger Delta in
the south as a sort of internal colony of Nigeria. Home to 15 million
impoverished people, the Niger Delta region produces 90 percent of
Nigeria's wealth. Under the swamps and mangroves of one of the
world's richest ecosystems lie vast reserves - an estimated 40 more
years of crude and a century of natural gas. The first oil was
produced here in 1956. After 40 years of production, there are rutted
roads, decrepit schools, few health clinics, no conduits for running
water, and polluted creeks and farmlands. There have been dozens of
oil spills and gas flares spew carbon dioxide 24 hours a day. The
Niger Delta is one of this country's poorest regions, despite its oil
wealth. Most people are struggling to survive on less than $1 a day.
Away from the main towns there is no real development, no roads, no
electricity, no running water and no telephones.</p>
<p> Most of the oil that has earned Nigeria close to US$340 billion
since production began over four decades ago has come from the Niger
Delta onshore sites. Some put the number at $300 billion with about
$50 billion &sup3;disappeared overseas&sup2; meaning stolen by
corrupt officials. Shell and other western oil companies extract oil
worth an estimated $150 billion a year in recent years from the area.
A rough estimate is that Nigeria earns some $10 billion every year
from oil.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Based on Nigeria&sup1;s 1988
population of 100 million, if
Nigeria had distributed the entire $340 billion it has received in
oil exploration up until year 2000, over a forty year period, the
citizen dividend per person per year would have been about $85.</span>
Based
on the figure of $10 billion that Nigeria earns every year from oil
and a current population of 130 million, distributing the full amount
as citizen dividends would yield about $77 per year per person. Based
on oil extraction worth of $150 billion a year from the area, and a
resource rent of 10% (or $15 billion) charged by the Nigerian
government, the annual citizen dividend would be about $115 per
person per year.</p>
<p> As noted earlier, GDP per person in 1982 was $860, in 1996 it
had fallen to $280. Based on the current GDP of $290, adding the
$115 dividend, would bring the income per person per year to $405.
For a family of four, that would be $1620 per year with the dividend
($1160 without the dividend). Based on the GDP per person in 1982, a
family of four would have earned $3440. That same family in 1982 with
the dividend of $85 added would have had $3780. While a
citizen&sup1;s dividend in Nigeria would mean a significant increase
in annual income, one must note the vastly more substantial decrease
in GDP from 1982 up until this time.</p>
<p> After the discovery of oil and with the high exchange rate of
US petrodollars compared to Nigerian nairas, palm oil, ground nuts
and other previous export products of Nigeria were for the most part
eliminated. Nigeria&sup1;s economy had been mostly subsistence
agriculture and fishing, and with the collapse of their few export
commodities, the economy took a nosedive for most Nigerians.</p>
<p> <b>What has become of Nigeria&sup1;s oil wealth?</b> Nigeria
was rated the world&sup1;s most corrupt country (out of 52) by
Transparency International&sup1;s Corruption Perception Index. Much
has been made of the fact that money generated from Africa's oil
reserves has been lost in corruption, mismanagement and violent
conflict. In Nigeria, an estimated $4 billion in government funds was
stolen by the dictatorship of General Sani Abacha in the 1990s. Some
estimate that as much as $50 billion in oil revenue has been stolen
since Nigeria first began production.</p>
<p> Faced with severe balance of payments problems in the mid
1980s, the then military ruler, General Ibrahim Babangida, adopted
International Monetary Fund and World Bank advised structural
adjustment programs. The key objective was to ensure that Nigeria
serviced its external debt of US $28 billion and maintained
macro-economic stability, while cutting back on social spending.
Starved of funds, social service institutions began to decay and
service delivery in schools and hospitals sharply declined. The World
Bank estimates that public spending per capita on health is less than
$5 and as low as $2 in some parts of Nigeria, contrary to $34
recommended for low-income countries by the World Health
Organization. Infrastructure and utilities began to collapse.</p>
<p> Comparing the $4 billion stolen by Abacha to the $28 billion in
external debt that Nigeria was forced to pay by the IMF/WB advised
structural adjustment programs, it seems that a case could be made
that the greater crime can be found in the neoliberal economic
system. As has happened to many other third world resource rich
countries, government leaders were urged to use the oil and mineral
wealth royalty payments to secure loans for their countries and to
buy military equipment and other foreign made commodities. Then the
accumulated debt was called in on the backs of the people as a
whole.</p>
<p> The IMF and WB could have insisted that a transparent oil rent
fund similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund be established as a
condition for loans. The fact that the international banking
institutions did not act in a responsible manner by promoting
transparent public finance institutions and socially just structural
adjustments programs but instead put countries into odious debt lends
credence to the position that these institutions were established to
maintain the predominance of the US dollar as the major global
currency over and above any humanitarian or even good governance
objectives.</p>
<p> What might happen to the people of Nigeria in the years ahead?
President Obasanjo and his administration intend to increase
Nigeria's oil reserves to 50 billion barrels by 2010 and to raise its
production capacity to five million barrels per day by 2010.
Confirmed offshore oil deposits has increased from about 30 percent
of the country's total reserves in 1997 to about 50 percent today. As
Nigeria moves closer to the reserves and production targets set by
Obasanjo, this percentage is likely to increase to more than 70
percent. Since oil production for Nigeria is set to move increasingly
offshore of the Niger Delta, people in the region are concerned that
they will be left behind once again with no share of the federally
controlled oil wealth. Nigerians would be wise to revamp and
diversify their economy sooner rather than later.</p>
<p> Given the extent of the corruption, violence, destruction and
environmental devastation, perhaps the people of the Niger Delta
should make a hard push for the federal government and the oil
companies to repair and restore their land and water and then look
forward to a new day of sustainable development based on renewable
sources of energy and their own capacity for self-directed
development. Any oil resource rents that they can draw down from the
federal government or finagle directly from the oil companies might
better be directed towards capping and tapping the dozens of natural
gas flares to provide an energy source for the region that will help
it transition to renewable energy of wind, solar, and
microhydropower.</p>
<p> Additionally, transparent, interest free (perhaps a 2%
management fee only) revolving loan funds for ecovillage and
sustainable development projects could be established with the oil
revenue, either managed on the federal level or via separately
mandated funds on the state level. Thus the oil revenue would be used
for internal development projects, not invested externally as is the
case with the Alaska and Norwegian permanent funds. As these projects
proceed, and the economy gently expands, land values will rise and
these funds could then transition towards a surface land rent and
distribution fund. A portion of these funds could then be distributed
as citizen dividends.</p>
<p> Let us note here that land based taxes and land value recapture
policies are recommended in the 1996 Action Agenda of the UN Center
for Human Settlements, a document agreed to by all UN member states.
The approach was also strongly promoted by ecological economist
Herman Daly of the University of Maryland in a very important speech
that he gave to the World Bank on April 30, 2002. Although Professor
Sala-i-Martin at Columbia University recently wrote a paper advising
the World Bank to help establish a fund in Nigeria similar to the
Alaska Permanent Fund, those of us who have been advocating for a
Niger Delta Fund are now thinking that a sustainable development
focus would be better than using the oil revenue for citizen
dividends in terms of overall wealth creation for the region.</p>
<p> Nigeria newspapers earlier this week gave us some positive and
hopeful stories. President Olusegun Obasanjo has fully endorsed the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and has
inaugurated the National Stakeholders Working Group, a 28-person team
which will work to publish all payments made by and to its
multi-billion dollar oil industry. Obsanjo wants to hold to account
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and its international
partners, including Chevron Texaco and ExxonMobil, the Anglo-Dutch
major Shell and France&sup1;s Total. </p>
<p> President Obasanjo also said that whatever resources the
country gets from extractive industries should be invested in
&sup3;renewable and non-depleting aspects of our national economy.
What we should, of course, not do is, advertently or inadvertently,
waste these resources because...they are not renewable.&sup2; He
further stated that &sup3;apart from being non-renewable, I have said
on a number of occasions that what God has put in the soil for
Nigerians are put in the soil for past, present and future
Nigerians... therefore, those of us who are managing it must manage
it for all Nigerians - past, present and future. And we cannot do
that unless we are transparent...&sup2;</p>
<p> Other good news out of Nigeria this past week is that Obasanjo
signed into law the Allocation of Revenue Act 2004 which abolishes
the dichotomy between onshore and offshore oil production in respect
of the principle of derivation for the purposes of allocation of oil
revenue accruing to the Federation. This announcement was received
with jubiliation in the Niger Delta states where state officials
described it as a victory for the &sup3;down-trodden people of the
Niger Delta.&sup2;</p>
<p> All of this is also very good news for those of us working to
secure resource rents for the people worldwide and to underpin our
political democracies with earth rights democracy ethics and
policies.</p>
<p> As the world turns, in a case being investigated by the US
Justice Department and the FBI, it is alleged that Halliburton paid
over $100 million to bribe Nigerian oil ministry officials and $200
million to bribe government officials surrounding the award of the
Nigeria Liquefid Natural Gas project between 1995 - 2002. A
Halliburton spokesperson said the company has handed over documents
to the Justice Department but insisted that the company did no wrong.
She said that Halliburton always maintains the highest ethical
business standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a name="CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER ENVI"></a><b> CLIMATE CHANGE
AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS</b></p>
<p> Some environmentalists raise the concern that citizen dividends
and social services based on petroleum and other nonrenewable
resources rents makes it that much more difficult to shift to
renewable sources of energy. Alaskan representatives frequently have
voted to open up the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and other areas
for more oil drilling. This writer&sup1;s first response to this
concern is that if citizens do not get a rightful share of these
resource rents, then corporations will capture even greater amounts
of surplus profits. While this is true, we need to look at the issue
in a holistic way.</p>
<p> From the vantage point of a planetary civilization, we clearly
need to shift to renewable energy sources. There is clear and
compelling scientific evidence of of global warming. Climate change
is one of the most pressing environmental problems of our time.
Carbon dioxide and other gases released by fossil fuel consumption
and deforestation is trapping heat in our atmosphere for 100 years or
longer, with devastating environmental consequence. It is time to go
full throttle in addressing this enormous challenge.</p>
<p> We need to use oil resource rents to shift to renewable energy
and sustainable economies. Both the Alaskan and Norwegian petroleum
funds invest in stocks, bonds and real estate. Interest from these
investments are distributed as citizen dividends in Alaska and for
social services Norway. The priorities of the fund portfolios need to
be scrutinized and revamped. Currently the investment portfolios are
mandated to follow the &sup3;prudent investor rule&sup2; meaning that
managers must find the balance point between highest profits and
lowest risks. Fund investments are not based on or screened for
socially and/or environmentally responsible criteria. </p>
<p> Furthermore, those of us working for a full range of resource
rents as the basis for earth rights democracy view oil rent fund
investment in real estate worldwide as an expropriation of surface
land resource rents from other nations and thus are not a just source
of interest income for the citizens of oil rent fund countries like
Alaska and Norway.</p>
<p> The Alaskan and Norwegian funds, and the Nigerian fund if it is
established, needs to have socially and environmentally responsible
criteria. Investments should be made in renewable energy - wind,
solar, green hydrogen, microhydropower - and in reforestation and
other environmental restoration activities. A portion of the funds
should be made available as interest free (suggested 2% - 3%
management fee) revolving loan funds to people in developing nations
to help finance their efforts for sustainable development.</p>
<p> A criteria of the loans should be that the communities receiving
the loans begin implementing surface land value (ground rent)
recapture in their towns, regions and nations. Land value based
resource rent funds, if full ground rent is collected for the people
as a whole, promotes land reform and affordable land access for
current and future generations in addition to generating funds for
public benefits and citizen dividends.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> In the US about one half of corporate
profits comes from real
estate related activities so we know that resource rents from surface
lands could be a substantial source of funds for basic income and
citizen dividends. In addition to land sites, rents from the
electromagnetic spectrum, water power points and satellite orbital
zones should be sourced for citizen dividends in the future.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
<p><a style="font-weight: bold;" name="KEY RECOMMENDATIONS"></a><b> KEY
RECOMMENDATIONS</b></p>
<p> In concluding this consideration of oil resource rents as a
basis for citizen dividends and basic income payments, here are three
key recommendations:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> (1) full use should be made of
information and communication
technologies for total transparency in revenue raising and
expenditure on the part of both government and extractive resource
industries, as modeled by the Alaska Permanent Fund and promoted by
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> (2) resource rent from non-renewable
resources should be
invested in socially and environmentally responsible ways and
primarily in the needed transition to renewable energy based
economies; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> (3) oil and other non-renewable resource
rent funds should
themselves transition towards capturing substantial resource rents
from surface land site values (ground rent) and other permanent and
sustainable sources of rent, such as hydropower points,
electromagnetic spectrum and satellite orbital zones.</p>
