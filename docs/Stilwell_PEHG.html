POLITICAL ECONOMY OF LAND: Putting Henry George in His Place</span><br>
Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan<br>
<font size="-1">The Journal of Australian Political Economy, December 2004.<br>
JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL ECONOMY No 54, p. 120<br>
</font></div>
<br>
Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the
form that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes
is integral to the production of the means of our subsistence. Its use
in an urban context is crucial in shaping how effectively cities
function and who gets the principal benefits from urban economic
growth. Its ownership is a major determinant of the degree of economic
inequality: surges of land prices, such as have occurred in Australian
cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions of wealth.
In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and nature more
generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological sustainability.
Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land
question.&#8217;<br>
<br>
These considerations indicate the need for a coherent political
economic analysis of land in capitalist society. Indeed, the analysis
of land was central in an earlier era of political economic analysis.
The role of land in relation to economic production, income
distribution and economic growth was a major concern for classical
political economists, such as Smith, Ricardo and Malthus. But the
intervening years have seen land slide into a more peripheral status
within economic analysis. Political economists working in the Marxian
tradition have tended to focus primarily on the capital-labour relation
as the key to understanding the capitalist economy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">1</font></span></small>
Neo-classical economists typically treat land, if they acknowledge it
at all, as a &#8216;factor of production&#8217; equivalent to
labour or capital, thereby obscuring its distinctive features and
differences.&nbsp; Keynesian and post-Keynesian economists have also
given
little attention to land because typically their analyses focus more on
consumption, saving, investment and other economic aggregates.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">1 A significant contributor to
the analysis of land and rent within the Marxian tradition is David
Harvey (see, for example, Harvey, 1982: 330-367). However, it is
notable that Harvey comes from a background in geography, not economics.</font></small></div>
<br>
However, there is an alternative current of political economic thought
for which &#8216;the land question&#8217; is central. This is the tradition based
on the ideas of Henry George. This article seeks a balanced assessment
of the usefulness of George&#8217;s ideas in the modern context. It outlines
how insights derived from Georgist thinking can help in dealing with
contemporary economic, social and environmental problems, while noting
deficiencies and additional concerns. Following a <a
 href="#George_and_Georgism">general summary of Georgist ideas and
policy proposals</a>, six themes are addressed: 
<ul>

</ul>
In each case it is argued that Georgist insights provide a valuable but
incomplete basis for analysis and policy.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="George_and_Georgism"></a>George
and Georgism</span><br>
<br>
What are the key ideas advanced by Henry George and promoted by his
followers? Like Marx&#8217;s analysis and the political movement he inspired,
George needs to be understood in historical context. Although not a
trained economist, his ideas gained widespread currency in economic
debates throughout much of the Western world in the late nineteenth
century. Also like Marx, his analysis stemmed from both ethical and
economic considerations. He was primarily concerned with exploring the
reasons why poverty and destitution coexisted with economic growth, and
saw the root cause of these problems in the prevailing policies towards
land. It is this focus on land, contrasting with the Marxian focus on
capital, that is the characteristically Georgist emphasis.<br>
<br>
George saw land as a community resource provided by nature, to which
every human being had an equal right. He argued that, since land was
fixed in supply, the system of private land ownership allowed the
wealthy few to enjoy exclusive rights to land and its benefits, while
alienating the poorer majority from land ownership and forcing them to
pay rent to landowners in order to access this necessary resource.
Moreover, the collection of rents by landowners allowed them to
increase their wealth without contributing to the productive efforts of
society. As the population grew, so too did the demand for land,
forcing rents and land values ever higher. In addition, increases in
land value resulting from publicly-funded developments, such as roads
and public transport systems, unduly benefited landowners at the
expense of the community. Such unearned gains from landownership
encouraged speculation in land, pushing prices even higher, while
exposing the economy to the risks of speculative &#8216;booms&#8217; and &#8216;busts&#8217;.<br>
<br>
One might expect such arguments to have led to the advocacy of land
nationalisation. But George thought this unnecessary because a tax on
land could be effective in capturing the economic surplus arising from
land ownership. This tax would generate all the revenue necessary to
fund public expenditures. George thought that such a land tax would
permit the removal of other taxes on labour and capital, which he
regarded as inherently inefficient. He argued that taxes on incomes,
sales, and payrolls, for example, acted as disincentives to production
and active endeavour, thereby stifling economic growth and creating a
barrier to full employment. A land tax, by contrast, would be both
economically efficient and more equitable in its distributional effects.<br>
<br>
George&#8217;s advocacy of replacing all existing taxes with a single tax on
land values was powerful. He argued that this tax would redistribute
the wealth that would otherwise accrue to private landowners, forcing
them to repay the community for their exclusive use of a public
resource. Moreover, such redistribution would reduce wealth
inequalities and allow massive improvements in welfare provisions and
public services. In addition, removing taxes on labour and capital
would boost economic growth and provide a stimulus to employment.
Conversely, taxing land values would reduce speculation in land and
depress land prices, allowing greater access to landownership while
reducing economic instability.<br>
<br>
The publication of George&#8217;s major treatise, <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span>,
in 1879 stimulated widespread interest. Supporters emerged throughout
the Western world, roused by George&#8217;s explanation of wealth
inequalities and inspired by his proposed solution of a single tax on
land. However, this initial wave of interest subsided, and George&#8217;s
ideas have been almost universally ignored in &#8216;respectable&#8217; economic
circles during the last century. They have been accorded the status of
a historical curiosity, at best (see, for example, Heilbroner, 1968:
166-73). But a Georgist movement advocating a land tax has persisted
and the last few years have seen a partial resurgence. While still
ignored by the economic orthodoxy, interest in George&#8217;s work has been
stimulated by modern concerns about housing affordability and
environmental decay. Such revival of interest recognises that these
problems stem, in part, from inadequate policies relating to land. Some
members of Green parties, in particular, have embraced Georgist ideas.<br>
<br>
Not all those attracted to Georgism embrace the extreme single-tax
position. A more pragmatic position emphasises retaining a mix of
different taxes but putting more emphasis on land tax revenues and less
on income, consumption, payroll and other taxes. In the Australian
context a pragmatic Georgism emphasises:
<ul>
  <li>aligning the rates of land taxes currently levied by the State
governments so as to eliminate inter-State variations in the tax scales;</li>
  <li>removing the existing exemption from land tax for owner-occupied
property;</li>
  <li>ensuring that all rate revenues generated by local governments
are based on unimproved capital values, ie. on land values only, not
including the value of any property on that land;</li>
  <li>combining these State and local revenue-raising measures into a
more comprehensive nationally uniform land tax system;</li>
  <li>incrementally raising the rate of land tax and making
corresponding reductions in taxes on income, consumption, employment,
capital gains (other than gains arising from land values) and stamp
duties.</li>
</ul>
These reforms would comprise a radical restructuring of the tax system.
There is little prospect of the major political parties embracing it <span
 style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> in the foreseeable future.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> But
whether is it a worthwhile direction for reform in the long-term
warrants careful consideration. This requires attention to the
fundamental principles of a Georgist political economy.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">2 However, it is pertinent
      to
note some support from an
otherwise unlikely source &#8211; the Federal Government&#8217;s Productivity
Commission. Its recent report on First Home Ownership (2004) explores
the case for shifting from stamp duties to higher land taxes.</font></small></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<a name="The_Moral_Issue"></a>The Moral Issue</span><br>
<br>
Georgism has a distinctive ethical basis. So a review of the
contemporary relevance of Georgist political economy can usefully begin
by making this explicit. The key moral issue is the private
appropriation of public wealth. As George recognised, land is a &#8216;gift
from nature&#8217; and, as such, is rightfully a community resource. Hence,
those deriving benefits from the private ownership of land should
recompense the community for the privilege. This principle has strong
echoes of the idea of &#8216;usufruct&#8217;, a pre-capitalist term denoting a
person&#8217;s legal right to use and accrue benefits from property that does
not belong to them. In return, the user is obliged to keep the property
in good repair and pay all costs as a &#8216;ground rent&#8217; (&#8216;Lectric Law
Library, n.d). The concept of &#8216;usufruct&#8217; has fallen out of common
usage, so one hesitates to try to revive it. Moreover, as Richards
(2002) notes, &#8216;it is difficult to image how this word could be
employed, or brought back into circulation, in the modern world, since
we live in a world in which people tend to be remarkably unsympathetic
to the property rights or claims of others&#8217;.<br>
<br>
However, the principle of &#8216;usufruct&#8217; goes to the heart of the question
of how best to balance collective and individual rights and interests.
George&#8217;s solution of a tax on the value of land squarely addresses this
issue. By returning a proportion of the land value to the community in
the form of taxation revenue, restitution would be paid for the use of
a community resource. This is an ethical justification for land
taxation.<br>
<br>
Indeed, one could say that the term &#8216;tax&#8217; is a misnomer because what is
really involved is value created by the community being retained by the
community rather than being appropriated by private landholders. For
example, under current arrangements landowners receive &#8216;windfall&#8217; gains
when the market value of their land rises as a result of publicly
provided infrastructure being built nearby, or when local government
zoning decisions reclassify their land as appropriate for further
development. In this way, individual landowners stand to reap huge
benefits at the expense of community-generated processes. Such
arrangements create an odd incentive: allowing landholders to
appropriate the unearned wealth generated by rising land values,
thereby rewarding this unproductive activity, while taxing productive
endeavour. The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217;, by contrast, would eliminate
such perverse incentives and thereby more effectively align private and
public interests in the use of society&#8217;s resources.<br>
<br>
However, the Georgist position cannot claim to provide a fully
comprehensive solution to the moral issue of balancing individual and
collective rights. While land tax addresses the private appropriation
of wealth from land, it does not address the appropriation of wealth
from other sources. The characteristically Georgist focus on land as
the source of the maldistribution of wealth is limiting in this
respect. Political economists have long argued that the accumulation of
capital also arises from the exploitation of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">labour</span>, for example. Whether the
exploitation of labour is systemic, as Marx argued, or exceptional is
properly a matter of debate. Either way, the point is that an ethical
basis for the economic system, and for the tax system in particular,
needs to take account of both land-related and other sources of
unjustifiable wealth appropriation. The moral issue thereby links with
a second concern of more explicitly economic character &#8211; the sources of
inequality in the distribution of wealth.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Wealth_Inequality"></a>Wealth
Inequality<br>
<br>
</span>Georgist analysis strongly emphasises landownership as a
principal source of inequality. Because land is a strictly limited
resource, its private ownership necessarily excludes large sections of
the community from its benefits. A landowning class thereby gains
political economic power. In George&#8217;s own time the social identity and
power of this landowning class was distinctive. Those who could not
afford to buy land were forced to pay rent to the wealthier few who
could. By taxing the value of land, George posited that publicly
created wealth could be recouped from the private landowners and
redistributed throughout the community more equitably in order to
address social goals.<br>
<br>
Are George&#8217;s arguments about land ownership and wealth inequality
relevant today? Australia provides an interesting example, because land
is the single largest item in national wealth. Laurie Aarons outlines
the concentration of farming land in particular in the hands of a few
very wealthy corporations and individuals &#8211; what he refers to as
&#8216;corporate squattocracy&#8217; (Aarons, 1999: 23). The relentless increase in
urban land values in recent years has also produced dramatic
redistributions of wealth. In the State of New South Wales, for
example, land values increased by about $361 billion over the period
1993 &#8211; 2003. The existing land-based taxes clawed back only $44 billion
in government revenues, comprising only about 12% of the land-related
economic surplus. So 88% was retained as &#8216;unearned income&#8217; by
landowners (Stilwell and Jordan, forthcoming). A higher rate of land
tax with fewer exemptions could have substantially reduced this private
wealth appropriation. This is not necessarily to posit the desirability
of recouping 100% through land tax, because that would certainly raise
major problems of people&#8217;s ability to pay, given that much of the
increased wealth resulting from land price inflation has not been
realised as current income. But it is indicative of the current
imbalance between private and public appropriations of the surplus
arising from increases in land-based wealth.<br>
<br>
However, it is also pertinent to note that land ownership today is
significantly less concentrated than in George&#8217;s time, with around 70%
of Australians being home-owners (including those in the process of
purchasing their homes with mortgage finance). According to the recent
Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey,
home-ownership is unevenly distributed between income groups, with 56%
of households in the lowest income quintile owning their own homes,
compared to 85% of those in the highest quintile (Kohler et al, 2004:
10). But this distributional inequality is significantly less marked
than the ownership of other assets, such as shares for example. Of
course, most land ownership for residential purposes involves very
small tracts, typically only about one-sixth of an acre in the suburban
areas of the major cities. Flat-owners, growing annually as a
proportion of the population, usually own less land and do so more
indirectly through strata property titles. So the form of land tax
(that is, whether flat rate or on a progressive scale, whether applying
to all land or only that above a &#8216;threshold&#8217; value, or exempting
owner-occupied property) becomes crucial to its effectiveness as a
mechanism for tackling distributional inequality. It is also crucial to
the political acceptability of land tax reform.<br>
<br>
In addition, it is apparent in modern economies that not all
socioeconomic inequalities stem from the unequal capture of the
economic surplus associated with land. Inequalities are also generated
by unequal access to capital, educational and employment opportunities.
These inequalities are imperfectly correlated with wealth deriving from
land ownership. Hence, additional means of redress are needed, as J. K.
Galbraith and other institutional economists have consistently argued
(e.g. see Galbraith, 1992; 2002: chapter 3). For example, &#8216;floors,&#8217; such
as minimum wage requirements and &#8216;social security&#8217; payments,
must
be provided to guarantee a minimum income to all members of society,
including those excluded from the production process. A strong, albeit
unfashionable, case can also be made for &#8216;ceilings&#8217; to limit excessive
salaries, such as those of some top corporate executives, which far
outweigh their productive contributions to society. The average
executive remuneration levels in major Australian companies increased
from 22 times average weekly earnings to 74 times average weekly
earnings in the period 1992-2002 (Shields et al, 2003: iii). It may be,
as George argued, that &#8216;the increase of land values is always at the
expense of the value of labour&#8217; (George, 1966: 224) but the complex
distributions of income received by capital and labour are not readily
explicable in terms of an analysis focusing exclusively on land.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Housing_Affordability"></a>Housing
Affordability</span><br>
<br>
A third aspect in this &#8216;stocktaking&#8217; of the relevance of Georgist
analysis and policy to contemporary political economic conditions
concerns the persistent problems of housing affordability. The
difficulty of purchasing, or renting, affordable housing has reached
social crisis proportions in many large cities around the world. In
Sydney, for example, a median-priced house could be bought for just
under four years of average Australian earnings in 1986, but an
equivalent house in 2003 cost over twelve years&#8217; worth of earnings
(Stilwell, 2003). This constitutes an enormous barrier to
home-ownership for a younger generation, a problem that both Federal
and State Governments have sought to redress by the provision of first
home-buyers&#8217; subsidies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> It is
not typically the house itself that has been the cause of the
inflation, but the price of the land on which it stands. So, looking at
the situation from a Georgist perspective immediately directs our
attention to how the demand and supply of land affects housing
affordability.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">3 These subsidies can have
counter-productive effects to the
extent that they increase demand and therefore the price of housing.
See, for example, the Report of the Productivity Commission Inquiry
into First Home Ownership, (2004: 71-73). </font></small></div>
<br>
The demand for land involves both use values and exchange values.
People seek land because the housing built on it provides shelter and
security, but they also purchase it as a store of wealth and a means of
capital appreciation. A particularly important driver of real estate
prices has been the speculative demand, as investors seek capital gains
in the property market. In Australia, this has been such common and
longstanding practice that it has been referred to as &#8216;the national
hobby&#8217; (Sandercock, 1979). By &#8216;creaming off&#8217; a part of this potential
capital gain, a higher uniform rate of land tax would act as a
disincentive to this property speculation, and could therefore be
expected to exert a downward influence on property prices. Georgists
have always been emphatic that land taxes are different from other
taxes in this respect &#8211; they depress prices because they reduce demand.
So the usual fears that a tax will be &#8216;passed on&#8217; to customers (such as
housing tenants, in this case) do not apply.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> By
making land less attractive as an item to be purchased in the hope of
making capital gains, land tax can therefore be an important check on
the inflationary process.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">4 This issue is discussed in
more detail in Gabbitas and Eldridge (1998: 151-154). The Productivity
Commission Staff Research Paper written by these authors suggests that,
while passing on the tax is unlikely to occur in the short term, in the
longer term supply-side responses may shift some of the burden onto
subsequent buyers and/or users of the land.</font></small></div>
<p>  However, while a higher uniform land tax could be an important
component in a policy addressing housing affordability, it seems
unlikely to provide a complete solution. The severity of the housing
problem in Australia, for example, also derives partly from the
dwindling supply of public housing. Public housing is now less than 5%
of the total housing stock and falling (National Housing Alliance,
2004: 5). Governments have withdrawn funds from public housing and
tightened entry requirements (for example, lowering the threshold for
the means test). This has caused public housing waiting lists to
lengthen and put greater pressure on the private rental sector. More
and more people have been forced into circumstances of significant &#8216;housing stress,&#8217; paying
a third or more of their net income for housing (Hawtrey, 2002), and further
adding to inflationary pressures
on housing prices.<br>
<br>
There is a potentially important link between these concerns &#8211; land tax
and public housing &#8211; because a higher, more uniform land tax could
generate revenue to finance a significantly larger public housing
sector. That would, in effect, kill two birds with one stone, providing
the twin basis for an assault on the problem of housing affordability.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Environmental_Concerns"></a>Environmental
Concerns<br>
<br>
</span>What about the relevance of Georgist ideas to current concerns
with environmental quality and ecological sustainability? Here too
there is a strong claim to consider. Interest in Georgism has been
reinvigorated in recent years by the need to develop public policies
that reflect the nature of land as a finite natural resource. From a &#8216;green&#8217; perspective,
land tax is a useful tool in discouraging the excessive and wasteful use of land.
That is, the prospect of paying a
high rate of land tax can be expected to discourage people from
purchasing more land than they need directly for their own purposes. It
accords with the principle that people should be taxed according to
their use of scarce environmental assets. <br>
<br>
This &#8216;ecological take&#8217; on Georgism is particularly powerful at a
time
of intensifying global environmental problems and recognition of the
need for remedial policy responses. It requires creative extension of
Georgist principles because the limitation of George&#8217;s own analysis in
this context is its primary focus on land. A range of other natural
resources needs to be considered, linking up with the broader concerns
of modern environmentalists such as Herman Daly (see, for example, Daly
and Cobb, 1990). Hence, land tax should be seen as an adjunct to taxes
on 
the use of other scarce environmental assets, including mineral,
forestry and fishing stocks, and also bandwidth for radio and
telecommunications, for example (Stilwell, 2002: 316-317). It should
also be seen as a corollary to other taxes that discourage
environmental damage, including resource rental taxes, carbon taxes and
fuel excises.<br>
<br>
The case for these environmental taxes need not necessarily rest on
Georgist principles, of course, but Georgism can claim to provide a
unifying analytical framework. A common feature of &#8216;environmental
taxes&#8217; is that they are all targeted, like land tax, at reducing the
scope for profiting from the private appropriation of natural
resources, and thereby restricting the profligate use of those
resources.<br>
<br>
A tension remains, reflecting the Georgist orientation towards taxes
rather than more directly regulatory interventions. Whether the use of
the price mechanism in this &#8216;environmental fine tuning&#8217; is sufficient
for dealing with pervasive environment threats is a moot point. The
nature and severity of environmental stresses is such that more
directly proscriptive environmental policies are commonly needed to
protect natural resources. The creation and maintenance of national
parks, for example, constitutes a necessary direct regulation of
land-use: the market, even when modified by taxes, cannot absolutely
guarantee the conservation of such crucial assets. In other words,
protection of &#8216;natural capital&#8217; may commonly require regulation as
well
as taxation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Urban_Development"></a>Urban
Development</span><br>
Concerns about urban policies also raise questions about the current
relevance of Georgist ideas. For example, it is pertinent to ask
whether a more uniform land tax would encourage the more efficient
utilisation of urban space. George argued that, in order to cover the
costs of a higher rate of land tax, landowners would be forced to put
their land to its most productive use, and could not afford to hold it
idle. Here is a clear link with the modern concerns to discourage &#8216;urban sprawl&#8217; and to promote &#8216;urban consolidation.&#8217; To
the extent that a higher land tax would encourage the development of more housing
in
existing urban areas, the pressures for housing development in outlying
areas would be significantly reduced. This, in turn, could reduce the
burgeoning demand for transport that is currently characteristic of
large cities.<br>
<br>
Land tax also impacts on the <span style="font-style: italic;">politics
</span>of peripheral urban expansion. Currently, the prospect of huge
capital gains resulting from decisions by local governments to rezone
land from rural to urban acts as an incentive for landowners on the
fringes of built-up areas to lobby for changes that will allow
increased development. Hence, landowners push for rights to
subdivision, irrespective of whether or not there is actual demand
(Day, 1995: 3). By creaming off the gains from windfall increases in
land values, land tax obviates this bias towards relentless urban
expansion.<br>
<br>
However, the question remains: would a uniform land tax be sufficient
to produce more efficient patterns of urban development? Or would there
still be a need for direct land use controls? Land tax can certainly be
a tool for discouraging the wasteful use of land. It tends to
discourage people from purchasing excessive amounts of land or leaving
it idle. However, it may also encourage the overdevelopment of land in
order to produce the income stream necessary to pay the higher rate of
tax.<br>
<br>
Critics of urban consolidation such as Patrick Troy (1996) have
examined the potential problems of such overdevelopment, including a
range of environmental impacts such as altered hydrological processes.
It seems to be an overly bold claim that a Georgist land tax alone
would be sufficient to achieve optimal urban development patterns. Land
use controls a necessary adjunct to land tax - in setting minimum
requirements for green space, for example. <br>
<br>
Local government planning controls are also important to prevent
incompatibility of land uses, such the development of hazardous or
unhealthy industrial activities adjacent to residential areas. Targeted
decentralisation policies are a means of encouraging the further
development of regional centres. Such policies can work in conjunction
with land taxes to ease growth pressures in the larger cities, while
addressing long-standing spatial, social and economic inequalities
(Stilwell, 2000: 254-260). The desirability of promoting more
decentralised regional development is consistent with a Georgist
perspective, but not altogether compatible with the claim that land tax
would facilitate urban consolidation. It seems clear that it &#8216;overburdens&#8217; land tax to expect it alone to produce the best spatial
outcomes, taking account of all the economic, social and environmental
issues involved in urban and regional policy. The various other policy
instruments &#8211; including regulations relating to green space, zoning,
and the provision of public infrastructure to pave the way for
decentralisation &#8211; are important complements to land taxation. In other
words, land tax is best regarded as a necessary but not sufficient
condition for more effective spatial policy.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Economic_Cycles"></a>Economic
Cycles</span><br>
<br>
Georgists have also frequently claimed to be able to explain and
ameliorate, even resolve, the cyclical character of the capitalist
economy. George argued that a higher uniform land tax could reduce the
severity of booms and busts in the housing market by reducing the
speculative investment in land. This would produce more stable economic
conditions throughout the economy, removing the boom-bust cycle to
which capitalism is otherwise prone. It is an argument that has
contemporary Australian relevance because the boom-bust character of
the urban property market is clearly a significant factor in overall
cyclical economic instability. An earlier article on Australian land
price trends by Kavanagh (2001) has illustrated this connection,
demonstrating that, while the property market is more volatile than the
economy as a whole, there has been a clear temporal connection between
the two patterns of cyclical behaviour over the last half century.
Property booms and busts have typically coincided with swings in
overall national economic performance. The policy implication is that,
by smoothing out cycles in the housing market, a uniform land tax could
help to avoid periodic crises in capitalist economies more generally. <br>
<br>
However, the argument needs to be kept in perspective. Periodic
economic recessions cannot be solely attributed to speculation in land.<br>
<br>
Inadequate levels of aggregate demand, problems of overproduction, and
problems of instability in financial markets are among other causes of
interruptions to the process of capital accumulation. Land tax cannot
feasibly claim to redress all the systemic contradictions and
malfunctions of a capitalist economy. Additional counter-cyclical
policies are necessary. These include macroeconomic stabilisers, such
as monetary and fiscal policies, that can contribute to reducing the
cyclical tendency to which the economy is otherwise prone, along with
incomes policy and the more radically interventionist &#8216;socialisation of
investment&#8217; that Keynes (1936: 378) advocated. So here, too, land tax
seems to have the status of a necessary but not sufficient condition
for progressive economic reform.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</span><br>
<br>
Enthusiastic proponents of Henry George&#8217;s ideas have often presented
them as a panacea for the economic, social and environmental problems
that beset contemporary society. Indeed, the Georgist analysis does
have much to offer. By more adequately addressing land as a unique
economic, social and ecological resource, it can help to reveal
underlying causes of currently pressing issues such as declining
housing affordability, growing economic inequality, and environmental
decay.<br>
<br>
The Georgist land tax &#8216;remedy&#8217; can also play an important role in the
redress of these problems. However, there are limitations to the modern
application of George&#8217;s ideas, as outlined in this article. While a
uniform land tax is a necessary component in addressing contemporary
political economic problems, it is not sufficient. It needs to be set
in the context of a broader political economic analysis and policy
program, also addressing public housing, urban and regional policies,
environmental taxes and regulations, &#8216;floors and ceilings&#8217; to limit
income inequalities and macroeconomic stabilisation.<br>
<br>
While the Georgist analysis redresses the general neglect of land in
modern economic orthodoxy, it is important not to go too far to the
other extreme. In other words, the important emphasis on land should
not come at the expense of attention to problems associated with labour
and capital and to the complex forms of government policy necessary for
the balancing of contemporary economic, social and ecological concerns.
The Georgist analysis needs to be integrated into a comprehensive
political economic analysis of contemporary capitalism.<br>
<br>
So what does &#8216;putting Henry George in his place&#8217; entail? It means
recognising the political economic importance of land and the potential
social gains from the extension of land taxation. Equally, it means
recognising the necessity of relating Georgist ideas and policy
prescriptions to a broader canvas of modern political economy,
including the analytical traditions associated with Karl Marx, J. M.
Keynes, and J. K. Galbraith, and modern environmental economics. Henry
George&#8217;s place is in good company.<br>
