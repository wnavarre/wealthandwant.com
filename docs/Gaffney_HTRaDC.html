<b>How to Revive a Dying
City</b><font size="+1"><b><br>
</b></font>Mason Gaffney
</center>
<blockquote><i>Following is an edited text of the 1988 Henry George
Lecture, presented in October by Dr. Mason Gaffney at St. John's
University in New York City. Gaffney is a Professor of Economics at the
University of California at Riverside. Henry George was an economist of
the late nineteenth century, whose views still influence debates on
property taxation.</i></blockquote>
<p><b>Introductory</b></p>
<p>My grandfathers saw New York City as the center of civilization.
It was a livable, optimistic place: a growing, vibrant,
trend-setting, prospering, cultural city. A little crooked, sure, and
great grandfather was probably no saint, paving streets for Tammany
Hall. But it had a present and future, a life and soul, not like the
hopeless despair of today's Bronx. </p>
<p>But we are here to talk of the future. I hope to see those good
times and better ones come again, preferably without the graft. And
we are here to review the ideas of another commuter between New York
and California, Henry George, and how his ideas might help to revive
dead cities. Henry George was a journalist who taught himself
economics. He had a flowing pen and a brilliant mind, and his book,
<a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b></a>,
remains the all-time best-seller
in economics (except for forced-sale items, like textbooks and the
Thoughts of Chairman Mao). People remember George, however, not for
the volume of his sales, but for his enduring ideas. The reform
program he developed combines incentive with justice. It comprises a
plan not just to revitalize cities, but to reunify society.</p>
<p><b>Dead and Dying Cities</b></p>
<p>Some extreme cases of moribund cities are East St. Louis, Robbins,
Harvey, and Ford Heights, IL; Camden and Newark, NJ; Benton Harbor,
MI; and Gary, IN. Large parts of many once-vibrant cities are half
dead, seriously blighted, and trending downwards. New Yorkers know
the South Bronx well enough to avoid knowing any better. In Milwaukee
it is the near north side, called locally the "inner core," a
galloping blight whose area has tripled in the last 20 years while
population has dropped. In Chicago it is South State Street, near the
Madison Street crossing which for generations was the most valuable
corner in the nation. </p>
<p>Blight is not restricted to stagnant or declining cities. In
booming Los Angeles, there is Watts. In nearby Riverside, one of the
fastest growing cities in the nation, the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">CBD [Central Business District]</span> is
surrounded by blight
which, among other things, frustrates years of subsidies aimed at
reviving the moribund CBD itself. </p>
<p>These extreme cases are not anomalies, not simply ghettoes and
embarrassments; <span style="font-weight: bold;">they are symptoms of
systemic malfunction</span>. They could
be portents and symbols for the rest of the economy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Blight may be
defined as failure to maintain, replace, and renew capital inherited
from the past. </span>Studies indicate that all of American industry
faces
this problem, compared with vigorous foreign competitors. In learning
to cure blight, we may learn to restore the greatness and pride of
this whole troubled nation.</p>
<p><a name="Cities That Have Revived"></a><b>Cities That Have
Revived</b></p>
<p>There is also good news: some cities have risen from the grave.
Indeed, all land development is resurrection in a sense: all land has
been used before for something. The history of a city lot usually
shows that there were several antecedent improvements, layered like
the ruins of ancient Troy. The goal should be to make renewal happen
faster and more widely, while we are still here to benefit. </p>
<p>Germany and Japan recovered from World War II with breathtaking
speed. Atlanta recovered from Sherman, albeit in its own courtly
time. Chicago burned in 1871, leaving 90,000 homeless, but recovered
without breaking stride. San Francisco and Anchorage recovered from
devastating earthquakes. Washington, D.C. recovered from the 14th
Street riots and arson. The basics were right; the locations remained
good. Disaster may even have forced "instant urban renewal," by
demolishing obsolescent capital and releasing land for rebuilding.
</p>
<p>Other revivals, while less dramatic and publicized, are more
impressive and relevant because they are revivals from normal decay
and obsolescence, pushed along by good public policy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Southfield</span>,
bordering Detroit, is thriving and flourishing as fast as its parent
central city is dying. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rosslyn, VA</span>,
across the Potomac from D.C., is
a forest of high-rises that rose while Washington was burning and
derelict in the 1960s. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sacramento</span>'s
once-depressing center has found
new life.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pittsburgh</span>, of grimy repute,
was recently named the most livable
U.S. city. Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taipeh, once best known as fetid
ports of call, are three of the "Four Tigers" of southeast Asia.
Local policies in these modern stories of economic success and social
revitalization show the hand of Henry George at work. In Taipeh, we
hear that they are guided by the philosophy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, a
Georgist convert. In Pittsburgh, we find a "graded tax plan" applied,
framed, and supported by the Henry George Foundation. Throughout
Pennsylvania, we see smaller cities emulating Pittsburgh's partial
application of George's policies; such cities bear close watching as
they bounce back.</p>
<p>Then there are cities with explosive growth after slow periods.
These include Sydney and Johannesburg, both notable for their use of
Georgist policies. Whatever their social faults, these cities have
burgeoned to become the economic capitals of their continents. There
are other examples in Africa, like Nairobi; and in the Antipodes,
like Brisbane and Auckland. Many cities of western Canada, including
Edmonton and Vancouver, grew with partial use of Georgist policies in
the early 1900s. Georgist policy was applied more informally (through
assessment discrimination) by San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, San
Diego, Houston, and other growing western U.S. cities during the same
period. </p>
<p>It is comforting to know that degeneration and failure are not our
predestined fate. We may choose them, but we may also choose renewal
and success. It is a matter of attitude and know-how.</p>
<p><a name="Why Cities Should be Revived"></a><b>Why Cities Should be
Revived</b></p>
<p>Some cities should be abandoned.</p>
<p>Towns around played-out mines are obvious examples. A farm town
becomes redundant when new roads let customers patronize a larger or
better town. Salvage what you can and move on. </p>
<p>Some would apply the same logic to all cities. Dead cities aren't
lost, they say, but rebuilt elsewhere; they were cash cows that have
been milked dry. Their depreciation allowances are reinvested on new
frontiers; people and vitality move with the capital. It is an
important half-truth, but a half-truth is also half wrong. The basic
original site stays put; land cannot move. Public and private social
capital cannot move, either. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">We cannot afford throwaway cities in a
finite world. New natural
sites are not common. There is only one Hudson Valley with only one
mouth, and here New York City has stood for 350 years. We cannot
abandon the Bronx and duplicate its environment somewhere; we cannot
rebuild the natural setting, and the sunk social capital is too
costly. Relocating to suburbs involves commuting cost in terms of
money and congestion. And then, when we tire of the new suburbs,
where will we go next?</p>
<p>Furthermore, blighted areas have high potential market values.
Picture a topographic map of a city where the contour lines represent
points not of equal elevation, but of equal market value per square
foot. The peaks, the Everests and McKinleys, are in the city retail
centers, where just one square foot rises to $2,000 (about $90
million per acre). Land just a few miles away from dizzying altitudes
can hardly be worthless. Harlem is near Park Avenue; Watts is near
Beverly Hills; South State Street is very near the Sears Tower.
Newark is 15 minutes by train from Manhattan. Newark office rents are
$25/sf per year. That is less, of course, than in Manhattan, but in
Riverside, California, we are throwing up offices to get rent of
$12/sf per year, while Newark stagnates.</p>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"

      <td

<p>Capital earning $25 is obviously more productive than that
yielding $12. I do not mean capital in the floor atop a high-rise,
which likely costs $25/sf (in annualized terms) to build and operate;
but capital in lower floors, which costs less to build but rents for
as much, yielding a surplus. To get more such capital and the
corresponding surplus, renew more land in high potential areas, like
Newark. Not to renew is to waste potential surpluses. Each year's
loss is gone forever; services of land perish with time. Urban
revival works best when healthy pieces remain on which to anchor
development. In the worst scenario no such place remains, but even
Camden has Campbell Soup; Newark has a great airport, a new Hartz
Mountain Industrial Park, and the Pru. Life is persistent and
resilient; seedlings that sprout seek only sunshine, water, and
cultivation.</p>
<p><a name="The Urban Surplus"></a><b>The Urban Surplus</b></p>
<p>One reason we remember Henry George is his pioneering study of how
cities work and the good they do. Previous economists showed limited
understanding of location value and its causes. Even von Thunen,
father of location theory, approached cities in an antiseptic way
that left out what today we call urban linkages and synergy. George
was a mensch, seeing cities in human, interactive terms. </p>
<p>George saw cities as <i>foci</i> of civilization's basic
mechanisms. People with mutual access, associating on equal terms,
expedite cooperation and specialization through the market.
Multivariate interactions are synergistic. Indeed, while each parcel
is developed in the stage of decreasing returns, the composite city
is generally in a stage of increasing returns, thanks to synergy: the
whole exceeds the sum of its parts, and increases to the whole yield
more than the sum of increases to the parts. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Synergistic surplus</span>,
said George, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">lodges
in urban land rents.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus he
explained a
phenomenon which other economists overlooked: the unparalleled rise
in urban rents and land prices, and in owners' wealth and power.</span>
</p>
<p>Building investment exhibits diminishing marginal productivity.
For example, the first $10K spent yields 30%, or $3K; but $1K (10%)
is paid in interest, leaving a $2K surplus. To acquire a superior
location that confers this surplus, the buyer can spend up to $2K
annually, which means paying up to $20K for the land (at 10%, $20K
costs $2K/year). The next $10K spent may yield more than 10% too, say
20%, conferring more surplus and adding more value to the land. The
idea is to invest until the last $10K unit yields 10%, just enough to
pay interest. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To understand
ground rents and land prices is to
understand cities; not to understand is to remain mired forever in
confusion and fallacy. Ground rent continues forever, generally
tending to rise; therefore, to buy title to land, people pay prices
that look high relative to current cash flows.</span> In Riverside, a
low
density city of 208,000, land prices go up to $18/sf. In San
Francisco, with high density and 800,000 people, prices reach
$1,000/sf; in Manhattan they exceed $2,000. In Tokyo, probably the
top of the line, one sale is reported at $25,000/sf. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Urban land
prices take your breath away.</span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land prices vary extremely from
city to city or block to block.
The cost to build a square foot of floor space is fairly constant
from place to place, but demand varies with location.</span> A small
rise in
floor rental translates into a large rise in ground rent and land
price, because the land owner gets everything above what is required
to operate and amortize the building. Thus, <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>in Riverside,
neighborhood mall space rental of $12 just pays for the building,
with only a little left over, resulting in land prices of perhaps
$5-$8/sf. <br>
  </li>
  <li>In Manhattan, rentals are triple those in Riverside; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">all
surplus accrues to ground rent, resulting in land prices 300 times
higher than in Riverside.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>At key locations in bigger cities, land prices are not just high
per square foot, they are higher per capita than in small cities.
They are even higher relative to building values, in spite of the
high-rise buildings. Remember that each additional floor adds more
ground rent, because floor space rental is more than enough to cover
the added cost. </p>
<p>Land prices across cities and neighborhoods are much more
differentiated than other measures economists commonly cite. For
example, the median income in upper east side Manhattan is about 8
times higher than north of Central Park, while the price of land per
square foot is probably 40 times higher. Urban land is also highly
concentrated in ownership; a handful of people and corporations own
most of it. A growing share of income property is held by wealthy
aliens, who want to diversify and acquire secure wealth they can
manage by remote control. Aliens even hold a good deal of residential
property in international "jet set" communities.</p>
<p><a name="Sharing the Surplus"></a><b>Sharing the Surplus</b></p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because
urban rents are a social surplus, not a payment for
anyone's making or supplying land, parties other than the landowner
have a claim. A good deal of American politics deals with how to
assert that claim and share in the surplus.</span> </p>
<p>Dividing a big pie seems a pleasant enough task, but Confucius
knew better: "It is easier to face a common enemy than to share a
surplus." The common ways of sharing surplus are clumsy, divisive,
and destructive; they bear some responsibility for dead cities. With
too much quarreling over spoils, there are no spoils to dispute.
Consider how spoils are shared, and how we might do better.</p>
<p><a name="Rent Control"></a><b>Rent Control</b></p>
<p>Rent control, which shares surplus with tenants, is a tempting
route that several cities follow. Renters feel abused and neglected
by tough managers and anonymous landlords. Supply is inelastic, at
least in the short run, so owners can't cut and run. Poetic justice
is served. But there are several spots on this policy:</p>
<p><b><i>Limited number of beneficiaries</i></b>. The original
tenants carve out an equity in the landlord's estate, but benefits
spread no wider. Tenants may sublet to others, becoming landlords
themselves. Rent control is at best a zero-sum game among the few,
not a social reform. </p>
<p><b><i>Lower incentive to maintain supply.</i></b> It becomes
unattractive to build new rental units, which are allowed higher
initial rents but are vulnerable to future caps. So rent control is
worse than a zero-sum game, it becomes negative-sum. Rent control
confiscates land income and building income alike; buildings do not
receive needed maintenance if there is no return. Too, land can be
reallocated to uncontrolled uses, such as condominium-ization. A new
wrinkle in Santa Monica is to buy a cheap rent-controlled apartment
building and convert it to a single-family residence for the new
owner.</p>
<p><b><i>Wasted space.</i></b> Tenants lose incentives to economize
on space that is underpriced to them. In the extreme, tenants move
away, but retain their apartments to use a few weeks of the year.</p>
<p><b><i>New class society</i></b>. Old renters become a privileged
class. A lower new supply, and wasted space, force uncontrolled rent
on new buildings above the market level. </p>
<p><b><i>Owner-tenant clashes</i></b>. An owner's main goal under
rent control is to evict and repossess. Nastiness and intimidation
have become routine, and the war stories legendary. In Tokyo,
outright extortion and violence are frequent. </p>
<p><b><i>Aborted incentive to maintain and improve</i></b>.
Landlords, and tenants retaining precarious tenures, lose all
economic motivation to maintain or improve property.</p>
<p><b><i>Dogged obstructionism</i></b>. Sitting tenants, who cannot
gain by site renewal, fight it every way they can. Obstructionists
have a vested interest in the status quo, however obsolescent,
however decayed, however inappropriate to the site.</p>
<p><b><i>Undertaxation</i></b>. Equity that tenants carve out of
landlords' estates has no market value, because it is inalienable (at
least legally). Assessed values and tax yields drop. The privileged
class pays low rent and avoids supporting public services. Higher tax
burdens are dumped on others, and worsened public services are
suffered by all. By way of analogy, I am a small farmer with canal
company shares that allow me to buy water below the market price, but
no right to sell my water. So I and my fellow shareholders waste
water and create a chronic, artificial southern California water
shortage.</p>
<p>The rationale is that housing or water is too important to leave
to the market, and must be price-controlled. The result is regulation
much worse than anything a market could accomplish. Around 1973 there
were shortages of coffee, raisins, and even toilet paper. These were
too unimportant to regulate, so their prices rose, demand fell,
supply rose, and the crises quickly disappeared. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rent control ensures
that we will not overcome the housing crisis so simply, if at all.</span>

(Equity in Kind)</b></p>
<p>Under the Code Napoleon, a French testator must divide real estate
equally among all children. Money cannot substitute for land; the
Code requires equity in kind. The resulting fine subdivision is
called <span style="font-style: italic;">morcellement</span>, and the
Code demands it without regard for
efficiency. </p>
<p>Each heir, in fact, must get an equal share of land of each
quality: meadow, woodland, etc.</p>
<p>Today we approach French Equity indirectly, and expensively. We
distribute land haphazardly, but seek to make every parcel equally
good by extending utilities and roads to all parcels on the same
terms, regardless of cost or location. </p>
<p>Economists call such schemes "postage stamp pricing," because
postal rates do not vary with delivery costs. Manhattan has 64,000
residents per square mile; Montana has 5.4. It costs a lot more to
collect or deliver mail in Montana. The reason postal rates rise is
that the U.S. urban population is spreading out more like Montana and
less like Manhattan (which once had over 100,000 per square mile).
Here are five other examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>The British Columbia Ferry Service.</i></b> This socialized
system has two urban lines that make money, but the whole system
hardly breaks even, because lesser lines serve remote areas. The
worst costs $12 for every dollar of revenue. </li>
  <li><b><i>British Columbia Hydro.</i></b> This socialized power
system
charges uniform rates throughout the Province. Users living in
high-density Vancouver are cheap to serve. A few live on the Yukon
border, where (I surmise) it costs hundreds of dollars to earn a
dollar of revenue. </li>
  <li><b><i>Water and sewer service in Milwaukee County,
Wisconsin</i></b>. City investments have been captured, controlled,
and milked by suburban land development interests, helped by state
legislators. </li>
  <li><b><i>State university campuses</i></b>. The legislative ethic
demands a prize, such as a university campus, in every electoral
district. Most of the eight UC campuses have excess land; some have
excess floor space. Sacramento solves rising enrollment not with more
intensive use of existing campuses, but with the costly creation of
new ones, each to enrich influential land speculators.</li>
  <li><b><i>Water supply in California</i></b>. The high real cost of
serving new settlements is passed on to older settled areas through
an accounting device called "melding," stirring all the accounts in
the same pot. Melding passes through several levels: a state
wholesaler serves the metropolitan district, which serves local
districts, which serve cities. At the end of the line, in Riverside,
it costs society $1800 to serve the marginal acre-foot (a unit of
water) selling for $20. This subsidy is worth fortunes to developers;
the cost is spread so others won't notice.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Problems with French Equity"></a><b>Problems with French
Equity</b></p>
<p>There are two problems with these subsidies as an approach to
equity: they are not equitable, and they are wasteful.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Equity
achieved by regional cross-subsidy is not interpersonal, but
interregional. It is like U.S. "foreign aid" programs, which tax the
poor in rich countries to aid the rich in poor countries.</span> Some
who
hold speculative land and enjoy subsidies are among the world's
richest people and cor-porations. Equity is not served by milking
middle-class neighborhoods to further enrich wealthy owners. "Public
works for private gain" is bad enough, but worse when profiteers are
already rich.</li>
  <li>How about waste? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Subsidy
creates waste in the amount of the
subsidy, almost by definition. </span>The New York Regional Plan
Association
estimates the social cost of creating a new lot on the urban fringe
at four times the lot's price (probably an underestimate). Why
develop a lot worth only one quarter of its cost? Because other
people pay the other three quarters. This process transfers ground
rent from areas of overcharge to areas of undercharge, but it
destroys much of the ground rent. To spread the surplus, we lose much
of it. </li>
</ul>
<p>Has French Equity any merit? It passed for a way to create jobs
when Keynes actually urged waste as a route to full employment. Those
ideas are now dormant, but we still do not understand the problem. If
we had to fire teachers or policemen each time a city extended
utilities to a campaign donor's raw acres, we would better sense the
true cost of public works for private profit.</p>
<p><a name="George's Constructive Program"></a><b>George's
Constructive Program</b></p>
<p>The key to renewing cities is shifting from obstructive ways of
sharing rent, like rent control; and destructive ways, like looting
and subsidies; to constructive ways. Henry George showed us how
equity and efficiency go hand in hand, how the magic of justice
combines with the magic of incentive.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, by George, equity need not be in kind. The monetary
mechanism overcomes the clumsiness of in-kind equity. If four
families inherit a one-family house, all four don't crowd in; they
sell and divide the money, or one buys out the others. There is
equity in money as well as in real estate. Money is often better; the
reinvestment opportunity puts the house on a magic carpet to follow
you anywhere. Money is wonderful!</li>
  <li>Second, by George, use the tax mechanism. Do not divide land into
unusable morsels, or shackle the market with rent controls, or
dissipate rent in subsidies. Give land to the highest bidder, and tax
ground rents to support government. </li>
</ul>
<p><a name="Power to Destroy or to Redeem"></a><b>Power to Destroy or
to Redeem</b></p>
<p>But we've always heard that tax destroys incentives. The news in
Henry George is that we can tax all the rent out of land, and not one
square foot will walk away, nor will God switch off the Creation. Man
creates capital by saving; some Other Force created land, and
sustains and serves it every day, undeterred by taxes. </p>
<p>Nor will Georgist taxes leave owners sulking on their land, but
the contrary. A 1983 <span style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>magazine
article calls them <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Higher
Taxes that Promote Development." The fixed tax is levied on land
value, based on opportunity cost. The owner uses land harder and
improves it more to meet a fixed tax; or sells, releasing surplus
land to those needing more space. Taxes stifle enterprise only if
they increase with enterprise. Land tax increases only with
opportunity cost, which is independent of the enterprise of the
owner. The only activity this tax impairs is withholding land from
use.</span> </p>
<p>George's land tax promotes equity toward the landless in at least
four ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it relieves them of taxes, to the extent that landowners
pay more;  </li>
  <li>it supplies them with more goods and services, as land is
used better;  </li>
  <li>it offers them jobs producing those goods and services;
and  </li>
  <li>it offers them a better chance to acquire land, as surpluses are
released to the market.</li>
</ul>
This is supply-side economics with a kick. It works through tax
transformation rather than tax reduction; total tax revenue may rise
or fall, as a separate issue. We can raise taxes and stimulate supply
together; there is no hard choice between them. At the same time, it
is demand side economics: untaxing investment raises the marginal
after-tax return, which, to demand-siders, is the motor that drives
the macro-economy. George's program not only reconciles efficiency
and equity, it squares taxes and incentives. What more can we ask of
economic policy than to resolve stand-offs that have confused us, and
dead-locked constructive action, for generations?
<p>It is an achievement on a par with resolving Evolution and
Creation, except George's program is something we can do something
about. We can implement it as quickly as we unclog the cerebral
arteries and follow thought with action. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many people are comforted to think
justice must be sacrificed for
efficiency, and schools starved or libraries closed to free up
incentives, so nothing, really, can ever be done.</span> We all feel
compassion, but, to stay whole in this world of beggars and bandits,
learn to harden our hearts. We screen out evidence of injustice and
rationalize what we cannot deny. This mindset, while understandable,
is unaffordable in a period of dangerous national decline and of
growing division between haves and have-nots. Corking in feelings is
difficult; there is satisfaction in venting compassion via support of
constructive public policies.</p>
<p>Camden has the highest tax rate in New Jersey, causing a vicious
circle as high rates drive away capital and further erode the tax
base. What if only land value were taxed? The depressant would become
a stimulant by the simple magic of converting a variable charge into
a fixed, unavoidable one. So it is with most depressed cities, which
today look vainly to Washington for salvation. They need enabling
legislation from their states, on the Pennsylvania model, but given
this power can save themselves.</p>
<p><a name="The Doubling Effect"></a><b>The Doubling Effect</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The counterpart of sharing rent
through taxation is to untax
things, like buildings, that involve human endeavor.</span> This
doubles the
incentive effect. If land tax is the stick, untaxing buildings is the
corresponding carrot, and George's program makes both larger. Every
lot with an old "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Defender</span>"
building has a potential replacement, the
"<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Challenger</span>."
Taxing buildings rigs the fight against the Challenger.
Say the lot-cum-Defender is worth $100K, and the Challenger would
cost $500K to build. Challenger cash flow must exceed Defender cash
flow by enough to pay $500K, plus added taxes based on it.</p>
<p>Georgist tax, by contrast, is impartial between Defender and
Challenger; the market decides. In 1965, after a detailed Milwaukee
study, I found that switching to the George program would allow 30%
of the city to be renewed immediately, simply by untaxing Challengers
vis-a-vis Defenders. (Sadly, Mayor Maier went the other way, so
Milwaukee lost 20% of its people and much of its wealth.)</p>
<p><a name="The Tripling Effect"></a><b>The Tripling Effect</b></p>
<p>New buildings face liquidity crises; almost all are built on
credit and need time to yield cash. The timing of tax on a building
maximizes the damage during the crisis period, for any given tax
yield over time. Of course, every building uses public services, but
new buildings in older cities pay for more than they receive, while
old ones receive more than they pay for. Think of building tax as a
forced loan to the Treasury, to be recovered when the building is
older. What could be more counterproductive than forcing a loan from
a builder passing through a credit crisis? The Georgist tax is low
when the builder's cash needs are pressing, and rises slowly over
time as the site ripens to its next best use. </p>
<p><a name="The Quadrupling Effect"></a><b>The Quadrupling
Effect</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Urban blight is cumulative and
self-reinforcing: blighted
buildings cast a pall on land around them, discourage upkeep, and
stifle renewal.</span> Whatever slows renewal of one site slows the
neighborhood in a vicious, downward spiral. Conversely, new buildings
stimulate renewal. There are exceptions; some new buildings sterilize
blocks with blank walls.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">But the exception is not the rule,
and abuse is not the precept.
The rule is that new buildings draw tenants from old and weaken other
Defenders, so that other owners also renew. </span>When they do, where
better than next to the newest building? Renewal, like blight, is
cumulative, but in a benign, upward spiral. Competition for sites
raises the tax base if land values are derived from ground rents. The
higher base allows the city to improve public services without taxing
buildings or scaring away generators of fiscal surpluses. In this
scenario, buildings raise the tax base indirectly, by raising the
value of land around them.</p>
<p><a name="The Quintupling Effect"></a><b>The Quintupling
Effect</b></p>
<p>Riverside built a downtown pedestrian mall when they were in
vogue, and has been sorry ever since. It did not work; retailers
deserted, and half the stores are empty. I asked the developer of a
successful mall why he thought downtown failed, and got a two word
answer: "absentee ownership." I should have known, having preached it
for years. </p>
<p>Farm advisers say, "The best dressing for soil is the owner's
shadow, applied daily." In town they ask, "Who's keeping the store?"
Absentees aren't the only negligent owners, nor are they all bad.
Torpid owners are the problem, and they come in many forms. A city
wants to be rid of owners who see real estate as a cash cow for their
retirement, and to replace them with owners who see it as a vehicle
for enterprise and who apply their shadows daily. The shadows follow
them to local civic clubs and to enterprising downtown or
neighborhood associations for making joint improvements. </p>
<p>The surplus to land attracts outside buyers. Absentees, redundant
parties in production, are often top bidders for pure ownership,
which is the legal right to receive land rent plus unearned
increments that accrue over time. Georgist taxation cuts directly
into rents and unearned increments, which attract absentee owners; it
spares the rewards of enterprise. It thereby effects a market
transfer of ownership from absentees to occupants, with the community
benefits that follow. In a period of rising concern over alien
takeovers of U.S. real estate, these points merit focused
attention.</p>
<p><a name="The Sextupling Effect"></a><b>The Sextupling
Effect</b></p>
<p>Untaxing buildings attracts outside capital to an area, but does
not result in new capital formation for the economy. In Keynesian
models, however, reducing tax on new capital raises the rate of
return after taxes (marginal efficiency of capital) and creates new
capital. In supply-side models, increasing saving is more important.
Land taxation helps here, too.</p>
<p><i>Land taxation, if vigorously applied, tends to reduce the
investment value of land, through a process called "tax
capitalization." </i>With land devalued, those needing wealth acquire
substitute assets by saving more, and investing the savings in real
new capital rather than land. </p>
<p><a name="The Septupling Effect"></a><b>The Septupling
Effect</b></p>
<p>Georgist taxation tends to reduce the need for public spending in
two obvious ways. One is to increase job opportunity, which in turn
reduces welfare spending. More productive job opportunities should
reduce pressure for military spending of a boondoggling, make-jobs
nature as well. The other is to eliminate urban sprawl and its
wasteful cross-subsidies. </p>
<p><a name="Renewal &amp; Housing for the Poor"></a><b>Renewal &amp;
Housing for the Poor</b></p>
<p>"Slum clearance" in the 1950s had a negative caste, with a name
catered solely for middle class consumption. Reuse of cleared land
was often at lower density, inevitably throwing unhoused people on
the private market. Federal "urban re-newal" in the 1960s, while
better named, emphasized clearing, not rebuilding. The inventory of
cleared, unrebuilt land under the program grew each year. Cynics'
cracks of "bombing out" and "Negro re-moval" were on the mark, though
blacks were not the only evictees. Any talk of demolition and renewal
evokes the specters of those cruel, wasteful programs. </p>
<p>But George's program begins with fostering renewal and intensive
use. Clearance is involved only to serve renewal, never as a goal in
itself. The first land taken would generally be vacant or with
boarded-up buildings. New buildings would draw renters and buyers
from old ones, releasing more space. The idea and impact are to
increase rentable, salable floor space. There would also be more
firms to compete in selling and hiring. How do we know there would be
an aggregate increase in supply? <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Higher density is one test. Untaxing
buildings fosters higher density because density, exemplified by high
buildings, substitutes capital for land. Untaxing capital obviously
makes it more economical.</li>
  <li>Higher quality is the other test. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The richer the new tenants or
buyers, the more space is released when they move. This is the
hardest point for advocates of the poor to accept. There will always
be specific cases where the rich bump the poor, leading to
contemptuous names like "trickle-down" that dismiss effects on the
market. But the aggregate is what should concern us.</span> If tenants
mobilize against new construction, a minority with a vested interest
harms everyone else, including the poor. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Building new
homes for the
rich, who can afford them, releases usable space for everyone
else.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There are three kinds of slums.</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Only the narrowest kind, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
slum
on high-value land</span>, causes eviction of the poor to benefit the
rich.
Owners in these uncommon areas neglect their buildings, expecting to
demolish them for expanding commerce or high-rise apartments. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
second kind is on bad land which will stay bad</span>. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The third, and most
common, kind is on good land with old buildings that have filtered
down to people who generate bad neighborhood effects</span>. Units go
vacant; land value is low. The market renews these slums not in a
stroke, but by nibbling at the fringes. Yet as it nibbles
incrementally in, it unavoidably creates more space than it consumes,
raising aggregate supply.</li>
</ul>
The poor also must fear <span style="font-weight: bold;">gentrification</span>,
in which new gentry
displace the poor in the same old buildings. This is one result of
not renewing; renewal as such is innocent. It seems carping, too, to
criticize people for restoring old buildings. The alternative may be
seen in ungentrified neighborhoods, where buildings simply go out of
use, sheltering no one. But the ultimate end of Georgist policy is
viewed in terms of the nation, pitting cities against each other to
attract people.
<p>Nothing is better for people than to be competed for. It raises
their bargaining power as tenants, buyers, and workers. </p>
<p><a name="Social Justice"></a><b>Social Justice</b></p>
<p>With all that talk of capital and efficiency, remember that we
began with a quest for justice in sharing rent surplus. Justice and
efficiency are not at odds; we can have both. The trade-off expounded
by many economists is to enervate us so we won't do anything. Yet we
have shown not just that we can have both, but more; we cannot have
either without the other. If we do not share rents in the efficient
Georgist manner, social and political pressures will cause
inefficient sharing and eventual dissipation.</p>
<p>This is what economic policy can do. The basic impulses, however,
the striving for justice and brotherhood, and the sense of personal
ethics, come from within, and from family, community, schools, and
religion. So does the sense of workmanship, the striving for
excellence without which no system works. </p>
<p>There are city councilpersons who can corrupt the best system ever
blueprinted. The Georgist program may even help to straighten them
out. Lincoln Steffens taught us that the villain in Eden was neither
Eve nor the serpent, but the apple! The apples of discord that
corrupt city councils are unearned increments to land value, which
they create or deny with every decision on extending sewers or
changing zoning. Georgist tax dehydrates those apples by attaching
higher tax to each unearned increment.</p>
<p><a name="A Summary of Reconciliations"></a><b>A Summary of
Reconciliations</b></p>
<p>Georgist policy has been shown as a means to revive dying cities,
and in the process to reconcile equity and efficiency; to reconcile
supply-side economics with taxation; to reconcile capital formation
with taxation of the rich. It can be seen as a means of harmonizing
collectivism and individualism, in the most constructive ways
possible. I know of no other program whose proponents can even make
such claims, let alone substantiate them. In a world that has already
priced younger people out of the real estate market, we should find
George's program worth our intense study and support. <br>
