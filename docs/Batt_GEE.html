<span style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>
</span>There are many indications that the paradigm that has dominated
orthodox economic theory for the past century, what has come to be
called neoclassical economics, is disintegrating.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1 </span></small>This
has led many economics students, as well as others interested in the
power and promise this discipline holds, to look once more at the
genesis of its theory and to attempt reformulations of its basic
premises. Marxism has also ceased to be a viable alternative, perhaps
more due to the failure of its institutional applications than to the
failings of the theory itself. Only one other longstanding economics
tradition has survived continuing scrutiny and remains a recognizable
and venerable legacy to the present time. This is the tradition that
has come to be known as Georgism. The Georgist tradition has seen a
profound revival during the past decade and warrants a comparison with
other upstart economics frameworks that have reached the level of
separate identity.<small><span

The Georgist school of thought takes its identity from the work and
insights of 19th century journalist, economist, and political leader
Henry George, who died in 1897 at the young age of 57. In his short
life, however, he managed to spawn a school of economics of lasting
impact, based on his prolific writing and speaking as well as his
dedicated pursuit of economic justice and political change. George&#8217;s
most famous book, <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>, has been
in print ever since
its initial publication in 1879. It had by 1906 sold more copies than
any book ever published except the Bible. Not only did he travel
internationally throughout the English-speaking world, strongly
influencing policy in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and
the United Kingdom, he was the candidate for the mayor of the city of
New York on two occasions, elections that he might have won had it not
been for Tammany Hall corruption in the first instance and his death
four days before the polls opened in the second. Current mainstream
textbooks have reduced his program to advocacy of the &#8220;single tax,&#8221;
often dismissing him as a crank, but his views were in fact far more
complex. They constituted a total world view synthesized from several
streams of thought current during the nineteenth century. The influence
of his thinking in United States is manifest in the language of many
state and local laws, even though only in the state of Pennsylvania
have his ideas been put into practice in any concerted way.<small><span

This paper constitutes an effort to compare, and if possible to
integrate, the emerging discipline of ecological economics with
Georgist economics. Ecological economics has the current distinction of
having established, to its credit, a collegial, cross-disciplinary
organization<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">,4
</span></small>a professional journal,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5 </span></small>and
at least one graduate program authorized to grant doctorates in this
subject.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6 </span></small>It
has established itself sufficiently to have had annual international
conferences for a decade and a half, and seen its works cited in
several other scholarly disciplines. Georgist economics, while having
no established doctoral program so distinctively tailored, has among
its fold many economists of established pedigree,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small> and
many others outside the academy who contribute significantly to its
discourse. There have been Henry George Schools in major cities around
the world for decades, a network of organizations, frequent
conferences, and at least thirty websites that exist to explicate and
purvey the Georgist outlook.<small><span

The organization of this paper has the following outline. It first
looks at the basic economic premises underlying Georgist economics as
they have evolved and been refined over the past century. It then
continues with an examination of the moral dimensions of Georgism,
contrasting it with neoclassical economics which claims to be value
neutral. Thirdly it explores both its research and political agenda and
goals to the extent that they can be identified as a cohesive approach.
The same examination then follows for the new discipline of ecological
economics. The paper concludes with an exploration of how the two
approaches can be synthesized so as to create a stronger and more
far-reaching interdisciplinary study of economics. Because the paper is
a revision of an earlier attempt written in the year 2000, and because
it is now being prepared for presentation to an audience of ecological
economists, more attention is given to the explication of Georgist than
to ecological economics. The author is also on firmer ground in
discussion of Georgism, and comes only recently to his discovery of the
ecological economics school of thought. Comments from the latter
perspective are therefore especially invited.<br>

<br>
The starting point of the Georgist framework is rigorous definition of
the three factors of production &#8212; land, labor, and capital, as in
classical economics. It should be further pointed out that these
factors are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all things of
economic value. Something must necessarily be in one category or
another; there is nothing <span style="font-style: italic;">outside </span>this
total classification. Understanding of what constitutes labor differs
little from definitions given elsewhere, regardless of which theory is
used. But definitions of land and capital differ somewhat from common
practice as well as sometimes in theory. Therefore, it is helpful to
spend time explicating the definitions of each as they are used in
Georgism, and to point out where these definitions diverge from those
most often employed in neoclassical economics applications. Many
contemporary economics texts begin by taking note of the
land-labor-capital distinction, but then make little use of it later.
These distinctions will make apparent why Georgist economics leads to
very different explanations of economic phenomena as well as to
different policy solutions.<br>
<br>
Critical to an understanding of Georgist economics is its recognition
of land as a special and unique factor of production. &#8220;Land,&#8221; to
Georgists, as true for classical economists throughout the 19th
century, is taken to mean not just the surface of the earth and
locational space; it means also any and all those natural resources and
non-human works that today can exact a market price. It includes the
wealth of the earth in all its natural forms, the air and water as well
as material elements. It includes phenomena of value like the
electromagnetic spectrum used to transmit communications signals, and
landing time slots such as have value at airports. As the world
economies enter a new age of high technology, these radio spectrums and
time allotments have gained ever increasing value. So also with
geosychronous satellite
orbits and most recently the genetic codes of all the biota on earth.<small><span

<br>
Sites have value relative to their location, and this is largely a
function of where people choose to congregate. The highest value lands,
in urban areas and in developed nations, have market worth many times
that of sites even short distances away. Remote land sites sometimes
have no market value whatsoever, and they are typically not &#8220;owned&#8221; by
private individuals or corporations because they are not attractive for
economic use.<strong> In New York City, for example, the ownership of one small
parcel of less than an acre in Times Square was transferred from
Prudential Life Insurance Company to the Disney Corporation in 1998 for
an estimated $240 million.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11</span></small> This
is more market value than all the land and buildings together in the
region north of the Mohawk River/Erie Canal in New York State. </strong>More
recently, a nine-acre parcel just south of the United Nations complex,
also available for development in New York City, was
estimated to have a site value of $750 million.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">12</span></small>
In both these cases, the cost of razing the existing obsolete buildings
was included in these prices, a factor which suggests that the market
value of the land would have been still higher were it not for this
condition.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">13</span></small>
In contrast there are land areas in Northern Canada and in the polar
regions for which there are no private bidders at all.<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">11New York Times, March 7, 1998.</font></small><font size="-1"><br>

    York Times, January 2, 1999.</small><br>
    <small>13There was a time, until the recent crash of the Japanese
economy in the early 90s, when the land under the Emperor&#8217;s Palace in
Tokyo was estimated to have a value higher than all of California.</small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</font></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It is equally important to distinguish those factors that are not land
in the classical sense of its economic use. Natural resources such as
coal, oil, and minerals, once removed from their natural state are no
longer regarded as land. </span>A diamond lodged in the deep earth is
land; that same diamond discovered by a prospector and then cut and
polished by a jeweler, is no longer land but capital. Likewise, fish in
the ocean are land, but fish once caught and in a boat are capital.
This is why, in any courses taught on Georgist economics, considerable
time is devoted to basic definitions. To carry the distinction just one
step further, land in the Georgist lexicon, is not wealth, whereas in
neoclassical economics it is. In the course of later discussion of the
Georgist view relative to the ecological economics approach, this will
emerge as a critical distinction, as it helps to demarcate the
boundaries of what activities fall within the realm of economic
behavior and what activities remain marginal.<br>
<br>
This separate and identifiable recognition of land has significant
importance for the definition of <span style="font-weight: bold;">capital
</span>too, because capital, then,
cannot be land. Capital, rather, is the product of labor and land (and
perhaps other past capital) to add to the increased store of capital of
individuals or of the community. Capital can be of many types, ranging
from monetary wealth to technical knowledge. The store of capital
applied to land and labor results in the further production of capital
wealth. Capital allows labor to be employed with greater efficiency and
productivity, through the use of technology and instruments and with
increased human skill and knowledge. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The next important step in
understanding Georgist economics is
recognition that each factor of production has its economic price: the
price of labor is wages, the price of capital is interest, and the
price of land is rent.</span> When any of these prices are unpaid,
distortions
result in the economic equilibrium and problems become manifest in
other realms of nature and society. In neoclassical economics
compensation for the use of labor and capital continue to be important
in the formulas and calculations employed to explain the economy. But
for neoclassical economics, David Ricardo&#8217;s &#8220;law of rent&#8221; is
essentially ignored and has be come for all practical purposes an
artifact in the history of economics. Rent continues to exist of
course; it is simply uncollected, left in the hands of those who
maintain monopoly control of certain services of nature, adding to
their market value in ways that distort the balance of markets. Failure
to recognize the importance of land rent (sometimes called economic
rent) is for Georgists critical to an understanding of the problems of
contemporary economies and economic analysis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">14The phenomenon of rent
      and
rent-seeking is a proper consideration not just in economics but also
particularly for the study of politics. A recent paper originally
published in Political Studies /Vol. 45 (September, 1997), pp. 639-658,
makes this clear: Paul Hutchcroft, &#8220;The Politics of Privilege:
Assessing the Impact of Rents, Corruption, and Clientelism on Third
World Development,&#8221; also at <a
 href="http://www.coc.ceu.hu/hutchcroft.html">http://www.coc.ceu.hu/hutchcroft.html</a>.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<br>
Hence it becomes important, critically important, to understand the
meaning of &#8220;ownership&#8221; and &#8220;property&#8221; in the Georgist lexicon. But it
is not difficult, for they continue to have their classical meanings,
just as for John Locke, Adam Smith, and all the major forerunners and
thinkers of classical economics until the advent of neoclassical
economics. What was the meaning of ownership and property in their
classical sense? Property was the product of human labor and capital,
and that alone. Items of property were household goods, personal
attire, armaments, and similar such goods. Property belonged in the
category of capital. Land was not part of property, but rather was its
own category. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land, broadly defined,
belonged to everyone and was the common heritage of all humanity.</span><small
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">15</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> One could no more &#8220;own&#8221; land than one
could own water, air, or other parts of nature, at least in the sense
of ownership that people often use today.</span> Much like the
native-American concept of ownership, it was part of what was
classically called &#8220; the commons.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small> &#8220;What
is this you call property?&#8221; Massasoit, a leader of the Wampanoag, asked
the Plymouth colonists whom he had befriended in the 1620s. &#8220;It cannot
be the earth, for the land is our mother, nourishing all her children,
beasts, birds, fish, and all men. The woods, the streams, everything on
it belongs to everybody and is for the use of all. How can one man say
it belongs to him?&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small>
Indeed Georgists see a moral equivalency between monopoly ownership of
land and nature and the ownership of slaves!<br>

Georgists' assumptions about property ownership rest upon premises
profoundly different from their conventional use in western society &#8212;
indeed increasingly in world society. In the discourse of legal
philosophy, the notion of property and ownership are better understood
as a collection of legal rights and responsibilities among people; for
example, the right to possess, to use, to capitalize, to manage, and to
retain the income from such.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">18</span></small> If
one disaggregates these rights, one has a far clearer understanding of
the potential array of socio-economic arrangements that are possible.
The primary distinction to Georgists is that between ownership for use
and ownership for gain. More will be said about the merit of this
division at a later point, but it should be noted even here that the
distinction is ancient,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small> and
has had expression at various times in human history long before the
appearance of Henry George. Two sets of contrasting terms are often
employed to distinguish the separate notions of ownership: 
<ul>
  <li>leasehold versus freehold, or  </li>
  <li>usufruct title versus fee-simple title.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">18This list, one among
      many, is
that of A.M.A. Honor&eacute;, a well-known legal scholar, noted in John
Christman, The Myth of Property, Oxford University Press, 1994, p. 19.
Another writer lists nine: possession, use, alienation (the power to
give away), consumption, modification, destruction, management,
exchange, and profit taking. Donald A. Krueckeberg, "The Difficult
Character of Property: To Whom Do Things Belong?" Journal of the
American Planning Association, Vol. 61, No. 3, Summer, 1995.</font></small></div>
<br>
In fact compensation for land held in usufruct was far more often in
kind than it was in money. Typically, in Middle Eastern as well as in
Asian societies, a percentage of a crop or of other products gained
from the land were accepted as just payment for its use, paid usually
to a king or nobleman in exchange for services which they in turn were
expected to provide. This usually meant the protection against ravaging
bands, arbitration of disputes, provision of sustenance in times of
emergency, and so on. The pattern of leasehold ownership with either
in-kind services, goods, or later fees paid to lords and kings is the
hallmark feature of feudalism, widely known not only in the European
past but throughout Asia and prehistoric Central American
civilizations. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In the Georgist context a titleholder
has the right to ownership of land in usufruct, but not in fee simple.
As long as an owner uses land and other elements of nature in accord
with the rules and laws of society, one retains a possessory interest. </span>That
interest extends to the privilege to use land for all purposes
consistent with its proper maintenance and care. It extends even in
some cases to the right to preclude others from any trespass at all. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But what it typically does not include is
the right to any speculative gain that would follow from title in
freehold, or the right to use land beyond what it is capable of
sustaining.</span> Use implies that its quality is not diminished for
the future availability of others, and that there is an obligation for
the user to pay to society a just price in exchange for such use. One
had no right, for example, to strip a forest of its trees. Enough is
known now about the arrangements of land ownership and use in
comparative perspective to assert with confidence that the historical
practice of title in fee simple or freehold has been far more the
exception than rule.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small>
Taking the long view of history, title in usufruct has been by far the
more common pattern of ownership of natural resources, except where
Roman jurisprudence and its offspring have spread throughout the world
and come to dominate.<br>

</span></small>Rent becomes critically important in Georgist economics,
because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.<br>
<br>
The concept of rent needs further explication precisely because it is
so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus,
defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
required to bring a service into production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To take just an elementary example,
consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
three farmers of equal ability and enterprise.</span> But suppose the
parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
one with the highest quality land having the best return. The one with
the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;<small></small>lowest
return. Economic rent is defined as the amount of surplus harvest
qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
highest return and that with the lowest return.<br>
<br>
Even though its originator, David Ricardo, had in mind the differential
return from agricultural lands, the concept of rent applies to other
natural services as well. Consider what happens in the case of urban
communities, using the simplest comparison with a tic-tac-toe board.
When the lattice is completely undeveloped and consists only of vacant
land squares, the locational sites have inconsequential value. But let
us suppose that each square is then settled &#8212; the first by a hotel, the
second by a department store, the third by a restaurant and so on &#8212; and
supposing that the owner of the center square is reticent to build at
all. Reserving his prerogative as titleholder he may intend ultimately
to sell. Given the rules of economics as they apply today he may be
wise to do so, keeping his money for other uses, as his square will
have increased in market value more than all the others despite his
having done nothing to improve it. It was this that prompted John
Stuart Mill to observe that &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, aris[es] from the efforts of an entire community.. . .&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> As
will be discussed later below, the single greatest factor in
determining the economic rental value of land today results not from
nutrients or access to water but rather due to site value determined by
location. And that can be priced and collected easily.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>27John Stuart Mill, Principles
of Political Economy, Book 5, ch 2, Sec.5.</small></font></div>
<br>
Lastly, one must appreciate that the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of every
sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
collection and the exploitation of land without
recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
is central to its tenets.<br>

<br>
Despite assiduous efforts to make clear the extent and the limits of
the economic rent as a concept &#8212; known as well as land rent, Ricardian
rent, and ground rent, even the best of contemporary neoclassical
economists disagree. Some texts argue that certain athletes or other
star performers with great natural ability reap returns for their
efforts far above what is in fact necessary to &#8220;bring them into
productive use.&#8221; The difference between what it would minimally take to
entice them to perform and the price they are actually paid is all
economic rent. Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears, and the
Beatles have all been compensated with impressive amounts of economic
rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small>
Georgists and classical economists are of mixed minds, arguing
sometimes that such payments are either wages or else are simply
transfers that in no way reflect productivity.<small><span

As with all nineteenth century moral philosophers, Henry George
subscribed to a belief in natural law. The natural order of things as
he saw it required that land be held in usufruct and that rent from
such should be returned to society. The theory was inspired by his
deeply religious roots and grounded in his reading of the prominent
thinkers that predated him. The natural order was also a moral order,
and the failure to comply with the order of nature and society as he
saw it was a perversion of justice. The fruits of the land belonged to
everyone, just as the fruits of one&#8217;s own labor were uniquely one&#8217;s
own. Since one owned one&#8217;s body, one was entitled to keep the product
of one&#8217;s physical efforts. Society had no more right to confiscate the
earnings of one&#8217;s sweat and brow than it ought to leave in the hands of
rich landowners the rent that was everyone&#8217;s inherent birthright to be
shared. There were just and unjust
taxes, and the only just tax was that which grew out of rent, of the
unearned increment that visited certain land sites as windfall gains
because of the efforts and investments by the community. Income and
excise taxes were unjust and confiscatory&#8212; even theft, as especially
were tariffs. Taxing or collecting land rent alone was the means of
ending poverty and restoring progress. Indeed many Georgists reject use
of the word tax entirely, preferring instead to talk instead about rent
collection. There is even a lapel button Georgists use that says
&#8220;Abolish all taxes; collect ground rent instead.&#8221;<br>
<br>
<small></small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist Economics:
Moral Premises<br>
<br>
</span>What distinguished Henry George&#8217;s views from those of his
adversaries in the last decade of his life was his assertion that
economics was necessarily a moral science. Unlike those who became the
founders of the American Economics Association in 1885, most of whom
were transitional figures to what would become neoclassical economics,
the primary focus of George and his disciplines was economic justice.
This is not to say that explanation was cast aside; indeed the subtitle
of his magnum opus, <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></span>,
was <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">An Inquiry
into the Cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of Want with
Increase of Wealth . . . The Remedy</span>. Why, he asked, in the midst
of such boundless plenty is there such abject poverty? He would
dedicate his book, first published in 1879, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;to those who, seeing the vice and
misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and
privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would
strive for its attainment.&#8221;</span> He had known poverty first hand when
he was struggling to support his young family and establish himself as
a printer, a journalist and a publisher. He could also see before him
the fruits of land and nature easily available to be harvested but for
its legal capture by monopoly titleholders. He wrote of all this in
some six books and countless other essays, the focus always on the
theme of economic justice.<br>
<br>
Along with Robert Ingersoll, he was likely the most stimulating <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/Speeches.html">orator
</a>of his age, a fiery moralist at a time during which there were many
others who might claim such a title. He traveled widely, was a champion
of labor, the landless, and the urban poor, particularly influential in
the struggle over the Irish land question and in the positions of the
Liberal party in the early 20th century. His admirers among the great
of the time were myriad: Sun Yat Sen, Leo Tolstoi, Winston Churchill,
Theodore Roosevelt, Charles Beard, Samuel Clemens, Robert Maynard
Hutchins, and John Dewey to name a few. Forewarned in 1897 that running
for mayor of New York a second time and trying at the same time to
finish another authoritative statement of his philosophy would kill
him, the prophesy was fulfilled nonetheless with his death four days
before election day. In 1886 he lost a rigged election<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">31 </span></small>when
matched against a scion of banking wealth Abram S. Hewitt, who was
recruited by Seth Low, President of Columbia University, but he beat
the third place finisher, Teddy Roosevelt. His funeral on the streets
of New York drew the largest crowd of mourners ever assembled until
that time, and until much later. No one doubted Henry George&#8217;s
passionate commitment to justice.<br>

<br>
The heart of George&#8217;s economics was, in a way, Biblical. As the son of
a religious book publisher born in Philadelphia, he had adequate
opportunity to witness the early growth of the American republic in a
unique way. On his own in San Francisco and responsible for a wife and
child at a young age, his first effort at resolving the puzzles of
injustice were a manuscript printed in 1871. But only after additional
exposure to Ricardian rent theory was he able to refine his ideas such
that they could form the basis of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span> eight years
later. His Christian roots led him to a deep commitment to the basic
moral equality of all people; his challenge was to find a way to ensure
that this equality was manifest in economic fairness.<br>
<br>
As noted earlier, the starting point of Georgist philosophy is that
nature belongs to owners only in usufruct and not in freehold. Because
any monetary wealth that accrued to that nature stemmed directly from
the physical presence of people and was therefore social in character,
the resulting added increment of value that constituted rent belonged
in turn to the community that created it. Nature would have no economic
price without people. Hence rent was the community&#8217;s entitlement and
not that of individuals, and the land rent that accrued to parcels as a
result of social investment should be returned to &#8212; recaptured by &#8212; the
community. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It was obvious to George
that the wealthiest people in the nation usually owed their fortune not
to the sweat of their brow or the inventiveness of their minds. Rather
their position was due to their success as land speculators, to an
increase in rent on land they had captured title to, land rightfully
belonging to all. </span>The earth and all its product, he argued, was
the common heritage of humanity, a birthright of all people.<br>
<br>
Any failure to pay back that increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. He witnessed first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development &#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
Plunkett writing at the same time:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There&#8217;s
an honest graft, and I&#8217;m an example of how it works. I might sum up the
whole thing by sayin&#8217;: &#8220;I seen my opportunities and I took &#8216;em.&#8221;<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">

</font></div>
<small><br>
</small>All society needed to do was to collect the economic rent from
landholders as its rightful due, a solution that became part of the
subtitle of his book, &#8220;the remedy.&#8221; Taxing the land (or, alternatively,
collecting the economic rent) was something common citizens could
understand.<br>
<br>
They knew well the enormous disparity in fortune between the landed and
the landless. They knew also that there was in fact land enough for
all, except for a system of ownership that made no distinction between
the right of land use and the right of land gain. George had no doubt
read Frenchman P. J. Proudhon&#8217;s more strident pamphlet that &#8220;property
is theft.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">33</span></small>
He knew that there was a long tradition of land taxation, well
articulated by a French school of philosophers known as the
Physiocrats. It was a natural and comprehensible solution for him to
advocate the adoption of the &#8220;single tax&#8221; on land, according to its
market value, to collect the economic rent. <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">33Pierre-Joseph Proudhon
(1809-1865), What is Property? (orig. 1840) New York: Cambridge
University Press, 1994.</font></small></div>
<br>
There was another dimension to George&#8217;s economic views as well. As
Locke and later classical economists argued, one owned the items with
which one &#8220;mixed his labor.&#8221; By extension one also owned items which
one purchased in trade from others who had similarly created their
wealth. Hence it was unjust and immoral for society to claim any parts
of the fruits of one&#8217;s own efforts in the form of tariffs, sales taxes,
and especially the income tax. Of course, except for a short period
during the American Civil War, the American government had never
implemented an income tax. But Britain had, and there was much
discussion of a need for an income tax in the United States; it was
again instituted in this country in 1913.<br>
<br>
During the late 19th century, the burden of various direct taxes was
not so large that many common people felt their acute impact. It was,
however, a time of extreme disparities between the poor and the
wealthy, and the single tax was a means by which to redress some of
those disparities. It would also foster the availability of employment
by making labor more attractive relative to land and capital
investment. In a word, people would more likely have to earn their
money. The fruits of land wealth, distributed among people equally in
the form of government services, would go far toward both enhancing
economic opportunity and correcting inequality. <br>
<br>
Georgists today adhere to much the same points of view, although there
are some significant differences. George himself was an ardent free
trader, mainly because he believed that the single tax should supplant
tariffs. After Ricardo, he accepted the idea of comparative advantage
that arose from trade, but only after land (resource) rents were
collected so as to preclude the raping of the natural environments of
countries rich in such resources. He also believed that population
growth was good &#8212; the more the better, and took special pains to refute
Malthus. But one should also recall that he was living at a time when
the expanse of the American continent was still open to any homesteader
who chose to do so. Population growth was not a problem at that time.
These elements of George&#8217;s thought are inconsequential to his
followers today. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet it is important
to note that Georgists are not socialists; they do not
subscribe to the view that society should own the means of production.
These should remain privately owned by and large (except perhaps as
today&#8217;s economic theory would call for, i.e., natural monopolies,
public goods, and other government instruments). They are, rather,
free-marketers in the full sense of the world, even more ardently than
many contemporary American conservatives.</span> He believed that
removing the
accretion of economic rent from landsites would restore self-regulating
equilibrium of the marketplace, thus obviating the need for the heavy
hand of government controls.<br>
<br>
Restoring land sites to the arena and influence of market forces by
collecting land rents eliminates the incentive to hold them for
speculative investment and thus expands the reach of the free market.
As much as that term has been now overused, Georgism constitutes a
&#8220;third way.&#8221; It is the distinction between the right of real property
ownership for use versus real property ownership for gain that sets
Georgists apart from other free market capitalists.<small><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">34John Christman, The Myth of
Property, note 16, builds on this thesis.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<p><br>
  Georgists today are also frequently very divided on the role of
    government in society. Many are vehemently anti-government and are
    subscribers to libertarian views;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">35</span></small> others are
    rather conventional progressives in their belief and confidence in the role
    of government to provide the full array of
    public services which are typically found in modern democratic
    societies. The axis of Georgist thought cuts completely across
    conventional political party lines as a consequence: one finds hardline
    conservatives and progressive &#8220;liberals&#8221; united only in the view
    that economic land rent should not be left in the hands of titleholders.
    Most would use such revenues to finance the support of government
    services, abolishing completely the wide array of income, sales,
    corporate franchise and other taxes that are currently used, keeping
  only environmental fees and user fees.</p>

  Adherents of minimalist government believe that any extra rent revenue
  collected from holders of land should be returned to people
  individually in the form of a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s dividend.&#8221; Given the choice of
  using the full amount of surplus rent to support government services or
  collecting only a portion, many libertarian Georgists would collect it
  all; leaving it otherwise in the hands of property holders, they
  believe, has more negative consequences than not collecting it. Not
  collecting the economic rent, so they argue, is worse than throwing it
&#8220;into the sea&#8221; for all its distorting and destructive consequences.
  Others advocates would prefer to collect it not for financing the
  services of government but rather to distribute it as a &#8220;citizen&#8217;s
  dividend.&#8221; There is widespread recognition of the destructive
  consequences of the failure to collect land rent. Some Georgists would
  allow a token amount of rent to be retained by landholders so as to
  facilitate real estate markets above and beyond what might otherwise be
realized.</p>
<p> Economic justice was and is the primary concern of Georgist economics,
  but not the only one. Land ownership is far more concentrated than
  other forms of income or of wealth;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36</span></small> as a
  rough rule of thumb, approximately one third of the households in the
  United
  States own no land at all. Because a tax on land cannot be passed
  forward, these households therefore pay no taxes at all.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37 </span></small>The
  taxes come instead roughly equally from residential and non-residential
  parcel owners alike. Farmers and foresters, who typically own land of
  very low market value on account of its remote location, pay a
  negligible amount of taxes. This means, of course that most of the
  non-residential tax burden falls upon commercial parcels, but the
  burden on tenants represents no change from the going rate of floor
  space whatsoever. George himself had given considerable attention to
  the virtues of land taxation. Measured against the current principles
  of sound tax theory typically enumerated by schools of economics and
  public administration, contemporary advocates give the tax high marks.
  It is no accident, for example that a total of eight
  Nobel-Prize-winning economists have endorsed the principles of land
  taxation.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span></small> The
  criteria typically used by experts in tax policy besides equity are variously
  defined to include neutrality, efficiency, simplicity,
  administrability, and stability. Because taxation inevitably has a
  moral dimension, the way in which taxes are designed and administered
  is also therefore profoundly moral in its content.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">36For example, 95% of the USA is
owned by the richest 3% of Americans; 60% of El Salvador is owned by
the richest 2% of El Salvadorans; 86% of South Africa is owned by the
white minority; 74% of United Kingdom is owned by the richest 2% of
Britons; and 84% of Scotland is owned by the richest 7% of Scots. This
probably understates the concentration, because it measures ownership
not by land value but by land area. See

Taxation: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a></span>: &#8220;I share your view that taxes would be best
placed on the land, and not on improvements,&#8221; and &#8220;In my opinion,
the
least bad tax is the property tax on the unimproved value of land, the
Henry George argument of many, many years ago.&#8221;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Herbert Simon</span>: &#8220;Assuming
that a tax increase is necessary, it is clearly preferable to impose
the additional cost on land by increasing the land tax, rather than to
increase the wage tax&#8212; the two alternatives open to the City (of
Pittsburgh). It is the use and occupancy of property that creates the
need for the municipal services that appear as the largest item in the
budget&#8212; fire and police protection, waste removal, and public works.
The average increase in tax bills of city residents will be about twice
as great with wage tax increase than with a land tax increase.&#8221;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Paul Samuelson</span>: &#8220;Pure
land rent is in the nature of a &#8216;surplus&#8217; which can be taxed heavily
without distorting production incentives or efficiency.&#8221; A land value tax can be
called &#8220;the useful tax on measured land surplus.&#8221;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">James Tobin</span>: &#8220;I think in
principle it&#8217;s a good idea to tax unimproved land, and particularly
capital gains (windfalls) on it. Theory says we should try to tax items
with zero or low elasticity, and those include sites.&#8221;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">James Buchanan:</span> &#8220;The
landowner who withdraws land from productive use to a purely private
use should be required to pay higher, not lower, taxes.&#8221;</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Franco Modigliani:</span> &#8220;It
is important that the rent of land be retained as a source of
government revenue. Some persons who could make excellent use of land
would be unable to raise money for the purchase price. Collecting rent annually provides access to land for persons
with limited access to credit.&#8221; </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Robert Solow:</span> &#8220;Users of
land should not be allowed to acquire rights of indefinite duration for
single payments. For efficiency, for adequate revenue and for justice,
every user of land should be required to make an annual payment to the
local government equal to the current rental value of the land that he
or she prevents others from using.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
Vickrey:</a></span> &#8220;It
(land value taxation) guarantees that no one dispossess fellow citizens
by obtaining a disproportionate share of what nature provides for humanity.&#8221;</small><br>
<small>The endorsements from the last four economists named above were
taken from a letter dated November 7, 1990 to Mikhail Gorbachev signed
by 30 prominent U.S. economists. That letter is reprinted in Richard
Noyes (ed.), Now the Synthesis: Capitalism, Socialism, &amp; the New
Social Contract. London: Shepheard-Walwyn, 1991, pp. 225-230.</small><br>

</div>
<small></small>A tax that is neutral is one that in no way alters the behavior
of the markets by its imposition; that is people perform and make
choices in the same way as if there was no tax at all.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">39</span></small>
Because a tax on &#8220;land&#8221; broadly defined is inelastic, i.e., has a fixed
supply, any tax on this base is completely capitalized in the market
price of the land itself. It is, in effect, a tax on the land rent, or
a recapture of the land rent by government in the name of society, just
as the rent is a creation of that society.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">39"The striking result is that a
tax on rent will lead to no
distortions or economic inefficiencies. Why not?&nbsp; Because a tax on
pure
economic rent does not change anyone's economic behavior. Demanders are
unaffected because their price is unchanged. The behavior of suppliers
is unaffected because the supply of land is fixed and cannot react.
Hence, the economy operates after the tax exactly as it did before the
tax--with no distortions or inefficiencies arising as a result of the
land tax." P. Samuelson and W. D. Nordhaus, Economics, 16th ed., p. 250.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<br>
A land tax is efficient because there is no economic distortion of
market choices as a consequence of its neutrality. This means that
there is no wasted economic behavior in the form of excess burden or
deadweight loss typically associated with other tax designs. As an
example of the inefficiencies of other taxes, for example, one might
consider the altered behavior that occurs in consequence of the
presence of the income tax or the sales tax. This deadweight loss in
American and British economies has been estimated to be roughly 20% of
the national domestic product in each nation. Put differently, were
there no deadweight loss as a result of the tax structure, the society
would essentially be 20% more productive &#8212; and 20% richer in the
aggregate.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">40</span></small><br>

worker (16% of NDP) in the first year, rising to $17,800 (23.7% of NDP)
after 20 years for the most productive tax reform, which involves
collecting 90% of the rent of land and using the income tax as a
residual tax. When the sales tax is used as the residual tax, the gain
per worker is about $3,300 less.&#8221; This and other work is summarized in

Great American Tax Dodge (Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co., 2000), where
the authors note (p. 23) that the proportion of U.S. taxpayers
deliberately engaged in cheating on their income taxes now approaches
&#8220;between one -third and one-half of the tax-paying population.&#8221; </font></small></div>
<br>
Because a tax on land is essentially a flat rate percent levied on a
base of assessed full market value, it is simple and easy for people to
understand. On account of that attribute, a tax on land value is easily
visible and is perceived by the public to be fair. Finally, now that
applied computer technology can be used to accurately assess the value
of land whether or not it is improved, one of the last traditional
objections to the administrative feasibility to land value taxation has
been allayed. All this enhances the legitimacy of government. The tax
is therefore not simply efficient from the narrow measure of tax
efficiency as described above. It is efficient also in the broader
sense, by its ability to foster sounder government performance, better
community relations, more livable community configurations, and
enhanced social productivity.&nbsp; It is not just from the standpoint
of tax theory alone that a tax on land should be evaluated.<br>
<br>
The most compelling arguments to many supporters stem from its
environmental consequences. A tax on land sites is the most powerful
instrument available to neutralize and reverse the centrifugal forces
of urban sprawl. This is because incentives are present &#8212; the higher
the tax the more power it has &#8212; to improve the high-value sites to the
full extent that their market value warrants. Titleholders are induced
to build on their parcels in order to recover the carrying costs of
their increased taxes. The inelastic supply of land sites means that
taxes are shouldered fully by owners, without being passed on to
tenants. (Of course a tenant&#8217;s charges can be raised anytime.) Hence
urban areas tend to be improved and peripheral areas become less
attractive to sprawl development. George saw a strong moral argument
for shifting from the conventional property tax levied on both land and
improvements to one based on land alone. The argument was quite simple:
the tax as it stood penalized people who improved their property and
rewarded people who held vacant parcels for speculative gain. It
rewarded those owners who let their holdings go to wrack and ruin,
often those who bought up parcels to use as rental property without
investing in the maintenance to ensure that they would continue to be
attractive and livable &#8212; slumlords.<br>
<br>
The Georgist approach to taxation had many names: his contemporary
Thomas Shearman wrote two books calling it the &#8220;natural tax,&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">41 </span></small>and
more recently it has been referred to as the &#8220;incentive tax&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small> and
ground rent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small>
It should be noted once more that, by whatever name, the &#8220;land tax,&#8221;
&#8220;site value tax,&#8221; or &#8220;single tax&#8221; to George covered a far wider scope
than simply locational sites, even though today this is the base that
is given the most attention. It covered any natural factor element that
humanity chose to put into service. Today, some of these parts of
nature which have come to be &#8220;owned&#8221; by private corporations (at least
insofar as their license to such use have become entitlements) are
worth millions. The electromagnetic spectrum that has been parceled out
to the communications industry has sometimes been &#8220;auctioned&#8221; for
one-shot revenue gains, is now for all practical purposes a freehold
title
in the hands of those industries.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">44</span></small> Were
those spectrum bands retained by governments and &#8220;rented,&#8221; the revenue
would likely be far greater. Whatever increased value now results
accrues to these private owners instead of to society.<small><br>

In the Georgist view, this economic rent is the public&#8217;s birthright,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">47</span></small> and
the failure to collect it and to use it to pay for the general costs of
government services is a moral as well as a public policy lapse.
Georgists regard the private confiscation of public wealth as mistaken
policy if not actually an immoral transgression &#8212; in a word, theft! He
himself was an advocate of the public owning and protecting &#8220;the
commons&#8221; and what is today often called &#8220;natural capital.&#8221; Studies have
shown that if economic rent were collected in full as well as other
appropriate revenues such as user fees and green taxes, the total
income would likely be enough to pay not only the costs of all
government services but provide a citizens&#8217; dividend of significant
amounts as well.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">48 </span></small>Statistical
data is difficult to compile, but what studies have been attempted to
date indicate that economic rent in all its forms and from all its
sources
comprises approximately a third of the economy as it is currently
calculated.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">49</span></small>
Arrangements such as these are to the followers of Henry
George a far more efficient and moral system of public finance.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist Economics: Agendas<br>
<br>
</span>The Georgist main agenda, as earlier noted, is economic justice.
If one searches the term &#8220;economic justice&#8221; online, the first site that
will appear is the Georgist website, <a href="http://www.progress.org/">progress.org</a>.
The starting point
is that people are entitled to what they earn, but only to what they
earn.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">50</span></small>
The fruits of the commons generated in rent might also be distributed
to citizens equally if not used to finance the general services of
government. In practice this means the abolition of those taxes that
represent an unjust capture of one&#8217;s personal property &#8212; taxes such as
income, sales, and other nuisance taxes. It accepts, to be sure, the
need to collect user fees, Pigouvian taxes, and perhaps sumptuary (sin)
taxes. It argues aggressively for the collection of economic rent in
support of government and, for any remaining surplus, its distribution
as a citizens&#8217; dividend.&nbsp; The justification for the collection of
rent has several grounds: 
<ul>
  <li>the first is to preclude the entitlement of
windfall gains to those who have unfairly captured monopoly control of
parts of what are rightfully the public commons.  </li>
  <li>A second reason is to
enhance the efficiency of economic productivity which the failure to
collect rent prevents. It is not just that monopoly control of commons
sites drives less attractive and less valuable land into production
because the primary choices are unavailable; it is also that the use of
alternative taxes leads to a deadweight loss in the economy which
reduces the wealth of every citizen except the monopoly titleholder.The
proper collection of land rent leads to increases in economic
efficiency in a way that wages are not artificially depressed and more
opportunities arise in the labor market.</li>
</ul>
The result of these factors
leads to a greater equality in the income of each person.
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1">50People would still,
      however,
be entitled to unearned income insofar
as it did not derive from economic rent &#8212; from the stock market, for
example, or from inheritance beneficences.</font></small><br>
</div>
The collection of land rent has other consequences for the smooth and
effective functioning of the economy as well. With respect to the
configurations of land use in urban areas, the collect of land rent
neutralizes, and even reverses, the centrifugal forces which the
current real property tax (i.e. that on both land and improvements)
exerts on the values of locational sites. In fact one eminent economist
argues that a tax on land sites is &#8220;better than neutral,&#8221; because it
fosters activity in the highest value areas and removes the factor of
adverse timing that often stalls economic investment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">51</span></small> This
all leads to the economic vitality of high-land-value cities, simply by
virtue of concentrating activity in central areas instead of peripheral
and remote regions. It discourages the extravagant and careless
development of land sites,
thereby also fostering development densities conducive to community
welfare and to the success of public transit services.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">52</span></small>
Experts agree that the minimum density necessary to make public transit
services economically viable is 10 to 12 households per acre; without
this, there is little prospect of altering private automobile
dependency.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">53</span></small>
And given the widespread environmentally and socially destructive
consequences of motor vehicle dependency, collecting rent is half the
answer toward the goal of engendering livable urban areas. (The other
half &#8212; see below &#8212; is pricing motor vehicle use at its true marginal
cost to society.)<br>

The more cohesive the development of communities is, the greater the
synergy exists among its members. Sprawl development not only increases
the cost of transportation and other infrastructure needed to service
these sites, it also reduces the extent to which people are accessible
to one another. There is considerable indication that American society
is losing this elusive quality of community. When Harvard professor
Robert Putnam published his celebrated article <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span> in January, 1995, it
was remarkable as much for the resonance that it generated throughout
the nation as for the message itself. David Broder of the Washington
Post pronounced <span style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span>
the most important academic article that year. Putnam argued that our
communal relationships are declining, and that an ever smaller
proportion of the population is involved in social activities of a
cooperative and communal nature.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">54</span></small> We
used to be a nation of joiners; increasingly now we&#8217;re a nation of
loners. As Tocqueville noted 150 years ago, affiliative groups used to
be the unique strength of American society.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">55</span></small>
Several hypotheses were offered in this and subsequent studies to
explain the decline in the civic engagement of Americans &#8212; various
demographic changes, technological innovations such as television, the
changing role of government, the cultural revolution, and so on. The
land-use and transportation patterns that have evolved in the post-war
period are a factor as well. The concepts of neighborhood and community
today no longer mean the same thing as they
did in the past.<br>

Saying hello to your neighbors today, if indeed you know them, means
tooting your horn as you meet them coming and going.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">56 </span></small>Urban
areas need instead to be designed to engender healthy community life.
Restoring the balance between accessibility and mobility so that human
exchanges&#8212; of all sorts&#8212; can occur efficiently and simply is a central
element of Georgism. As author Kirkpatrick Sale has said, we need to
restore <span style="font-style: italic;">Human Scale</span>.<small><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">56Studies show that there
      is an
inverse correlation between the
ability of a street to move &#8212; and to park &#8212; cars and trucks, and
the
amount of social interaction between neighbors on that street. One such
study compared three similar residential streets, with different levels
of traffic volumes, in San Francisco. Residents on the different
streets were asked to indicate on the base maps of their streets where
friends and acquaintances lived. Those living on streets with the least
traffic volume had three times as many friends and twice as many
acquaintances as those living on the streets with heavy traffic
volumes. Donald Appleyard, Livable Streets, Berkeley: University of

</span></small>Much of the loss of scale communities is due to the fact
that transportation planners have reconfigured the urban areas of the
country to serve the automobile.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">58</span></small> It
stems from a fundamental confusion between what geographers call
accessibility and mobility. This distinction is explained particularly
well in a recent text, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Geography
of Urban </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Transportation:</span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Accessibility refers to the number of
opportunities, also called activity sites, available within a certain
distance or travel time. Mobility refers to the ability to move between
different activity sites (e.g., from home to a grocery store).<small><span

Recent days have witnessed a profound and growing awareness of the
problems due to sprawl development. In fact one opinion poll marked
sprawl as the highest current concern among American voters.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">60</span></small> The
answers being offered, however, don&#8217;t address the root causes of the
problem. The most talked about panacea is the institution of urban
growth boundaries, but these have failed to be demonstrably successful
even in the two communities most often cited (Portland and Boulder)
where they were instituted over twenty years ago.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">61</span></small>
Solutions such as these reflect the penchant of policy makers to rely
upon so-called &#8220;command-and-control&#8221; (CAC) approaches to government
rather than &#8220;pricing&#8221; approaches. The extension of government reach and
weight to impose policies deemed appropriate is burdensome, expensive,
and inefficient.<br>

Such means reflect a lack of understanding and imagination according to
authors David Osborne and Ted Gaebler, who urge adoption policies of
&#8220;steering rather than rowing.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">62</span></small> As
long as drivers personally are able to pass off to others the true
costs of their travel, it guarantees, along with the failure to collect
land rent, that sprawl development will continue. One 1993 study
concluded that "when the full range of costs of transportation are
tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public a
total of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. This is equal to about
one-quarter of the annual GNP and is greater than our total national
annual expenditure on either education or health."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">63</span></small>
Japan, by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4% to satisfy all
its transportation requirements, although the figure might be a bit low
because not all externalities are included in the calculation.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">64</span></small> One
reason we are spending so much on motor vehicle transportation is that
our public policies encourage it. Road user fees represented about $33
billion in 1991 but the true costs to society were ten times that;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">65</span></small> put
another way, drivers pay only 10% of the true costs of their motor
vehicle use.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">66</span></small><br>

Failure to collect land rent leads to speculation and the resulting
boom-bust economic cycles that are so destructive to the general
economy.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">67</span></small>
Henry George in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>
(Bk V, Ch1) identified the
"speculative advance of land values" as the "great initiatory cause of
industrial depressions." Economic cycles can be linked to just about
every downturn over the course of two centuries, the more so as the
economy has come to be monetized. Frederick Lewis Allen, the great
journalist gives a compelling account of how the Florida land boom (and
later bust) antedated the Great Depression.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">68</span></small> More
recently a similar speculative bubble explains the Asian economic
crash, particularly in Thailand.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">69</span></small> When
the Japanese economy was at its peak, the value of land in Tokyo alone
exceeded that of the entire United States, and the appraised land value
under the Imperial Palace was as great as all the real estate in
California.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">70</span></small>
The most convincing study of the relationship between land value cycles
and more general economic cycles is one done for Australia by a
contemporary Georgist economist.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">71 </span></small>There
are some students of the American economy that believe that we are the
cusp of a crash in land values that have been bid up over decades, and
that this could well precipitate a market downturn that could be
long-enduring. <small><span

Pricing resources of nature at their marginal rates is a clearly
understood economic principle. To do otherwise fosters extravagant and
wasteful use of such, or leads to inefficient use of their locations.
Hence both a moral reason &#8212; the unjust windfall gain that otherwise
befalls such monopoly titles &#8212; and an economic reason &#8212; efficiency &#8212;
call for such practices. It is the compelling impetus of politics and
not economic rationality that frustrates the implementation of such
designs. With the advent of greater and more accurate data, as well as
the increased power of computer analysis, there is every reason to
argue for and anticipate the collection of economic rent from every
source where it arises.<br>

</span></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ecological Economics: Basic Premises</span><br>
It is far easier to outline the basic premises of Georgist economics
than it is to do so for the emerging field of ecological economics.
Georgism is a tradition that grew out of a clearly formed tradition of
19th century classical economics and has been refined further for the
past century. It was neoclassical economics that diverged from the
reigning orthodoxy. The differences between the classical tradition as
represented and defended by Henry George and the emerging neoclassical
school were vividly portrayed from their earliest divergence, even to
the staging of formal debates between George and the new orthodoxy&#8217;s
adherents. <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">75</span></small>
In contrast, ecological economics along with other emerging heterodox
schools is itself very much a reaction to the neoclassical tradition&#8217;s
insensitivities and failures. The differences between ecological
economics and the floundering discipline of neoclassical economics are
as much by way of the former&#8217;s criticism of the latter as they are an
enunciation of clear starting points.<br>
<br>
To be sure, neoclassical economics emerged gradually over a period of
some fifty years, and only reached its heyday, one might argue, with
the arrival of Paul Samuelson. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Samuelson, the
MIT economist whose text has gone through some 16 editions and has
outsold all other text combined once said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care who writes a
nation&#8217;s laws . . . if I can write its economics textbooks.&#8221; </span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">76</span></small> The
neoclassical position developed ever greater abstract mathematical
applications, with models ever more detached from &#8220;real world&#8221; market
forces. This system of analysis now has reached a point of questionable
utility due to its hermetic and Newtonian emulations.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">77 </span></small>Little
by little, one premise and formula after another have been cast aside,
to a point now that there is a broad recognition among economic
theorists at least that the discipline faces an intellectual crisis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">78</span></small><br>
<small></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">75This history is well
chronicled in Mason Gaffney, The Corruption of Economics, London:

<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></small>Without enumerating further criticisms that have been
levied against neoclassical economic thinking, something that has been
done far better elsewhere than is possible here, suffice it to say that
some of the most compelling charges have been made by the ecological
economists.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">79</span></small>
The most trenchant one as explicated by economist Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen is its violation of the basic laws of physics.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">80 </span></small>It
assumes a continuing draw-down of the earth&#8217;s store of energy, of which
there is, of course, only a finite amount. If the economy continues to
expand to include all elements of the earth, it will consume so many
resources, particularly energy resources, that ultimately life itself
is destroyed. One study calculated that if everyone in the world lived
at the level of the average American, three &#8220;earths&#8221; would be necessary
to accommodate us all. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">81</span></small> The
challenge, argue the ecological economists, is to structure economic
analysis and the economy itself in such a way that markets are
contained and that existence outside economic reach is respected and
preserved. Whereas other studies of the environment within the
framework of conventional neoclassical economics attempt to price
nature in a way that its value is assured, ecological economists work
from the conviction that such an approach is questionable if not
futile, as it can never achieve any accurate and reliable market values
for such existence.<small><span

<br>
A central premise of ecological economics is a recognition that market
prices do not reflect the value of commodities, particularly the
resources and services of nature. Oscar Wilde first noted&nbsp;that
a cynic was &#8220;a man who knows the price of everything and the value of
nothing.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">83</span></small>
But it is clearly not only cynics who hold such ideas today. The
growing &#8220;commodification&#8221; of all things &#8212; the consequence of a gradual
and inexorable privatization of the whole world and the ever expanding
attempts to include everything which humans touch in a market economy,
where objects and services which lack a market price are thus treated
as free goods &#8212; means either that ultimately everything must be priced
or else that other means must be found by which to identify value. The
subfield of environmental economics is based on just this view &#8212; that
everything must be priced. To be sure, we cannot live without the
natural environment, yet treatment of natural goods and services as
free under the neoclassical economics
framework leads inevitably to their total consumption and destruction.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">84</span></small> The
looming exhaustion of natural resources compels us to recognize that
market prices have limited worth in signaling true value, whether those
resources be the biota of the world upon which human beings also depend
for their existence or mineral wealth in the form of fossil fuel energy
which drives modern economies. If we do try in any way to price the
goods and services provided by the environment, they are so far beyond
counting that it becomes self-evident that our economic approach must
change.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">85</span></small><br>

If land and land rent are the strongest determinants to Georgists,
energy is its closest counterpart to ecological economists. Just as
land rent can be measured fully in terms the relative surplus it
produces in any given socio-economic context, energy can be traced and
calculated in calories, BTU&#8217;s or joules. Land rent is completely a
human product &#8212; there is no rent where there are no people, as land has
no market value. On the other hand, energy exists regardless whether
people are present or not, as it is a component of nature itself. But
not all energy is now recognized as relevant in economics; only that
energy which is employed in the human economy, and we assume that the
human economy is necessarily bounded. Wind, sunlight and lightening are
as yet unpriced and are peripheral today even in ecological economics.
Attention is given more to those natural resources potentially
procurable or otherwise relevant to human dependency, and energy
certainly is primary. So rather than regard energy as a free good and
largely outside the economy&nbsp;as neoclassical
economics assumes, energy will likely continue to be central &#8212; even the
driving force &#8212; in ecological economics. <br>
<br>
Indeed just about all other factors of production are essentially
convertible from energy. Besides that used in households, industry, and
transportation sectors, agriculture &#8212; at least linked to developed
economies &#8212; is essentially energy driven. As Martinez-Alier has shown,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">86</span></small>
modern agriculture is essentially unfeasible without reliance upon
applied energy forms, and the diets of modern societies are heavily
reliant upon energy in the forms of intensive fertilizer use, intensive
application of machinery, and animal protein-fed farmers. By way of
contrast, in pre-modern agricultural societies one could argue that
human and animal energy account for all the foodstuffs produced, and
were used in turn to assure the continuance of the agricultural cycle.
Unlike modern societies they are in energy equilibrium. Hall<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">87</span></small>
argues that energy is the determining factor in the development success
of all economies, posing momentous challenges for the future as
projected shortages of fossil fuel sources loom on the horizon.<br>

The regard for steady-state socio-economic dependence upon the natural
environment raises profound questions about the extent to which human
activity is possible without continuing depletion of the earth&#8217;s energy
resources, mainly fossil fuels. On the one hand are those that believe
that contemporary society&#8217;s reliance upon intensive energy has become
so embedded that continued sustainable life is impossible.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">88</span></small> Among
these are noted ecologist writers such as Paul and Ann Ehrlich who
envision the continued boom and ultimate collapse of all civilized
nations.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">89</span></small>
The other view includes the majority of ecological economists who hold
out hope that it might be possible to shift in time to renewable energy
sources before damage to the ecosystem is irreversible. This view is
exemplified by those who could be called the &#8220;steady-staters,&#8221; and who
believe that there is still time to bring economic practices into
an equilibrium state and avoid the doomsday scenario. Among the latter
are Herman Daly, one of whose books is entitled Steady State Economics.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">90</span></small> An
interesting discourse is unfolding among this community, perhaps as
reflective of personal temperament as much as it is due to research

<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>The
heart of ecological economics is ecological carrying capacity and
the premise of economic sustainability. Although this term has to some
extent become a mantra and widely abused, its most popular definition
remains that first enunciated by the 1987 Brundtland Commission Report:<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> "development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">92</span></small>

fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs
of present and future generations."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">93</span></small> At
various times scholars have sought to improve upon this definition; one
offered by adherents of the ecological economics school reads as
follows:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. For renewable resources (fish,
trees, etc.), the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of
regeneration.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">2. The rate at which we allow economic
activity to generate wastes that must be passed into the environment
should not be allowed to exceed the environment&#8217;s ability to absorb
them.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">3. The depletion of nonrenewable
resources (oil, coal, etc.) should not be offset by investment in and
development of renewable substitutes for them.<small><span

Implicit in all this is the argument that manufactured capital (i.e.,
that created by human beings), and natural capital (those resources
provided by nature) are not substitutable, as well as the belief that
current practices portend irreversible consequences for the earth&#8217;s
environmental stability. Nor can the various components of natural
capital alone be regarded as interchangeable goods. Natural gas might
in some instances be a substitute energy source for coal, and chicken
an alternative protein source to beef. But fundamentally each element
is to a significant extent unique in nature &#8212; fulfilling its own
special niche in what ecologists call lexicographic uniqueness.<br>
<br>
Conventional thinkers argue that these two classes of natural and
man-made capital are mostly substitutable, in what ecological
economists have called &#8220;weak sustainability.&#8221; But the contrary, &#8220;strong
sustainability,&#8221; is at the heart of ecological economics, going even
further than many authors of the Brundtland Commission Report would
have accepted by recognizing the&nbsp;lexicographic
character and place of each and every element of the biota.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">95</span></small> There
is no definitional consensus, however. The Clinton-Gore administration,
for example, established a President&#8217;s Council on Sustainable
Development on June 15, 1993, and adopted the Brundtland Commission&#8217;s
language. But it carefully avoided any detailed definition of what was
meant by sustainability.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">96</span></small>
Subsequent executive orders and press releases have been equally vague
as to what definition of sustainability is being used,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">97 </span></small>and
to this day the matter remains unsettled.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ecological Economics: Moral Premises<br>
</span><small></small><br>
If Georgist economics takes a moral stance primarily focused on
justice, ecological economics makes a much wider sweep. From its
standpoint the very survival of the world is at stake, so that matters
of distributive justice, so central to Georgists, tend to get lost in
debate. Many ecological economists and environmental economists would
claim that theirs is not a moral stance at all; rather it is a simple
empirical reality. One philosopher writing in the journal Environmental
Ethics sets forth a view reflective of many:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I do wish to point out that this
&#8216;holistic&#8217; view of the Earth&#8217;s ecological systems [i.e., the natural
world as an organism] does not itself constitute a moral norm. It is a
factual aspect of biological reality, to be understood as a set of
causal connections in ordinary empirical terms.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">98</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1">98Paul W. Taylor, &#8220;The Ethics of
Respect for Nature,&#8221; in
Environmental Ethics, Vol. 3, No. 3.(Fall, 1981), pp. 197-218);
reprinted in Michael E. Zimmerman, et al (ed.), Environmental
Philosophy, Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1998, p. 77.<br>
</font>
</small></div>
Living within the laws of nature would seem to be axiomatic in the
development of any ethical system, and it is a mark of degree that our
ethics have so ignored such realities that a corrective is called for.
Only in 1967 Professor Lynn White noted in a now famous article how
much the Judeo-Christian tradition has been used to explain and justify
practices of exploitation and domination of our natural environment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">99</span></small>
Mistaken or not, this view of man&#8217;s place in nature is generally
accepted as conventional wisdom throughout western culture. The ecology
movement constitutes a revolutionary and very unsettling outlook to
this prevailing view, a radical shift in thinking from even mainstream
environmentalism and conservation ethics half a century ago. In this
view other species, both plants and animals, are as much entitled
to life and well being as is homo sapiens. Theodore Roosevelt a century
ago could never have subscribed to the views of contemporary
environmental ethicists, as much of a conservationist as he was. The
earliest clear manifestation of modern thinking at least in western
thought appears to be Aldo Leopold&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">Sand
County Almanac</span>, a work only
published in 1949!<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">100</span></small>
Ecological economists
accept this so much as given &#8212; that human beings are of the earth and
its bio-system rather than on the earth to dominate it &#8212; that further
refinement of this basic orientation is almost beside the point. This
was simply prudent care and planning to Leopold; he fully recognized
our total dependence upon nature.<br>

Not only are human beings co-equal with other living beings of the
earth, so also are beings yet born entitled to an existence. The
Iroquois Indians of New York State are often quoted to the effect that
&#8220;In our every deliberation, we should consider the impact of our
decisions on the next seven generations.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">101</span></small>
Several contemporary environmental organizations have adopted the
Iroquois &#8220;Great Law of Peace&#8221; so that it has become the vernacular
equivalent of the Brundtland Report&#8217;s definition of sustainability.
Sustainable economics, or 7th generation planning, also requires Daly&#8217;s
&#8220;steady state&#8221; economy, <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">102</span></small>
where (as if natural resources constitute &#8220;capital&#8221;) one lives only on
interest and not principle. Daly contrasts two notions of economic
practice: growth and development. The former may momentarily increase
economic productivity and wealth, but is in the long term a fatal
course of policy. It increases quantity but not quality. Development,
rather, is what should be aspired to, an increase in quality,
efficiency, and fulfillment through minimal uses of energy and material
resources. For development, the value-added dimension comes from
treading lightly on the earth, from the use of mental capital rather
than physical capital.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">103</span></small> Daly
in still another article talks about three parameters of
sustainability: &#8220;allocation, distribution, and scale,&#8221; which will lead
to an economy which is &#8220;efficient, just and sustainable.&#8221; <small><span

One exponent of ecological economics suggests five axioms to measure
the degree of &#8220;ecosystem health:&#8221; <small><span

</small>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1">105Costanza, et al, Ecosystem
Health, note 84, pp. 6, 24.</font></small><font size="-1"> </font></div>
<ul>
  <li>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dynamism</span>:
Nature is more profoundly a set of processes than a collection of
objects; all is in flux. Ecosystems develop and age over time.</li>
  <li>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Relatedness</span>:
All processes are related to all other processes.</li>
  <li>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hierarchy</span>:
Processes are not related equally but unfold in systems within systems,
differing mainly along the temporal and spatial scale on which they are
organized.</li>
  <li>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Creativity</span>:
The autonomous processes of nature are creative and represent the basis
for all biologically based productivity. The vehicle of that creativity
is energy flowing through systems which in turn find stable contexts in
larger systems, which provide sufficient stability to allow
self-organization within them through repetition and duplication.</li>
  <li>The Axiom of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Differential
Fragility</span>: Ecological systems, which form the context of all
human activities, vary in the extent to which they can absorb and
equilibrate human-caused disruptions in their autonomous processes.</li>
</ul>
Elsewhere ecosystems are measured according to their relative health, a
metaphor deliberately taken from the field of medicine. What
constitutes ecosystem health is still very much an open discussion, but
it has been defined in terms such as integrity,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">106</span></small>
diversity, stability and resiliency.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">107</span></small>
These are all concepts which presume a level of depth, span and
integration, and see the living environment not as things and
instruments, but rather as elements of interdependent processes
requiring respect, sometimes even management. It often also presumes
respect for the environment not just for instrumental reasons but for
aesthetic and moral reasons. The reality of ecological economics
entails valuation of nature according to criteria beyond just market
value. After all, this nature is a central part of the &#8220;commons&#8221;
or &#8220;natural capital.&#8221;<br>

One interesting article considers whether ecological economists must
necessarily be moral individualists or moral holists. The former
reflect the ethical tradition drawn from classical liberalism and
utilitarianism wherein the satisfaction of individual needs is measured
according to standards of distributive justice. Ethical individualism
presents problems insofar as there is little or no protection to any
existence beyond members of the human community. There is no basis for
moral claims by elements of nature &#8212; animals or plants&#8212; inasmuch as
they lack consciousness and the capacity to suffer. Yet environmental
holism, reflected in the thinking of Leopold, suffers from liabilities
as well. Continuing the argument, this thinking fails because<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) there is no biologically coherent
notion of &#8220;community&#8221; robust enough to ground either contemporary
scientific theory in
community ecology or environmental ethics; <br>
2) it is not possible to safeguard the &#8220;rights&#8221; of biological
communities; <br>
3) in relying on natural-selection mechanisms to deliver it from
relativism [its defenders&#8217;] evolutionary ethics has lost its normative
dimension; and <br>
4) [this] version of ethical holism appears to sanction what [is
elsewhere called] &#8220;environmental fascism.&#8221; <small><span

<small><br>
</small>In a series of articles in one edited volume, ecosystem health
is defined by the extent to which there is diversity, hierarchy,
complexity, resiliency, and both dynamism and homeostasis. All of these
attributes taken together reflect a holistic view, and possess an
integrity, it is argued, which has utilitarian, aesthetic and moral
dimensions.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">109</span></small>
Ecosystem health has elsewhere been portrayed in terms of a capacity
for unfolding openness to greater diversity and complexity &#8212; an
evolution if you will &#8212; that fosters both further integration and
hierarchy as well as richness and resiliency.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">110</span></small>
Attempts in later chapters to operationalize these terms further&#8212; so as
to better facilitate environmental management&#8212; ran head on into
methodological and philosophical difficulties. This was partially due
to the fact that benchmark measures for each dimension was less easily
identified. Yet only six years afterward a second collection of essays
includes a number of studies that show the relative condition of water
resources, forests, and fisheries, as well as indicators of how the
burden of human enterprises and their over-extension translates into
environmental despoliation.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">111</span></small>
All this has led to discussion of natural resource management which
means in most instances managing not nature so much as socio-economic
behavior in order to maintain and ensure the viability and integrity of
ecosystems.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">112</span></small><small><br>

This leads to still a third important dimension of ecological
economics: the belief that human fulfillment in the final analysis
comes not from consumption and exploitation of natural resources and
material goods. Because the concept of an ecological footprint is so
important, retreating to a less imposing and more respectful
relationship with the earth leads to an interest in a lifestyle that
has come to be known as &#8220;voluntary simplicity.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">113</span></small> It
grows from greater compatibility and appreciation of nature, an ability
to live in harmony with it, and a capacity to enjoy community with the
environment and its natural beauty. Higher levels of human realization
and actualization arise from communal interaction, and from the pursuit
of wisdom and relationships. It is no accident that ecological
economics has made frequent reference to still another emergent
tradition of economic philosophy now known as humanistic economics.
This latter builds on the thinking of Abraham Maslow and the human
potential movement born of the 1970s.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">114</span></small> In

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ecological Economics: Agendas<br>
<br>
</span>There are now several books and essays offering policy outlines
to address ecological challenges worldwide. Many are collaborative
efforts as befits a newly emerging field of study. Two books serve
particularly well as references for the agenda of ecological economics
as the field is presently defined. Both are authored primarily by
Herman Daly, a founder of the ecol-econ discipline. The first, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">For the Common Good</span>, was first
written in 1989, and has been republished in a second edition in 1994.<small><span

was awarded the New Options prize for being the &#8220;Best Political Book of

of the ecological economics approach, <span style="font-style: italic;">Natural
Capital and Human Economic Survival</span>, published in 1995.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">117</span></small>
These two books reflect an explicit and comprehensive political agenda
of concern to ecological economists. Significantly also several of the
ideas expressed in these volumes have already crept into mainstream
environmental policy discourse.<small><span

<br>
Daly and Cobb outline eight issues relating to the ecological economics
perspective which call for clear public policy changes in their view.
All relate to the American context: economic globalization, population,
land use, agriculture, industry, labor, income policies and taxes, and
national security policy. Put differently, there is no realm of policy
outside of the reach of ecological economics; this is what makes it
truly interdisciplinary. The second book focuses more directly on means
by which to preserve natural capital, using what means governments have
at their disposal. After first distinguishing between <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;command-and-control&#8221; (CAC)</span> and
incentive pricing systems, the authors continue by exploring the
various ways that the latter, fiscal measures, can be engaged to alter
the course of current economic practices in favor of more sound and
environmentally sensitive ones. No short treatment can do justice to
each class of proposals, but a quick summary indicates their general
direction.<br>
<br>
Underlying the whole agenda is a commitment beyond simple description
to sustainable development economics and to Daly&#8217;s &#8220;steady state&#8221;
economics. This entails the institution of environmental safeguards,
protection of cultural and biological diversity, minimal resource use,
and recycling. It further means protection of small countries and
localities &#8212; of both ecosystems and populations &#8212; against
all-encompassing economic units that preclude the possibility of their
being able to survive independently. It presumes also that not just
humans alive today have entitlements, especially privileged elements of
wealthy countries; it recognizes rather the justice and moral claims of
people and natural ecosystems yet to live to survive as intact and
integral units. It recognizes that governments must take a hand in the
preservation of such ecosystems, as&nbsp;markets forces
left to themselves will wreak destruction on the most vulnerable parts
of the earth and ultimately upon the earth itself. It accepts the fact
that the carrying capacity of the earth is&nbsp; limited, and that we
appear to have already exceeded that carrying capacity in our ignorance.<small><span

</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">119One oft-cited article
      is that
of Peter Vitousek, et al, &#8220;Human Appropriation of the Products of Photosynthesis,&#8221; BioScience,
Vol. 36, No.6 (1986), pp. 368-373, available at
http://dieoff.org/page83.htm. It calculates that consumption of earth&#8217;s
resources is doubles at an ever increasing rate, and that humans have
already appropriated 40% of terrestrial biological productivity. The
most comprehensive collection of articles addressing this perspective
is created and maintained by retired Cornell Professor Jay Hanson, at
www.dieoff.org. The site name arises from his view that the world
economy&#8217;s dependence upon fossil fuels faces an imminent end, and the
earth will then be capable of supporting only about two billion people.
Hence a looming dieoff. </font></small></div>
<br>
The distinction between CAC approaches to environmental challenges as
compared with pricing approaches is central to all this analysis.
Daly&#8217;s shows a strong preference for the latter. In what he calls
&#8220;graded ecozoning,&#8221; for example, potential atmospheric impacts are
divided into three areas. 
<ul>
  <li>First, for emissions that do not cause significant damage and do
not accumulate in significant concentrations, taxpayers would be
charged a general fee.  </li>
  <li>Second, in instances where incentives require altered behavior to
address problems such as high ozone or carbon monoxide emissions in
certain local areas, more targeted taxes would apply.  </li>
  <li>Finally for those pollutants that have profoundly damaging
impacts, regulation and perhaps criminal liability would be called for
in cases of their release. These classes are labeled the &#8220;property
rights zone,&#8221; the &#8220;incentive zone,&#8221; and the &#8220;regulatory zone&#8221;
respectively. The model follows the growing interest and preference for
pricing approaches over more heavy-handed and administratively
inefficient CAC approaches.  </li>
</ul>
Green taxes, sometimes also called corrective taxes or Pigouvian taxes,
are their first candidates for consideration. This is because they can,
if priced right, recover the costs of externalities in ways that allow
individuals to use their own discretion about employing environmentally
damaging practices. But the authors extend their thinking to cover
goods and materials that may have negative ecological impacts although
not yet conclusively demonstrated by science. The answer there is to
rely upon a &#8220;precautionary polluter pays principle&#8221; based on the
present value of the forecast impact should the worst case scenarios be
borne out. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
annual cost of using a car in the early 1990s, for example, was $51,656
according to their calculations.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">120</span></small> This
would obviously entail an enormous imposition of taxes, far above the
less than $7,000 direct annual costs typically shouldered by drivers
now,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">121</span></small>
the rest of which are now passed on to society generally. Grave doubt
exists about the potential impact of various externalities of driving,
along with concern about the extent of damage which might possibly
occur to
the ecosystem; this warrants employment of the precautionary principle
and calls for policy solutions to curtail this travel mode. Complete
prohibition of certain materials and chemicals may be warranted in some
cases.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">120Prugh, et al., note 83, p.

International, a consulting firm that provides data to corporations and
governments for purposes of mileage reimbursement and travel
deductibility.</small></font>
</div>
<br>
The authors would further impose the full costs, in the form of taxes,
on the depletion of natural capital resources. This in turn would both
discourage the improvident use of such materials and encourage their
re-use and recycling beyond what economic arrangements now provide for.
They also argue strongly for tariffs and trade barriers that would
foster linkages between existing local community enterprises, since
they view economic globalization as a &#8220;race to the bottom&#8221; with respect
to the exploitation of both resources (land) and labor. These tariffs
would apply not only to protect the viability of certain social and
political units but to ecological systems generally, so that their
protection would be better guaranteed against the ravages of market
exploitation.<br>
<br>
With respect to arrangement of property rights, their classifications
follow more conventional thinking, distinguishing ownership according
the degree of access and by the extent of public protection warranted.
Here they fall back more on legal and regulatory approaches than upon
pricing. They see a continuum that runs from individual property rights
to common ownership, ignoring the fact that any title to property
constitutes a &#8220;bundle of rights&#8221; which can in principle be
disaggregated and charged for in various ways.<br>
<br>
The theme of economic justice runs throughout Daly&#8217;s work, evident of
course in the title <span style="font-style: italic;">For the Common
Good</span>.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">122</span></small>
But
the formulations of justice are not explicit. One looks in vain for a
statement of what if any entitlements people should possess by virtue
of being human, or what nature or posterity is due in turn. Absent is
anything that Harvard Law professor Mary Ann Glendon calls &#8220;rights
talk.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">123
</span></small>But it is clear that the ecological economists are
struggling mightily with these questions. They are boldly posed
elsewhere in the writing of Joan Martinez-Alier, a Spanish scholar who
is widely known in the movement not just by his own writing but as
editor of the journal <span style="font-style: italic;">Ecological
Politica</span>. In one article, he sees an
ever-widening standing for environmental claims, as the environmental
movement evolves from one based on the efficient and sustainable use of
natural resources (the &#8220;gospel of eco-efficiency,&#8221; in the tradition of
Gifford Pinchot), later to the &#8220;cult of wilderness&#8221; (in the tradition
of John Muir and Aldo Leopold).&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">124</span></small> They
are evident also in the work of Bernardo Aguilar, particularly with
reference to north-south trade arrangements which essentially exchange
natural resources for developed nations&#8217; currencies. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">125</span></small> As
people come to understand their relationship and dependence upon their
natural environment, he envisions an unfolding pattern of litigation to
preserve the sanctity and protection of peoples dependent upon it.
Distant corporate interests will be blocked from exploiting the lands
of local populations who are otherwise left with
the liabilities of their repair.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">POINTS OF SYNTHESIS OF GEORGIST AND
ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS</span><br>
<br>
The commonalities of Georgist economics and ecological economics appear
to be organizable into six general points: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) preservation of the commons, <br>
2) sustainable development, <br>
3) appropriate valuation of natural capital, <br>
4) ensuring social and biological community, <br>
5) fostering individual self-realization, and <br>
6) securing economic justice. <br>
</div>
Implicit in all these points is the view that market activity needs to
be circumscribed and juxtaposed to the non-human, biological realm. It
appears that there is lots to be gained by some synthesis of the two
fields of discourse.<br>
<br>
Ecological economists worry about the encroachment, and even the
elimination, of those elements of nature to which private property
title has not been granted. In their concern about the need to protect
the &#8220;commons,&#8221; they are torn between the view that only through
privatization can all the world&#8217;s assets be preserved and the
alternative view that any private appropriation of the commons
constitutes a moral compromise. They fear a repeat of Garrett Hardin&#8217;s
&#8220;tragedy of the commons.&#8221; Their argument often proposed is rather
complex to explicate: it assumes that private property titles may
perhaps provide the best incentive not to exploit the fruits of the
earth and the earth itself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">126</span></small> To
Georgists, on the other hand, the earth and all its resources are
already in fact the birthright of all humanity; individuals are
entitled to its use in return for the payment of rents. Further
privatization is anathema. The key rather is in distinguishing the
various components of ownership and getting prices right &#8212; mainly in
the
collection of economic rents.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">126See Terry Anderson, Free

<br>
One must ask then whether there is some such means by which to
accomplish the goal of environmental preservation &#8212; through either of
the means by which government has at its disposal: command-and-control
(CAC) approaches or pricing approaches. It has already been noted how
difficult CAC approaches are to enforce, and how expensive they are
both in terms of administration and economic inefficiencies. Pricing on
the other hand suffers from the difficult challenge of getting it
&#8220;right,&#8221; som ething which typically must be resolved through formal
public decisions, especially when and insofar as they involve public
goods or common property.<br>
<br>
And yet, for pricing to work at all, there must be both supply and
demand; the lack of either results in there being no market price at
all. Is it possible, perhaps, that policies might be developed where
demand for certain resources are reduced to zero &#8212; and hence no price?
To some extent this is how the Georgist economics approach works. It
leaves certain realms of the commons unthreatened by exploitation for
the reason that the attention of the market is focused elsewhere. By
the collection of economic rent the prices of resources are effectively
shifted, so much so that the market arena is profoundly altered.
Resource prices are shifted in such a way that their use is curtailed
and their consumption concentrated. It was noted earlier, for example,
that collection of land rent tends to reverse the centrifugal forces of
sprawl, actualizing demand at the core of urban areas and leaving
remote regions uninhabited and
intact. Economic rent accrues to sites that have high demand and
frequent use; collecting that economic rent tends to concentrate their
use in ways that discourages speculative practices, allocate their use
to those who can best maximize their utility, and leave other sites and
commodities in remote areas less affected by human activity. So also
with charges for other public resources such as radio frequencies and
airport landing slots. Pricing incentives are established in such a way
that economic activity is intensified, concentrated, and integrated
without the need of artificial CAC instruments such as zoning, urban
growth boundaries, community land trusts, and other devices which are
expensive to implement and have notable records of failure.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">127</span></small> <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">127See Batt, &#8220;Solving the
Problem of Urban Sprawl,&#8221; note 61.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<br>
On the other hand, collection of economic rent, whether it be from the
use of land sites, fossil fuels, fishing grounds, solar and wind energy
settings, electromagnetic spectrum frequencies, airport landing
timeslots, and or even air sinks facilitates their highest and best use
while leaving less attractive settings unaffected. Where there exists
the possibility that environmentally sensitive sites or resources might
otherwise be exploited, then is the appropriate time to institute
focused CAC approaches, and with more attentive and efficient
administration for all involved. The practice of concentrating economic
activity in the more limited footprint that pricing creates is
consistent with approaches taken in ecological economics. This is
because the economy is recognized as only one component of human
experience and the world system, not coterminous with it. Daly, for
instance, draws concentric circles to illustrate the proper setting of
the economic system &#8212; inside the social and cultural system which
itself exists in a greater ecosystem. Collection of economic rent has a
centrifugal and concentrating effect on human activity and hence upon
the ecosystem itself. It has a benign effect on ecosystems insofar as
it effectuates a steep and identifiable market gradient between areas
of heavy socio-economic activity and those that bring no price at all.
And yet by facilitating closer contact between members of the human
community, it also fosters exchanges of a nature
that are outside the market economy &#8212; family relationships and
neighborhood activity.<br>
<br>
The consequences of collecting economic rent are to increase prospects
for achieving sustainable development. This is because fiscal
instruments constrain the use of natural resources more than do either
CAC approaches or fiscal measures inspired by neoclassical approaches.
Collecting full royalties by competitive auction for nature&#8217;s harvests
reverses the exploitation of nature that presently obtains.
Establishing proper prices for such materials and services would likely
reduce their appropriation. All this enhances efficiency and
productivity in ways that are consistent with sustainable economics,
and gives recognition and space to elements of the ecosystem so that it
is less threatened with extinction and exhaustion. Site value taxation
works to circumscribe the domain of economics relative to the natural
world. Its greatest impact, presently evident in the consumption of
energy and land area, is turned inward on itself. Space, time, energy,
and nature are thereby conserved and spared insofar as their economic
costs become dearer. The centripetal forces encouraged by the
imposition of land value taxation and which induce the proximity of
land use configurations have a salutary effect on the
health and vitality of social community. Using Daly&#8217;s language again,
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">128</span></small></small>
instead of mindless growth one encourages development, quality over
quantity. Ecological economists have been in the vanguard of opposing
the globalization of the economy, believing that its disruptive effects
on local communities outweigh any gains in potential diversity,
economies of scale, and competitive advantages that might obtain. Henry
George himself was an ardent free trader a century ago, but this, as
Daly points out, was before capital had the mobility that it does
today. In Ricardo&#8217;s time, capital remained largely within a nation&#8217;s
borders, not true today. Whatever competitive advantages localities
might have had during the early industrial revolution are vitiated
today by the speed with which money can be transferred in seconds from
one nation to another. Notably, the late E.F. Schumacher was a strong
supporter of both Georgist economics and of local currencies.<small><span

</small></font><small><br>
</small></div>
Recent years have witnessed a growing awareness of how urban sprawl has
sapped community cohesion and creativity. In part it is the land use
configurations themselves that have been responsible, fostered by the
decisions of realtors and developers to capitalize on the promise of
speculative gain to be had by people who settle at the periphery of
urban areas and then see their land values rise. But current reversals
in public sentiment about suburban lifestyles suggest that community
cohesion is once more appreciated. This reversal of preferences may
favor measures that will foster development of landsites with the
highest value, reducing motor vehicle dependency and infrastructure
costs. It is no accident, perhaps, that rankings of the most livable
cities in the country correlate most strongly with those that are most
bicycle friendly.<small><span

</small></div>
Greater proximity in development can lead to greater guarantees for the
preservation of unsettled areas, leaving tracts of nature undisturbed
by the inroads of human presence. This too may have the ironic effect
of fostering greater community with nature. Certainly millions of
backyards with gas grills and lawns to mow are a poor substitute for
pastoral lifestyles. Ecological economics makes clear to people the
interdependency between urban and rural, past and future, life and
lore, far better than the conspicuous consumption fostered by
conventional economic pursuits. Daly himself writes approvingly of land
value taxation, even though he has little to say about Henry George or
about collecting economic rent.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">131</span></small>
Ecological economics hunts for a continuum between economic value and
non-pecuniary value, without finding a clear boundary for either.
Georgism, in contrast, encourages a precipitous fall-off in economic
prices at the periphery of human presence, simply on account of the
fact that rent recovery reverses the centrifugal impetus of
conventional market forces. The continuum asserts itself.<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">131For the Common Good, note 79,
Ch. 13.</font></small></div>
<br>
The grant of land sites and other natural resources to individuals and
corporations in leasehold rather than freehold has an additional
advantage beyond the revenue collected in rent to support the general
purposes of government. This is the restoration of ownership of the
earth to all people: what in Georgist terms and in classical philosophy
is their birthright. Acknowledgment&nbsp;that the earth
belongs to us all, and is both our entitlement and our responsibility,
has the effect of enfranchising the people of the earth everywhere,
perhaps ennobling them as well. At a time in human history when the
incomes of the world&#8217;s people are increasingly disparate, and where
wealth is even more unequally distributed, it must be recognized that
titles to the resources of the earth are the most unequally, and
unjustly, distributed of all.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">132</span></small>
Recognition of this truth may come as a revelation; indeed it may well
be revolutionary in some
circles. But restoration of birthrights to which all people have a just
and proper claim may be the single most important and effective means
by which to facilitate and ensure sustainable economic policies
worldwide. <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">132New figures have just been
compiled to dramatize the shifts
in just the past few years in America and in the rest of the world. See
Frank Ackerman, The Political Economy of Inequality, note 30.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<br>
All this leads to the likelihood also that personal growth can also be
enhanced by the forgoing factors: greater community facility, greater
identification with &#8220;the commons,&#8221; and greater access to nature all
enrich human experience. Georgists argue that more intensive use of
land sites, more efficient use of (and hence reduced consumption of)
material resources, and greater regard for the value of time will add
character to human life by encouraging mental capital more than by
physical capital. Enjoyment from reading books or exploring the
internet may finally trump snowmobiles and stock car racing. This
value-added dimension of human awareness comports with the
environmentalist argument that it is the lack of access to nature that
frequently makes people regard it as an instrument.<br>
<br>
The focus of Henry George&#8217;s inquiry, and of his disciples, is the
pursuit of justice. Economic justice is an agenda which ecological
economists also subscribe to, even though their immediate focus is
concern about the earth&#8217;s survival at all, let alone the distribution
of its fruits. Here, however, is where the Georgist tradition is able
to contribute most to the environmental justice program. There is a
broad appreciation, particularly among ecological economists that have
worked in poorer nations, that natural resources are endangered every
bit as much by the scarcity of basic necessities as by overpopulation.
Urban elites usurp high value lands and retain land rents growing out
of their production; poor people are marginalized and left to fend for
themselves. They often survive by taking what little environmental
resources are left on ravaged land sites, further reducing the
resiliency of these local ecologies. Collection and redistribution of
land rents, either in the form of public services or in the form of a
citizens&#8217; dividends, offers a way to restore equity without
redistribution of land titles and without all the dislocations this
might entail. Many third world leaders at the present time see
solutions to poverty and economic inequality in the redistribution of
land titles. Georgists argue that this is not necessary; all that is
necessary is to recover the land rent and assure its equitable
distribution to rightful claimants. <br>
<br>
There is currently a renewed and worldwide interest in Georgist
approaches, especially among former nations of the eastern block and in
Cuba where Georgist scholars and advocates have been invited to visit
several times.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">133</span></small>
Herman Daly appears by one of his most recent papers<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">134</span></small> to
be ever more closely drawn to the Georgist position that the &#8220;from
the point of view of equity it matters a great deal who receives the
prize for nature&#8217;s increasingly scarce services. Such payment is the
ideal source of funds with which to fight poverty and finance public
goods.&#8221;

Professor Daly goes on to say that<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Value added belongs to whoever added
it. But the original value of that to which further value is added by
labor and capital should belong to everyone. Scarcity rents to natural
services, nature's value added, should be the focus of redistributive
efforts. Rent is by definition a payment in excess of necessary supply
price, and from the point of market efficiency is the least distorting
source of public revenue.&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Appeals to the generosity of those who
have added much value by their labor and capital are more legitimate as
private charity than as a foundation for fairness in public policy.
Taxation of value added by labor and capital is certainly legitimate.
But it is both more legitimate and less necessary after we have, as
much as possible, captured natural resource rents for public revenue. <br>
<br>
The above reasoning reflects the basic insight of Henry George,
extending it from land to natural resources in general. Neoclassical
economists have greatly obfuscated this simple insight by their refusal
to recognize the productive contribution of nature in providing "that
to which value is added". In their defense it could be argued that this
was so because in the past economists considered nature to be
non-scarce, but now they are beginning to reckon the scarcity of nature
and enclose it in the market. Let us be glad of this, and encourage it
further.<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I am not advocating revolutionary
expropriation of all private property in land and resources. If we
could start from a blank slate I would be tempted to keep land and
minerals as public property. But for many environmental goods,
previously free but increasingly scarce, we still do have a blank slate
as far as ownership is concerned. We must bring increasingly scarce yet
unowned environmental services under the discipline of the price
system, because these are truly rival goods the use of which by one
person imposes opportunity costs on others[2]. But for efficiency it
matters only that a price be charged for the resource, not who gets the
price. The necessary price or scarcity rent that we collect on newly
scarce environmental public goods (e.g. atmospheric absorption
capacity, the electromagnetic spectrum) should be used to alleviate
poverty and finance the provision of other public goods.<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The modern form of the Georgist insight
is to tax the resources and services of nature (those scarce things
left out of both the production function and GDP accounts) -- and to
use these funds for fighting poverty and for financing public goods. Or
we could simply disburse to the general public the earnings from a
trust fund created by these rents, as in the Alaska Permanent Fund,
which is perhaps the best existing institutionalization of the Georgist
principle. Taking away by taxation the value added by individuals from
applying their own labor and capital creates resentment. Taxing away
value that no one added, scarcity rents on nature's contribution, does
not create resentment. In fact, failing to tax away the scarcity rents
to nature and letting them accrue as unearned income to favored
individuals has long been a primary source of resentment and social
conflict.<br>
</div>
The justice in the Georgist tradition grows out of the premise that one
is entitled to what one makes with one&#8217;s own hands or mind, but one is
not personally entitled to the gains that grow out of communal efforts.
Those are owed to and should be returned to the community. The justice
inherent in ecological economics, to the extent that it has solidified,
involves a recognition that preservation of natural capital is in the
interest of everyone. Both recognize and value the preservation of a
world commons in nature. Both appreciate the diversity preserved in
local community institutions and cultures. Both accept models based on
self-regulating assumptions &#8212; in one case using the phrase &#8220;steady
state&#8221; economics, in the other case the recovery of land rent in the
pursuit of open and stable markets over monopoly control. There is
great promise in the confluence of the two perspectives: they offer a
solution to the age-old challenge of resolving what in the world ought
to be public and common, and what else ought to be individual and
private. It remains now for proponents of each perspective to continue
exploring commonalities. <br>
<br>
Alternatives that have been tried in the past, both classic capitalism
and socialism, suggest that neither has served the interests of
humanity well in the long term. Ecological economics has no theory of
property as such, and Georgism here offers a proven course of
application. To Georgists, ownership is linked to use and not to
freehold title. Holding individual property under license of the
community, and under terms which the community stipulates, is an idea
with a long tradition, well accepted, and needing only to be revived in
contemporary political, legal and economic discourse. Combined with the
pricing device of collecting land rent, ecological economics will have
a tool by which to circumscribe and even reverse the centrifugal forces
of a new economic imperialism. This is truly the beginning of a &#8220;Third
Way&#8221; when other theories seem to be moribund.<br>
