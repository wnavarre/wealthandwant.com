<div style="margin-left: 40px;">(The municipal laws of every country
are not only observed as a rule of conduct, but by the bulk of the
people they are regarded as the standard of right and of wrong, in all
matters to which their regulations are extended.<br>
<br>
In this prejudice, however natural to the crowd, and however salutary
it may be deemed, men of enlarged and inquisitive minds are bound by no
ties to acquiesce without enquiry.<br>
<br>
Property is one of the principal objects of municipal law, and that to
which its regulations are applied with greatest efficacy and precision.
With respect to property in movables, great uniformity takes place in
the laws of almost all nations; they differ only as being more or less
extended to details, comprehending the diversity of commercial
transactions; and this branch of jurisprudence may be said to have
almost attained to its ultimate maturity and perfection.<br>
<br>
But with respect to property in land, different principles have been
adopted by different nations in different ages; and there is no reason
why that system which now prevails in Europe, and which is derived from
an age not deserving to be extolled for legislative wisdom, or regard
to the equal rights of men, should be supposed to excel any system that
has taken place elsewhere, or to be in itself already advanced beyond
the capacity of improvement, or the need of reformation.<br>
<br>
So let it be considered what regulations a colony of men settling in a
small island, just sufficient to furnish them subsistence, by the aid
of high cultivation, would probably establish in order to render the
independent subsistence of each individual secure, and to prevent any
one, or a few, from engrossing the territory, or acquiring a greater
share than might be consistent with the public good? Just such
regulations respecting property in land, it would be in the interest of
every state to establish at any period of its history.<br>
<br>
It is to a free and speculative disquisition, concerning the foundation
of this right of property in land, and concerning those modifications,
by which it may be rendered in the highest degree beneficial to all
ranks of men, that the author of these pages wishes to call the
attention of the learned, the ingenious, and the friends of mankind. )<br>
</div>
<br>
All Right of property is founded either in occupancy or labour. The
earth having been given to mankind in common occupancy, each individual
seems to have by nature a right to possess and cultivate an equal
share. This right is little different from that which he has to the
free use of the open air and running water; though not so indispensably
requisite at short intervals for his actual existence, it is not less
essential to the welfare and right state of his life through all its
progressive stages.<br>
<br>
This right cannot be precluded by any possession of others and nor is
it tacitly renounced by those who have had no opportunity of entering
upon it. The opportunity of claiming this right ought to be reserved
for every citizen. In many rude communities, this original right has
been respected, and their public institutions accommodated to it;
whenever conquests have taken place, this right has been commonly
subverted and effaced; in the progress of commercial arts and
refinements, it is suffered to fall into obscurity and neglect.<br>
<br>
Speculative reasoners have confounded this equal right with that which
is founded in labour, and ascertained by mutual law. The right of a
landholder to an extensive estate must be founded chiefly in labour,
and the progress of cultivation gives an ascendant to the right of
labour over that of general occupancy. But the public good requires
that both should be respected and combined together, and although such
combination is difficult, and has rarely been established for any
length of time, it is the proper object of Agrarian laws, and effectual
means of establishing it may be devised. Almost all of Agrarian laws
have proceeded on the plan of restricting that extent of landed
property which an individual may acquire, and not the nature and the
force of that right with which the landholder is invested.<small
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1)</small> Thus
endeavouring to establish an equality of fortune, they have been found
impracticable, and, could they have been carried into execution, must
have proved detrimental.<br>
<br>
The value of an estate in land consists of three parts - the original,
the improved, and the improvable value. That every man has a right to
an equal share of the soil, in its original state, may be admitted to
be a maxim of natural law. It is also a maxim of natural law, that
everyone, by whose labour any portion of the soil has been rendered
more fertile, has a right to the additional produce of that fertility,
or to the value of it, and may transmit this right to other men. The
original and the improvable value of a great estate still belong to the
community, the improved alone to the landholder. (2)<br>
<br>
If the original value of the soil be the joint property of the
community, no scheme of taxation can be so equitable as a land-tax, by
which alone the expenses of the state ought to be supported until the
whole amount of that original value be exhausted; for the persons who
have retained no portion of that public stock, but have suffered their
shares to be deposited in the hands of the landholders, may be allowed
to complain, if, before that fund is entirely applied to the public
use, they are subjected to taxes, imposed on any other kind of
property, or any articles of consumption.<br>
<br>
A just and exact valuation of landed property is the necessary basis of
an equal land-tax. The original value is the proper subject of
land-taxes: the improvable value may be separated from the improved,
and ought to be still open to the claims of the community.<br>
<br>
How preposterous, then, is the system of that country which maintains a
civil and military establishment, by taxes of large amount, without the
assistance of any land-tax at all! - In that example may be perceived
the true spirit of legislation as exercised by landholders alone.
Property in land is the fittest subject of taxation; and could it be
made to support the whole expense of the public, great advantages would
arise to all orders of men. What then, it may be said, would not in
that case the proprietors of stock in trade, in manufacture and arts,
escape taxation, that is, the proprietors of one-half the national
income? They would indeed, be so exempted; and very justly, and very
profitably for the State; for it accords with the best interests of the
community, through successive generations, that active progressive
industry should be exempted, if possible, from every public burden.<br>
<br>
All property ought to be the reward of industry; all industry ought to
be secure of its full reward; the exorbitant right of the landholders
subverts both these maxims of good policy. It is the indirect influence
of this monopoly which makes a poors-rate necessary; requires unnatural
severity in penal laws; renders sumptuary laws unpolitical, and the
improvement of machinery for facilitating labour unpopular, and perhaps
pernicious. The oppressed state of the cultivators, being universal,
has been regarded by themselves and others as necessary and
irremediable. A sound policy respecting property in land is perhaps the
greatest improvement that can be made in human affairs.<br>
<br>
(And reformation in this important point is not to be despaired of; the
establishment of property in land has changed, and may hereafter
receive other innovations.)<br>
<br>
The chief obstacle to rapid improvement of agriculture is plainly that
monopoly of land which resides in the proprietors, and which the
commercial system of the present age has taught them to exercise with
artful strictness, almost everywhere. Hereafter, perhaps, some
fortunate nation will give the example of setting agriculture free from
its fetters. A new emulation will then arise among the nations
hastening to acquire that higher vigour and prosperity, which the
emancipation of the most useful of all arts cannot fail to produce.<br>
<br>
The actual state of Europe, with respect to property in land, is very
different from what might be desired. That exclusive right to the
improvable value of the soil which a few men, never in any country
exceeding one hundredth part of the community, are permitted to
engross, is a most oppressive privilege: by its operation, the
happiness of mankind has been for ages more invaded and restrained,
than by all the tyranny of kings, the imposture of priests, and the
chicane of lawyers taken together, though these are supposed to be the
greatest evils that afflict the societies of human kind.<br>
<br>
The rent which may be taken for land ought to be submitted to
regulations not less than the interest of money. Whatever good reasons
may be given for restraining money-holders from taking too high
interest, may with still greater force be applied to restraining
proprietors of land from an abuse of their right. By exacting
exorbitant rents, they exercise a most pernicious usury, and deprive
industry that is actually exerted of its due reward. By granting only
short leases, they stifle and prevent the exertion of that industry
which is ready at all times to spring up, were the cultivation of the
soil laid open upon equitable terms. It is of more importance to the
community, that regulations should be imposed on the proprietors of
land, than on the proprietors of money; for land is the principal stock
of every nation, the principal subject of industry, and the use of
which is most necessary for the happiness and due employment of every
individual.<br>
<br>
Nor is it less practicable to adapt regulations to the use of land than
to the use of money, were the legislative body equally well inclined to
impose salutary restrictions on both. The glaring abuses of the one
might be as effectually prevented as those of the other; although the
total exclusion of all manner of abuse from either is not to be looked
for. But that class of men in whom the strength of every government
resides, and the right of making or the power of influencing and
controlling those who possess the right of making laws, have generally
been borrowers of money and proprietors of land.<br>
<br>
The monopoly of rude materials, indispensably requisite for carrying on
any branch of industry, is far more pernicious than the monopoly of
manufactured commodities ready for consumption. The monopoly possessed
by landholders is of the first sort, and affects the prime material of
the most essential industry.<br>
<br>
The monopoly possessed by land-holders enables them to deprive the
peasants not only of the due reward of industry exercised on the soil,
but also of that which they may have opportunity of exercising in any
other way, and on any other subject; and hence arises the most obvious
interest of the landholder, in promoting manufactures.<br>
<br>
That nation is greatly deceived and misled which bestows any
encouragement on manufactures for exportation, or for any purpose but
the necessary internal supply, until the great manufactures of grain
and pasturage are carried to their utmost extent -- it can never be in
the interest of the community; it may be in that of the landholders,
who desire indeed to be considered as the nation itself, or at least as
being representatives of the nation, and having the same interest with
the whole body of the people.<br>
<br>
(When mention is made in political reasonings of the interest of any
nation, and those circumstances, by which it is supposed to be injured
or promoted, are canvassed, it is generally the interest of the
landholders that is kept in view.)<br>
<br>
In fact, however, their interest is, in some most important respects,
directly opposite to that of the great body of the community, over whom
they exercise an ill-regulated jurisdiction, together with an
oppressive monopoly in the commerce of land to be hired for cultivation.<br>
<br>
Property in Land, as at present established, is a monopoly of the most
pernicious kind. The interest of landholders is substituted for that of
the community; it ought to be the same, but it is not. The landholders
of a nation levy the most oppressive of all taxes; they receive the
most unmerited of all pensions: if tithes are oppressive to industry,
rents capable of being raised from time to time are much more so.<br>
<br>
Regarding the whole wealth of the community, as belonging of right to
themselves, landholders stand foremost in opposing the imposition of
exorbitant taxes by the State, forgetting the exorbitancy of that
taxation which they themselves impose on the cultivators of the soil,
and which the sovereign may in justice, and in the way of retaliation
ought to, regulate and restrain. They clamour aloud against pensions
and sinecure places, bestowed by the sovereign, not adverting that
their own large incomes are indeed pensions, and salaries of sinecure
offices, which they derive from the partiality of municipal law in
favour of that order of men by whom its regulations are virtually
enacted.<br>
<br>
There are districts in which the landholder's rents have been doubled
within fifty years, in consequence of a branch of manufacture being
introduced and flourishing, without any improvement in the mode of
agriculture, or any considerable increase of the produce of the soil.
Here, therefore, the landlords are great gainers, but by what industry
or attention have they earned their profits? How have they contributed
to the progress of this manufacture, unless by forbearing to obstruct
it? And yet from the necessity under which the manufacturing poor
lived, of resorting to these landholders to purchase from them the use
of houses and land, for the residence of their families, they have been
enabled to tax their humble industry at a very high rate, and to rob
them of perhaps more than one-half of its reward.<br>
<br>
Had the manufacturers of such districts possessed what every citizen
seems entitled to have, a secure home of their own - had they enjoyed
full property in their lands; would not then the reward of their
industrious labour have remained entire in their own hands?<br>

<br>
The encouragements granted to commerce and manufactures, and so
universally extolled, seem merely schemes devised for employing the
poor and finding subsistence for them, in that manner which may bring
most immediate profit to the rich: and these methods are, if not
deliberately, at least without inquiry, preferred to others, which
might bring greater advantage to the body of the people directly, and
ultimately even to the rich themselves.<br>
<br>
What is it that in England restrains the early marriages of the poor
and industrious classes of men? Alas! not the Marriage Act but a system
of institutions more difficult to be reformed; establishing in a few
hands that monopoly of land by which the improvable as well as the
improved value of the soil is engrossed. It is this which chiefly
occasions the difficulty of their finding early and comfortable
settlements in life, and so prevents the consent of parents from being
given before the legal age. It is this difficulty which even after that
age is passed still withholds the consent of parents, restrains the
inclinations of the parties themselves, and keeps so great a number of
the lower classes unmarried to their thirtieth or fortieth years,
perhaps for their whole lives.<br>
<br>
What other reason can be given, than the influence of this monopoly,
why in countries, for many ages not thinly inhabited, nor unacquainted
with the arts of agriculture, so great a proportion of the soil should
still remain barren, or at least far below that state of fertility, to
which the judicious cultivation of independent occupiers could bring it?<br>
<br>
While the cultivable lands remain locked up, as it were, under the
present monopoly, any considerable increase of population, though it
seems to add to the public strength, must have a pernicious influence
on the relative interests of society, and the happiness of the greater
number. By diminishing the wages of labour, it favours the rich,
fosters their luxury, their vanity, their arrogance; while on the other
hand, it deprives the poor of some share of their just reward and
necessary subsistence.<br>
<br>
It were unjust to censure the proprietors of land, however, for
retaining and exercising, as they do, a right whose foundations have
not been inquired into, and whose extent no one has ever yet
controverted. It is the situation in which they find themselves placed
that prompts their conduct; nor can they readily conceive either the
injustice or the detriment which the public suffers, by permitting such
rights to be exercised. On the other hand, the farmers and cultivators
have no clear perception of the injustice and oppression which they
suffer. They feel indeed, and they complain, but do not understand, or
dare not consider steadily, from what cause their grievances take their
rise. The oppressive rights of the one order, and the patient
submission of the other, have grown up together insensibly from remote
ages, in which the present state of human affairs could not have been
foreseen.<br>
<br>
The public good requires that every individual should be excited to
employ his industry in increasing the public stock, or to exert his
talents in the public service, by the certainty of a due reward.
Whoever enjoys any revenue, not proportioned to such industry or
exertion of his own, or of his ancestors, is a freebooter, who has
found means to cheat or to rob the public, and more especially the
indigent of that district in which he lives. But the hereditary revenue
of a great landholder is wholly independent of his industry, and secure
from every danger that does not threaten the whole State. It increases
also without any effort of his, and in proportion to the industry of
those who cultivate the soil. In respect of their industry, therefore,
it is a taille or progressive tax of the most pernicious nature; and in
respect of the landholder himself, it is a premium given to idleness,
an inducement to refrain from any active useful employment, and to
withhold his talents, whatever they are, from the service of his
country. If the circumstances in which he finds himself placed
stimulate to any exertion at all, it is that insidious vigilance by
which he himself is debased, and his dependents at once corrupted and
oppressed.<br>
<br>
It has been required of the magistrate that he should with the same
assiduity apply rewards to virtue as punishment to vice. The part which
he has to act in respect or these cases is very different. The natural
sentiments of men are sufficient to repress smaller vices, and to
encourage and reward great and striking virtues; but they are not
vigorous enough to apply adequate punishment to great crimes, nor
steady and uniform enough to secure due reward and regular
encouragement to the common and ordinary virtues of human life.<br>
<br>
Every man, and every order of men, have their peculiar commodity, which
they bring to market for the service of the community, and for
procuring the means of their own subsistence. It would be injustice and
oppression, therefore, if any one order were to impose restrictions on
any other, respecting the price they may demand for their peculiar
commodity. This injustice, however, certain higher orders have
attempted, though generally without success, to put in practice, on
various occasions, against their inferiors -- against hired servants,
day labourers, journeymen, artists of various kinds -- by prescribing
limits to the wages they are allowed to ask or to receive.<br>
<br>
These lower classes of citizens have only the labour of their hand for
their commodity, and if any is more than another entitled to the
privileges of a free and equal market, it is surely that which may be
accounted more immediately the gift of nature to each.<br>
<br>
The community has a right, no doubt, to restrain individuals from doing
aught that may be pernicious or offensive: what right it can have to
compel them to exert their industry for the public service, at a
regulated price, may admit of question, excepting only those cases in
which the safety of the state is brought into immediate and evident
danger.<br>
<br>
The indirect and remote influences of this monopoly are productive of
many unnatural situations and many pernicious effects, which the skill
of legislature is frequently employed in vain to redress. Were this
monopoly anywhere removed, and the cultivation of the soil laid open
upon reasonable terms, the lowest classes of men would not be destitute
of wherewithal to maintain their decayed and infirm relations and
neighbours. These charitable attentions, prompted by private affection,
would be better discharged, than when they devolve on the public; and
all that encouragement to idleness, that waste, and mismanagement,
inseparable from poor rates, and other public institutions of this
sort, would be spared.<br>
<br>
Sumptuary laws have been frequently turned into ridicule, and not
unjustly, as pretending to maintain an impracticable simplicity, and an
unnecessary austerity of manners, among the great body of citizens; but
they deserve a very different estimation, if considered as means of
directing the public industry to those exertions which may be
productive of the most extensive utility, and most valuable enjoyments
to the community at large.<br>
<br>
If those persons who spend their days in the manufactures of velvet and
of lace could be induced to employ the same industry in raising grain,
potatoes, and flax, would they not, by increasing the plenty of these
necessary commodities, augment the real accommodation of a very
numerous class of citizens? And would not the happiness thence arising
more than compensate the scarcity of those frivolous refinements which
may be required for the gratification of a few?<br>
<br>
Why should it be necessary to restrain the industry which ministers to
luxury ? - Because the industry which is productive of essential
plenty, is restrained.<br>
<br>
In a country where the opportunities of exercising a natural
employment, and finding an easy subsistence, were thus laid open to
all, the temptations to theft and other violations of property would be
very much diminished; nor could it be thought necessary to restrain
such crimes by the unnatural severity of capital punishments.<br>
<br>
In such a country no suspicion could arise, no surmise would be
listened to, that the invention of machines for facilitating mechanical
labour, could ever be pernicious to the common people, or adverse to
the prosperity of the State.<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps no government can claim to itself the praise of having attended
with the same impartial care, to the interests of the lower, as of the
higher classes of men. Those who are employed in cultivating the soil
are placed below the regard of men in higher stations of public dignity
and trust; nor are their sufferings and wrongs obtruded on every eye,
like the misery of the begging poor. They themselves are not much
accustomed to reflection; they submit in most countries to their hard
fate, as to the laws of nature; nor are they skilled, when severer
oppression has at any time awaked them to a sense of the injustice they
suffer, in making known their feelings and their complaints to others.
But if the intelligent, and the friends of mankind, will take some
pains to inquire into the nature and extent of that oppression, under
which the industrious groan, and the force of that exorbitant monopoly,
from whence their grievances proceed; and if such men will employ the
talents which nature has given them, in explaining these grievances,
and the rigour of that monopoly, to the whole world, -- Europe,
enlightened Europe, will not be able to endure it much longer; and the
subversion -- nay, even the abatement-- of this monopoly, with the
abuses flowing from it, may well deserve to be accounted the best, and
most valuable fruit of all her refinements and speculations.<br>
<br>
If it be indeed possible to accomplish any great improvement in the
state of human affairs, and to unite the essential equality of a rude
state, with the order, refinements, and accommodations of cultivated
ages, such improvement is not so likely to be brought about by any
means, as by a just and enlightened policy respecting property in land.
It is a subject intimately connected with the proper occupation and the
comfortable subsistence of men; that is, with their virtue and their
happiness. It is of a real substantial nature, on which the regulations
of law may be made to operate with efficacy, and even with precision.<br>
<br>
So powerful and salutary might the good effects of such an enlightened
policy prove, so beneficial such a restoration of the claims of nature
and the general birth rights of mankind, that it might alone suffice to
renovate the strength of nations, exhausted by civil war, or by great
and unsuccessful enterprises; and even in the most flourishing states,
it might give rise to a new era of prosperity, surpassing all example,
and all expectation that may reasonably be founded on any other means
of improvement.<br>
<br>
If we consider only how far the present state of property in land even
in the best governed nations of Europe, is removed from that more
equitable and advantageous system, we may almost be led to despair that
any great progress can be made towards so remote an improvement,
however much it may be desired.&nbsp; On the other hand, the actual
system of landed property in Europe is greatly changed from what it has
formerly been. It has varied its form, with the prevailing character of
successive ages; it has been accommodated to the rude simplicity of the
more ancient times, to the feudal chivalry of the middle centuries, and
to the increasing industry and cultivation of later more tranquil
periods. It may now therefore be expected to receive a new
modification, from the genius and maxims of a commercial age, to which
it is too manifest that the latest establishment of landed property is
by no means adapted, and that from this incongruity the most pernicious
and most flagrant oppressions arise.<br>
<br>
In the progress of the European system of landed property, the
domestic, the feudal, and the commercial stages may be distinguished.
In the first, the condition of the cultivator was secured from any
great oppression, by the affectionate sympathy of the chief of his
clan. In the second, it was still secured, and almost as effectually
secured, by that need which his lord had of attachment, assistance, and
support, in the frequent military enterprises and dangers in which he
was engaged.<br>
<br>
But in the commercial state there is no natural check which may
establish the security of the cultivator; and his lord has hardly any
obvious interest but to squeeze his industry as much as he can. It
remains, therefore, for the legislatures of different countries to
establish some control for protecting the essential interests of their
common people. It is an object which deserves, and will reward, their
care. In the dark and disorderly ages the oppression exercised over the
cultivators could not be reduced to a system. Their landlords depended
on their assistance and military services, and would not, therefore,
hazard the diminution of their attachment. If at any time the landlord
endeavoured to exact more than they were inclined to give, means of
concealment and evasion were not wanting, by which his rapacity might
be effectually eluded. But in the present times there is no reciprocal
dependence, and all means of concealment and evasion are rendered by
the order of our laws uncertain, or, indeed, vain.<br>
<br>
In those disorderly times, whatever oppression, or chance of
oppression, the cultivators of the field were exposed to, they saw
their landlord exposed to others, perhaps greater and more frequent.
There was common to both an uncertainty in the possession of their just
rights; and to compensate this, a chance of obtaining by address
somewhat beyond these rights. In the present times, these common
chances are removed by the protection of established government. The
rights of the higher orders are rendered perfectly secure, while those
of the cultivators are laid open to their oppressions.<br>
<br>
That free discussion which every subject now receives gives reason to
hope that truth and utility will always triumph, however slowly. In
politics, in agriculture, in commerce, many errors have been rectified
in theory, and even the practice in some (though not in an equal
degree) reformed. And shall it be reckoned, then, that in this, the
most important of all temporal concerns to the greatest number of
mankind, the most pernicious errors will be suffered to remain still
unrefuted, or if not unrefuted still unreformed? It is not permitted to
the friends of mankind to despair of aught which may tend to improve
the general happiness of their species, any more than it is consistent
with a magnanimous and genuine patriotism ever to despair of the safety
of our country.<br>
<br>
The collective body of the people, if at any time their power shall
predominate, ought above all things to insist on a just regulation of
property in land. It belongs to the community to establish rules by
which this general right may become definite; but not to recognise such
a right at all, not to have established any rules by which its claims
may be ascertained and complied with, ought to be accounted essentially
unjust. Means may certainly be discovered by which this general right
of the community in the property of the soil may be clearly and
practically ascertained.<br>
<br>
Internal convulsions have arisen in many countries by which the
decisive power of the State has been thrown, for a short while at
least, into the hands of the collective body of the people. In these
junctures they might have obtained a just re-establishment of their
natural rights to independence of cultivation and to property in land,
had they been themselves aware of their title to such rights, and had
there been any leaders prepared to direct them in the mode of stating
their just claim, and supporting it with necessary firmness and
becoming moderation. Such was the revolution in 1688, at which time,
surely, an article declarative of the natural right of property in land
might have been inserted into the Bill of Rights, had the people at
large been beforehand taught to understand that they were possessed of
any such claim.<br>
<br>
Under circumstances of public distress, even the higher and privileged
ranks, awed into wisdom and humanity by the impending gloom, may be
inclined to acquiesce in those regulations which tend to renovate the
whole body of the State, though at the expense of diminishing in some
degree the privileges and emoluments of their own order. They will
consider that, unless the numbers, the industry, and the manly temper
of the body of the people can be kept up, the fortune of the community
must fall into continual and accelerated decline, and the privileges of
every rank become insecure.<br>
<br>
If, in the meantime, commerce is restrained and manufactures decline,
let the cultivation of the soil be laid open, on reasonable terms and
without delay, to the people thus deprived of their usual employment;
such a resource would convert what they must account a misfortune into
an opportunity of finding real and natural happiness.<br>
<br>
What more effectual preparation can be made for the most vigorous
defence of national liberty and independence, than to interest every
individual citizen more immediately and directly in the welfare of his
country, by giving him a share in the property of the soil, and
training him to the use of arms for its defence. The former of these
means of public security and defence is scarcely less requisite than
the latter, the propriety of which is so generally understood.<br>
<br>
As for the beneficial effects of such a statute, the candid and
intelligent are requested to estimate in their own thoughts what these
might prove in the district with which they are most particularly
acquainted, and to consider whether it would not very much improve the
condition and the prospects of the day labourer, the hired servant and
the working manufacturer, without imposing on the established farmer or
the landlord any unjust inconvenience? Whether it would not lessen the
number of the indigent and the idle? After having made this estimate,
let them consider what might have been the present state of that
district had such a progressive Agrarian law been established there one
hundred or even fifty years ago.<br>
<br>
Various objects have engaged the enthusiasm and excited the efforts of
mankind in successive ages; schemes of conquest and settlement in one
age; plans of civil and religious liberty in another; manufactures and
commerce have now their turn; and perhaps in some not very distant age
a just regulation of property in land may become the chief object of
public spirited endeavours.<br>

Editor's Notes:<br>
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> In Scotland today the same mistake is
still being made!</span><br>
Under land monopoly, the &#8220;nature&#8221; of the landowner&#8217;s &#8216;right&#8217; - actually
a &#8216;privilege&#8217; - is society&#8217;s permission to extract that rental payment
which by right (birthright) is the community&#8217;s own: and the &#8220;force&#8221; of
this &#8216;right&#8217; is delivered by The Law of Rent and Depression of Wages
(see Further Reading). [Editor].<br>
<br>
The value of any piece of land can indeed be divided into the three
separate parts Ogilvie proposes, viz: 
<ul>
  <li>the <span style="font-weight: bold;">original </span>value
which the land might have borne in its &#8216;natural state&#8217;, prior to all
development;  </li>
  <li>the <span style="font-weight: bold;">improved </span>value
which it has received from the improvements and developments bestowed
upon it by the proprietor [buildings, cultivation, etc.]; and  </li>
  <li>the <span style="font-weight: bold;">improvable </span>value,
which the land may still receive from [possible and permitted] future
improvements and developments.</li>
</ul>
However, more recent thought recognises that for the purposes of site
valuation for public revenue, we need distinguish only between the
value of the unimproved site (which is entirely created by the presence
and economic activity of the community, and therefore belongs to it)
and the value of the improvements (which being created by the occupier
belongs to him). [Editor].<br>
<br>
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Ogilvie wrote
his Essay essentially as an agrarian-based proposal for change, the
land and tax reform he sets out addresses and resolves the key urban as
well as rural problems in Scotland today. After all, it is in our
cities, in the presence of concentrated populations, that by far the
highest land values are found; and the effects of the Community Ground
Rent measure would be just as beneficial here as in the country.
