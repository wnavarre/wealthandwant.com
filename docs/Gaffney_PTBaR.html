#5: Make Landowners Pay Their Taxes</a>
<p>"Make no small plans: they have no magic to stir men's blood,"
quoth Daniel Burnham. As a successful architect and planner, he knew
how to stir his clients' blood. However, his ringing phrase is
negative and preemptive, hence overstated. Leo Tolstoy noted in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">War
and Peace</span> that wars are won and lost by the sum of individual
confrontations on chaotic battlefields, where generals lose control.
Folk wisdom says "The Devil is in the details." We do need small
plans, lots of them, to implement big visions. My hat is off to the
trench warriors who are advancing the two-rate property tax reform
plans in Pennsylvania and New York, one small city at a time.</p>
<p>Let's rephrase Burnham in the affirmative: "<b><i>Make big plans:
they have magic to stir people's blood</i></b>." Big Plans imply
Grand Visions. Henry George had few peers at stirring his hearers'
blood, and agreed.</p>
<blockquote>"If you would move men, to what shall you appeal? Not their
pockets, but their patriotism; not selfishness, but sympathy.
Self-interest is a mechanical force, but in loyalty to higher impulses
men will give even life."</blockquote>
<p>Big Plans and Grand Visions inspire small ones. They also help
orient and coordinate them. They help us divide the major from the
minor, to direct our work most efficiently. This is what I will
attempt here.</p>
<p>Big Plans can also scare people, it is true. We see this right now
when drastic changes and new philosophies are moving in Congress.
That does not mean they won't prevail, however. They scare some
because they move many others. Abstract philosophies, living only in
intellectual undergrounds, build up slowly until suddenly they take
command. <b><i>This is how change occurs</i></b>.</p>
<p>Superficially it seems "sudden," but intellectually the way has
been paved by years of Grand Visions and Big Plans.</p>
<p>The upshot is, we need Big Plans with Details Ready. I speak here
of Big Plans with magic to stir the blood of those who<b><i> see the
benefits of supporting government from land and resource
rents.</i></b> I'll sketch the big picture, where details fit in, and
how they all fit together.</p>
<p><a name="Priority #1. Safeguarding the p"></a><b>Priority #1.
Safeguarding the property tax</b></p>
<p>We need to uphold and safeguard the property tax as the mainstay
of state and local finance. Remember, it is partly a tax on land
value. It is the institutional basis for much of the Georgist goal.
We speak of reforming the property tax, but first there must be a
property tax. Because it exists, we can modify it to tap land rent
for public uses in a non-catastrophic way, using traditional laws,
administrative agencies, and land tenures. Capping the property tax
rate, as in California, ties the hands of reformers.</p>
<p>There has been much ado about Hawaii's phased-in shift to a
two-rate property tax plan. However, Hawaii raises only 16% of its
state and local revenues from the property tax, so the rate is very
low. You can focus the Hawaiian property tax on land values 100%, and
still have an 84%-messed-up tax system. Studies would then show
little visible result from the reform. Critics would say "Ho-hum, we
told you so."</p>
<p>New Hampshire is another story. It raises 64% of its state and
local revenues from the property tax, double the U.S. mean of 32%.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New Hampshire is called a "low-tax"
state, but its property tax is
highest in the nation, per capita, at $1344. The U.S. mean is $699 per
capita, and it goes down to $174 per capita in Alabama.</span></p>
<p>Politicians whose priority is raising sales taxes for property tax
relief might study Alabama's economy overall, and ask if that is the
model they aspire to. Its per capita income ranks 41st in the U.S.
Meantime,
New Hampshire's marshy peneplains, barren granites, icy winters, and
impassable mountains are producing the 7th highest per capita income in
the
nation.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, fortunately, Assemblyman Richard Noyes is hard
at work upgrading the property tax. He is chair of the legislative
committee overseeing assessment quality; his priority is bringing
land assessments up to market, and building assessments down. He does
this by pushing for more frequent reassessment. Whatever he thus
achieves in The Granite State is magnified by its high dependence on
the property tax.</p>
<p>How about New York? It ranks near the middle in the ratio of
property taxes to all state and local taxes, at 33% (the U.S. mean is
32%). That is not because New York property taxes are low, but its
other taxes are high. So New York is an OK place to sow the seed of
2-rate tax-plan, but the harvest of any success will be sparser than
it would be in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>How about Pennsylvania? This state stands out for its efforts to
reform local property taxation but, sad to relate, it ranks below the
middle in the ratio of property taxes to all state and local taxes,
at 29%. It is low in property taxes per capita, at $609, less than
half the New Hampshire level.</p>
<p>Property tax reform in Pennsylvania is, therefore, heavily
diluted. Add to that the problem of overlapping tax jurisdictions:
when a city reforms its property tax, its county and school district
carry on as before. What changes, then, is just 1/3 of 28%, or about
9% of the complex of state and local taxes. Federal taxes are totally
untouched. Trench warfare in Pennsylvania cities is therefore
inchmeal, and the results hard to measure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">What happens when a state radically
slashes its property tax?
Michiganders are saying they must wait and see, but there is no need
for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To read
your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened since
California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.</p>
<p>The obvious direct results have been to cut public services, raise
other taxes, and lose credit rating.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our school support fell from #5,
nationally, to #40 in 1985 when last seen, still falling.  </li>
  <li>County road
maintenance is down to where my county (Riverside) is repaving its
roads at an annual rate of once every 130 years. Once in 20 years is
recommended here, and up north you generally need higher frequency.
You can't just build infrastructure and then stop paying for it, it's
a perpetual commitment. Thanks to urban sprawl, a high fraction of
our population now depends on these county roads.</li>
  <li>In 1978 we had a surplus in Sacramento. Since then we have raised
business taxes, income taxes, sales taxes and gas taxes, but go broke
every June. Now our State bond rating is last among the states. One
of our richest counties (Orange) has gone bankrupt; Los Angeles is on
the brink of it, saving itself by closing emergency rooms and
hospitals that serve as a last resort for the uninsured poor.</li>
  <li>The private sector is doing badly, too. Raising income taxes,
business taxes, and sales taxes is no way to stimulate an economy;
they are all a drag on work and enterprise. <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Our income per capita was down
from #7 to #12 among the states by 1992, then fell some more. From
1992-94, California was one of three states where median household
income fell.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Our unemployment rate is 9%, 50% higher than the
national mean of 6%.    </li>
    <li>Our poverty rate is 18%, compared to 14.5%
nationally.    </li>
    <li>Not surprisingly, therefore, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
only government function
that grows now is building and operating prisons.</span>    </li>
    <li>One of our few
rebounding industries is cinema, the art of escaping from reality: we
excel at that. Another thriving activity is that of auctioning off
used machinery for export to the east.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In 1993 there was net outmigration (including international
migration) from this state that has symbolized American growth since
time immemorial. It is unheard of. 426,000 people were lost, nearly
2% of the population. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is a
watershed change: imagine of all
states California, America's trend-setter, our El Dorado, The Golden
State, our Horn of Plenty, the safety-valve for job-seekers and
retirees and entrepreneurs from everywhere, the end of the rainbow,
losing population! It's almost enough to make a person click off the
TV and think!</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Our fall of income per capita is greater than appears from a
purely monetary measure. Real pay (in contrast $) has fallen more
because of the drastic rise in shelter prices. In San Francisco,
shelter takes 50 percent of the median income, with many other
cities, especially coastal ones, not far behind. It is unusual to
find livable quarters for less than $600 per month. The median home
price rose 163 percent during the 1980s to $258,000 (that is just the
median - the mean is higher). These prices are part of the C.O.L. of
all renters and new buyers, a part not fully incorporated in standard
CPI measures.</p>
<p>Some cities are in desperate straits. In 1976 San Bernardino was
chosen an "All American City, A City on the Go." Go it did: today 40
percent of its people are on welfare!</p>
<p>California is earthquake country. But it has always renewed
itself. It was different after the Northridge quake in the San
Fernando Valley, January 1994. This is the uppermiddle neighborhood
of Los Angeles, but now large pockets of ruined buildings remain,
unreconstructed, inhabited by vagrants and criminals: an instant
Bronx West. These ominous blighted sections portend the spread of
more blight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">It should give one pause. It is the
expectable consequence of what
the voters did. They rejected the concept of taxing inert wealth in
favor of the alternative: taxing liquidity, cash flow, work,
production and commerce. </span>The predictable result has been to
inhibit
economic activity, and encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.
They turned property from a functional concept into a sacred one;
from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce goods, and
pay taxes into a welfare entitlement.</p>
<p>California had a construction boom in the late 1980s, but it was
not healthy. It was marked by extreme scatter and instability.
Downtown L.A. was to become a great new financial capital. But it now
has nearly the highest office vacancy rate in the U.S., with of
course a high rate of builder bankruptcies. Speculative builders were
led on to over-build, in part by anticipated higher land rents and
prices. This Lorelei effect was magnified by national income-tax
provisions luring on speculative builders. But we have to ask why
California fell harder than other states, even with the
object-lessons of the oil states in clear view.</p>
<p>David Shulaman tersely summarized <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
distributive effects of
Prop. 13 </span>as he left us to become Chief Equity Strategist for
Salamon
Brothers in Manhattan: <span style="font-weight: bold;">"it breached
the social compact." </span>Alienation
is the result, and the results of alienation are the Rodney King
riots, arson and looting. (The consistent leader in death rate from
violent causes is New Mexico, with the lowest property tax in the
nation.) The Watts riots, you may object, preceded Prop. 13, and you
are right. However, the Watts riots were part of a national epidemic.
By 1967 there were riots with arson and looting in 70 or more
American cities. The Rodney King riots were endemic to California,
and they spread over a much wider area of Los Angeles than the Watts
riots did. The looters and arsonists were not all black, and the
targets were not all white, but mainly Korean-Americans who just
happened to be there minding their stores.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom now blames our California bust on the end of
the Cold War. Surely that is a factor, but as a casual explanation,
it is too pat, too easy and too convenient. It shifts the load onto
impersonal historical forces - the Marxist world view. Let us see if
it can survive analysis.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compare today with 1945. Los
Angeles' economy depended much more
on The Hot War, 1940-1945, than it every did on The Cold War.</span>
Los
Angeles' wartime boom had swelled its population as no other great
city, 1940-45. After 1945 the U.S. pulled the plug on defense
spending, more than today. Jane Jacobs, in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Economy of Cities</span>,
tells us what happened to military spending in Los Angeles after
1945. It lost 3/4 of its aircraft workers, and 80 percent of its
shipbuilders. It lost its military and naval overseas supply and
replacement businesses. Troops stopped funneling through. It got
worse: petroleum and cinema and citrus, its traditional exports, all
declined.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pundits then forecast a regional
collapse, but Los Angeles boomed
instead. </span>The wartime immigrants stayed. They formed creative,
innovative small businesses in large numbers, giving L.A. its
deserved reputation for having the most dynamic, flexible, adaptable
industrial base in the nation. Besides exporting goods, L.A. also
became more self-contained, providing itself with more of the goods
it previously imported. How could this be? Angelenos had access to
land, the basis of all supply and demand in any economy.</p>
<p>Between 1945-50, one-eighth of all new businesses started in the
U.S. were established in L.A. They were small, creative, flexible,
miscellaneous, and too varied and dynamic to classify. No Linnaeus
could sort them in static conventional boxes; they were the despair
traditional economic geographers and base theorists who were at a
loss to explain the region's thriving economy. The new Angelenos
stayed and started producing everything for themselves, some things
previously imported, and others never seen before.</p>
<p>Eastern firms established branch plants. Top eastern students came
to California's great university system and stayed behind to take
jobs and make careers here, then sent their children through
California's excellent public schools. California became famous for
supporting outstanding higher education, highways, water supplies,
public health, public safety, and other public services, all without
repelling business by taxation. There was a regional "El Dorado
Effect" as demand and supply grew together. Growing local demand
allowed for economies of scale serving local markets. Food and
shelter were cheap and abundant. Land for business was accessible,
providing a basis for the California self-contained phenomenon. A
"continental tilt" developed in both interest rates and wage rates,
drawing in eastern capital and labor. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why is that not
continuing
today?</span></p>
<p>The invisible, pervasive change is due to Proposition 13, which
makes it possible to hold land at negligible tax cost. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In 1945 land
was taxed at 3 percent every year, building a fire under holdouts to
turn their land to use. Today that same tax cost is well below 1
percent. Using <a href="Gwartney_Estimating_LV.html">Gwartney's
Rule of Thumb</a> (see below under #2, A,
"Reassessing Land Frequently") it is about 1/8 of 1 percent: a rate
of 1 percent applied to 1/8 of the true value.</span></p>
<p>Landowners are only taxed now if they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they are confronted by the
drag of our high business and employment and sales taxes,
necessitated by the fall of property taxes. A handful of
oligopolistic landowners control most of the market; small businesses
are squeezed out. This helps us segue from being at the cutting edge
of industrial progress to a third-world economy - from the NH model
to the AL model - with little relief in sight.</p>
<p>What was different then? We had high property tax rates, but they
were more focused on land than now, less on new buildings. Another
obvious difference was the lower burdens of sales tax, business tax,
and income tax. California was more hospitable to Georgist thinking
than perhaps any other state, shown by its long run of Georgist
political action in the prior thirty years. Most people today are
totally ignnorant of this subject. It has been deleted from our
history books. Here is a brief review.</p>
<p>Several states had "single-tax" movements and initiatives,
1910-14, but most of them petered out. In California they continued
through 1924, and then popped up again in 1934-38. In 1934 the "EPIC"
campaign of Upton Sinclair included a strong Georgist element - he
proposed the establishment of new factories and farms on idle land.
At the same time, Jackson Ralston was pursuing a pure land tax
initiative, 1934-38.</p>
<p>Sinclair and Ralston lost. But the very existence of such
political action in California, when the movement was torpid
elsewhere, tells us a lot. It reveals a large matrix of supportive
voters and workers, with effective leaders, to whom politicians
(including elected County Assessors) would naturally respond by
focusing on land assessments. Politicians survive by accommodating
and absorbing dissident movements. Even while "losing," such
campaigns raise consciousness of the issue. Thus,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> in California,
1917, land value constituted 72 percent of the assessment roll for
property taxation.</span></p>
<p>This remained the California norm for years. California was
different. Even into the 1960s, Sacramento County elected an avowed
single-tax Assessor, Irene Hickman; San Diego County harbored an
active movement for raising land assessments. The Henry George
Schools of San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento were
the most active such schools in the country: four in one state, when
most had none. State Senator Al Rodd, Chair of the Senate Finance
Committee, held hearings and tried to push land tax legislation
through his Committee in the 1960s and early 1970s. He assigned a
staffer, Jack Massen, to spend a year working out the detailed
effects on intergovernmentai relations. Assemblyman Dr. William
Filante, from a base of Georgist support in Marin County, picked up
the torch too.</p>
<p>California displayed amazing prosperity and growth up to 1978. It
had the resilience to shrug off the loss of war industries after 1945
and still grow "explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we
suffered a string of reverses. The timing, along with a priori
causative analysis, plus direct observations too numerous to review
support an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13.
Michigan, be warned: "This Could Happen to You.</p>
<p><a name="Priority #2: Enforce Good Laws"></a><b>Priority #2:
Enforce Good Laws </b></p>
<p><a name="Reassess Land Frequently"></a><b>Reassess Land Frequently
</b></p>
<p>It is important to assess land for tax purposes often, especially
on a rising market. (Landowners will see to it you do so on a falling
market.) Land appreciates most years, while buildings depreciate
physically every year. Lagging assessments therefore automatically
overtax buildings relative to land.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Assemblyman Richard Noyes has circulated data on the
effect of reassessment in NH. The land fraction of assessed value
rises each time there is a reassessment. Keene, NH leads with
frequent reassessments, a high fraction of land in the mix, and a
strong track record attracting enterprise and jobs.</p>
<p>In California, where we used to have good assessment, we now have
bad assessment legally mandated by Prop. 13. So long as land is
unsold, and/or not newly improved, its assessment rise is capped at 2
percent a year, while market prices soar. Here is one example of the
results. This year the Metro Water District of Southern California
(MWD) condemned 410 acres for its new Domenigoni Reservoir to expand
the system (to accommodate land speculators in the desert boonies).
The jury hit them for $43 million, which works out to about $1.95 a
square foot.</p>
<p>The question occurred to me, how does that square with the
assessed value for property taxation? I asked Ted Gwartney, a
professional appraiser with the Bank of America, to check the
assessed value. It is about seven cents a square foot; The
condemnation price, supposedly based on market value, is about 28
times the assessed value.</p>
<p>This is not the result of fractional assessment. In California we
assess property at 100 percent when land changes ownership or there
is a new building. Rather, this is the result of Prop. 13 and its
prohibition of market reassessment until land sells.</p>
<p>I thought that was startling, but Mr. Gwartney's reaction was,
"What else is new?" He, who works with such data every day, has a
rule of thumb that market land value in California today is about
eight times assessed value. That is important enough to repeat: our
assessed land values are routinely at 1/8 of true land value. I
wouldn't dare say that on my own authority, but Mr. Gwartney is here
to confirm it. He is a veteran appraiser; for many years he was
Director of Assessments for the entire Province of British
Columbia.</p>
<p>Does this help you understand why California landowners are now so
slow to adapt to new demands? In 1945 the assessors were building
fires under landowners, so they sought new strategies to meet new
circumstances. Today there remains a weak incentive to improve to
improve property: tax collectors generally cost them money when they
make improvements. Sit still, lie low, hire no one, hang on, produce
nothing, and your holding costs are negligible.</p>
<p>A little of the old magic lingers. In October, 1995, a 225-acre
parcel in Corona, the Chase Ranch, was sold to a builder, Coscan
Davidson Homes, for building 967 units. The previous owners, "GGS,"
including a Japanese insurance firm, were "seeking a way out. They
were behind in tax payments and GGS was losing its staying power,..."
quoth Stephen Doyle, spokesman for the buyer. It is that "staying
power" that stifles land use and production. Coscan wants to build
immediately. Even so, though, they plan to take five years to build
out the project - if everything goes well. This is the new,
post-Prop. 13 meaning of "immediately."</p>
<p>In spite of extreme underassessment, the assessed value of taxable
land in California is 40 percent of the total real estate value.
Imagine what it would be if assessed values were real values,
"marked-to-market,'' as the law used to stipulate. It would be over
70 percent, as in 1917. "Staying power" would go down; land use, jobs
and production would rise.</p>
<p><a name="Use the Building-Residual Metho"></a><b>Use the
Building-Residual Method of Allocating Value</b></p>
<p>It is equally important to use the "Building-Residual Method" of
allocating value between land and buildings. This means you value the
land first, as though it were vacant, based on highest and best use.
You subtract this land value from the total value of
land-&amp;-building as currently improved: the residual, if any, is
building value.</p>
<p>Valuing one lot or parcel this way, you have information needed
for valuing neighboring and other comparable parcels. Using a map
with value contours, you can value a whole city this way with
surprising ease and speed.</p>
<p>Using this method, I valued Milwaukee land in 1963 and 1967. The
building-residual method nearly tripled the land values reported by
the City Assessor, who was using the assessor's usual inconsistent
mix of various other methods. How's that again? Did I say tripled?
Yes, I really said "tripled." By his methods, buildings on the eve of
demolition were carrying values higher than their sites; by the
building-residual method these old buildings had no value at all,
which of course is why they were being torn down. Besides
depreciation and technological obsolescence, many buildings suffered
severe "locational obsolescence," owing to shifting demand patterns.
The land was re-usable, and had as much or more value without the
extant buildings.</p>
<p>Using the building-residual method requires no change in present
laws. It is within the latitude of assessing officials, who, in turn,
respond to public opinion. The conscientious citizens' move is to
educate and bring pressure, just as the old single-tax campaigners
like Jackson Ralston did. In the process of "losing" they won over
half of what they sought, just by taking a stand and making the
effort.</p>
<p><a name="Federal Income Taxes"></a><b>Federal Income Taxes
</b></p>
<p>One of assessors' greatest problems today is the strong pressures
from owners who want to allocate as much value as possible to
buildings that they may depreciate for federal income tax purposes.
Here is where we must study how the parts form the big picture. Here
is where federal and local tax policies intersect. Some Georgists
have neglected or misunderstood the income-tax treatment of land
income. Let us see how this works.</p>
<p>Congress and the IRS let one depreciate buildings, but not land,
for income tax. This important distinction harks back to when the
income tax was new, and Georgist Congressmen like Warren Worth
Bailey, from Johnstown, PA and Henry George Jr., from Brooklyn were
instrumental in shaping it.</p>
<p>When a building is new, the depreciable value is limited to the
cost of construction. The non-depreciable land is the bare land value
before construction. So far, so good. Over time, however, building
owners have converted this into a tax shelter scheme. Owner A, the
builder, writes off the building in a few years, much less than its
economic life, and sells it to B. "A" pays a tax on the excess of
sales price over "basis." The basis is reduced by all depreciation
taken, so any excess depreciation is "recaptured" upon sale. It is
defined by Congress as a "capital gain," and given the corresponding
package of tax preferences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>deferral of tax,</li>
  <li>lower rate,</li>
  <li>step-up of basis at time of death,</li>
  <li>tax-free exchanges, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus far, any tax preference goes to A, the builder, and may be
seen as a wellconsidered building incentive. Watch, however, what
happens next. "A" sells to B and B depreciates the building all over
again, from his purchase price. To do so, B must allocate the new
"basis" - i.e., his purchase price - between depreciable building and
non-depreciable land.</p>
<p>How shall B allocate the new basis? Enter the local tax assessor.
Here is where local assessment intersects with Federal income tax
policy. The IRS does not try to assess land and buildings. Instead,
IRS instructions tell taxpayers they may use locally assessed values
to allocate basis between depreciable buildings and non-depreciable
land. The IRS accepts this allocation as conclusive. As a result,
local owners of income property press their assessors to allocate as
much value as possible to buildings, and as little as possible to
land. This does not affect their local taxes, but lowers their
federal taxes. It lets them depreciate land.</p>
<p>Local revenues are not immediately affected. Local assessors have
little reason not to accommodate their constituents, local
landowners, to help them depreciate land for federal and state income
tax purposes. They have little reason to use the correct
"building-residual'' method of allocating value, and a compelling
reason to use the wrong method that understates land value. Thus they
convert non-depreciable land value into depreciable building value.
It is the modern version of "competitive underassessment." In the
process, they also convert the local property tax from a land tax
into a building tax.</p>
<p>After a while B sells to C, who in turn sells to D, so each
building is depreciated many times. So is a large part of the land
under it, tame after time, although it should not be depreciated at
all. This is carried so far that real estate pays no federal or state
income taxes at all.</p>
<p>The solution to this lies with the U.S. Congress. The need is to
limit depreciation to one cycle only. It is a most urgent problem for
both federal and local treasuries. We all have Congressmen. Write to
them and raise their consciousness. They are brokers who respond to
public opinion. It is we who are derelict.</p>

<p>There are rich jurisdictions and poor. Professor Tideman's paper
in this conference alludes to this matter in passing. Let us support
his point with some numbers.</p>
<p>In California, you might think that farm counties like Tulare have
a lot more taxable value per capita than cities, but au contraire.
Tulare
County reports assessed values per capita of $38,100; the whole State
averages $60,000 per capita. Suburban Marin County weighs in with
$95,400;
urban Los Angeles County has $59,000; Orange County has $74,000.</p>

<p>You might also think that Tulare, being rural, has a lot higher
fraction of land value in its mix, but again, not so. The<b><i> Land
Share of Real Estate Value (LSREV)</i></b> in Tulare County is 28
percent, compared to a statewide mean of 40 percent, and 47 percent
in Orange County. (This datum, and others of like kind, refute the
conventional belief that farm counties are heavy on land in the mix.
On this last point, I must respectfully take issue with my good old
friend Gene Wunderlich, whose paper at this conference suggests that
farm counties have higher land fractions. I wonder if he has perhaps
conflated building values with pure land values? My data, from
California State Board of Equalization, show lower land fractions in
real estate in the purely rural counties of the San Joaquin Valley.)
Grazing and mining counties like Inyo have high values of LSREV, but
they are a small share of the farm economy. (lnyo County, lightly
peopled but heavily cattled, has $136,000 per capita, with very few
human capita (and its cattle are exempt from the California property
tax). Major farm counties with intensive farms, like those of San
Joaquin Valley, have low values of LSREV.</p>
<p>Within counties, disparities among cities and school districts are
much greater. In Tulare County, one pathetic little povertyville, the
City of Parlier, has just $10,000 of assessed value per capita. Here
are some assessed values per capita from different California cities
in the County of Los Angeles: Lynwood, $21,500; Beverly Hills,
$294,000 (14 times Lynwood); City of Industry, $5,533,000 (257 times
Lynwood).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">This is why some critics call the
property tax "regressive." It
has given some plausibility to the otherwise bizarre claim that
switching to a sales tax is less regressive than sticking with the
property tax. </span>Within each city a property tax is progressive,
but
<span style="font-weight: bold;">when your data meld cities like poor
little Parlier and Lynwood with
Beverly Hills, you sometimes find poor people paying more of their
income in property taxes than rich people, and getting less for it.
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Switching just the
local property tax to land ex buildings will do
little or nothing to correct such disparities, and therefore make
little progress toward overall social justice, and the wide support
that will evoke. </span>There is, in fact, a natural cap on local
property
tax rates imposed by local particularism: the City Council of Beverly
Hills will not raise taxes in Beverly Hills for the benefit of voters
in Parlier.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To avoid such regressivity we must
work out some formula for power
equalization. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The most
straightforward formula is simply a statewide
land tax.</span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>On
this I must again applaud Dick Noyes in NH - not for
what he says, but what he does. What he says is that the genius of NH
is its local control of revenues; what he does is initiate bills for
a statewide land tax.</p>
<p>There are many other tax enclaves and exemptions by which much
property stays off the tax rolls. I have a long list, with about 35
items. Here I'll just focus on two: timber and oil.</p>
<p><a name="B. Timber and Timberland"></a><b>B. Timber and Timberland
</b></p>
<p>Standing timber is generally now exempt from property taxes, by
law or custom. Land remains on the property tax rolls. This sounds
like a Georgist idea; advocate Ellis Williams, a forest economist,
has made the point. It is, however, just partial and discriminatory
Georgism. The present system works as though you exempted half the
buildings in a city from a tax and raised the rate on the others.
Timber is exempt, but as soon as it is cut, milled, and hammered into
buildings, it goes on the property tax rolls. The bias is apparent
between capital in different forms.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standing timber still yields some
revenue when it is cut. The idea
has been to substitute a "yield-tax" for the property tax. </span>In
practice, though, yield tax rates are much too low to be
revenue-neutral. In California, for example, the yield tax rate is
2.9 percent. It is levied just once during the tree's life cycle of
60-100 years, at the end. Two and nine-tenths percent levied just
once at the end of each 60 years, is obviously less than one percent
levied every year, starting from year one. Values are low in the
sapling years, but well above zero, and in the last few years before
harvest, the stumpage is worth nearly as much as its harvest value. I
have calculated that a yield tax of 25 percent or so (varying with
the interest rate and the tree-life) is needed to have the same
present value as a one percent property tax.</p>
<p>Here is the revenue result in one major California timber county,
Mendocino. Its major property value is timber, but the County
government and its subdivisions hardly get dried beans from the yield
tax on it: $3.9 million in 1993, compared to $45 million from all
property. This is not because they are cutting timber slowly;
actually they are depleting the inventory. Neither is it because
other values are high. This County has no large cities. Most of its
people live outside the cities, and its annual timber harvest is
twice as high as the sum of all its other "agricultural" gross output
(including fishing). The net cash flow from timber harvests is much
more than twice as high as the net cash flow from other property,
because stumpage value is added mainly by property (land and trees),
while other farm products like grapes, fruits, and milk are more
labor-using.</p>
<p>How about land under the timber? It is separately valued, and kept
on the property tax rolls. However, it yields revenue of only $1.2
million: one-third of what the yield tax renders.</p>
<p>Why so little? They could raise the valuation of timber land to
compensate for exempting the trees. In addition, "timberland" in some
areas is sold for vacation homes and resorts. Assessors once began
using those sales to justify higher valuations. They also observed
smaller timberland owners paying higher unit prices than giant
corporate owners, and up-valued parts of their vast spreads
accordingly.</p>
<p>Timber owners had other ideas, however. Major owners like SP
(520,000 acres of timber in California) took alarm and went to
Sacramento for relief. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They
got their lands put in a "</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Timber Preserve
Zone" (TPZ)</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> wherein
land is assessed only on its putative value for
raising timber, regardless of market value, regardless of alternative
uses, and regardless of nontimber income from land growing timber.
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">These
"compatible" (untaxed) uses include grazing, resorts, vacation
homes, campsites, fishing, hunting, watershed protection, tourism,
rifle ranges, rights-of-way, mining, log storage, landings, roads,
logging camps, etc. There is also hemp for the drug trade: possibly
the state's most valuable farm crop, but unrecorded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">TPZ is hardly known outside the
timber counties, but it covers
vastly more than the better-known "Williamson Act" which provides for
preferential low assessment of farmland.</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> In Mendocino County, TPZ
land of medium grade ("<span style="font-weight: bold;">Site III"</span>)
is now tax assessed at $136/acre.
This is about ten percent of its value for growing timber</span>
(disregarding compatible uses), and a lesser fraction of its value
for higher-valued "incompatible" uses like retirement homes that
require formal "conversion" (obtainable on demand) out of TPZ. This
is how they keep the tax payments on TPZ land down to only $1.2
million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a name="The Role of Timber and Timberla"></a><b>The Role of
Timber and Timberland </b></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mendocino County</span>,
lying on the north coast, is redwood countty.
Redwood's value on the stump ("stumpage") this year is <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">53 cents</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">per
board foot (pbf) </span>when mature. In <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Shasta County</span>, timber
stumpage is
worth about half that, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">28
cents pbf,</span> and is heavily logged at that
value -- Shasta is our second biggest producer. If it is worth logging
great volumes of Shasta timber to get 28 cents pbf, then there is a
lot of surplus in Mendocino timber at 53 cents pbf. This surplus is
what makes this land so valuable for growing timber. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This surplus,
unvexed by taxation, is what makes these lands so attractive to, and
the play-things of corporate raiders, merger specialists,
speculators, arbitrageurs, lawyers, and junk-bond salesman living
thousands of miles away.</span></p>
<p>Redwood is a faster-growing species than most western timber
(although much slower than Yellow Pine in the southeastern states).
An acre of good (Site II) Mendocino land will yield a crop of 40,000
bf after 60 years of growth, worth about $20,000 on the stump at the
1995 prices. Discounting that to the present, using a real interest
rate of five percent, means dividing it by about 16. Add ten percent
for the present value of all harvests after 60 years, and you have
very roughly $1,400/acre for the land value based purely on timber
culture, considering no other values. Yet <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">under TPZ its assessed tax
value is $158, about 11 percent of its true value just for timber
culture. </span>This is accomplished by legislating the actual acre
values
(California Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). The legislated
formula mandates that "income-based" assessments be based on past
prices, projected into the far future with no adjustments for
inflation, but discounted at a high interest rate. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It is clear for
whose benefit this law was framed.</span></p>
<p>Meantime, urban demand is probing up north into southern Mendocino
County from the Bay Area and Sonoma County, its southern neighbor.
Mendocino has a long, scenic coastline with premium amenity values. A
significant fraction of the TPZ land has a speculative value for
resort, retirement, residential, urban and vacation uses, well above
its timber value. None of this is reflected in tax assessments: TPZ
protects against that, even though owners may convert out of TPZ at
will. Land may be classed as TPZ regardless of past, present, or
intended use.</p>
<p>The private area of Mendocino County is 1.9 million acres. Half of
that is timberland, with 863,000 acres in TPZ. At an estimated
$1.36/acre in taxes, this contributes $1.2 million to the County
budget. The County gets $45 million from all property, of which the
timberland fraction is 2.7 percent.</p>
<p>Add to that the yield tax of $3,9 million and you have timber and
timberland together providing about $5 million of Mendocino County
revenues. However, the County and its subdivisions (especially school
districts) get over $100 million in intergovernmental subventions
from Sacramento, paid by taxes on income, sales and businesses. By
comparison, the $5 million from timber is a paltry share indeed to
come from the most valuable resource in the County.</p>
<p>Timberland owners around the country have sold this bill of goods
to legislators. In many states, less than half the private land is
fully taxable, because of such laws. These are not all western or
southern states, either, as one might surmise. In NH, for example,
only 45 percent of the private land (and none of the Federal land) is
fully taxable. The rest is sheltered by the State's "Current Use" tax
law, their version of our TPZ law.</p>
<p>Advocates for these laws argue that land taxes, accumulating with
interest over long growth periods, would eat up all the profit from
growing timber. Let us see. Taxes of $1.56 per acre per year,
accumulating over 60 years at a real interest rate of five percent,
come to $552 per acre in constant 1995 dollars. At that time the
timber stumpage will be worth about $20,000 at 1995 prices, or 36
times the accumulated future value of the land taxes. (In addition,
the investment will have served to shield the owners from the eroding
effects of inflation, a benefit assumed away by using constant
dollars. On top of that, it is a good bet the real value of timber
will have risen after 60 years of population growth.)</p>
<p>Thus, land taxes would have to be 36 times what they are now to
consume the whole value of timber harvests. The fact is, present
taxes are a negligible token. Timberland is effectively sheltered
from the full weight (light as it is) of the one percent property tax
imposed on ordinary land. It pays, as we have seen, only about $1.2
million a year in Mendocino County.</p>
<p>The acre value of timberland is low compared with downtown values
in San Francisco, where one little square foot in the hottest spot
may fetch $2,000. That is $87 million per acre! However, there are
very few such golden acres, compared to a million acres of timberland
in Mendocino County, some 35 million acres in California, and 737
million acres in the U.S. That is 32 percent of the area of the 50
states. (The fraction of private and public land in forests is, by
coincidence, the same: 32 percent.)</p>
<p>Owing to the success of timber people in spreading their gospel,
almost all of their land is underassessed. Almost all state yield
taxes, imposed in lieu of property taxes on standing timber, are too
low to be revenue-neutral. Add to that, Congress since 1943 has made
timber a "capital asset" for federal (and therefore state) income
tax. Many costs of managing and carrying this capital asset are
expensible - certainly interest and property taxes are. The net
result is that timberland contributes very little to public revenues
at any level.</p>
<p>Residents of timber counties are typically scattered and poorly
organized. Timber companies are huge, rich, few and tightly
organized. In Mendocino County, Georgia Pacific and Louisiana
Pacific, absentee owners, together own the best 500,000 acres - 58
percent of the County's timberland - and Georgia-Pacific owns
Louisiana-Pacific. They control state forestry schools, paying
professors as consultants. They support research in forest economics
at think tanks like Resources for the Future in Washington, which has
never criticized their tax preferences but trained its big guns on
public agencies, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management. "The industry" controls tax laws in 50 states, and
sloughs tax burdens onto others. It will continue to do so until
other taxpayers in the timber counties wake up and organize to
control state timber tax laws.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In 1946 President Harry S. Truman,
with the stroke of a pen, added
50 percent to the area of the U.S. when he unilaterally extended our
traditional three-mile limit out to 200 miles. <span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></p>
<ul>
  <li>The first three miles
were soon given to the coastal states; California and Alaska both
raise large lease and tax revenues from their lands under these
coastal waters.  </li>
  <li>The next 197 miles, however, is unorganized
territory, outside the sovereignty and tax reach of any state, or
subdivision thereof.</li>
</ul>
Most of our domestic oil and gas is now produced from the seabed
under this water wilderness. The property is public domain under
federal BLM administration, but firms bid for leaseholds there under
a system that the majors seem to manipulate to their advantage. Even
so, there are some Federal revenues from both lease payments and
corporate taxes. State and local revenues, however; are nil.
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Counties
may, and often do assess and tax "possessory interests"
in leaseholds on federal uplands that lie within state boundaries.
They are helpless, however, to tax such property held offshore.</span>
The
property values are huge, and so are the firms that own the
leaseholds. Many firms own tens of millions of acres apiece, areas
larger than whole states. Offshore oil is our largest enclave
protecting rent-bearing lands from property taxation, and any other
form of state or local taxation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some form of national property tax
is called for; or higher lease
payments in lieu of taxes.</span> Perhaps some income tax surcharge is
the
best way, or special federal tax on net proceeds. This paper cannot
enter the thicket of what jurisdiction should have sovereignty to tax
offshore leaseholds, nor how best to levy the tax. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The point here is
that no system of resource-based taxation is complete,
philosophically or practically, that leaves this enclave
untouched.</span></p>
<br>
<a name="Tax All Natural Resources Unifo"></a><b>Tax All Natural
Resources Uniformly and Comprehensively </b>
<p>Advances in the arts and sciences keep disclosing new values in
old resources. Owing to institutional lag, these values can grow huge
without finding their way onto the tax rolls. A thoughtless reaction
is, "Bureaucrats want to tax everything!" <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The point is to tax all
natural resources uniformly and comprehensively, to end the lowering
taxes on incomes. productive business, and sales!</span> Land taxation
will
not win wide support, nor will it deserve to, if it is perceived as a
tax focusing on median homeowners, farmers, and merchants, while
exempting oilmen, media tycoons, and timber barons.</p>
<p>In addition to newly awakened <a name="resources"></a>resources,
many resources long known (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">water</span>)
are held in odd tenures that
have not been recognized as taxable property, although they should
be. Any comprehensive move toward using resource rents for public
revenue must include these varied resources and tenures. I have a
list of 30 or so, too many to treat here. To give a sampling, they

<p style="font-weight: bold;">In tapping these many varieties of
resources and tenures for
public revenues, citizens and their representatives may have to set
priorities. Two practical criteria rise to the top:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li>go first for the
big values, and  </li>
  <li>go for the soft targets.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The biggest values are probably in
energy, communications, water,
rights-of-way, zoning and street use.</span> Let's just look at what we
are
learning about <span style="font-weight: bold;">communications</span>.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Knowledge and entertainment
appear
both at top and bottom on man's hierarchy of needs.</span> People
without
even adequate shelter may be seen huddled around tv sets; people in
war, or under totalitarian governments, risk their lives to hear
smuggled broadcasts. People with higher incomes and security equip
themselves with mobile telephones, and call around the world; they
rush to get on the information highway. AT&amp;T was the biggest
non-financial corporation in the world before splitting up.
Newspapers depend on their "wire" services: one of the first Great
American Monopolies was Western Union and its news appendage, AP.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent FCC auctions have fetched
billions of dollars for spectrum
licenses, but this is like selling the badlands after giving away the
beachfronts. </span>The values of extant licenses given away ion the
past,
especially spectrum in top locations, are much higher. AT&amp;T
recently paid $112.5 billion for the McCaw Company's spectrum
licenses, which are a smattering of all that is out there. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
licenses should be on the property tax rolls in the jurisdictions
that they cover. </span>The revenue possibilities are staggering.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">How about soft targets? </span>A
soft target is any tenure recently
created, in a field that is easy to understand. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries </span>come to
mind. In the last few years governments in Canada and the U.S. have
limited allowable fish hauls by excluding new fishing boats and
imposing quotas on the owners of old ones. This "imposition" amounts
to a gift. Some quotas swiftly rose in value to over $1 million each,
suddenly creating a class society where before there was equal
opportunity. There is now a class of nouveau, instant millionaires
and parlor fisherman who rent out their quotas to working
fishermen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Very likely it is wise to limit
fish catches and avoid the
"tragedy of the commons." It is also necessary to police the waters
and keep out alien interlopers, a dicey business calling for the full
power of a strong national government. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">It is not necessary, however,
to give away the quotas so dearly policed.</span></span> It is obvious
to any
objective observer that the quotas should be sold or (better) leased
to the highest bidder. If the Feds insist on giving them away, states
and localities should class them as taxable property subject to a
high rate. The best time to levy appropriate charges is when quotas
are new, and the injustice of the present dispensation is apparent to
all.</p>
<p>Another soft target is the Manhattan taxi license, or "medallion."
For some reason this has long been a favorite object lesson among
economists, even as they shut their eyes to grosser sources of rent.
It may be because cabbies are rude and visible and lower class, but
whatever the reasons these writers have shown their consciousness of
the rent aspect of medallions, and raised the consciousness of
others.</p>
<p>The reason for pursuing soft targets is not for the money they may
yield, but for principle. Once the principle is understood and
established, wider applications should follow. In economic principle,
fishing quotas and taxi medallions are just like conventional land
titles: privileged control over limited natural resources. If it
makes sense to socialize the rent from quotas and medallions, why not
land titles too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="Priority #4. What Tax to Fight"></a><b>Priority #4. What
Tax to Fight First?</b></p>
<p>We must set priorities on taxes to lower and eliminate. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
Georgist [geoist] objective is dual: to raise taxes on land,
and to lower taxes on other bases.</span> Many Georgists have the
posture
and mindset of reforming just "the property tax," in a vacuum, but
this was never George's main point. There are other new or augmented
taxes more damaging and noxious than the property tax falling on
reproducible wealth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>state taxes on retail sales;  </li>
  <li>payroll taxes;  </li>
  <li>income taxes falling on wages and salaries;  </li>
  <li>excise taxes; etc.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some Georgists have supporting wiping
out taxes on "personal"
(movable) property. </span>Political success be the test, this
movement has
won massively (although silently) in state after state, and in all
Canadian provinces. The result, though, is to do as much harm as
good, for the exemption of capital is partial and discriminatory.
"Real" (immovable) capital is still taxed, biasing the way investors
allocate capital. Indeed, some "real" property is changed into
"personal" property simply by unbolting it from the floor.
<p>The result is also regressive, because personal property in most
industries is more concentrated in ownership than real capital. In
farming, for example, personal property includes cattle, stored
grain, and farm machinery, but the owner's dwelling is real
capital.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Georgists have diverted their
efforts into wiping out the
property tax on standing timber, replacing it with a nominal yield
tax.</span> Again, the result is partial and discriminatory, biasing
investors to allocate more capital in the form of timber, and
correspondingly less in other forms. As noted earlier, the present
system works as though half the buildings in a city are exempted from
a tax and the rate on the others raised.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timber-exemption is highly
regressive because the ownership of
timber is much more concentrated than the ownership of homes of
loggers and mill-workers and retirees in the timber counties. It
would not be so bad if the land taxes on timber-growing sites were
raised enough to compensate for exempting the growing stock. However,
as we have shown, these site taxes are also held down to token
levels. </span>The net result is to turn timber and timberland owners
into a
huge public welfare case supported by a sophisticated brainwashing
machinery paid by the discretionary income and wealth of the
industry.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most Georgist activists today
devote most of their efforts to
lowering the property tax rate on urban buildings. </span>As we have
seen,
this effort is only effective in states that still rely heavily on
the property tax. Even in such states, all the gains won so
laboriously, trench-by-trench, in Pennsylvania can be lost overnight
should the State Legislature or the electorate decide to cap property
tax rates and meet the shortfall by raising consumer taxes and income
taxes. This has occurred in California, and been credibly threatened
in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>However, this effort is potentially productive, even in states
with low property tax rates, because it sets the stage for raising
the rates. Once buildings are exempted, a polity can raise tax rates
without driving away industry, capital, or talented people. Today,
politicians like California's Governor Pete Wilson enhance their
careers by starving schools and libraries and police in order to
attract and retain employers by offering lower tax rates. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Given a
property tax on land ex buildings, we could support the public
services without penalizing true industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To achieve that end, we must stifle
sales and payroll and income
taxes. They are the chief alternatives to property taxes. They are
inherently counterproductive because they are contingent on some
"taxable event" which is a constructive act of production or
exchange. </span>Henry George, in one of his striking similes,
observes that
a packhorse can carry a heavy load on its back, but hardly any load
if you bind it to the shins. Economic theorists write of the "excess
burden" of excise taxes, and the "Laffer Curve Effect;" lawyers write
of "taxable events:" both are saying the same thing in their own
argot. Sales and payroll and income taxes are like the load strapped
to the packhorse's shins, dragging on every step. Indeed, they are
more like a load bonded under each hoof: the horse has no burden if
it just stands still.</p>
<p>What, then, makes these regressive taxes so attractive to
landowners? Why this constant clamor and pressure to raise them to
provide "property tax relief?" In the short run they do relieve
landowners. They appear to shift taxes off landowners, who are well
organized and vocal, and onto working people who are not. But they
soon shift back onto landowners by repelling mobile capital and
labor.</p>
<p><a name="Priority #5: Make Landowners Pa"></a><b>Priority #5: Make
Landowners Pay Their Taxes </b></p>
<p>The solution is to make the regressive taxes pinch landowners. The
income tax, when new, was designed to do exactly that. Georgists like
Congressman Henry George, Jr. and Warren Worth Bailey took the lead
in shaping it to do so. Over time, though, it has changed into mainly
a payroll tax, and as it changed it became increasingly popular with
landowners. It served their greed and became the clarion call of
their constant clamor for "property tax relief."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In 1942 Congress excluded 50
percent of "capital" gains from
taxable income, and broadened the definition of "capital" assets.</span>
As
top-bracket rates on "ordinary" income rose above 50 percent,
Congress capped capital gains rates at 25 percent. Meantime,
wage-tax withholding was sold as a wartime measure - "We must all do
our duty." <span style="font-weight: bold;">College professors were
dutifully indoctrinating their
students that the income tax is the perfect tax: fair, progressive,
allocationally neutral, all at once.</span></p>
<p>Then income tax rates went wild, going as high as 92 percent on
"ordinary" income (but capped at 25 percent for capital gains).
Federal and state income taxes became the mainstay of public finance.
Owners of income property soon learned to avoid almost all income
taxes by claiming short tax lives by which fictitious inflated
depreciation write-offs offset all their cash flow. Once a property
has exhausted its depreciation "basis," owner A sells the property to
owner B, who depreciates it all over again, and so on through several
rounds. The only "recapture" of this excess depreciation is when A
sells to B for a capital gain; in effect, the rent of income property
shows up as "capital gains." This tax burden is minimized by keeping
rates low on capital gains.</p>
<p>Many who think of themselves as "Georgists" have shut their eyes
to this important matter. Some simply declare a pox on all forms of
income tax. Others even join the hue and cry for exempting capital
gains, specifically and preferentially, from income tax. These
positions are, I submit, foolish. <span style="font-weight: bold;">So
long as we have an income tax
that treats land income kindlier and gentler than wage and salary and
interest income, so long will we have perpetual clamor for "property
tax relief" by shifting the burden to incomes, until no burden
remains to shift - a condition we are approaching in half the
states.</span></p>
<p>Landowners and their advocates are ahead of us, and will remain so
until we wake up. They are already lobbying to replace or supplement
income taxes with what they miscall "consumer" taxes: various excise
taxes, allegedly "general" retail sales taxes, income taxes with
expensing allowed for all capital outlays, cash flow taxes, et hoc
genus omne.</p>
<p>These taxes are mislabelled because they all exempt
land-consumption from the base. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land-consumption
is holding land
without its earning any cash. </span>A true, comprehensive consumer
tax
would include such land-consumption. At the same time it would
exclude retail purchases of necessities used to form and maintain
"human capital." It would, in short, look more like a land tax than
the present retail sales tax. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is
only by bending the meaning of
words to a class-biased goal that the apologists of private
rent-taking and land-hoarding have sold sales taxes and VATs as taxes
on "consumption."</span></p>
<p>To turn back the drive for more consumer taxation, we must insist
that the base include land-consumption. Then either the drive would
accomplish a Georgist goal, or more likely, the rent taking, land
hoarding apologists would turn tail.</p>
<p>We cannot accomplish those ends if we fight only for local
property tax reform. We have to marshal our forces where they will do
the most good.</p>
<p>In the late 18th century and most of the 19th, revenue to operate
govemment came mainly from the sale of land.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Throughout history - and even today -
wealth and privilege has
been based upon ownership of land and monopoly. Economics, unchecked
and in ignorance of the land and rent question, remains "the
caveman's law, the law of the sharpest tooth, the angriest brow and
the greediest maw." (so said Al Smith, Governor of New York and
presidential candidate during the 1920s)</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">But we know there is a better way. The
recognition that
"territoriality" may be necessary as the law of survival for lower
species is not borne out for mankind; for humanity there is a higher
order. The human condition, the dignity of man and the aspiring
benevolence that are made material by way of man's free association
and the free exchange of labor and its handmaiden - capital.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Land rent is socially created, it is the
fruit of the loins of
unfettered labor and capital. Monopoly and privilege are the
highwaymen who rob us of the means to end poverty, slums and
depression. This is the promise of LVT. This is the big idea. The
hope. Something to believe in - its time surely has come.</p>
