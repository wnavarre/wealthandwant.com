SPECIAL CHALLENGE TO ECONOMIC THINKING <br>
<br>
</span>Nonpoint pollution goes right to a chink in the
armor of conventionally trained economists (like myself) who are
overtrained towards becoming protagonists of the price system.&nbsp; To
the skeptical we are "free market freaks": eco&#8209;freaks who are &#8209;nomic
rather than &#8209;logical.&nbsp; Whatever our faults we are zealous, and
carry the conviction of true belief.&nbsp; With the problem at hand,
however, we can't do what we do best, that is call for price signals,
punt, and slip away.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The very name "nonpoint" pollution suggests that
economists see this as just an odd bit of clutter, something
"non&#8209;regular" in their tidy world.&nbsp; Indeed, all pollution was an
exception, an "externality," until recently (at least at my age it
seems so).&nbsp; Then they learned you can meter effluents and tax
them, or trade effluent rights around like private property.&nbsp;
Thenceforth they could fit pollution right into existing models and
ideologies with minimum intellectual strain.&nbsp; They were happy as
Procrustes with a new guest.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
But we can't meter runoff &#8212; how frustrating.&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>It comes from areas &#8212; how disorienting.&nbsp;  </li>
  <li>Its damages are spread
unequally over other areas, differentially populated &#8212; how
non-homogenous.&nbsp;  </li>
</ul>
Standard-brand economists are ill-equipped and
undisposed to face such problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Conventional price theory has been accused of
mocking physics because it uses some elementary calculus, but if so it
is a poor imitation: it deals with an imaginary world abstracted not
just from friction but from space and time themselves.&nbsp; Space is
relegated to one subdiscipline (location theory) and time to another
(finance), so regular price theorists can spin their webs in purest
abstraction, undistracted by these details.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Most price theory is spaceless.&nbsp;</span>
Even location
theory, at least the most common kind, conventionally treats cities as
Euclidean points: the math is simpler that way.&nbsp; Newton could get
away with it explaining planetary motion; students of urban sprawl can
not.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Economists are also ill-equipped to
deal with
ecology.</span>&nbsp; Economists' "externalities" pour into a biosphere
of
interdependencies at least as complex as what economists purport to
understand.&nbsp; Economists are too disposed to underrate the
sensitivity, passion and numbers of Nature's votaries, and the real
economic value of the philosophical values they celebrate.&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries </span>economists are a
notable exception, although they probably
impose more economics on biology than vice versa.&nbsp; But most
economists treat "eco&#8209;freaks" as noisy nuisances.&nbsp; In the absence
of a real ecologist I will presume to take their part.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Economists, I hasten to add, are often useful
citizens (both male and female, in spite of the male pronouns I
use).&nbsp; Economists have been lumped with "soft scientists" &#8212;
chemists really know how to hurt a fellow.&nbsp; But as a budgeteer
allocating limited resources among competing ends &#8212; his favorite
posture &#8212; it is often the economist, the soft scientist, who makes
hard choices among hard scientists with soft programs.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Another good use for economists, when mixed with
natural scientists, is to temper extremism among those susceptible to
technofascination.&nbsp; Some white-smocks, vested with prestige and
authority once reserved for black-robes and red-coats, are given
to
optimistic fancies based on what science can do, as opposed to what
slobs in the field actually will do.&nbsp; It is the economist's fate
to study the latter, which accounts for his twisted smile and sardonic
inside jokes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
But sometimes a positive-thinking economist (there
are a few) develops affirmative enthusiasms of his own for social and
political programs that transcend particular technologies.&nbsp; Then
he may need natural scientists to temper his zeal, as you may temper
mine in what follows.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<a name="THE_SEARCH_FOR_SURROGATES_"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">THE SEARCH FOR SURROGATES </span><br>
<br>
The frustrated economist, unable to tax runoff,
still has a bag of tricks.&nbsp; He looks for surrogates to tax,
something in a sack or bottle that moves through a market: Aha!
pesticides, fertilizers, salt, they'll do nicely to tax.&nbsp; Thus we
will "internalize the externalities" and have "proper pricing of
inputs" to create incentives for correct "trade-offs" in the
"production functions," and we're nearly home.&nbsp; Well, halfway
home.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Well, we've made a start.&nbsp; A few problems
remain.&nbsp; One is that a plurality of economists don't like the
effluent charge approach anyway, even for point sources.&nbsp; They
follow Coase and prefer to grant pollution entitlements to be traded in
a free market.&nbsp; Incredibly (to me) this view has prevailed.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In principle they profess not to care what worthy
few get the original entitlements, but in practise a select company of
ancient and honorable polluters get them.&nbsp; We now call these
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">"offset
rights,"</span> a new form of property.&nbsp; In the L.A. Basin (South
Coast Air Quality Management District), a few have grown rich by
establishing their respective histories of pollution which they can now
sell to others who wish to continue this wholesome tradition.&nbsp; The
demonstration effect on those contemplating new and as yet unregulated
forms of pollution may be imagined.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Those needing air to breathe?&nbsp; Well, according
to the modern philosophers they can enter the market, buy up offset
rights and retire them.&nbsp; Thus is fulfilled Robert Ingersoll's
forecast a century ago that if some corporation could bottle the air
they would charge us to breathe.&nbsp; It seems to confirm this dour
warning from a former Secretary of Labor: &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"We soon&nbsp; discovered ...&nbsp; the
danger of allowing economic
policy to be dominated by business or financial interests or, which
usually comes to the same thing, orthodox economic analysis."&nbsp;
(Marshall, p.ix) (emphasis added)</div>
<br>
The public has learned what is being done to it,
finally, and is rebelling at the Coase logic, which only a Chicago
economist could love.&nbsp; Offset rights are on the ropes.&nbsp; To
simplify, therefore, I am not going to speculate how Coase might be
applied to nonpoint, but just ignore it.&nbsp; I will treat effluent
charges, and taxes on surrogates, as the conventional economic solution
to pollution.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
But before leaving this there is a lesson in
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The holders of offset
rights, whether "ancient and
honorable" or "innocent purchasers," are demanding compensation.&nbsp;
Never mind about asking them to pay the victims; they demand payment to
stop!&nbsp;</span> (Polakovic, 1987) &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">They will probably get it, for if the
system be
changed, there will be a taking of something, which they claim is
property.&nbsp;</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such
is the force of the Great Secular Superstition,
that unearned gains are sacred, even those originating with something
as unworthy as dumping crud on other human beings.</span>&nbsp; This
superstition is why effective control seems so expensive.&nbsp; My
remarks will not be instructed by it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The surrogate approach may work
through regulation
and prohibition as well as taxation.&nbsp;</span> Banning DDT and other
organochlorines after 1972 has solved or prevented a lot of nonpoint
problems, as you know.&nbsp; We may also tax or ban other pesticides of
long residual life, stimulating a predictably successful quest for
pesticides that self&#8209;destruct after doing their job.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
But economists balk at absolutes.&nbsp; They have to
admit that Rachel Carson and William Ruckelshaus and Russell Train won
some games while economists sat on the bench, but they can show you
things would be better with more tempered, measured responses.&nbsp;
They prefer taxation to regulation: it inhibits rather than
prohibits.&nbsp; It is more flexible, leaving latitude for applicator
adaptation, recognizing the smoothness and continuity of production and
damage and substitution functions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
They would point out, for example, that making
pesticides costlier would discourage the present practise of routine
preventive or "insurance" spraying, and incent farmers to spray only
when the bugs are up to an "economic threshold."&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulation
to achieve the same end would be much more difficult, almost like a
prescription drug system, presupposing an entomology profession with
the moral and legal authority and tradition of the medical
profession.&nbsp; Economists would point out that inhibition rather
than prohibition is compatible with IPM, the optimizing solution.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You've heard the traditional spiel, it is
arguable.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We can inhibit
nonpoint pollution, in some ways
optimally, by controlling surrogates.&nbsp; But let's look at the
problems that would remain.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">
a.&nbsp; Taxes overlook the locational element,
whereas damages vary according to the site of the runoff.&nbsp;</span>
A tax
imposed only in critical areas is avoidable by importing the input from
tax&#8209;free zones.&nbsp; We could tax uniformly everywhere; but a uniform
tax on, say, nitrogen fertilizer would, in order to protect certain
waters, reduce yields from all lands.&nbsp; Presently that would pull
more acres into use, worsening other problems.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">b.&nbsp; Taxes raise revenue, and
recipients develop
vested interests in the revenue,</span> interests which may come to
override
the regulatory purpose of the tax.&nbsp; The main issue of 19th century
tariff debates was regulation vs. revenue.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c.&nbsp; Excise taxes are not
leakproof.&nbsp; </span>The
volume of bootleg cigarettes should give us pause, and I (a small fruit
grower) have been tempted more than once with illicit supplies of
Roundup.&nbsp; There is a huge underground economy in this country, a
testament to man's irrepressible genius for tax evasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
</div>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">underground economy</span>
sometimes rises to the
surface, in episodes of rebellion, when deregulation is the vogue in
government.&nbsp; I favor some kinds of deregulation myself, but the
repressed cowboy psychology seizes these opportunities, too, to evade
legitimate taxes and prohibitions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is a grand tradition of bailing out sellers
with stocks on hand when a product is taxed or banned.&nbsp; Chlordane
is a recent example.&nbsp; Dairy producers have been compensated when
they could not sell their pesticide&#8209;contaminated milk.&nbsp; (Carlson,
1977, p.319) &nbsp;<br>
<br>
To sell existing stocks tax free, when new ones are
banned or taxed, creates a nice windfall.&nbsp; The 1972 Federal
Pesticide Act also "provides for compensation to holders of patents on
pesticides when registration removal occurs." (ibid.)&nbsp; The problem
is, this whets the appetite for future windfalls.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
It is something like the terrorism treadmill where
ransoming one hostage stimulates future kidnapping.&nbsp; Some clever
people will develop new harmful products whose future prohibition or
taxation will endow them with more windfalls, etc. ad inf.&nbsp; There
are more than 50,000 agricultural pesticides registered in the U.S.
(Gianessi, 1987, p.1), giving a notion of the possibilities.&nbsp; This
is a second kind of "pesticide treadmill."&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Earl Heady has optimistically noted that herbicides
are becoming more specific, tailored to certain crop problems (Nicol
and Heady, 1977, p.339).&nbsp; Whatever else you can say about Roundup
it is anything but that, and I wonder if we have yet to find an optimal
set of incentives to bend the twig of research in desirable
directions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">d.&nbsp; A tax on nitrogen could be
avoided by
growing legumes.</span>&nbsp; Not a bad idea, perhaps, all things
considered,
but it just scratches the surface of the kinds of substitution, some of
it unpredictable, that can occur when you tax a surrogate rather than
the damaging effluent itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">e.&nbsp; Taxing a surrogate fails to
distinguish
among individual applicators.</span>&nbsp; It taxes the best for the
sins of
the worst, and credits the worst for the virtues of the best.&nbsp;
Even if the rate be set optimally it will overtax the good and undertax
the bad, and will not motivate anyone towards greater care and
conscience to avoid harmful practises.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">f.&nbsp; The objectivity and moral
authority of the
professionals on whom we must rely to evaluate pesticides is not
unquestioned.&nbsp;</span> This is a delicate area, but we must face a
certain
public skepticism.&nbsp; The University of California has just lost a
court case in which they were accused and convicted of violating the
Hatch Act by favoring agribusiness over family farmers.&nbsp; They are
appealing, and damage&#8209;controlling, assuring the public (with public
funds) what good people they really are, and how minimal the matter
really was.&nbsp; Perhaps so: but they lost the case.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">What would happen
if their objectivity were
questioned on the grounds that they accept large, directed grants from
pesticide producers, let faculty members consult for the same, and push
faculty members into grantsmanship?</span>&nbsp; Would Rachel Carson
have
found happiness in a UC Department of Entomology?&nbsp; Will Frances
Moore Lapp&eacute;?&nbsp; Was Earth Day conceived under a grant from
Monsanto?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
U.C. Entomology Professor Robert van den Bosch was
not amused by the dominance of what he called "the pesticide
mafia."&nbsp; His <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Pesticide
Conspiracy </span>(1978), although tendentious,
cites enough specifics to impugn several U.C. administrators, other
universities, the USDA (that "wholly owned subsidiary" of the chemical
industry), many congressmen, bankers and food processors, farm
employers, most producers, salesmen and lobbyists, and at least one
Nobel laureate.&nbsp; It is not a reassuring picture, nor is it
reassuring that van den Bosch has been answered, if at all, by
ridicule, personal abuse, and whispering.&nbsp; I draw the curtain of
diplomacy over wherever these thoughts may lead.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Moral authority or not, there are questions of
efficiency and expedition.&nbsp; The mills of EPA may or may not grind
exceeding fine, but they do grind exceedingly slowly.&nbsp; Since 1972
EPA has arrived at suspending only 79 active ingredients.&nbsp; Most of
its "reregistration" reviews are still in some interim stage.&nbsp;
Apparently industry advances new toxins much faster than EPA reviews
them, so the inventory of pending reviews can only grow.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">g.&nbsp; The case for "proper pricing
of inputs" is
most persuasive when we can show that everything else in the system is
working right first, as the optimal background we are to avoid
distorting.&nbsp; But that is conspicuously untrue.&nbsp; </span>When
the
system is balanced wrong anyway, what is one more distortion?&nbsp; It
might even make things better, a viewpoint labeled "the theory of
second best."&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In fact, land use decisions are
superimposed on a
settlement pattern based on massive market failure in land.&nbsp; The
phenomena rather imprecisely called "land speculation" and "absentee
ownership" betray market failure; and no one disputes there is massive
regulatory failure in pricing and subsidizing transportation, which in
turn determine land rents and values.&nbsp; Result: the land market is
not efficient; land is not properly priced and allocated to begin
with.&nbsp; This is the thread I will follow, although it may run afoul
of The Great Secular Superstition.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="SOURCES_OF_NONPOINT_POLLUTION_"></a>SOURCES OF NONPOINT
POLLUTION &nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
All pollution is originally "nonpoint."&nbsp; It
only becomes "point" pollution when someone has taken the trouble of
gathering it at a small orifice in order to control it, often for the
benefit of others.&nbsp; If we then tax point polluters while exempting
nonpoint we will impair the incentive to control.&nbsp; That of course
is why we are conferring now, and why we are looking at taxing
surrogates.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing and banning surrogates has a
place, perhaps a
big place in any control program.&nbsp; But it may not touch many
sources of nonpoint pollution.&nbsp; Let's list them here; see what
damage they do (next section); and then see what remains unsolved by
taxing and banning surrogates.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
Major sources of nonpoint pollution are:

<ul>
  <li>agriculture,  </li>
  <li>forestry,</li>
  <li>mining,  </li>
  <li>recreation,  </li>
  <li>paving and rooftops,  </li>
  <li>roads,  </li>
  <li>lawns and gardens,  </li>
  <li>onsite industrial waste dumps, and  </li>
  <li>military, for a
start.&nbsp;  </li>
</ul>
To these I would add 
<ul>
  <li>the class of moving point sources,
like autos and vessels and aircraft, which have part of the elusive
character of nonpoint sources.&nbsp; I would add  </li>
  <li>septic tanks; and</li>
  <li>moonlight dumpers; and  </li>
  <li>everything served by a storm sewer, or no sewer
at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Construction" is usually added, but
  construction
  per se is innocent and should not bear the onus.</span>&nbsp; It is
  rather <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">grading</span>,
  the destruction that precedes construction on new lands, that
  denudes land and allows runoff and blowing.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Filling </span>can
  be
  noxious, too, when it takes wetlands that otherwise help filter runoff
  before it hits shellfish beds and beaches.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">So nice a
  distinction may seem picky, but it is
  heavy with policy meaning.&nbsp;</span> The Sears Tower and the Empire
  State
  Building probably caused less runoff than any modern cookie&#8209;cutter
  subdivision.&nbsp; We can have needed construction without grading and
  filling by renewing and infilling our cities instead of promoting more
  urban sprawl.&nbsp; Milwaukee in the last 20 years has lost 20% of its
  population.&nbsp; Buildings are boarded up and land lies vacant while
  dozers and scrapers tear up new land upstream of it.&nbsp; At least
  one&#8209;third of Milwaukee, perhaps more, could and should be renewed
  forthwith, obviating much of the random lateral expansion onto new land
  whose runoff now causes so much grief down here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Within agriculture it is common to
  hear that tillage
  is the problem; the solution, evidently, is grazing.&nbsp; On some
  lands that is true, but the generalization is not.&nbsp;</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">On other more
  fragile lands, grazing causes runoff.</span>&nbsp; Not for nothing are
  sheep
  called "woolly maggots," and the Arab called the father, rather than
  the son of the desert.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exploitive
  high&#8209;grading grazing, leaving
  weeds to take over the range, is another form of pollution</span> &#8209;&#8209;
  biological pollution, depleting the gene pool.&nbsp; As with all land
  problems, "where" and "when" are as important as "what."&nbsp; "A place
  for everything, and everything in its place," the slogan of land
  economics, is the proper watchword.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">We sometimes hear that good organic
  manure is the
  answer.&nbsp; But on feedlots, too much of a good thing becomes a
  nonpoint pollutant.&nbsp;</span> Cities in the upper Santa Ana River
  basin
  must provide tertiary sewage treatment, but the largest concentration
  of dairy cattle in the world, in the Chino basin, drains into the same
  waters.&nbsp; Next time you visit Disneyland if the water reminds you
  of Wisconsin, there may be a reason.&nbsp; (Chino, ironically, is in an
  agricultural preserve, to enhance the environment.)&nbsp; These
  feedlots also overlie what might be one of our most usable aquifers, in
  a region in sorest need of water storage.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Cities like Milwaukee are painted as victims of
  nonpoint pollution, but within cities the great anomaly is that the
  output of sanitary sewers is monitored and treated while that of storm
  sewers is not.&nbsp; A few blocks from this meeting in downtown
  Milwaukee you can see coal and salt stored in the open, draining
  directly into the Harbor with each rain.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  In Riverside, the local scatological whimsy is "Flush your toilets, Orange County needs the water."&nbsp; It relieves
  the local inferiority complex, but actually that water gets tertiary
  treatment.&nbsp; It is our storm runoff that's dirty.&nbsp; Some cities
  of course have only one set of sewers, but that creates problems of its
  own which Milwaukee knows well.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  In Riverside we have also poisoned many of our own
  water wells with toxic percolation from farm and industry wastes which,
  since they are inside our expansive city limits, we cannot blame on
  others; but which our prudent city fathers prefer not to identify too
  closely.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>

  PROBLEMS ARE CREATED? &nbsp;</span><br>
  <br>
  If the old problems of BOD, bacteria, nitrogen,
  sedimentation and phosphates are partially mitigated, new ones are upon
  us: toxic metals, new pesticides (and an accelerating pesticide
  treadmill), ammonia, and organic supertoxins (Harkin, 1985, p.
  K&#8209;II&#8209;4).&nbsp; The salts ye have always with you; and BOD, although
  perhaps mitigated inland, is still lethally high in Long Island Sound
  and Chesapeake Bay (Business Week, October 1987).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage is affected by reconcentration.</span>&nbsp;
  Beneficial concentration of runoffs in dumps, to minimize damage, is
  inherently unlikely.&nbsp; Much of the damage does come from
  reconcentration of toxics in waterways and fats, but the damage is not
  restricted to riparian owners or ichthyophages since water supplies for
  large downstream cities depend on river waters.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Cities can treat polluted waters, of course, but at
  considerable cost, and substantially reduced consumer satisfaction with
  the product.&nbsp; The last may or may not be "just psychological," but
  it is a signal from the sovereign consumer which has led to such costly
  ventures as San Francisco's project to invade Yosemite Park, drown the
  scenic Hetch Hetchy Canyon of the Tuolumne, Yosemite's peer, and carry
"sparkling mountain water" 158 miles back home; and East Bay's parallel
  venture to the Mokelumne River.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sediment silts up harbors.</span>&nbsp;
  To handle this
  problem we first need recognize we have too many harbors anyway, thanks
  to logrolling in Congress and the machinations of the Army Corps of
  Engineers.&nbsp; Rivers and Harbors are the classic porkbarrel vehicle
  of Congress.&nbsp; Wisconsin alone may have as many harbors as the
  whole Pacific Coast.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of any solution here is to stop
  subsidizing
  dredging.&nbsp;</span> Subeconomic harbors would close; others would
  finance
  their own dredging, with this bonus for the welfare of all: they would
  redirect their lobbying budgets from the zero&#8209;sum game of soliciting
  federal funds to the constructive game of promoting runoff
  control.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Sediment also silts up reservoirs; and again we have
  too many, thanks to a long history of subsidizing water supply in
  western states.&nbsp; That is the pork you trade us for all those tiny
  harbors.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">We make it worse by
  penalizing water conservation
  ("use&#8209;it&#8209;or&#8209;lose&#8209;it" is the rule).&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  The lobbies and the engineers don't see it that way,
  of course, but then that is part of the problem, isn't it?&nbsp; We are
  so used to living and learning under the logic of the lobbies that we,
  the rightful heirs of Emerson and Thoreau, are conditioned to reject
  our own direct perceptions.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  In the logic of true values we should probably put
  more weight on other damages, such as that land is sterilized, and
  people are poisoned.&nbsp; Species are destroyed or constricted,
  leaving the natural world to surviving coyotes, crows and
  sparrows.&nbsp; High&#8209;grading the forests leaves weed trees to inherit
  the earth, a form of genetic pollution.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  It is the shame of economists that some of them make
  the world equate that with "materialists."&nbsp; Economics properly
  deals with how to meet human desires, and staying alive in a healthy,
  pleasing environment ranks high among those.&nbsp; Aldo Leopold makes a
  certain amount of sense from which micro theory might benefit.&nbsp;
  Macro, too: if Walter Heller had really "heard" Barry Commoner when
  they debated, or read him (Commoner, 19xx) we might be far ahead in
this game.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p> Several writers treat <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">salt runoff</span> lightly.&nbsp; It
  may be of small concern in this region, but it is of monumental moment
  in the arid west.&nbsp; Downstream water becomes unusable, and water
  pooling and exchanging, from which so many economies could result,
  become much harder to negotiate ("my water is better than your water,"
  etc.).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  While we can't blame Washington for everything, it
  has a lot to answer for here.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
  salt runoff comes from
  Federally subsidized water.</span>&nbsp; Kesterson Refuge is poisoned
  by
  runoff from the Westlands Water District, irrigated under heavy Federal
  subsidy from the Central Valley Project (in spite of its long and
  notorious violation of acreage limitation provisions of the Reclamation
  Act).&nbsp; The worst problem on the Colorado is salt runoff from the
  Wellton-Mohawk project, near Yuma, a subeconomic boondoggle from start
  to finish.&nbsp; All extant Colorado River salt problems are now
  aggravated by the subsidized Central Arizona Project.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  Other salt problems come via underground
  water.&nbsp; Irrigation applied upstream percolates underground and
  resurfaces at lower elevations, evaporates and leaves salt residues,
  sterilizing certain lands (e.g. below the Fresno Irrigation
  District).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">But more ominous, aquifers themselves
  are impaired,
  and maybe destroyed forever.&nbsp;</span> Americans have yet to hear
  this
  alarm bell, and take a frighteningly insouciant attitude toward
  groundwater.&nbsp; Even Earl Heady, an informed person, has written
  that pesticides only hurt us by being concentrated via the food chain
  (Nicol and Heady, 335).&nbsp; But in my little corner of the world,
  southern California, many aquifers are being impaired, perhaps lost
  forever by "downward runoff" or percolation of water laced with
  toxics.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  I wish I could report this has made us more
  conscious of the problem than easterners, but if so that has not
  reached the <a name="MWDSC_Metropolitan_Water_District_of"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">MWDSC (Metropolitan Water District of
  Southern California)</span>,
  the apex of our water establishment, which neglects the problem
  nonchalantly.&nbsp; MWD is driven instead by the passion of its designs
  on all waters north to the Arctic Circle.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  You think that's hyperbole?&nbsp; I wish!&nbsp; "Only Yesterday," in the '70s, there were several Senators and a big
  head of steam behind "NAWAPA," to tap the Yukon.&nbsp; Sensible,
  economical conservation of local aquifers is too prosaic, and besides
  it violates the American credo of preferring the most resource&#8209;using
  solution.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Real men don't
  conserve resources; real men have vision
  and acquisitive genes, they sally forth like their warrior progenitors
  and grab more.&nbsp; Conservation is for sissies and besides, it would
  only demonstrate the folly of MWD's hydro&#8209;imperialism.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
  <br>
  Damage to lakes and impairment of riparian values is
  notorious and needs no laboring here.&nbsp; We see some progress in
  protecting inland lakes, but now the oceans themselves are
  threatened.&nbsp; There is worsening damage to salt&#8209;water estuaries,
  gulfs, bays, and wetlands.&nbsp; Shellfish and finfish supplies are
  diminished and contaminated; the littoral is all littered; swimming is
  restricted; riparian amenities are impaired (Business Week, October
  1987).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Urban invasion of <span style="font-weight: bold;">coastal wetlands</span> is
  an aspect of the problem.&nbsp; Wetlands have served as filters protecting the
  ocean: urbanize them and more raw sewage reaches the ocean.&nbsp; Here
  again the culprit is not "construction" as such, it is filling.&nbsp;
  Cuts in the hills increase runoff; fills in the wetlands reduce
  filtering.&nbsp; The combined effect is very bad news.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wind drift</span> is an episodic
  problem.&nbsp; Where there
  are windless days, it is controllable.&nbsp; But it only takes one
  human error, and in Hemet, California, in 1974, 2500 ducks were
  wind-drifted to death: lucky they weren't humans.&nbsp; Bees are
  routinely lost in large numbers.&nbsp; In Hawaii or Wyoming, lacking
  many windless days, one wonders.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wind erosion</span> from bare land is
  something else.&nbsp;
  Land laid bare stays bare in all weather, and a long "Santa Ana"
  windstorm blows it far and wide.&nbsp; Mother Earth will have her
  revenge.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Insects </span>fly across property
  lines, wind or no.&nbsp;
  Nonpoint entomological pollution is a by&#8209;product of the pesticide
  treadmill.&nbsp; The <span style="font-weight: bold;">biocide&#8209;by&#8209;pesticide
  of natural predators</span>,
  followed by exploding populations of previously minor pests, has turned
  oversprayed fields into baneful insectaries spawning new horrors that
  fan out everywhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="THE_CASE_OF_FORESTRY_"></a>THE
CASE OF FORESTRY</span> <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The inadequacy of surrogate pollution
taxation is
exemplified by forestry.&nbsp; The main purposes of watershed
protection have long been to regulate water flows, to reduce flooding
and erosion, and sustain flows during droughts.&nbsp;</span> Minimizing
pesticide runoff is a worthy additional purpose, but not the sole
one.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Francisco Goya left hanging in The Prado two
paintings of his beloved, La Maja Desnuda and La Maja Vestida.&nbsp;
Some prefer the earthy Desnuda.&nbsp; When it comes to Mother Earth,
however, she looks better Vestida in virgin verdure or some renewable
replacement raiments.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gaia
theorists, indeed, regard the
biosphere as an integral part of the whole terrestrial organism.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">However you regard it, removing it is
hazardous and
damaging to the children of Earth.&nbsp; Denuded land is the source of
almost all forest runoff problems.&nbsp;</span> Erosion results from a
combination of 
<ul>
  <li>logging roads (too many, too long, on land too steep);  </li>
  <li>clearcutting; and  </li>
  <li>slow replanting.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
Slow replanting is the central problem.&nbsp; It
slows the supply of second&#8209;growth timber, and thus creates pressure to
invade submarginal areas.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Foresters
should harvest the low, flat,
warm lands early and often because: </span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">a) Regeneration is economical
there, it pays for itself where trees grow fast; <br>
b) Regeneration is
fastest there, minimizing the exposure period of bare land; <br>
c) Logging
roads may be shorter and less erosive there, because nearer to markets
and on level land; <br>
d) The temporary loss of scenic beauty is less
severe; <br>
e) The exposed bare land is less steep; <br>
f) Logging is cheaper
and less destructive; selective logging is more feasible; <br>
g) Fire
control is easier; <br>
h) Younger stands are more vigorous and naturally
resistant to pests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
The last point bears underscoring here.&nbsp; It
points to how good forest management can minimize pest damage without
heavy reliance on toxics.&nbsp; The spruce budworm, for example, wreaks
damage mainly on trees weakened by age.&nbsp; To protect those older
trees, whole forests, millions of acres in the northeast are sprayed,
with tragic treadmill results.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The tussock&#8209;moth, over which so much organochlorine
has been shed in the fir forests, damages trees mainly on poor growing
sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Trees on good
sites withstand defoliation, green up,
and grow with renewed vigor.&nbsp; The moral: stay off the poor
sites.&nbsp; The method: utilize the good sites fully.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why aren't
the good sites harvested early, replanted
quickly, and utilized fully?&nbsp; One major reason lies in the tax
system.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">a.&nbsp;
Replanting cost is not expensable for
income tax, it must be capitalized, hence not written off until decades
later when timber is harvested.</span>&nbsp; Timber taxation was not
neglected, you may be sure, by Oregon Senator Packwood who shepherded
through our most recent tax reform; but timber lobbies have
deliberately traded this off to keep what they prize more, the capital
gains treatment of timber sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">b.&nbsp;
Most states have substituted the yield tax
for the property tax.</span>&nbsp; The result is a bias against early
harvesting.&nbsp; When you look at the whole system it also pushes
cutting pressure out to marginal lands.&nbsp; But a yield tax at a high
rate wholly destroys any incentive to restock marginal lands, once cut:
it makes them subeconomic to replant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">c.&nbsp;
Some states have virtually eliminated the
land value part of the property tax on timber, removing an incentive to
early reforestation.</span>&nbsp; A tax based on land value continues
at a
steady level during the sterile downtime of land between harvest and
replanting, thus pricking holders in the most compelling way to
restock, while not taxing them at all for actually restocking.&nbsp; On
marginal land the tax base is zero (it being based on land value) so it
does not cause abandonment, nor make replanting any less economic than
it already is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">d.&nbsp;
When timber is standing the value added by
growth is partly unrecognized as taxable income.&nbsp;</span> Timber
has been
a "capital asset" for income tax purposes since 1944.&nbsp; Not only is
much of the gain unrecognized as income, but any tax is deferred until
harvest.&nbsp; After timber is felled, value-added in the mills and
markets is "ordinary" income and bears the full fury of the tax
rates.&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;When timber is standing there is
no property tax, so
it need only grow fast enough to pay interest on its value.&nbsp; After
it is cut it must yield a rate of return high enough to cover a
property tax, too, not just on its stumpage value but also on the
value-added by harvesting, hauling, milling, shipping, storing,
merchandising, and constructing.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Thus the dual result of income and property taxes is
to defer harvest, increasing the volume of old, disease-prone timber
standing on good land, and pushing logging pressure out to marginal
lands.&nbsp; Many marginal lands are non&#8209;regenerable.&nbsp; Logging
there is simply mining, leaving La Tierra Desnuda and open to the
elements indefinitely.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
</div>
Forestry on public lands, ironically, manifests
similar biases, from a different set of incentives.&nbsp; William Hyde,
Marion Clawson and others have documented the pattern: undermanagement
of superior sites accompanied by premature invasion of steep, remote
sites as the Forest Service internalizes all its profits from timber
sales to build more roads (and its empire).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Both private and public forestry generate
specialists with information monopolies which they use to obscure these
issues and divert us with others.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">An optimal
solution would constructively combine and
synthesize two apparently contrary concepts of land stewardship.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THESIS:
Concept A says "Conserve for the
future."&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ANTITHESIS: Concept B says
"Stewardship means
highest and best use."&nbsp;</span> Landholders are responsible to use
land
now, in order to employ others (generate incomes), to produce goods
(combat inflation), and pay taxes (avoid deficits).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SYNTHESIS: Concept AB says do both,
but in different
places.&nbsp; Use the good lands intensively, grow timber early and
often, thus relieve human pressure and help conserve the vulnerable,
erosive lands.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div>
<br>
Until this is done, will optimal taxes on aerial
sprays do much good?&nbsp; Some good, no doubt.&nbsp; But the main
problems are deeper rooted and call for bolder measures.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
That is my basic message.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Forestry
suffers
from cutting sprawl, quite analogous to urban sprawl.&nbsp; The center
is neglected, so the action moves to submarginal fringes and damages
what's left of the center.</span>&nbsp; Let us now look at two more
cases,
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">urban
sprawl</span> itself, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">agricultural
sprawl</span>, where the source of
problems is analogous, and the implied solutions the same.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="THE_CASE_OF_URBAN_SETTLEMENT_"></a>THE
CASE OF URBAN SETTLEMENT </span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The central problem here is
urban sprawl; the
solution is compactness.</span>&nbsp; More land urbanized means more
urban
runoff.&nbsp; But more people on given land may even mean less runoff
per acre, e.g. at the threshold where sewering can economically replace
a collection of septic tanks and leach lines.&nbsp; It certainly means
less runoff per capita.&nbsp; It means better control of any given
runoff.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
A compact, synergistic city is resource&#8209;saving;
sprawl is resource-wasting, using up more land, capital, materials,
fuels, and air/water quality to substitute for direct human contacts
and cooperation.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Here are some
items that sprawl maximizes or
worsens: </span><br>
<ul>
  <li>the number of car&#8209;miles for any given level of
urban linkage, with smog generated in proportion.&nbsp; (The
unforgettable demonstration of the last came in 1967 when Mayor Henry
Maier closed all Milwaukee gas stations for a week, because of arson
and riot threats.&nbsp; As a by-product Milwaukeeans saw, for the first
and last times, what clean air really looks like &#8212; glorious!) &nbsp;</li>
  <li>paved areas, with salt and roadside litter both
spread in proportion.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
  <li>"and sudden death."&nbsp; Auto accidents, the
ultimate "negative externality," kill some 40,000 Americans per year,
maim many times more, and intimidate everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
  <li>grading and denuding new lands, generally
upstream and more sloping.&nbsp; Three&#8209;quarters of the pollutant
loadings in the Menominee River come from urban non-point
sources.&nbsp; Developing urban areas cover only 2.6% of the watershed,
but contribute 37% of the suspended solids and 48% of the
phosphorous.&nbsp; (Bauman et al. 1980, cited in Falk, 1985, p.
P-II-B-2) </li>
  <li>number of homes on septic tanks. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>diversion of sewer funds from treating sewage to
collecting it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
  <li>larger lots and lawns, longer driveways. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>inhabited areas without good fire protection,
with more grass and brush exposed to humans. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>private wells puncturing aquifer caps. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>settlement and industry beyond gutters and storm
drains. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>withering of mass transit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
  <li>longer, wider utility rights-of-way, with higher
voltage and pressure and hazard. &nbsp;</li>
  <li>filling wetlands </li>
  <li>occupying floodplains, so more flood control
reservoirs are needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
  <li>automobile dependency creates its own treadmill
effect.&nbsp; The car itself is the major consumer of urban space,
space which must in turn be traversed, using still more
car-miles.&nbsp; Pedestrians and cyclers are maimed and intimidated
into becoming motorists.&nbsp; Mass transit withers away.&nbsp; The
market does not lead us to optimal outcomes in such a world &#8212; this
world.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Suburbs abate their own problems by
pick&#8209;pocketing
central cities, e.g. by getting sewers they could not pay for
themselves.</span>&nbsp; Milwaukee Metropolitan is as good an example
as
any.&nbsp; Systemwide that is a dubious gain, when the central
infrastructure goes to ruins.&nbsp; The titles of some seminal works on
this subject tell the story quite well: America in Ruins (Choate and
Walters, 1981); The Costs of Sprawl (Downs); "Cost&#8209;push of Urban
Sprawl" (Schechter); "The City as a Distorted Price System"
(Thompson).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Solutions
to urban sprawl will involve at least
these three courses: &nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">a)
Marginal-cost pricing of city
services, with a spatial or locational component.</span>&nbsp; Example:
a
water-rate surcharge rising with pressure zones.&nbsp; Cheap city
services in the center, encouraging infill and centralization.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">b) Renewal-oriented tax policy,
especially in central cities.&nbsp;</span> (Milwaukee needs this the
worst
way, having lost population and capital for many years now.)&nbsp;
Renewal&#8209;oriented property taxation means to impose higher tax rates on
land than buildings (Breckenfeld).&nbsp; Former Mayor Dan Hoan favored
this policy (Hoan, pp. 26-27), and what Hoan favored, Hoan did.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Renewal-oriented property assessment accomplishes
the same end by apportioning a higher share of assessed value to land,
and less to buildings.&nbsp; During Hoan's tenure the City Assessor
accomplished it by using the "building-residual" method of
apportionment.&nbsp; He drew up, reproduced, and publicly distributed
land value maps, on which every parcel was valued at its highest and
best use, as determined by comparable sales in the neighborhood.&nbsp;
This approach approximately triples the assessed value of land, as
compared to current Milwaukee practise.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">c) Renewal-oriented spending and
service policy</span>.&nbsp; One guide to this is "tiered" zoning and
planning, firm and consistent.&nbsp; Attorney Robert Freilich, the
"father of growth control," has shown how to make this work in Ramapo,
San Diego, and we hope soon in Riverside.&nbsp; When Dan Hoan was Mayor
of Milwaukee, 1916-36, he oriented spending this way reflexively (Hoan,
Chaps. 2,8), to serve the existing city rather than to expand it.&nbsp;
Milwaukee was a city that worked &#8212; then.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
</div>
<br>
One may prefer other measures.&nbsp; More should be
said about constraining the space demands of cars and trucks.&nbsp; But
the point is that whatever measures one wants, they will have to cut
much deeper than taxing pesticides and fertilizers.&nbsp; We are
talking about major, radical readjustments of urban, tax and utility
policies.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="THE_CASE_OF_AGRICULTURE"></a>THE
CASE OF AGRICULTURE</span> <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Farming
manifests the same problem as forests and
cities.&nbsp; Public policy suppresses full use of the best lands while
subsidizing use and abuse of marginal lands.&nbsp; As we said of urban
sprawl, the more land in use, the more runoff.&nbsp; Here are some
elements that cause "agricultural sprawl." &nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">a)
Urban sprawl takes the best land out
of farming.</span>&nbsp; Cities deserve the best land and get it, but
urban
sprawl inflates urban demand several times over.&nbsp; In the best
light the demand is premature.&nbsp; Much of it is just wrong, now and
forever.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Shock waves from exploding cities fan out through
the entire hierarchy of farm land uses, but not as neatly as force
travels through a row of steel balls in the lab.&nbsp; At each margin
of supersession there is a transfer of chaos plus an increment.&nbsp;
Citrus invades deciduous, deciduous sprawls out among vines and
vegetables, these move into cotton, cotton pushes on alfalfa which
displaces small grains which take over pasture which invades the
forests, and at each margin there is a new contribution of sprawl,
chaos or entropy, a loss of concentration and focus and good economic
spatial organization of farm activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">b)<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Land retirement programs</span>, under
whatever label (there's been a new variation on the theme every few
years since 1933)<span style="font-weight: bold;"> put good land on ice
to support prices.</span>&nbsp; Under
the resulting "price umbrella," marginal land enters production.&nbsp;
This is classic cartel behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">c) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Surpluses
are destroyed at home, or
dumped (sold below cost) abroad, under Federal subsidy.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">d) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Some
crops associated with high
erosion receive strong support or protection: wheat, corn, cotton and
sugarbeets, for example.&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">e) <span style="font-weight: bold;">SCS
funds are not allocated by need,
but per Senator</span>.&nbsp; Aldo Leopold observed of SCS, "In our
attempt to
make conservation easy, we have made it trivial" (Leopold, p.
210).&nbsp; It is worse: we have made it a pork barrel, like rivers and
harbors and missile contracts.&nbsp; So instead of cover-cropping
problem lands we use SCS funds on lands that scarcely need them,
reducing their output and increasing the pressure to till marginal
lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">f) <span style="font-weight: bold;">We
raise a farmer's property tax
assessment for installing a truly conserving device like a Harvestore
&#8212; it is so visible.</span>&nbsp; Yet it turns hay into silage.&nbsp;
The
other farmer who stores corn silage in an open bunker pays few taxes
while losing 1/3 to 1/2 of the product of an erosive culture.&nbsp;
&nbsp;</div>
<br>
Meantime we subsidize new and submarginal lands in
dozens of ways.&nbsp; But on the farm as in the city, the more land,
the more runoff.&nbsp; I have cited the Feds for the Westlands Water
District draining into Kesterson Refuge, and the Wellton&#8209;Mohawk Project
draining into the Colorado River.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The State of California is as bad.&nbsp; The whole
arid southwest quarter of the Great Central Valley is being brought
into cultivation using subsidized water from the California Water
Project's Westside Canal.&nbsp; Promoters there have discovered another
treadmill effect, the "groundwater treadmill" of
local-depletion-and-state-rescue, a treadmill that seems
good for any
number of cycles.&nbsp; But salt runoff has reached such a pass that
the next rescue requirement will be a "brine line" to the sea, a line
whose outlet is as sought-for as a nuclear waste dump.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
South of the Tehachapis the MWD has its own
variation, the Mulholland cycle.&nbsp; MWD frightens city voters with
drought forecasts, secures entitlements to excess water, and dumps it
on surrounding deserts to enrich land speculators there.&nbsp; While
waiting for urban sprawl to reach them they farm with the mindset of
short-term tenants, caring nothing for soil conservation or permanent
farm improvements.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mulholland began the game in 1913, storing Owens
Valley water in the San Fernando Valley (remember Chinatown with Faye
Dunaway and Jack Nicholson?)&nbsp; It was too good not to replay; there
have been several Sons of Chinatown.&nbsp; MWD is now watering an
"avocado crescent" 200 miles north-south, with groves on slopes up to
45 degrees.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Will pesticide taxation control those
problems?&nbsp; Rather, toxic runoff is just another of several reasons
why we must face up to radical review of our political-economic
treadmills, driven as they are by what TIME Magazine has called <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The
Great American System of Public Works for Private Profit.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="THE_COMMON_THEME_FROM_FOREST_CITY_AND"></a>THE COMMON THEME FROM
FOREST, CITY AND FARM</span> <br>
<br>
Market failure, public programs and perverse
incentives in the land market create a gross bias towards spreading out
too much.&nbsp; This aggravates otherwise fairly tractable runoff
problems.&nbsp; The more Tierra Desnuda, the more runoff.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
This perversion does not occur by accident.&nbsp;
Spread and sprawl in forestry, cities and agriculture are common
results of the dominant force driving American politics, the quest for
unearned increments to land value.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Thorstein Veblen in his final testament, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Absentee
Ownership</span>, noted that American farmers &nbsp;<br>
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">...have
always, ... wanted something more than their ... share of
the soil; not because they were driven by a felt need of doing more
than their fair share of work ..., but with a view to ... getting
a little something for nothing in allowing their holdings to be turned
to account</span> (Veblen, pp. 138-40).&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
To enhance those values they will now invoke
any complaisant higher power, and since God already did His bit by
donating the Earth, they turn to Government.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But the profile of land values is like
a volcanic
island.&nbsp; To raise the top and the slopes and the shores we must
also raise the shallows above sea level, where they shed the waters and
come into use.&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Rising population is one factor pushing up the
profile of values, but not the strongest one.&nbsp; Increased demand
per capita is the main factor.&nbsp; These demands include all the
spurious demands described above, like the demand of government for
land to "bank" and hold idle, and the demand of speculators "with a
view to getting a little something for nothing."&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Veblen went on to say that farm technology adapts to
the Procrustean bed of absentee ownership: rather than leading,
technology lags changes wrought by the ownership pattern.&nbsp; Thus it
is not "society" or "efficiency" alone that mandate inorganic
monocultural chemical farming, but also the peculiar needs of absentee
owners holding more land than they can work themselves or with their
families.&nbsp; Logic of, by and for this minority is set up as logic
for all.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
If this be true, or (more likely) partly true, it
must be admitted that most academics go along and get along with this
dominant minority.&nbsp; Organic farming, biological controls,
appropriate technology, IPM, and other countervailing logics had to
come from screwballs outside the system, plus a few martyrs and
kamikazes inside it, dominated as it is by accommodating "regular
fellows," "good old boys," noncontroversial administrators who
"understand local needs" and "work with community leaders," and
complaisant faculty who enjoy "credibility."&nbsp; Are we part of the
problem?&nbsp; Let everyone debate that with his own conscience, and be
fair enough to lose a few points.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="SOLUTIONS_"></a>SOLUTIONS</span>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution is land stewardship, a
new-old ethic to
supplant the cowboy ethic in which western man has wallowed over
several centuries of territorial expansion.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;<br>
<br>
To reprise from the section on forestry, we must
synthesize two concepts of land stewardship.&nbsp; Concept A says "save
for the future"; Concept B says put land to full use right now, to
serve and employ people.&nbsp; Concept AB says do both, but each in the
right place.&nbsp; Use the good land, use it well and fully, employ the
workers, serve everyone's needs.&nbsp; Congregate and cooperate on
central, low, flat, fertile ground, as efficient markets and efficient
public policies would dictate anyway.&nbsp; Leave the marginal land in
peace.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
But as we tiptoe into this new era let us not sell
stewardship by making it too easy and trivial, lest we repeat the sorry
history of SCS.&nbsp; We are all trained to be trivial, to make few
ripples and no waves.&nbsp; We are conditioned by higher education, and
disciplined by employers to accept and believe the basic premises of
the system and contribute our mite, if any, only to reinforce or patch
or adorn it.&nbsp; Hence the fascination of schemes like effluent
charges and their analogues like excise taxes on surrogates.&nbsp; If
those ripples look like waves to us, it shows how much we have to grow
to deserve our ancestors.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Excise taxes have their place, true, but the
problems at hand are much vaster and deeper than little measures
reach.&nbsp; Solutions call for basic reconstruction and reorientation
more drastic than most of us dare contemplate.&nbsp; But let's try: it
might even be fun.&nbsp; Dan Hoan had fun making Milwaukee work; he is
as good a model as we need.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
