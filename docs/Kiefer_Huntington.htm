<p align="center"><strong>James Otis Sargent Huntington</strong><br>Founder, [Episcopal] Order of the Holy Cross <br>1854-1935<br>
  [SMOG 15.76]</p>
<p>  James Huntington was born in Boston in 1854, studied
    at Harvard and at St Andrew's Divinity School in Syracuse, was ordained to
    the priesthood around 1880, and served a working-class congregation. After
    a few years, he felt called to found a monastic order for priests of the
    Episcopal Church, and with two companions he began working among poor immigrants
    on New York's Lower East Side. After a slow start, he with others became
    the Order of the Holy Cross, which now has a monastery in West Park, New
    York, and priests involved in parish work and social work scattered elsewhere.
    Huntington was Superior of the order for several non-consecutive terms, but
    devoted himself chiefly to preaching, teaching, and counselling until his
    death on 28 June 1935. Since this is the feast of Irenaeus of Lyons, he is
    commemorated on the anniversary of the receiving of his monastic vows by
    the Bishop of New York on 25 November 1884.</p>
<p><strong>In the course of his work, he became involved in the labor-union movement
  and <em>the land-tax movement</em>. The latter of these may require some explanation.</strong></p>
<p>Henry George, author of <em><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a></em>, argued that, while some forms
  of wealth are produced by human activity, and are rightly the property of the
  producers (or those who have obtained them from the previous owners by voluntary
  gift or exchange), land and natural resources are bestowed by God on the human
  race, and that every one of the N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth
  of the coal beds, 1/Nth of the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of
  the fertile soil. God wills a society where everyone may sit in peace under
  his own vine and his own fig tree.</p>
<p>  The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of land
    hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
      of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
      Leviticus
    25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the use of it
      until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty years,
      when all
    debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary owner. </p>
<p>    Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
      of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
      expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
      owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
      a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here
      I am
      anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
      in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
<p>  This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece of
  land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on it, practically
  zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the original sale price,
  but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold his &quot;fair share,&quot; or
  1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal to his dividend check,
  and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land is meant land with a value equal
  to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the country.</p>
<p>  Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
    as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
    more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
    to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
    the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
<p>  Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
  at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to feed
  and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth of the
  labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family of 4
  occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will enable
  them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that land is
  enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course, they may prefer
  to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the situation from which
  we start is one in which everyone has his own plot of ground from which to
  wrest a living by the strength of his own back, and any deviation from this
  is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly involved,
  who judge themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
<p>    Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
    conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
    land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
      or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
    uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
      (everything
    else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It
    is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and means that the ultimate owner
    of the land is the king, as symbol of the people. Note that English-derived
    law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The
    concept of eminent domain is that the landholder may be forced to surrender
    his landholdings to the government for a public purpose. Historically, eminent
    domain does not apply to property other than land, although complications arise
    when there are buildings on the land that is being seized.</p>
<p>  I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
  support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
  Huxley</a>, <a href="../themes/quotable_notables.htm">Woodrow Wilson</a>,
  Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo
  Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William F Buckley Jr</a>, and <a href="../themes/underpop/Sun_Yat-Sen.htm">Sun
  Yat-sen</a>. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by Alfred Nobel himself there
  has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the Henry George Foundation claims
  eight of the Economics Laureates as supporters, in whole or in part, of the
  proposals of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Milton
  Friedman</a>, 1976; <a href="../themes/quotable_nobels.htm">Herbert
  A Simon</a>, 1978; <a href="../themes/quotable_nobels.htm">James Tobin</a>, 1981; Franco Modigliani, 1985; James M Buchanan,
  1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
<p>  The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that cities
  shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they tax buildings
  and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about to ask, &quot;How
  can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land and the value of
  the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real estate assessors do
  it all the time. It is standard practice to make the two assessments separately,
  and a parcel of land in the business district of a large city very often has
  a different owner from the building on it.) Many cities have moved to a system
  of taxing land more heavily than improvements, and most have been pleased with
  the results, finding that landholders are more likely to use their land productively
  &#8212; to their own benefit and that of the public &#8212; if their taxes do not automatically
  go up when they improve their land by constructing or maintaining buildings
  on it.</p>
<p>  An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian proposal, &quot;evolution,
  not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental and reversible. If a city or other
  jurisdiction does not like the results of a two-level tax system, it can repeal
  the arrangement or reduce the difference in levels with no great upheaval.
  It is not like some other proposals of the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth
  justly, and make me absolute dictator of the world so that I can supervise
  the distribution, and if it doesn't work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem
  is that absolute dictators seldom resign.</p>
<p>    For those who wish to inquire further, I recommend reading the book <a href="../George_P&P.html"><em><strong>Progress
    and Poverty</strong></em></a>, by Henry George. It is available from the <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/">Robert
    Schalkenbach Foundation</a>    or from your local bookstore or library. It should be on every list of Great
    Books of the Western
    World, or of books that every educated person is assumed to have read. Ask
    for their catalog, and make a similar request of the <a href="http://www.henrygeorgefoundation.us/">Henry
    George Foundation of America</a>.</p>
<p>    I repeat, this is not an argument for a political or economic proposal, but
      simply background material on the founder of a religious order. You did
      not expect me to tell you that James Huntington was a disciple of Henry
      George
      and leave you wondering who Henry George was, did you?</p>

<hr width="40%">
<p>The New York Times of July 18, 1887 carried an article entitled &quot;Playing Second
  Fiddle: Henry George is Again in the Background: Father Huntingdon Awakes All
  the Enthusiasm at Last Night's Anti-Poverty Meeting&quot;. Here is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;... Father Huntingdon waited calmly until the stamping and cheering of
    these enthusiastic anti-poverty people had ceased. The working classes reminded
    him
      of the slave who had bought his liberty three times and had again been
    made a slave.&quot; The workingman had bought his liberty thrice, yes, thirty
    times,
      yet he was still in industrial slavery. If men were made free and the land
    were made free, then the people would get what God intended for them.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;... If at times Father Huntingdon talked over the heads of his auditors,
    that fact did not interfere with the warmth of the applause showered upon
    him.
    After he sat down he was compelled to rise a couple of times to acknowledge
    the cheers of the 1,500 or more people who gladly did him honor. He created
    a hearty laugh later in the evening, when one of the audience, in relating
    a personal experience, said he had asked an Episcopal clergyman to talk on
    labor matters once, and the clergyman had said he must first secure the consent
    of his Bishop. Would not Father Huntingdon be cast out of the church for
    his advocacy of the new doctrine?</p>
  <p>&quot;Stepping to the footlights Father Huntingdon said: &quot;My Bishop is not that
    kind of a Bishop and I'm not that kind of a priest.&quot;</p>
