<center><b>The Property Tax Shift</b>
<p> by Jeffery J. Smith</p>
</center>
<p><b> What is the PTS?</b></p>
<p>The conventional property tax is two taxes in one. One falls on
buildings, the other on land. Some places don't tax improvements at
all, just sites. They did the Property Tax Shift (the PTS).</p>
<p><b> Why is the PTS better than the conventional property
tax?</b></p>
<p> Taxing buildings raises their cost and discourages
improvements, resulting in slums and loss of construction jobs.
Taxing parcels, on the other hand, lowers their price and spurs
development, resulting in compact, more esthetic cities offering
plenty of good work.</p>
<p><b> Where has the PTS been tried and how did it do?</b></p>
<p> The PTS operates in Pittsburgh, twice named America's Most
Livable City for its affordable housing and low crime, and in 14
other towns in Pennsylvania. Taiwan taxed ag land and converted from
poverty to prosperity in record time. While taxing land, some places
fully exempted structures. New Zealand enjoyed seven years of 99%
employment. Johannesburg, South Africa, had the fastest
site-recycling rate in the world. Some Australian towns added
business during the last recession. Other places, such as the Port
District of San Diego, Canberra (the capitol of Australia), and Hong
Kong, exist on public land leased to homes and businesses. All three
raise lots of public revenue. Hong Kong often rates as the world's
best city for business. (See our "Where Tax Reform Has Worked: 20
Case Summaries".)</p>
<p><b> How is taxing the land being friendly to the
earth?</b></p>
<p> Un-taxing buildings means owners can improve them -
weatherize, solarize, add heat exchangers, etc - and not incur a
higher tax liability. Up-taxing land means owners must put theirs to
best use. Those who'd pay the most, owners of the valuable central
sites, would be the most eager to develop, absorbing the development
that now spills over into leap-frog sprawl.</p>
<p><b> Transportation drives land use; where does the PTS fit
in?</b></p>
<p> The PTS makes the tax overhead on parking lots too high for
owners and the revenue lost from overly wide streets too high for
municipalities. Changing the use of these lands make driving less
convenient than riding. Plus, transit can be funded from the values
around its stops.</p>
<p><b> Won't the PTS spur over-building, too much
density?</b></p>
<p> Not likely.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) The very heart of big cities, where
value
peaks, becomes hard for private parties to afford, easy for the
public who could there create a plaza. <br>
(b) Taxing land reduces the
profit from speculation, making it easier politically to zone. <br>
(c) It
also reduces the price of land, making it affordable to buy and
protect fragile sites. <br>
(d) As building on under-used appropriate
sites satisfies demand, it becomes feasible to de-build from streams,
banks, cliffs, and ridge tops. Along with plazas, freeing up these
natural features provides sufficient open space.</div>
<p><b> Is this urban medicine, the PTS, good for farms and
forests?</b></p>
<p> The PTS drives compact urban form, sparing suburban farms. As
the Tax Shift advances, de-taxing work and profit while collecting
natural rents, investment is moved in the opposite direction, from
extracting natural resources to recycling used materials. As
recycling takes labor and extraction takes capital, de-taxing both
ends the tax-breaks now enjoyed by extraction. On a level playing
field, recycling can roll over extraction, sparing forests and the
wilderness in general.</p>
<p><b> What's the new bottom line? Who pays more? Who
less?</b></p>
<p> The PTS is inherently progressive. The site value ratio from
city center to rural fringe is typically 2,000 to one. Only the very
rich own very valuable land. Most people own land of less than
average value. Usually, 75% save, 20% break even, and 5% pay more
after the PTS.</p>
<p><b> What about low income earners who do lose after the
PTS?</b></p>
<p> Occasionally a poor person owns a valuable lot - a small one
close in or a large one far out - that'd owe more than before.
Deferring the poor owner's obligation could let them continue to
under-use their location. That forces development to inappropriate
sites. Eventho' it is society, not owners, who makes land valuable
and thus own this value, society should bear the initial cost of the
PTS. Government could offer the land-poor a bond of equivalent value
in exchange for the land.</p>
<p><b> How do you tell how much a lot is worth? (no pun
intended)</b></p>
<p> People are already figuring out how much a parcel is worth.
Buyers and sellers do it for each transaction. Both parties look at
the social factors: foot traffic, ambient income, proximity to parks,
shops, et al., density, growth rate, etc. Then they conclude a deal
that is fair to both sides (or they wouldn't deal). Both private
appraisers and public assessors track these (relatively) free market
sales.</p>
<p><b> Won't shifting the property tax take a constitutional
amendment?</b></p>
<p> Amending a state or federal constitution would be the direct
approach. But as laws are written by lawyers and include loopholes,
an ambush may work more easily. Activists could persuade their local
jurisdiction to give residents the same property tax breaks that
politicians give big corporations, meanwhile establishing a Benefit
District to collect rent to fund a Housing Voucher, good for taxes,
mortgages, and lease payments. Pretty shifty, eh?</p>
<p><b> Who supports paying higher dues for one's land?</b></p>
<p> The idea is just becoming popular among environmentalists (see
our "97 Notables on Taxing Land Alone') and libertarians. Because the
PTS is both fair and efficient, a few civic leaders, both liberal and
conservative, campaign for it (in Mexicali, the mayor won it). And
sometimes, an overwhelming majority votes it in, as in Allentown in
1996. Historically, versions of the PTS have blossomed each century
(see our "101 Famous Thinkers on Owning Earth").</p>
<p><b> Is the PTS really necessary?</b></p>
<p> As long as we let rapidly rising land values reward urban
speculation and rural over-extraction, permanent peace with the earth
is not possible. This torrential flow of revenue must be put at the
service of sustainability if ever we are to enjoy it. So, how about
it? Ready to help shift taxes now and subsidies later? Just use the
coupon below. Thanks, on behalf of the planet.</p>
