<blockquote><i>Here Are 22 Empirical Studies On the Effects of Land
Value Taxation In Actual Applications</i></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dilemma is this: recounting 237 studies (more are coming) is
mind-boggling and brain-busting. It will lead to e-g-o (eyes glazed
over) among readers, so I am listing 22 brief summaries of them here.
Anyone desiring all 237 summaries should write me for them (10528
Cross Fox Lane, Columbia, MD 21044; cost: $12). I did some of these
studies myself. </p>
These 237 studies come from a close reading of the back issues
(from 1974 on) of Incentive Taxation, an eight times yearly
newsletter reviewing empirical studies of the taxation of land
values. Here are the 22 summaries mentioned above:<br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(1) The contiguous cities of
Allentown and Bethlehem in eastern
Pennsylvania</b> are comparable as to size and economy. However, in
1997 Allentown became two-rate LVT. The difference between the land
and building rates was expanded in each of the following four years
while Bethlehem remained one-rate.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Allentown&#8217;s new construction and
renovation grew by 82% in
dollar value in the three years after it adopted two-rate LVT as
compared to the prior three years. Its new construction and
renovation grew 54% faster than Bethlehem&#8217;s new construction and
renovation despite the infusion of much federal-grant money into
Bethlehem (but not into Allentown) during 1997-99. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are based on a study
of city-hall building-permit
data on file in the Allentown and Bethlehem city halls, done by
Benjamin Howells (a science researcher and former Allentown
councilman), William Kells (a science-oriented businessman), and
Steven Cord (professor-emeritus) in 1999. The study was summarized in
Incentive Taxation (hereafter referred to as IT), 7/00, p. 1.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(2) Washington and nearby
Monessen (both in southwestern
Pennsylvania)</b> are roughly comparable as to size and economy.
After Washington became two-rate LVT in 1985, it saw its new
construction and renovation increase by 33% in dollar value in the
three years after two-rate adoption as compared to the prior three
years. During the same time periods, nearby one-rate Monessen&#8217;s
new construction and renovation decreased by 26%.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A report of this study, based on
building-permit data on file in
the Washington and Monessen city halls, can be found in IT, 10/88.
Also see IT, 9/00, and 10/97).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(3) Connellsville, Pa. </b>saw
its new construction and
renovation jump 3.46 times in the three years after it adopted a
two-rate LVT property tax as compared to the prior three years. This
jump can be compared to nearby the rather modest 1.07 increase in
nearby Uniontown during the same time period. The two cities are
quite comparable, although Uniontown is somewhat larger and is the
county seat (both these differences are economic development
plusses).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A report of this study can be
found in IT, 10/97. It is based on
building-permits issued on file in the Connellsville and Uniontown
city halls.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(4) Aliquippa, Pa.</b> presents
interesting statistics because
both the city and eventually its school district went two-rate LVT.
When the city adopted a substantial two-rate building-to-land shift
in its local property tax in January 1988, its new construction and
renovation jumped 97%, 1988-90 as compared to 1985-87. See IT,
10/91.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Meanwhile, nearby Ambridge
(comparable except that it was closer
to the Pittsburgh international airport and enjoyed a brisk tourist
traffic at its Old Economy Shaker Village - both economic plusses)
experienced a 30% decline in building-permits issued during the same
period of time. Nearby Beaver Falls, also comparable except that it
was less hilly than Aliquippa and is the county seat (both economic
plusses), experienced a 7.2% decline during the same period of time.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In July 1993, the Aliquippa School
District adopted a two-rate
building-to-land switch in its property tax. Another spurt in new
construction and renovation took place: for 1994-95, it was 2.3 times
greater than for 1991-92 (based on building-permit records on file at
city hall; see IT, 12/99).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(5) In 1989, Clairton, Pa., an
industrial suburb of
Pittsburgh</b>, was under direct state fiscal control, officially
labeled &#8220;financially distressed.&#8221; It took the advice of the
prestigious Pennsylvania Economy League by going two-rate LVT in
January of that year, taxing building assessments at 2.105% and land
assessments at 10% (instead of both at 3.7%). During the three-year
period after the switch, its taxable building permits were 8.5% more
than in the three years before. This is to be compared to the 5.8%
decline in U.S. building permits during the same periods of time
(based on building-permit records in Clairton City Hall; see IT
10/93).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(6) Let us now compare two-rate
Oil City, Pa</b>., which
adopted two-rate LVT starting in January 1989, with its nearby
one-rate-but-otherwise-comparable neighbor, Franklin, Pa. Oil City
experienced a 58.2% increase in new construction and renovation in
the three years after it adopted a two-rate property tax as compared
to the three years before, whereas one-rate Franklin experienced a
12.2% decline during the same time periods (based on building-permit
study in the two city halls, IT 11/94).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(7) The long two-rate LVT
experience of Pittsburgh</b> has
provided many studies: for instance, in the years 1980-84, when
Pittsburgh was expanding the difference between its land and building
property-tax rates, its new construction as measured by
building-permits issued was fully 3.57 times higher, adjusted for
inflation, than in the pre-change years of 1974-78, despite the
steady post-1980 contraction of Pittsburgh&#8217;s steel industry
(source: Pennsylvania Economy League study of Pittsburgh&#8217;s
two-rate Graded Tax, 1985, p. 16). For the entire United States,
1980-84 office-building permits were only 1.6 times higher than for
1974-78 (not adjusted for inflation, per Daniel Sansbury, U.S. Bureau
of Census, Suitland, Md. on 1/21/93 and as reported in IT,
10/93).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The boom in Pittsburgh continued:
in 1985, its building permits
increased 2.29 times over 1984; in 1986, it was 2.38 times greater
than in 1984 (source: Pbg. Bldg. Inspection Dept.; also see IT 10/86,
p. 2).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But there&#8217;s something even more
striking: after Pittsburgh
increased its land-tax rate in 1979 and again in 1980, its
construction increased an almost unbelievable 26.18 times faster than
construction in the U.S. during the same period of time (sources:
table 1194, U.S. Census report C30, and the building-permit annual
reports, city of Pbg.).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(8) In other countries, there
are many good studies of the
effect of a building-to-land switch on construction.</b> For
instance, Godfrey Dunkley, a mechanical engineer specializing in the
design and sale of fluid filtration equipment, extracted interesting
statistics from the official Municipal Yearbooks of the government in
South Africa.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dunkley compared 1959 assessments
to 1979 assessments and found
that the one-rate towns (taxing land and buildings equally) increased
their total assessments by 486%, the two-rate towns (taxing land more
than buildings) increased by 561%, and the 46 towns that switched
from taxing only land assessments increased by 850%. Inflation
affected all these figures, but the more a town taxed land values,
the faster it grew. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Further substantiation: the eight
towns that switched from
one-rate to LVT-only increased by 748%, and the 15 towns that
switched from two-rate to land-taxing-only increased by 996%. A later
Dunkley study of a different time comparison yielded similar figures
(for a summary of Dunkley&#8217;s first study, see IT 9/83).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(9) Then there&#8217;s the study by
professors Wallace Oates and
Robert Schwab</b>, both of the University of Maryland, which reported
that 15 large northeastern cities in the U.S. averaged a decline of
15.5% in their annual value of building permits issued between
1960-1969 and 1980-1989, but two-rate LVT Pittsburgh recorded a 70.4%
increase. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Columbus, Ohio was the only other
city in the study recording an
increase - a rather modest 3.6% &#8211; but it had annexed some
fast-growing suburbs in the interim (see IT, 10/92).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(10) In 1995, Professor
Nicolaus Tideman of Virginia Tech
University and his then-graduate student, Florenz Plassmann</b> (now
a professor at the University of Binghamton), completed a highly
technical study of land value taxation in Pennsylvania entitled
&#8220;A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the Effect of Two-Rate
Property Taxes on Construction.&#8221; See IT 12/00 for the verbatim
conclusion of the original study and the peer-reviewed Journal of
Urban Economics, pp. 216-47, for the full study.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To quote from the conclusion of
their original study: &#8220;The
results say that for all four categories of construction, an increase
in the effective tax differential is associated with an increase in
the average value per permit. In the case of residential housing, a
1% increase in the effective tax differential is associated with a
12% increase in the average value per unit&#8230; From the perspective
of economic theory, it is not at all surprising that when taxes are
taken off of buildings, people build more valuable buildings. But it
is nice to see the numbers.&#8221;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(11) Harry Gunnison Brown, a
leading economist in the 1930s,
reported that suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</b>, which
were about five rail miles from Flinders Street in the center of
Melbourne and which taxed land values only, had 50% more dwellings
constructed per available acre in the 1928-1942 period than those
which did not. Making a similar comparison for suburbs seven miles
out, the land-value-tax suburbs did 2.33 times better; LVT suburbs
9.5 miles out did twice as well.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(12) A Pittsburgh City Council
study (1976)</b> showed
conclusively that a 1% earned income tax would hit the city&#8217;s
homeowners 3.59 times harder than an equivalent-in-revenue LVT
increase. The same study also found that a two-rate LVT would
down-tax 73.6% of homeowners.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(13) A Washington, D.C.
council-authorized study done in the
1970s</b> shows that if the current property tax were shifted from
land and building assessments to land assessments only, then there
would be these tax reductions: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>single-family homes - 18.1%, </small></li>
  <li><small>two-family homes - 20.9%, </small></li>
  <li><small>row houses - 14%, </small></li>
  <li><small>walkup apartments - 38.9%, </small></li>
  <li><small>elevator apartments - 22.5%.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(14) In 164 suburbs outside
central Melbourne (Aus.),</b>
during the two-year period 1955/56 to 1957/58, there were 42 new
factories, of which half were in the 17 localities using LVT-only.
Not only that, but factory employment in these l7 LVT-only localities
increased by 445 whereas in the remaining 147 localities, factory
employment decreased by 361 (source: Aus. govt. statistics in
&#8220;Public Charges Upon Land Values,&#8221; a 1961 study of the
General Council of Rating [local taxing] Reform).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(15) Twelve studies in rural
Victoria found that LVT-only
towns</b> averaged a construction-and-renovation growth of 29%, as
compared to the growth of their real-estate-income-taxing neighbors
of a modest 2.6% in the same period of time (source: GCRR study of
building-permits issued as reported in Progress Magazine, Melbourne
3/75). In each case, LVT-only was adopted as a result of a poll only
of landowners.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(16) If you fall through the
earth, you will emerge near Perth,
Western Australia</b> (pop. 400,000). 17 localities there tax land
values only; they experienced a 34.36% increase in the total number
of dwellings between 6/30/71 and 6/30/76. The nine nearby localities
taxing both land and buildings and presumably subject to the same
economic-growth influences, experienced a 0.02% decrease in the same
time period (source: Aus. govt. statistics, as cited in Progress,
11/77, p. 10).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(17) In North Dakota</b>,
according to USN&amp;WR, 4/3/78, p.
54, farmers paid no tax on farm buildings, and a survey by a high
official of the N.D. League of Cities revealed that this has
encouraged new farm construction.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(18) California Irrigation
Districts </b>- Ever since 1909,
California law requires that when new irrigation networks are built,
they are to be financed by a tax on the affected land values only;
all privately owned improvements were to be property-tax exempt. The
theory was that since land values jumped due to the publicly owned
irrigation networks, the expense of those networks should be borne by
the affected landowners.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result has been beneficial to
the local farmers, particularly
the smaller ones. The irrigated valleys are among the most productive
in the world, and in 1914 the Modesto Chamber of Commerce stated,
&#8220;as a result of the change many of the large ranches have been
cut up and sold in small tracts. The new owners are cultivating these
farms intensively. The population of both country and city has
greatly increased&#8230; The new system of taxation has brought great
prosperity to our district. Farmers are now encouraged to improve
their property. Industry and thrift are not punished by an increase
in taxes&#8221; (Congressional Research Service, &#8220;Property
Taxation,&#8221; p. 48).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(19) Malvern, Australia</b>
experienced a marked construction
spurt after it adopted LVT-only in August 1955, but the most
extensive construction took place in its blighted problem
neighborhoods. Before August 1955, those neighborhoods accounted for
only 22% of the city&#8217;s building permits, but in each of the five
ensuing years, that percentage jumped first to 35% and then steadily
moved up to 47% in 1960 (remember that these percentages are of
continually larger construction figures; source - Victoria Building
&amp; Construction Journal, 1979).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(20) Tax defaults</b>: in New
Zealand in the late 1950s, ten
large LVT-only cities had slightly less defaults than three large
non-LVT-only cities. This would indicate that exempting buildings
from local taxation does not increase tax defaults (source: H.
Bronson Cowan, a Canadian and president of the Intl. Research Com. on
Real Estate Taxation, p. 31 of the 1961 report of the Canadian
Federation of Mayors and Municipalities). See IT, 12/81.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(21) According to a city-funded
1980 study in New Castle,
Pa</b>., seven vacant and two poorly developed downtown sites would
be an estimated $150,851 more profitable to build upon with an
LVT-only property tax. If county and school taxes were also to adopt
LVT-only, then the extra profit would approximate an estimated
$243,750 a year.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(22) Assessment officials in
both Pittsburgh and Scranton,
Pa</b>. reported to Steven Cord that after these cities shifted some
of their local property taxes from buildings to land, there were no
significant changes in assessment appeals.</small></div>
<p> </p>
After more than fifty years of searching, I have never been able
to locate an LVT jurisdiction that did not increase its construction
and renovation after its LVT adoption, and more importantly, did not
out-construct and out-renovate its comparable non-LVT neighbors.
<p>The following is a summary of the 237 empirical studies (soon to
be much more):</p>
<ul>
  <li>45 empirical studies conclusively prove that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">when a town adopts LVT, a spurt in new
construction and renovation results</span>. I encountered no studies
proving otherwise.</li>
  <li>63 empirical studies conclusively prove that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a local building-to-land-tax switch has
always resulted in a spurt in new construction and renovation</span>,
as measured by building permits issued, and what&#8217;s more important,
these 63 have out-constructed and out-renovated their comparable
neighbors (presumably they were subject to the same economic-growth
influences). No studies prove otherwise.</li>
  <li>85 empirical studies conclusively prove that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">most voters pay less with a
building-tax-to-land-tax switch (with no diminution in govt. revenues)</span>.
In two of these studies, the voters were found to pay more (that could
happen if there was a large factory in town that fared a little better
with a building-tax-to-land-tax switch than did the homeowners).</li>
  <li>30 empirical studies conclusively proved various miscellaneous
LVT advantages. </li>
  <li>6 studies concerned <span style="font-weight: bold;">farmers</span>:
in three studies, farmers essentially broke even with a shift to LVT,
in one study farmers would pay slightly more, and in two studies
farmers would pay slightly less. But in Australia, farmers generally
voted in LVT.</li>
  <li>Endorsements were listed in 8 empirical studies (but we have
hundreds more endorsements listed elsewhere).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think the down-taxing of buildings will lead to more
buildings and the up-taxing of land will lead to the more efficient
utilization of land-sites, then act. The poor and unemployed need
your help.</p>
