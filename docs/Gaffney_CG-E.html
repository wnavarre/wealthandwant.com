<strong>California's Governor-Elect</strong><b><br>
</b>Mason Gaffney<br>
October, 2003<b></b>
</center>
<p>For better or worse, California has recalled its governor and
elected Arnold Schwarzenegger (A.S.) to replace him. A.S. has
revealed no specifics of how he will stanch our deficit. He
campaigned on generalities: he is against taxes, against waste in
government, against measures to rein in vehicle use, and nostalgic
about the good old days when Governor Pat Brown was spending heavily
on roads and water projects. No one seems sure how he will connect
the dots. After his first visit to Sacto last week, he seemed not
sure, either.</p>
<p>His choice of advisors, however, tells us A.S. will repeat Pete
Wilson's performance from the early 1990s. Chief of Staff Patricia
Clarey is a good soldier from Wilson's old staff; Auditor Donna
Arduin is from Jeb Bush's Florida. The gurus who set the doctrinal
tone give the clearest hints: they are neo-classical economists of
deepest dye. These are advisors George Shultz and Michael Boskin
from the Hoover Institution. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economics,
to them, is a set of dismal
choices. California's choice is to cut public services, or lose
business and jobs. That is what they told Wilson in 1994. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">All taxes
are the same, always "burdens," always driving away "business."</span></span></p>
<p>In 1994, Wilson appointed Shultz and Boskin heads of his "Task
Force on California Tax Reform and Reduction." They "urged" a 15%
cut in income taxes, personal and corporate. Biggest cuts would be
for corporations, and the highest brackets. Boskin said "savings to
business are crucial to the State's recovery." Shultz said it will
"spur job creation," and "make California more competitive." Wilson
endorsed the report, to make California "a friendlier place for
taxpayers." Other usual suspects like The State Chamber of Commerce
jumped right on board, to "stimulate the economy." It could have
been a dress rehearsal for G.W. Bush in Washington.</p>
<p>They promised it would increase revenues, on the Laffer-curve
hypothesis. Failing that, they would cut "waste in government," that
perpetual whipping boy. On the last matter, they stifled two
important points. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, in 1978 critics of Prop. 13 asked Howard Jarvis how the
public schools and local governments could survive without the property
tax. "Let the damn s.o.b's in Sacramento figure it out, that's what you
pay the b&#8230;..ds for," came the answer in Jarvis-speak. They figured it
out, all right: they raised sales and income and business taxes, to
funnel funds to localities and schools. Naturally, state taxes rose
without any visible rise in state services. Now the Jarvisites,
including A.S.'s advisor Jon Coupal, cite this as waste in Sacramento.</li>
  <li>Second, most taxes come out of the social surplus, hence sooner
or later out of land rents. Most landowners, wrote Adam Smith, are too
"indolent" to be fully aware of that, so they oppose land taxes. Later,
as the truth seeps in, they come to oppose all taxes. Wasteful public
spending is bad, but the part not wasted is spent in the public
interest. Jarvis told us that fire-fighters are just hogs like
teachers, with their "noses in the public trough," but today, like
Kipling's Tommy Atkins, "it's savior of 'is country when the guns begin
to shoot." <b>Today, no one even expects that any part of the rents
taken privately should be spent in the public interest. Luxurious waste
by private rent-takers is seen as a natural right, free of social
obligations. Thus far have we come from the feudal coupling of social
obligations with private rents. Add to this the notion that widows and
other poor people own all the land, so any tax is regressive.</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Boskin and Shultz, posing their dismal choice for California,
dismissed by silence that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we
can raise needed revenues while also
spurring job creation and stimulating the economy. It is simple:
restore that part of the property tax that falls on land, while
continuing to cap the rate on buildings. </span></b> Attorney Charles
Haughey has drafted a simple amendment to Prop. 13 that accomplishes
this by changing just a few words here and there. Boskin and
Shultz's silence is not from ignorance. Boskin was the
prot&eacute;g&eacute; of George Break, a member of Schalkenbach's
<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/studies/TRED.html">Committee on Taxation,
Resources, and Economic Development (TRED)</a>. He is the colleague of
Hoover staffer Charles McLure, another TRED
member, and of <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a> who has (reluctantly and
patronizingly) muttered a few good words about taxing land values. It
is rather that the Georgist message gets filtered out.</p>
<p>How does that happen? Pete Wilson, when Governor, was thick with
major landowners, who are also major political contributors.&nbsp;
Wilson
as Governor used one of the residences of Donald Bren, owner of the
Irvine Co., for official meetings.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Irvine has owned for years about
1/5 of Orange Cnty., and its interest has ever been to maximize the
value of its lands. It is not hard to fathom why A.S. told Warren
Buffet to do 500 pushups the moment Buffet suggested reviving
property taxation.</span></p>
<p><b>It is also alleged that land values are too small to support
government. Let us test that idea.</b> In 2003, at the current
rate, there will be about 15,000 "confirmed" sales of owner-occupied
urban California residences at prices over $1 million. That is from
DataQuick, a standard source of current real estate data. 15,000 is
about 2.7% of all confirmed sales. Some of those go much higher. The
mean is probably over $2 million.</p>
<p>Turnover of costlier homes is lower than that of ordinary homes.
(For example, turnover of existing homes is 30% greater in Riverside
County, with lower values, than in Orange County, with higher
values.) 2% a year is a fair guess at the turnover of homes valued
at $1 million or more. If so, there are 50 x 15,000, or 750,000 homes
in Calif valued at a mean $2 millions. Their aggregate value is
750,000 x $2 million = $1.5 trillions.</p>
<p>These are not large buildings: they average 2864 s.f., with 4
bdrms, 3 baths. In the north end of Sta. Monica, a vacant lot alone
is over $1m. They are not new buildings: only 9% are new. It's the
land that makes them worth so much.</p>
<p><b>A tax of 1% on that value would yield $15 billions a year. </b>
That's from only 2.7% of the urban homes in Calif. The data exclude
many sales, country manors, for example. Some well-known lands thus
excluded are</p>
<ul>
  <li>the Lucas compound and the Pritzker family compound in
Marin;  </li>
  <li>San Simeon;  </li>
  <li>the Reagan Ranch and similar holdings in the
northern half of Sta. Barbara Cnty;  </li>
  <li>fashionable winery properties in
choice valleys statewide;  </li>
  <li>the Chandler family's Tejon Ranch;  </li>
  <li>the
200,000 acres of James Boswell in the Tulare Lake Basin; etc.</li>
</ul>
<b>There is also the other 97.3% of urban owner-occupied
residential real estate.</b> A lot of it is just under $1 million a
pop. In Marin County, the <span style="font-style: italic;">median </span>sales
price of owner-occupied
single-family homes was $700,000 when last seen, and rising. The
mean is always higher than the median. Some L.A. County cities with
median values just under $1 million include San Marino, Bel Air,
Westwood, Brentwood, La Canada, Calabasas, and others. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">There is also
all the other land: commercial, industrial, farm, forest, etc., which
is 60% of the assessed property value in California, and a much
higher fraction of the real value because it is so egregiously
underassessed.</span>
<p><b>10% of the residential units are vacant.</b> Vacancy rates are
especially high in beach cities with resort qualities and very high
prices. These also include "beach, yacht and business" cities like
Newport Beach.</p>
<p><b>A high fraction of California real estate is absentee owned.
</b> The Sultan of Brunei, for example, owns several houses and sites
in Beverly Hills and Bel Air. California's official Legislative
Analyst, the highly respected William Hamm, estimated <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">in 1978 that
over fifty per cent of the value of taxable property in California
was absentee-owned. </span>This is such a bold, bare, and enormous
fact it
is hard to understand how Californians have been misled into
resisting the urge to levy land taxes on all this foreign wealth. They
may be put off by the argument that they need to attract outside
capital, but that carries no weight when considering the large
percentage of this property which is land value, and which may be
taxed separately from buildings.</p>
<p><b>Some half of any reduction in California property taxes leaks
to out-of-state owners. </b> Nor is this the only <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">leakage</span>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Net
federal income tax payments have risen because sales and nuisance
taxes raised to replace lost property taxes are not deductible.  </li>
  <li>Sales of local general obligation bonds have stopped and will
stay
stopped. Revenue bonds are sold instead, with higher interest rates.  </li>
  <li>Fire insurance rates must rise.  </li>
  <li>Private spending, even by local
landowners, has a higher propensity to import than public spending
that goes for policemen, firemen, teachers, local contractors, and so
on.</li>
</ul>
<b>This substantial leakage of economic base results in multiple
declines in state income. </b> Cities love to commission "economic
base" studies, and a small industry of moonlighting economists love
to perform them, usually to rationalize subsidizing some
transnational conglomerate to put in a branch plant. They use canned
"input-output" models to show how every dollar invested generates
$2-3 of induced investment locally. Yet no one has seized on this
obvious case to show that <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">local property taxes, substituted
for
absentee rent payments, creates multiple increases in local income.</span>
The whole intellectual apparatus is dominated by absentee investors
and used for their benefit.</span>
<p>Many rents may be taxed in other ways. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Georgists have long noted
that parking meters are a way of collecting rent for use of public
land, but they are pikers when it comes to estimating the value
thereof. Donald Shoup, a UCLA professor, estimates <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the value of
street parking, if properly priced, as enough to replace the entire
property tax.</span></span></p>
<p>Parking, however, is less than half the story. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Vehicles also use
public space when they are moving</span>, often bumper-to-bumper in
heavy
traffic. Bridge, tunnel and ferry tolls reflect this obvious fact,
and yet even <span style="font-weight: bold;">most Georgists resist
the obvious logical extension of
the principle: taxes on vehicles and fuels are a kind of rough "land
tax on wheels."</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The revenue
potentials are breathtaking. Auto
dealers, of course, spearhead the opposition.</span> Observe how many
acres
each dealership preempts, and you will understand how they make so
much money to brainwash the public into rejecting such taxes, along,
of course, with conventional property taxes on their land.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Many valuable land resources are
held by license, rather than
title, and escape the property tax almost entirely.</span> Licenses to
divert <span style="font-weight: bold;">water </span>are an obvious
case, and worth enough to replace
billions of dollars of sales and income taxes. More on this, and the
recent transfer of Colorado River water to San Diego, will appear in
the next installment of Insights.</p>
