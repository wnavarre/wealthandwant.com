<div align="center"><strong>Steps to Economic Recovery
  </strong>
</div>
<p align="center">by John Dewey, Ph.D., professor, Columbia University<br>
  <font size="-1">An address over Radio WEVD, <br>
  New York, NY <br>
  April 28, 1933, 8:45 PM</font></p>
<p>You have heard much about various steps that should be taken to promote economic
  recovery. I propose this evening to concentrate attention upon one step, a
  step absolutely fundamental to permanent recovery of the sick patient, as distinct
  from remedies that dope the patient into a temporary hectic burst of activity;
  a step so simple and so basic as to be generally neglected.</p>
<p>The one thing uppermost in the minds of everybody today is the appalling existence
  of want in the midst of plenty, of millions of unemployed in the midst of idle
  billions of hoarded money and unused credit, as well as factories and mills
  deteriorating for lack of use, of hunger while farmers are burning grain for
  fuel.</p>
<p>No wonder people are asking what sort of a crazy economic system we have when
  at a time when millions are short of adequate food, when babies are going without
  the milk necessary for their growth, the best remedy that experts can think
  of and that the Federal Government can recommend is to pay a premium to farmers
  to grow less grain with which to make flour to feed the hungry, and pay a premium
  to dairymen to send less milk to market.</p>
<p>Henry George called attention to this situation over fifty years ago. The
  contradiction between increasing plenty, increase of potential security &#8212; and
  actual want and insecurity is stated in the title of his chief work, <a href="../George_P&P.html"><em>Progress
  and Poverty</em></a>. That is what his book is about. It is a record of the
  fact that as the means and appliances of civilization increase, poverty and
  insecurity
  also increase. It is an exploration of why millionaires and tramps multiply
  together. It is a prediction of why this state of affairs will continue; it
  is a prediction of the plight in which the nation finds itself today. At the
  same time it is the explanation of why this condition is artificial, man-made,
  unnecessary, and how it can be remedied. So I suggest that as a beginning of
  the first steps to permanent recovery there be a nationwide revival of interest
  in the writings and teachings of Henry George and that there be such an enlightenment
  of public opinion that our representatives in legislatures and public places
  be compelled to adopt the changes he urged.</p>
<p>Do not the following words sound as if they were written today? </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;So true
        it is that poverty does not come from the inability to produce more wealth,
        that from every side we hear that power to produce is in excess of the
    ability to find a market; that the constant fear seems to be not that too
    little, but
        that too much, will be produced! Do we not maintain a high tariff, and
    keep at every port a horde of Custom-House officers, for fear the people
    of other
        countries will overwhelm us with their goods? Is not a large part of
    our machinery constantly idle? Are there not, even in what we call good times,
    an immense
        number of unemployed men who would gladly be at work producing wealth
    if they could only get the opportunity? Do we not, even now, hear from every
    side of
        embarrassment from the very excess of productive power and of combinations
        to reduction production? . . . This seeming glut of production, this
    seeming excess of productive powers, runs through all branches of industry
    and is evident
        all over the civilized world.&quot; [<a href="../HG/SP/SP08_That_We_All_Might_Be_Rich.htm">Social
        Problems, Chapter 8: That We All Might Be Rich</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet these words were penned in 1883, just fifty years ago, by George in his
  work called <a href="../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm">Social
  Problems</a>, every word of which applies to our present condition,
  only in a more intense degree. Nor did our people have to wait for the advent
  of technocrats to hear that the machine and the control of power make it possible
  to abolish poverty while actually improvements in the machinery of production
  and distribution are working in the opposite direction. Fifty years ago, George
  pointed out the same contrast. On the one hand, as he said: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Productive
        power in such a state of civilization as ours is sufficient did we give
    it play, to so enormously increase the production of wealth as to give abundance
        to all.&quot; [<a href="../HG/SP/SP08_That_We_All_Might_Be_Rich.htm">Social
        Problems, Chapter 8: That We All Might Be Rich</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, now, as when George wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The tendency
            of all the inventions and improvements so wonderfully augmenting
    productive power is to concentrate enormous wealth in the hands of a few,
    to make the
            condition of the many more hopeless . . . Without a single exception
    I can think of, the effect of all modern industrial improvements is to production
            upon a large scale, to the minute division of labor, to the giving
    of large
            capital an overpowering advantage . . . The tendency of the machine
    is in everything not merely to place it out of the power of the workman to
    become his own employer,
            but to reduce him to the position of a mere feeder or attendant;
    to dispense with judgment, skill and brains . . . He has no more control
    of the conditions
            that give him employment than has the passenger in the railway train
    over the motion of the train.&quot; [<a href="../HG/SP/SP04_Two_Opposing_Tendencies.htm">Social
    Problems, Chapter 4: Two Opposing Tendencies</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet machine and scientific technology contains
          in itself the possibility of the complete abolition of want and poverty.
  What is the trouble?</p>
<p>Go to the work of Henry George himself and learn how many
    of the troubles from which society still suffers, and suffers increasingly,
    are due to the
    fact that a few have monopolized the land, and that in consequence they have
    the power to dictate to others access to the land and to its products &#8212; which
    include waterpower, electricity, coal, iron and all minerals, as well as
  the foods that sustain life &#8212; and that they have the power to appropriate to
  their
    private use the values that the industry, the civilized order, the very benefactions,
    of others produce. This wrong is at the very basis of our present social
  and economic chaos, and until it is righted, all steps toward economic recovery
    may be temporarily helpful while in the long run useless.</p>
<p>I suppose my hearers have heard the following line of consolation put forth
  by professional optimists like Mr. Charles Schwab and his imitators. &quot;To
  be sure,&quot; they say, &quot;we have a bad depression, but we have had in
  our history at least nine such depressions before, and yet have come out of
  them all to enjoy even better times than went before.&quot; What a wonderful
  consolation, and what a wonderful system! We can get out of our present hole
  and climb up in order to fall into a tenth, and eleventh and twelfth hole,
  and so on, each deeper than the one before! Is it not about time that instead
  of patching up here and there we try to go to the roots of our troubles?</p>
<p>Consequently instead of attempting a technical explanation of the moral and
  economic philosophy of Henry George, I want to urge my hearers to acquaint
  themselves with his own works, to study them and then to organize to see that
  his principle is carried into effect. What are the most evident sore spots
  of the present? The answer is clear. Unemployment; extreme inequality in the
  distribution of the national income; enormous fixed charges in the way of interest
  on debts; a crazy, cumbrous, inequitable tax system that puts the burden on
  the consumer, and the ultimate producer, and lets off the parasites, exploiters
  and the privileged &#8212; who ought to be relieved entirely of their gorged excess
  &#8212; very lightly, and indeed in many cases, as in that of the tariff, pays them
  a premium for imposing a burden on honest industry and on the means of production;
  a vicious and incompetent banking system, with billions of money, the hope
  for the future of millions of hard-working peoples, still locked up, while
  the depositors lose their homes and walk the streets in vain; the greater part
  of our population, in the nation of the earth most favored by nature, still
  living either in slums or in homes without the improvements indispensable to
  a healthy and civilized life.</p>
<p>You cannot study Henry George without learning how intimately each of these
  wrongs and evils is bound up with our land system. One of our great national
  weaknesses is speculation. Everybody recognizes that fact in the stock market
  orgy of our late boom days. Only a few realize the extent to which speculation
  in land is the source of many troubles of the farmer, the part it has played
  in loading banks and insurance companies with frozen assets and compelling
  the closing of thousands of banks, nor how the high rents, the unpayable mortgages
  and the slums of the cities are connected with speculation in land values.
  All authorities on public works hold that the most fruitful field for them
  is slum clearance and better housing. Yet only a few seem to realize that with
  our present situation this improvement will put a bonus in the pockets of landlords,
  and the land speculator will be the one to profit financially &#8212; for
  after all, buildings are built on land.</p>
<p>So with taxation. There are all sorts of tinkering going on, but the tinkers
  and patchers shut their eyes to the fact that the socially produced annual
  value of land &#8212; not of improvements, but of ground-rent value &#8212; is about
  five billion dollars, and that its appropriation by those who create it, the
  community, would at once relieve the tax burden and ultimately would solve
  the tax problem. Of late the federal government has concerned itself with the
  problems of home ownership, but again by methods of tinkering that may easily
  in the long run do more harm than good. The community's acquisition of its
  own creation, ground-rent value, would both reduce the price of land and entirely
  eliminate taxes on improvement, thus making ownership easier. And how anyone
  expects to solve the unemployment question by putting the sanction of both
  legality and high pecuniary reward upon the ability of the few to keep the
  many from equal access to land and to the raw material, without which labor
  is impossible, I do not see &#8212; and no one else does. For the tinkerers
  assume that unemployment must continues, only with government assistance to
  those
  who are necessarily out of work. By all means let us help those that now need
  it, but for the future let us prevent the cause instead of merely mitigating
  the effects.</p>
<p>So, if there were time, one could go through every one of our problems and
  show its intimate connection with a just solution of the land problem.</p>
<p>I do not claim that George's remedy is a panacea that will cure by itself
  all our ailments. But I do claim that we cannot get rid of our basic troubles
  without it. I would make exactly the same concession and same claim that Henry
  George himself made: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;I do not say that in the recognition of the equal
        and unalienable right of each human being to the natural elements from
    which life must be supported and wants satisfied, lies the solution of all
    social
        problems. I fully recognize that even after we do this, much will remain
    to do. We might recognize the equal right to land, and yet tyranny and spoilation
        be continued.</p>
  <p>But whatever else we do, as along as we fail to recognize the equal right
      to the elements of nature, nothing will avail to remedy that unnatural
    inequality in the distribution of wealth which is fraught with so much evil
    and danger.
      Reform as we may, until we make this fundamental reform, our material progress
      can but tend to differentiate our people into the monstrously rich and
    frightfully poor. Whatever be the increase of wealth, the masses will still
    be ground toward
      the point of bare subsistence &#8212; we must still have our great criminal
    classes, our paupers and our tramps, men and women driven to degradation
    and desperation
      from inability to make an honest living.&quot; [<a href="../HG/SP/SP18_What_We_Must_Do.htm">Social
