<center><b>Land Rent in a Tax-free Society</b></center>
<p style="text-align: center;">Outline of remarks by Mason Gaffney, <br>
for use at Moscow Congress,
5/21/96&nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Rents are a taxable surplus. I
estimate that this
taxable surplus constitutes 35% or more of the national income in
most nations with market economies, and more in resource-rich
nations.</span>
<p> What is rent? Marx and market economists define it much the
same. Marx spells it out in <em>Das Kapital</em> (Vol. III, Part VI, Chap.
46-47). In simple feudal conditions, the whole of surplus value is
rent. Under capitalism, an industrial landowner gets a "surplus
profit" above the cost of capital; location exerts the "overwhelming
influence"; the landowner is "passive ... contributes nothing, risks
nothing, unlike the industrial capitalist."<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Rent for housing land is
"tribute for the permission of inhabiting the earth.</span>"&nbsp; "...
space is
required as an element of all production and all human activity." In
urban industry, to increase production "demands an extension of the
land area."</p>
<p> Marx continues, one can distinguish house value from land
value. House and land are often even "owned by different persons."
Growth of capital "necessarily raises rent" (while it lowers rates of
profit on capital). "Land, not the house, forms the actual object of
speculation in growing cities." Machinery and other capital wear out,
"but the soil, if properly treated, improves all the time." Marx
calls for a "Trinitarian Formula: Capital; Land; Labor."</p>
<p> In mining, rent comes from the low-cost mines, because they
sell their product at the same price as the high-cost mines. In all
fields, high product prices are "converted into rent and in this way
fall into the hands of the landlord," concludes Marx.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> 2. The value of rent is huge. Every
economy produces a
large excess over wages. To be sure, not all of it is surplus. Some
of it goes to replace capital that wears out each year. This is not
part of the net surplus, nor income to the capitalist; it is a return
of capital.</p>
<p> Second, some goes as a return to capital, over replacement.
This is pure income. Income to capital is not a taxable surplus, but
a functional incentive: it moves people to form and supply capital.
This entails securing new capital (by saving, and borrowing) and
conserving old capital (avoiding dissaving, and avoiding export of
capital).</p>
<p> Capital income serves another useful function: it steers
capital into the most productive uses. Steering capital to its best
uses has the same useful function as securing new capital, and
conserving old. Using capital effectively is as beneficial as
securing more capital, and ever so much cheaper. The Great Transition
in Russia now is learning to allow income on capital, to secure these
benefits. The trick is to do it without allowing more than is
needed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> The rest of
the excess over wages is captured in the rent of
land. It is a true taxable surplus. The amount is already huge, and
will become huger yet when existing taxes are abated.</p>
<p> The size of rent is not reported in capitalist nations,
except to trivialize it. Their national accountants, dominated by
landowners, neglect or conceal it artfully, to protect it from being
taxed. Local governments do, however, measure and tax property by
value. More than half the value of property is land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In Vancouver,
B.C., 73% of the value of all property assessed for taxation is land,
even though much land there is exempt from tax, and not assessed at
all. In California's major cities it would be just as high if only we
assessed land here as accurately as they do there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. Rent will become huger yet when
you abate taxes
presently levied on production and exchange, because these now
depress the rent of land. </span>That is, in a tax-free market
economy, the
benefit of abating present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The
taxable surplus simply shifts from one form to another.</p>
<p> This is more than a simple shift of a fixed amount. When you
substitute land revenues for existing taxes, the surplus actually
grows, as if by synergy. You gain more revenue base than you lose,
because existing taxes now suppress much latent production. Payroll
taxes directly drive workers from taxable jobs to untaxed gains from
crime. Abating those taxes will unleash suppressed economic giants,
along with all the new surplus values their latent production will
generate. "Monetarists" warn you that "there are no free lunches." In
fact, however, good policy creates lots of "free lunches." It makes
the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine the benefits,
alone, of turning people from destructive careers in crime to useful
jobs producing goods.</p>
<p> At the same time, the effect of socializing land revenues is
to stimulate better land use - the opposite of the effect of existing
taxes. Every landowner, to pay the required land charge, is pushed to
steer his land to the best use (just as paying interest steers
capital to its best use). Thus, the shift to rent-based revenues
doubly induces new production: it releases the brake of present
taxes, and replaces it with an added push to produce. This is
"supply-side economic policy" in the best and truest sense. It
generates yet more surplus. You may take all of rent to support
government functions, without damaging private market incentives, but
only sharpening them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> This policy lets us achieve and
reconcile two policies that
many now believe are incompatible, viz.: free markets, and common
rights in land. </span>It is a kind of miracle, yet simple to
understand and
implement. Monetarist advisers would bind you in a dilemma: they
claim you must choose between private markets and common rights. In
fact, you may have both at once. Public revenue is simply the kind of
socialization that occurs in a market economy. Socialize the rent of
land, and you socialize the net benefits of owning land, even while
privatizing the management of land, and gaining the benefits of using
free markets.</p>
<p> The combined effect of all this stimulus would be a burst of
growth such as few economies have ever shown, except in wartime. We
learned in the U.S.A. in World War II the astounding effects of
simply taking the brakes off production. U.S. GNP doubled, 1941-43;
all willing workers were fully employed. This same miracle can occur
in Russia, 1996-98. The natural resources and human talent are here:
you only need the right incentive structure to turn labor from
idleness and crime to producing goods and services.</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Some of the benefit of abating
existing taxes will
lodge in higher after-tax wage rates, rather than higher rents. </span>For
the present and near future, however, the supply of labor in Russia
is highly elastic because so many potential workers are now
unemployed, or underemployed, or occupied in crime. In this
condition, raising demand for labor will raise payrolls by raising
the number of good jobs, more than by raising wage rates. On balance,
therefore, this effect on jobs will create new rents, more than it
cuts into old ones. After Russia shall have achieved full employment,
wage rates may rise and cut into the surplus of land rents, but if
this should then create a new kind of problem (which I doubt), it is
more pleasant, and easier to solve, than those that afflict you
now.&nbsp;
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 5. Many varieties of natural
resources generate rents.
City land is the greatest single source.</span> For example, one city,
Vancouver, contains half the value of taxable property in B.C. - a
province of 934,000 sq. kilometers, or 70% larger than France.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> However, many other resources
yield rents. </span>Some of them are
also huge in value, even though some are inconspicuous. Here are a
few varieties of them: <br>
</p>

<p> Some of those varied resources are highly valued. For
example,</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">newly minted fishing permits
offshore of Washington State</span>
sell for $1 million each. Their owners retire and rent the permits to
working fishermen, creating an instant class structure where before
there was equal opportunity. Imagine the value of an exclusive right
to take Caspian sturgeon.  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio spectrum amassed by the
McCaw Company
recently passed to AT&amp;T for $13 billions</span>.  </li>
  <li>Dmitri Lvov estimates
that your oil and gas revenues alone could support the entire
national government (Practicable Course of Economic Reforms in
Russia. Moscow: Russian Academy of Sciences, Central Economics and
Mathematics Institute, 1994). <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">They might even
surpass urban rents in
value, if they were valued at world market prices. 
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">In
arid lands,
access to water is life itself.</span></li>
</ul>
<p> You may measure rents that these different varieties of
resources generate, once their products sell in markets that tell you
their true value. As mentioned, when we restricted fishing rights to
those with licenses, licensees immediately began renting them out,
creating a market price. If there is a market for logs, you may
estimate the value of forests from which they come, using the
"netback" technique. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is already
an active world market for
radio spectrum - and the price is very high, so do not neglect it.
There is a world market for mineral leases to produce oil and gas.</span>
It
is shark-infested, so enter it carefully, but there are hundreds of
experts to advise you how to get your fair share from the minerals
you own, and prosper like the Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf or, better,
like the ordinary people of Alaska, Alberta, The Netherlands, or
Norway.</p>
A challenge for Russian science and statecraft is how best
to tap for public use or equal distribution all these varied
rent-sources. Each poses its own technical problems. Once you commit to
pricing resources in free and world markets, however, markets
generate the price data needed to measure taxable surpluses that each
kind of resource generates. The Russian people, who spawned so many
world-class composers, writers, and scientists, who turned back
Hitler, and launched the first Sputnik, obviously have talent,
industry, courage, and ability to organize and govern. It is a matter
of bringing these virtues to bear on the question at hand.<br>
