<a href="#Conclusion">Conclusion</a><br>
<p>The proposition that the rental value of land should be collected
by governments and used for public purposes has a powerful moral
rationale: Since no one made the land, no one can properly claim to
own it. There is a simple efficiency rationale as well: Social
collection of the rental value of land does not interfere with
incentives to be productive. If governments do not collect the rental
value of land, then they will levy taxes that discourage productive
activity.</p>
<p>When "government" is not a monolith but a collection of entities
with responsibilities in different geographic and functional areas,
these rationales for land value taxation leave unanswered <b>the
question of how the rental value of land should be allocated among
governments.</b> That question is addressed in this paper.</p>
<p>To simplify the analysis, it will be assumed that there are at
most two levels of government, local and state. It will also be
assumed that each governmental entity promotes the welfare of its
citizens. The question of whether the rental value of land can
provide sufficient revenue will not be addressed.</p>
<p><b><a name="Inefficiencies_and_Inequities_of_Some"></a>Inefficiencies
and Inequities of Some Systems</b></p>
<p>Before introducing a system that promotes efficiency and equity,
it is interesting to explore the limitations of some other systems.
These systems illustrate a variety of potential inefficiencies and
inequities, some of which are obvious and others subtle.</p>
<p>Consider first a world with only local governments, each of which
levies a tax on the rental value or the sale value of the land in its
jurisdiction. Such a system encounters difficulties with justice or
efficiency or both, if the per capita values of rent minus public
expenditure are unequal among localities when labor is allocated
efficiently among localities.</p>
<p>Suppose for example that one locality is rich in natural
resources, and that the local government collects revenue from those
who extract those resources, without corresponding expenditures.
Whether the revenue is used to lower taxes, increase public services
or provide citizens with a dividend, the existence of those extra
revenues will make the locality more attractive to potential
immigrants. People will move until the level of well-being that they
can achieve in each locality is the same as in any other locality.
But if some of the benefit of living in one place comes from sharing
in the bounty of natural resources, then the population of that area
will be greater than the population that would maximize total output.
The opportunity to share in the benefits of natural resources by
moving to a different locality is a private benefit but not a social
benefit. This discrepancy between private and social benefit induces
an inefficient allocation of people among places.</p>
<p>This inefficiency could be avoided by a rule that the benefits
would be divided among those who resided in the locality when the
resources were discovered, but then there would be a problem of
inequity. It would not be possible to justify the fact that some
persons received these benefits while other did not.</p>
<p>If the problem were confined to natural resources, it could be
resolved by a rule that natural resources would be managed by a level
of government corresponding to the territory over which people were
free to migrate. However, the same problem of inefficient migration
occurs whenever differences in natural endowment, such as ports or
particularly fertile land, make it efficient to have a distribution
of population in which the difference between per capita rent and per
capita government expenditure varies among localities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The same problem of inefficient
migration occurs whenever there
are services, such as education or welfare, that are provided to
citizens without payment or with payments that are less than the
marginal cost of providing the service. </span>Starting from a
situation in
which people are allocated among localities in such a way as to
maximize total output, people will have an inefficient incentive to
move to places that offer more services for which they are not
required to pay.</p>
<p>A second simple system that might be considered would be one in
which all localities levy taxes on the same base, namely land in all
localities. This would remove the incentive for people to crowd
inefficiently into localities with excellent natural opportunities.
However, such a system would have a serious difficulty of its own.
Local governments could be expected to spend money without regard to
whether the benefits were as great as the costs, since their own
citizens would pay only a small fraction of the cost of whatever they
decided to do.</p>
<p>The inefficiencies and/or inequities induced by local variations
in natural endowment when local governments operate independently
suggest that some form of federalism is needed. However, federal
systems can have inefficiencies of other sorts.</p>
<p>Consider a system of states and localities in which both state and
local governments finance their activities by taxing every parcel of
land in their jurisdictions, according to the rental value that the
parcel would have if it were unimproved. Suppose that a state
government placed a tax of 10% on the value that land would have if
it were unimproved, and suppose that there was a local project that
would cost $95,000 per year and raise the rental value of local land
by $100,000 per year. The project would be socially beneficial, and
if there were no national tax on the rental value of land, the local
government would find that undertaking the project would improve the
welfare of its citizens. However, one effect of the project would be
to increase by $10,000 (10% of $100,000) the amount of money that the
citizens of the locality were required to pay to the state
government. Therefore it would not be in their interest to undertake
the project. Thus taxation of the rental value of land by both states
and localities does not promote efficiency in a federal system. </p>
<p>Now consider the possibility of having both levels of government
levy a tax on the sale value of all land in their jurisdictions. This
system would motivate efficient local decisions if every factor other
than land were perfectly mobile, and if there were no possibility of
inefficient management of projects.</p>
<p>With resources other than land perfectly mobile, the impact of
local decisions on the welfare of a locality's residents can be
measured by the value of the land in the locality, since returns to
labor and capital are determined by conditions over which the local
government has no control. To promote the interests of its citizens,
a local government would maximize the sale value of the land in its
jurisdictions. If a state government placed a tax on the value of
land, the welfare of the local citizens would still be maximized by
undertaking every activity that raised local land rent by as much as
the activity cost.</p>
<p>Suppose for example that a state government levied a tax of 20%
per year on the sale value of land, while a local government levied a
tax at a rate of 50% per year, and the market interest rate was 10%
per year. Suppose that the rental value of all land in the locality
was $1,000,000 per year. The sale value of the land (assuming that no
changes in rent, taxes or interest rates are anticipated) would be
$1,000,000/(.2 + .5 + .1) = $1,250,000. Local government revenue
would be $625,000, state government revenue from the locality would
be $250,000, and private appropriation of rent would be $125,000.</p>
<p>Now suppose that a project that cost $95,000 per year and raised
land rent by $100,000 per year were undertaken. The local tax rate
would have to rise, since the existing local tax rate would produce
only $50,000 per year in additional revenue. To find the new tax
rate, one solves the simultaneous equations</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Vx = $720,000, (2)</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>where V is the sale value of all land in the city and x is the
local tax rate. The first equation says that the value of all land
must be rent (1,000,000 originally plus 100,000 from the new project)
divided by the sum of tax rates and the interest rate. The second
equation says that local revenues, the product of the value of land
and the local tax rate, must equal the original spending of $625,000
plus the new spending of $95,000.</p>
<p>The solution to the pair of equations is</p>
<p>V = $1,266,667 (3)</p>
<p>x = .56842. (4)</p>
<p>State revenues rise by $3,333, and private appropriation of rent
rises by $1,667. The general rule that is exemplified here is that
the ratio of the benefit to the state to the local benefit is equal
to the ratio of the state tax rate to the interest rate. There is a
local benefit for any combination of state tax rate and interest
rate, as long as the project has positive net benefits. Thus the
combination of local taxation and state taxation of the sale value of
land, unlike the combination of local taxation and state taxation of
the rental value of land, does not discourage localities from
undertaking efficient projects.</p>
<p>One of the assumptions of the above analysis was that factors
other than land were perfectly mobile. But this is not the case.
Suppose that the project reduces the value of buildings by $2,500,
because they are no longer so well suited for their locations. This
effect makes the project no longer locally worthwhile. One remedy for
this impact is to include in the project payments to the owners of
buildings to compensate them for the reductions in the value of
buildings.</p>
<p>Another (implicit) assumption of the above analysis is that
identifying worthwhile projects is a costless activity. If there is a
cost to the city of determining that a project is worthwhile, then
the fact that some of the benefit of the project will go to the state
as a whole will eliminate the incentive to discover some worthwhile
projects. In principle, this difficulty could be overcome by
including the expected cost of discovery as a project cost that must
be paid.</p>
<p>This suggests another source of inefficiency. If a project could
be undertaken either in a more efficient or a less efficient way, and
if local citizens will receive extra income from the less efficient
choice and pay only a third of the extra cost of that choice, then
some bias toward the less efficient choice can be expected. There
seems to be no way around this source of inefficiency within a system
in which both state and localities levy taxes on the sale value of
land.</p>
<p><b><a name="An_Efficient_and_Equitable_System_of"></a>An Efficient
and Equitable System of Land Taxation by Multiple
Jurisdictions </b></p>
<p>Efficiency and equity can both be achieved in a system of taxation
of land by multiple jurisdictions, if the following features are
incorporated in the system:</p>
<blockquote><b>1. A distinction should be made between sources of the
rental value of land. </b>There is, on the one hand, the value that
land would have in the absence of local development -- the value that
it would have for agriculture, for the extraction of natural resources,
or as the site of a new town if there were no town there. This
component of the rental value of land should be regarded as the common
heritage of the largest possible collectivity. There should be some
system of compensatory payments among local governments to equate per
capita receipts of this component of value. On the other hand, there is
the addition to rental value that comes from the growth of communities
and the provision of public services. This component of value should be
regarded as the income of the locality, which the locality may collect
and spend as it sees fit.
  <p><b>2. If there are two levels of government, the higher level
should collect only two kinds of taxes:</b> </p>
  <blockquote>(1) levies on land for the addition to the rental value
of land that is produced by the services that are provided by the
higher level of government and
    <p>(2) appropriation of a portion of the pre-development value of
land that would otherwise be allocated among localities in proportion
to their populations. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This insures that a locality cannot reduce its obligation to the
higher level of government by acting inefficiently.</p>
  <p><b>3. Citizens should not be able to oblige localities to spend
money on them by moving from one place to another.</b> Any citizen
entitlements should be independent of migrational decisions. If the
citizens of some locality wish to support their own citizens, or if
they wish to support anyone who chooses to move to their community,
this does not entail an inefficiency. The inefficiency arises only if
localities are legally obliged to support migrants whether they wish to
do so or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The ideas in this paper can be regarded as a variation on the
Pigouvian idea of equating marginal private cost and marginal social
cost. Independent localities with free migration are inefficient
because of the resulting discrepancy between the marginal private
cost and the marginal social cost of migration. Taxation of a common
base is inefficient because of the discrepancy between the social
cost of local government spending and the cost of such spending to
localities that make spending decisions. Taxation of the rental value
of land by both localities and states is inefficient because it
causes the local cost of a project to exceed its marginal social
cost. Taxation of the sale value of land by both localities and
states is inefficient because it causes the cost to the locality of
being inefficient to be less than its social cost. The system that
does not have inefficiencies is one that avoids externalities in
migration decisions and makes the local contribution to state coffers
independent of actions that localities take.</p>
