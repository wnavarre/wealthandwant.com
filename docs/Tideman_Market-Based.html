<b><a name="I._Introduction"></a>I. Introduction</b>
<p>This paper describes systems for assigning rental value to land
through markets for the use of land that are created and managed by
government officials. The central idea of the paper is that the full
rent of land can be collected while achieving an efficient allocation
of land if the rent for improved sites is revised annually, based on
offers for the use of similar unimproved sites for the current year.
The efficient allocation of land requires neither the sale of land
nor leases of long duration at fixed rents.</p>
<p>Two systems for assigning rental value to land are presented. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One
system employs a market in which land is actually turned over to
bidders for their use, while the other employs a market in options to
use land. </span>While these systems are applicable in many settings,
they
are particularly applicable to current conditions in the Soviet
Union, where land is being transferred from public to private
management. The new manager of each site will receive the profit or
bear the loss from production on that site. The main question under
consideration concerns the process to be used to determine how much
must be paid for the use of each site.</p>
<p>A standard response of economists to such questions is, "Sell
everything to the highest bidder." In the context of land in the
Soviet Union, this would mean selling, for a lump-sum amount, the
right to use each site into the indefinite future. However, for a
number of reasons, such an approach is less attractive than selling
the right to use sites for rent to be paid annually. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, the person who can make best use of the site may be unable
to match a purchase bid from someone else, because of unequal access to
lending markets (due to inequalities in wealth, for example). Selling
land-use rights for annual rent makes sites more available to users
with relatively little in assets. </li>
  <li>Second, uncertainty about future political conditions would tend
to depress purchase offers. Selling land-use rights for annual rent
requires the state to accept the risk of future unfavorable public
policies, and thereby tends to promote favorable future conditions. </li>
  <li>Third, the high degree of general uncertainty about future
economic conditions can lead to offers of less than the expected value
of opportunities, simply because people have no idea how to guess what
the opportunities are worth. Selling land-use rights on an annual basis
permits many of the future uncertainties to be resolved before bids
must be made. </li>
  <li>Finally, the returns from future use of a site can more justly be
claimed by future generations than by the present generation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Selling land-use rights for annual rent allows each year's
population to claim that year's rent. While the proceeds of sales can
be invested for the benefit of future generations, not collecting the
money in advance helps preserve the heritage of the future against
political predations. For all of these reasons, I assume that what is
desired is not a purchase price but a rental price to be assigned to
each site for each year.</p>
<p><a name="II. Renting Land One Year at a"></a><b>II. Renting Land
One Year at a Time</b></p>
<p>The idea of renting a site to the highest bidder is conceptually
more complex than selling it to the highest bidder, because different
users can be expected to desire to use a site for different spans of
time. Suppose that one person bids 1,000 rubles per year for 20 years
and another bids 1,100 rubles per year for 30 years. Which bid is
higher? To compare these bids, one must know what someone else would
pay for the use of the site twenty years hence, and one must also
know the appropriate discount rate for the next thirty years. These
difficulties of comparing bids for different terms can be avoided by
renting sites just one year at a time. This annual rent-setting
procedure also guarantees future generations that they will not be
disadvantaged by being bound by the terms of agreements in which they
did not participate, and which disposed of their heritage for a small
fraction of its value.</p>
<p>The idea of renting sites one year at a time may sound unpromising
at first. The efficient use of land generally requires improvements
that last for many years. How can entrepreneurs be expected to
improve land if they are only permitted to rent it for one year at a
time? The answer is that entrepreneurs can be expected to make
durable improvements to land even under these circumstances, provided
that they have the opportunity to continue to use the land they have
improved, for a price that is determined in a fair and impartial
manner.</p>
<p>The risks associated with uncertainties are customarily borne, for
a price, by entrepreneurs. Uncertainty in the future price of using
land, like uncertainty in the future price of any other input or
product, can be accommodated by entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The kind of uncertainty that will significantly deter potential
investors is uncertainty associated with a climate that invites tax
increases or other rule changes that extract additional money from
investors, taking advantage of the fact that investment in durable
improvements has occurred. To attract investment, governments must do
what they can to commit themselves not to take confiscatory action
once investment has occurred. This commitment is accomplished by
settled rules, by public respect for property in a democratic system,
and by a system of public finance that provides adequate revenue for
necessary expenditures and curbs the tendency of politicians to spend
excessively. The future rent of land can accordingly be uncertain
without discouraging investment, provided that the process used to
determine rent is settled and does not confiscate capital.</p>
<p>The question at issue can thus be restated as, "What process can
be used to determine the rental value of land, one year at a time, in
such a way that the full rent of land is collected, while at the same
time insuring that entrepreneurs are not required to pay extra
amounts by virtue of having made durable improvements to land?"</p>
<p><a name="III. Defining &quot;The Rent of Land"></a><b>III. Defining
"The Rent of Land"</b></p>
<p>To proceed, there must be agreement upon a definition of "the rent
of land." From a conceptual or theoretical perspective, the rent of
land is a residual. It is the difference between total revenue and
costs other than land, when land is managed in such a way as to yield
the greatest present value of net returns.</p>
<p>There are two practical difficulties with this definition. It
yields an answer in terms of the present value of rent rather than an
annual amount, and it does not provide an algorithm for public
officials to follow. The two difficulties can both be overcome by
using an operational concept of rent, defined in terms of what people
are willing to pay. But before proceeding, it is useful to define
some symbols.</p>
<p>Define V(0) as the present discounted value of the net returns
from the use of a site from the present time onward, assuming that
the site is now unimproved. Define V(1) as the present value,
discounted to today, of the net returns from the use of the site from
one year from now onward, assuming that the site will be unimproved
one year from now. The rental value of the site for the year
beginning today, R(0), may then be defined as V(0) - V(1). The logic
of this definition is that the rent for a site for the current year
is the most that anyone is willing to pay for use of the site for the
current year, if use of the site after the current year is contingent
upon payment of amounts that have a present value of V(1).
Alternatively stated, rent for this year is what must be added to the
value, as of today, of using a site from one year hence into the
indefinite future, to produce a total equal to the value of using the
site from today into the indefinite future.</p>
<p>This definition corresponds to the following operational
conditions. Suppose that there are a number of identical sites, and
suppose that people have the opportunity to bid for the use of one of
these sites, under a rule that the use of the site will go to the
highest bidder, who will be obliged to make an immediate payment
equal to the amount offered by the second highest
bidder.<font size="-1"><b><i>1</i></b></font> This payment will
entitle the highest bidder to use the site for one year. The highest
bidder will also have the option of using the site into the
indefinite future, upon payments of annual amounts R(1) for use in
the year beginning at time 1, R(2) for use in the year beginning at
time 2, and so on, where the amounts R(1), R(2), ... will be
determined by bids, under corresponding conditions, for identical
sites in future years.</p>
<p>A bidder will reasonably expect that the sum of present values of
the amounts R(1), R(2), ... will be V(1). If it is any less, an
opportunity for profit has been left unexploited. And if it is any
more, at least one bidder is heading for a loss. In these
circumstances, a rational bidder who is able to put the land to its
best use will offer V(0) - V(1) for use of the site for the year
beginning at time 0. And this is the definition of the rent for the
site for the year beginning at time 0.</p>
<p>The identification of one year as the period for which the rent
applies in this analysis is arbitrary. A similar analysis can be
undertaken using a month or a decade as the time period for the first
rental payment. In practice, the appropriate period is chosen by
balancing the higher administrative costs of frequent rent changes
against the costs of inaccuracies in rent from less frequent rent
changes.</p>
<p><a name="IV. Consequences of Foreseeable"></a><b>IV. Consequences
of Foreseeable Increases in Rental Value</b></p>
<p>If the value of a site is expected to rise in the future, bidders
for the current use of the site will take that into account in their
current offers. A potential user who wishes to make long-lasting
improvements to the site, of a sort that cannot take full advantage
of the future higher value of the site, will offer less for the site
this year than if the site did not have future prospects that will
raise future offers from competing uses. On the other hand, a
potential user who wishes to use a site as something like a parking
lot, requiring very little in durable improvements, will be virtually
unconcerned with the prospect of higher future rents. Thus, to the
extent that bidders can foresee future bids, sites where optimal use
requires a change in use in the near future to achieve greatest
efficiency will tend to be acquired by users who can relinquish use
without suffering loss.</p>
<p>Of course, the future cannot be seen perfectly. People will
sometimes experience losses as a result of unanticipated rises in the
rent of the land under their durable improvements. To compensate for
this risk, people who wish to use land for durable improvements will
reduce, to some extent, their bids for land. They may also seek to
purchase insurance against rent increases, just as they now purchase
fire insurance.<font size="-1"><b><i>2</i></b></font> The practice of
setting each year's rent at the amount that someone is willing to pay
in that year for the use of a similar site ensures that some
profit-oriented person (either the investor or the seller of
insurance) has an incentive to estimate carefully the opportunity
cost of a site in future years before the site is committed for a
long span of time to a particular durable improvement.</p>
<p><a name="V. Relaxing the Assumption of I"></a><b>V. Relaxing the
Assumption of Identical Sites</b></p>
<p>The system described so far presumes that there are many identical
sites, so that the rents offered for ones that are relinquished can
reveal the value of the ones in continued use. In fact, every site
has unique characteristics, especially in terms of the distances from
other locations that are economically relevant, and often in other
ways as well. Fortunately, the initial assumption of identical sites,
which was made to explore the system, is not necessary. It is
possible to make good estimates of the rental value of all land from
information about the rental value of a small percentage of sites,
because the rental value of land tends to be a smooth function of
location. Rents are highest in the centers of cities, diminishing
gradually with distance from the center. Rents are also higher in
places with characteristics such as proximity to transit facilities
or especially good views, and tend to be lower in places that are
close to the source of a noxious smell or noise.</p>
<p>To take account of the differences among sites, the officials in
charge of renting land can annually examine the results of recent
auctions and construct a revised map of land rents. In constructing
this map, the rent assigned to each site that is auctioned should be
not the highest bid, but rather the second-highest bid, which
represents the actual opportunity cost of a site, what it would be
worth to have one more vacant site.</p>
<p>Consider an example to highlight this point. Suppose that the
highest bid for a site is 1,000 rubles per year, the second-highest
bid is 800 rubles per year, and an adjacent site, with virtually
identical characteristics, is occupied by someone for whom continued
use is worth 900 rubles per year. If charged 1,000 rubles, this
person will relinquish the site, and the rent that can then be
obtained for it will presumably be the 800 rubles offered for the
adjacent site. Thus it is counterproductive to assign rent that is
greater than the highest offer that is refused.</p>
<p><a name="VI. Summary of the System Invol"></a><b>VI. Summary of
the System Involving Actual Delivery of Land</b></p>
<p>To operate the system for determining annual rents from bids for
sites that are actually delivered for use, the officials in charge of
renting land simply auction every site that is relinquished by its
previous user. According to the terms of the auction, the bid
represents an offer of rent for the first year's use, with use of the
site going to the highest bidder at a price of the second highest
bid. The highest bidder also receives an option to continue to use
the site into the indefinite future, upon payment of rent that will
be determined, year by year, by rent maps constructed from bids in
auctions that will be conducted in the same way.</p>
<p>The user of any site is permitted to terminate use at any time,
provided that the site is restored to a condition of bare land. To
protect against the abandonment of sites in a condition in which it
is expensive to restore them to an unimproved state, anyone who
wishes to build can be required to post a bond against the cost of
demolition.</p>
<p>Any user of land is permitted to sell both the improvements on a
site and the right to continue renting the site to anyone else, for
any price on which they mutually agree. However, it can be expected
that the prices that will secure agreement will reflect little if
anything more than the value of the improvements, because the right
to use sites can be obtained at auction just by offering a small
amount more than what others are offering for the first year's
rent.</p>
<p>Each year the land-managing bureaucracy will construct a new map
of land value, based on the second-highest bids for sites that have
been auctioned recently. Rent bills for all land will then be sent
out, based on this map.</p>
<p><a name="VII. A System Based on Options"></a><b>VII. A System
Based on Options to Use
Land</b><font size="-2"><b><i>3</i></b></font></p>
<p>The system described previously presumes that each year enough
sites are relinquished to the state for re-leasing to produce a
current land value map with adequate accuracy. If such is not the
case, it is possible, at the cost of somewhat higher administrative
expenses, to employ a system in which a specific market rent is
assigned to each site each year. This system involves creating an
options market, where the officials in charge of renting land solicit
offers that bind potential users to rent specified sites at specified
rents, if any of the designated sites become available.</p>
<p>A potential problem with setting rents through options is that
entrepreneurs who make durable improvements seem exposed to
expropriation by such a practice. A bidder for an option on an
improved site can make an artificially high offer, taking advantage
of the fact that the person who made the improvements will not want
to relinquish the site on which they were made. The way to avoid this
problem is to require bidders to bid for many similar sites,
including some that have a significant probability of being
relinquished.</p>
<p>Consider first how this works if there are a large number of sites
that are identical, except for the improvements on them. To motivate
bidders to bid as much as the full rent of land, a fee (perhaps 1 per
cent of the rent collected) is paid to the highest bidder. But if any
site is relinquished, the highest bidder is required either to take
over the site and pay the specified annual rent for at least a year,
or find someone else to take it over, compensating that person as
necessary. As long as there are some sites with a significant
probability of being relinquished, a bidder will find it unwise to
bid more than the true rent for these sites. And bidding less than
the true rent means leaving an opportunity for profit unexploited.
</p>
<p><a name="VIII. Mathematical Analysis of"></a><b>VIII. Mathematical
Analysis of a Bidder's Calculations</b></p>
<p>The calculations of a bidder can be made more formal, in the
following way. First, define some terms:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Z = The bidder's expected profit per site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">p = the bidder's subjective probability
of being the one who names
the highest rent.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">A = The rent that the bidder names.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">f = The fraction of rent that the highest
bidder receives.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">g = The bidder's subjective estimate of
the average probability
that a site will be relinquished by its current users.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">R = the bidder's estimate of the true
rental value of the
site--the rent that the site would yield if its use were offered at
auction.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">C = the cost to the bidder of developing
rent estimates.</p>
<p>Putting all of the above terms together, the bidder's expected
profit is </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Z = p[Af - g(A - R)] - C. (1)</p>
<p>Both bids that are very high and bids that are very low lead to
negative profits. If a bid is very high, then p is nearly 1 and g is
large relative to f, so that the - g(A - R) term dominates the
expression and is negative, leading to negative profits. On the other
hand, if a bid is very low, p is virtually zero and the C term
dominates the expression, leading again to negative profits. For
intermediate bids, however, positive profits are possible. If A
equals R and the bidder is confident of being the only bidder, then
the expression for Z reduces to Af - C, which is positive if f is
generous enough to cover the cost of submitting a bid.</p>
<p>It can confidently be expected that at least one person will find
it profitable to submit a bid, because if there is only one bidder,
that person can profit from the cursory effort involved in submitting
a bid that is sure to be lower than the actual rent. The number of
bidders is in equilibrium if every existing bidder has positive
expected profits, but any potential new entrant finds the cost of
developing bids not worth the expected return. </p>
<p>When a bidder's expected profit is maximized, the derivative of
(1) with respect to A, the variable that the bidder controls, is
zero. Thus,</p>
<p>dZ dg dp</p>
<p>-- = p[f - g - --(A - R)] + --[Af - g(A - R)] = 0.
(2)</p>
<p>dA dA dA</p>
<p>One use that can be made of this expression is to determine the
conditions that lead profit-maximizing bidders to submit bids exactly
equal to their estimates of the rent of sites. The excess in a bid is
A - R. Solving (2) for A - R yields</p>
<p>dp</p>
<p>p(f - g) + --f</p>
<p>dA</p>
<p>A - R = ------------------. (3)</p>
<p>dg dp</p>
<p>p&Auml;&Auml; + g&Auml;&Auml;</p>
<p>dA dA</p>
<p>A bidder will be motivated to report accurate estimates of rent if
the numerator of the right-hand side of (3) is zero. Denote the
elasticity of p with respect to A by</p>
<p>A dp</p>
<p>s = - --. (4)</p>
<p>p dA</p>
<p>Since dp/dA is non-negative, s is non-negative. The condition for
motivating accurate rental estimates (the condition that the
numerator of the right side of (3) be zero) can be expressed as</p>
<p>p(f - g + sf) = 0, (5)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>f = g/(1 + s). (6)</p>
<p>Equation 6 expresses the "commission rate" that must be awarded to
the highest bidder to motivate accurate bids. The parameter g can be
estimated by the frequency with which sites are redeveloped. The
parameter s might possibly be estimated from patterns of bids and
assumptions about expectations. If there is only one bidder, because
everyone recognizes that person's skill and reliability and thinks it
not worthwhile to compete, then s is 0. Since s is non-negative,
equation (6) implies that the commission rate that must be paid to
motivate accurate assessments is less than or equal to the
probability that a site will be relinquished.</p>
<p><a name="IX. Relaxing the Assumption of"></a><b>IX. Relaxing the
Assumption of Uniform Rent in the Options System</b></p>
<p>The above analysis employs an assumption that there are many
identical sites. When this assumption is relaxed, bidders must be
permitted to submit different bids for different sites, and the
problem of avoiding excessive bids for sites with durable
improvements re-emerges. If bids were completely unconstrained,
bidders would bid extra amounts for sites with durable improvements,
reflecting the low probability that these sites would be
relinquished.</p>
<p>The way to avoid this problem is, once again, to take advantage of
the fact that land rent varies smoothly over locations. Each bidder
can be required to offer bids on enough contiguous sites to ensure
that there is more than a minuscule probability of relinquishment for
a reasonable number of the sites. The requirement can be stated in a
form such as, "A bidder must bid on all sites within a convex polygon
of the bidder's choosing, containing at least 200 sites. Each bid
takes the form of a land rent function that applies to the whole
domain on which the bidder is bidding. And the land rent function is
constrained to be a uniform amount per square meter, with additive or
multiplicative adjustments for identified factors such as distance
from the center of the city, distance from transit stops, and
elevation.</p>
<p><a name="X. Operating the System Involvi"></a><b>X. Operating the
System Involving Options to Use Land</b></p>
<p>To operate the system involving options to use land, the officials
in charge of renting the land solicit options from anyone who is
interested in bidding. A bidder is required to post a bond amounting
to something on the order of 0.25 per cent of the rental value being
bid upon. The bidder determines the area on which to offer options,
and then provides a bid per square meter as a function of
characteristics of the site.</p>
<p>For each site, officials compute the rent implied by each bid that
includes the site. The highest such bid is the rent assigned to the
site, and a corresponding bill is sent to the user.</p>
<p>One might think that to be consistent with the earlier system, the
second-highest rather than the highest bid should be used to
determine the rent of the site. However, as long as the site is not
relinquished, it can be presumed to be worth more to the existing
user than to any other. Thus the highest option bid is in fact the
second-highest bid overall, so that using the highest option bid is
consistent with the earlier practice. The person to whom the land is
worth the most (the existing user) pays what is offered by the person
to whom it is worth second-most (the highest option bidder).</p>
<p>As with the previous system, the user of a site is permitted to
sell both the improvements and the right to continue renting the
site, to any one at any price upon which they mutually agree. The
user is also permitted to relinquish the site at any time, upon
restoring it to the condition of bare land. And again, anyone who
wishes to build on a site can be required to post a bond against the
cost of clearing improvements.</p>
<p><a name="XI. Using Land Rent Information"></a><b>XI. Using Land
Rent Information to Manage Externalities</b></p>
<p>Once a detailed land rent map has been created, one of the uses to
which it can be put is to determine appropriate prices for activities
that affect the rental value of surrounding land. For example, if the
bidders for land include a negative adjustment for proximity to a
factory that pollutes the air, then it is possible to determine, from
the bids, how much greater land rents would be if the pollution were
terminated. This amount can rightly be charged to the factory.
Similarly, if the bidders include a positive adjustment for proximity
to a private parking garage in a commercial district, it is possible
to compute the amount that the presence of the parking garage adds to
total rents. To motivate people to undertake an efficient amount of
the activities with such positive effects, they should receive the
addition to rent thus generated. Option bids result in detailed maps
of land rent that reveal both the locations of activities with
positive and negative effects on land rent and the magnitudes of
these effects.</p>
<p><a name="XII. Extensions to Other State-"></a><b>XII. Extensions
to Other State-Allocated Privileges</b></p>
<p>The central idea of the systems developed here is that the price
to be charged to someone who makes continuing use of a state-supplied
privilege can be determined by annual offers for corresponding
privileges. The idea can be applied not only to land but to other
domains as well. One domain that comes readily to mind is use of the
frequency spectrum. As with land, effective use of the frequency
spectrum (by radio stations, television stations, cellular telephone
networks and so on) requires a social understanding that a particular
individual or organization is permitted to have exclusive use of
particular parts of what is available. (In the case of the frequency
spectrum, this means the exclusive right to broadcast in a given
frequency band in a given geographical area.)</p>
<p>People who wish to use frequency allocations generally need to be
assured that they will have continuing use of the portions of the
frequency spectrum that are assigned to them, so that they will not
be left with useless broadcasting and receiving equipment. If so few
people ever want to use the frequency spectrum that there is never a
shortage of band widths to be allocated, then it is perfectly just
and efficient simply to permit anyone who wishes to use the frequency
spectrum to state the band width he or she wishes to use and then to
require others not to interfere. However, if band-width allocations
are scarce, then justice requires that those who receive allocations
compensate the rest of society for their privileged status. But how
much should they pay?</p>
<p>The systems described in this paper can be applied to determine
appropriate payments. If one wishes to use a system involving actual
transfer of broadcasting rights, then payments can be determined by
occasional (secondprice) auctions of the right to use a given band
width for a single year. If one wishes to have the greater
information that is available with bids for options, then one asks
potential users of the frequency spectrum to make binding offers
annually on a large number of contiguous band-widths, rewards the
highest bidders and uses the highest bids to determine the payments
required of continuing users of the frequency spectrum.</p>
<p>The general characteristics of the domains to which these bidding
systems can usefully be applied are the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">1. The domain contains many similar
bundles of rights.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">2. A bundle of rights in the domain must
be held for a
considerable span of time to be used efficiently.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">3. The future value of the rights is more
uncertain than the
current value of the rights.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">4. In the cycle of use of the rights in
conjunction with other
inputs, there are times when use can be terminated efficiently (as
when land is cleared for rebuilding).</p>
<p>While land and the frequency spectrum have these characteristics,
the first characteristic is generally present neither for mineral
deposits nor for enterprises. Thus other systems are be needed for
the privatization of these domains.</p>
<p><a name="XIII. Precedents in Existing In"></a><b>XIII. Precedents
in Existing Institutions</b></p>
<p>The idea of offering land for rent under terms in which future
rent depends on future market conditions and creating a market in
options to use land may seem unprecedented. In fact, there are
precedents. Many commercial leases contain escalator clauses, which
specify that future rent will be determined by the level of an
index.<strong><em><font size="-1">4</font></em></strong> Indices of construction cost are often used for this purpose.
This practice is parallel to the idea of setting future rent
according to future bids for the use of land. Options markets have
long existed for shares in companies and for commodities. The firm of
London Fox recently proposed to set up futures markets based on the
sale value of commercial and residential property and on commercial
rents (Frampton, 1990). Thus the idea of options in land also has a
precedent.</p>
<p>What is new is the suggestion regarding how a society can receive,
in all future years, the full rental value of land that it turns over
to private management: Just charge for each site, in each year, the
amount people offer for the use of similar land for that year when
they know that future rents will be determined in the same way. By
collecting all rent without burdening those who improve land, this
simple rule maintains land as the heritage of all generations.</p>

each bidder to bid the full value of use to him or her. See Vickrey
(1961).</p>
