He sells things that people need, <br>
Yet I respect him!<br>
<br>
He doesn't paint pictures <br>
Or write poems<br>
Or deal in "culture"<br>
While children starve<br>
And girls go to the streets.<br>
<br>
He only sells goods <br>
That people need<br>
And sells 'em honestly <br>
And has never yet <br>
Sold himself.<br>
<br>
What artist, lawyer <br>
Poet, writer<br>
Can say as much for himself <br>
Truthfully&#8212;that he has<br>
Never sold himself for Gain?<br>

That he has never <br>

<br>
As bad as any of us <br>
And as good&#8212;<br>
But looking,<br>
Staid, dignified, prominent!<br>

No one could be <br>
So eminently<br>
Distinguished and correct <br>
As he &#8212; looks&#8212;<br>

Fay&#8212;<br>
With the heart of an anarchist <br>
The soul of an I.W.W.<br>
The brand of the outlaw<br>

And a dark-eyed woman <br>
Who beckons to me. <br>
Yet I stay.<br>
<br>
There's a hungry child <br>
In California<br>
An infant soul <br>
Whose body<br>
Lacks food and shelter.<br>
<br>
There's a starving maid <br>
In California,<br>
A girl whose hunger <br>
For bread or ribbons<br>
Is denied.<br>
<br>
There's an exploited mother <br>
In California<br>
Whose choice is<br>
Between the sweat shop, <br>
Starvation or harlotry.<br>
<br>
There's a jobless man <br>
In California<br>
Tramping over Idle Acres <br>
Moving on&#8212;begging&#8212;stealing&#8212;<br>
The sheriff's irons behind him.<br>
<br>
There's a broken life <br>
In California<br>
A discouraged hopeless being <br>
A blood brother of mine&#8212;<br>
And a fighting chance<br>
<br>
To succor him&#8212;<br>
A bare chance <br>
Immediately<br>
To Open the Earth <br>
And free him.<br>
<br>
Not one only<br>
Tho one were enough <br>
For a man&#8212;<br>
But a hundred thousand&#8212;<br>
So I stay and strive in California.<br>

<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE SILVER THREAD</span> <br>
There are in every society a number of people who care.<br>
<br>
For these life is not bounded by their material satisfactions. They are not content
to mind their own business and let the word wag along as it will. For it doesn't
wag that way. It has no will. It wags as Rockefeller and the steel trust will.
And that spells a shameful and
unnecessary poverty &#8212; hunger, prostitution, starvation wages, child slavery,
insanity, suicide, murder for profit, and millions disemployed.<br>
<br>
Reason enough why those who care should not be content to sit with hands folded
in their own houses.<br>
<br>
Consciously or unconsciously these sense the invisible silver thread that runs
from heart to heart and binds the human mass into a unity from which no unit
can escape.<br>
<br>
This silver thread is not known or sensed by those whose attention is fixed on
externalities, and they marvel when "unmerited" blows fall; nevertheless it is
the most real thing in the world, and whoever does not reckon with it will find
his steering wrong.<br>
<br>
The silver thread by which the tortures of a Danbury hatter touch the life of
a Pasadena millionaire is not mere trope of speech or poetic metaphor. It is
more real and lasting and unescapable than rent,
interest, and land values.<br>
<br>
But only those who care sense it.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HUMAN NATURE PERCENTAGES</span><br>
<br>
Gather a thousand human beings anywhere. <br>
&nbsp; Show them the possibility of realizing immediately a sane, decent, kindly
system of social life<br>
&nbsp; Eighty per cent will enlist to accomplish it.<br>
<br>
Gather a thousand human beings anywhere.<br>
&nbsp; Show them a strange new fiscal device for the alleviation of poverty an
inch a year.<br>
&nbsp; Ten per cent will eagerly embrace it and try to force it on the
rest.<br>
<br>
Gather a thousand human beings anywhere.<br>
&nbsp; Show them an Ideal that calls for heroism &#8212; and a Self Interest
easily reached. <br>
&nbsp; Ninety per cent of them will choose the ideal.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">STILL WAITING FOR HEAVEN<br>
<br>
</span>Beware the medieval concept of Heaven! It lingers in the consciousness
of those who think themselves most. liberal, most radical, unorthodox, infidel.
Many who fancy themselves free bold
atheists still believe in Heaven.<br>
<br>
They have disowned the word, denied the material mansions in the skies, repudiated
an after-death state of perfect bliss &#8212; still they are thrall to the essentiality
of the material concept of Heaven, which denies the reality of Here and Now and
relegates everything to the future.<br>
<br>
Heaven is a habit of thought, a habit of dwelling only or mainly in the future.
It is the idea that happiness can only be attained after awhile, that the ideal
is only possible for the future; that here and now we must suffer in this vale
of tears, but after awhile we will
reach socialism, or anarchism, or singletax &#8212; then our children or their
children will inhabit a decent world and begin truly to develop.<br>
<br>
It admirably pleases the needs of our masters and exploiters, who are no longer
alarmed that we repudiate the word "heaven." They grant us
that "freedom," seeing that the Heaven habit of thought abides with us and we
go on as ever planning and educating always, always for the
future &#8212; never for Now!<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">HUMAN NATURE<br>
<br>
</span>Human nature is full of meanness and pettiness &#8212; on its surface.
The tongue lies, our interests lead us to deceit, fear keeps us chained to the
superficial, the strife against poverty engenders hate and
envy &#8212; the shadow or the reality of need or hunger saps our frankness and
courage, reduces us all to the status of sneak thieves and detectives.<br>
<br>
This is the surface of life. Underneath it lies the heart, dormant usually, or
pumping only in a mechanical way. Rouse it, interest it, excite it to consciousness
and dominance, and you will find beneath every hypocrite, liar, and coward (which
we all are)&#8212;<br>
<br>
A Man or a Woman true and dependable at the center.<br>
<br>
Human nature is cramped, distorted, perverted &#8212; first and chiefly by the
economic and industrial infamies &#8212; but its Heart is true.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE SOURCE OF POWER</span><br>
The seat of power is the Heart.<br>
<br>
The head invokes it, the hands execute it &#8212; but power resides in the
Heart.<br>
<br>
Mentality guides, shapes, molds it (more or less) &#8212; but the source of power
is the heart.<br>
<br>
This is not gush or sentimentality, but physiologic fact.<br>
<br>
The heart supplies all motor power &#8212; automatically as a rule, unconsciously,
aimlessly.<br>
<br>
The brain analyzes, relates, ponders, plans &#8212; but without the Heart it
has not power to stir a leaf. <br>
<br>
In all life the Heart is the reservoir of power, and whoever would accomplish
anything must invoke it. <br>
<br>
We quicken the nerve ganglia of the spleen, the liver, the solar plexus, and
other centers &#8212; and get emotions of hate, envy, deceit, sensuality, as
these centers draw undue blood from the Heart.<br>
<br>
But quicken the Heart of man, reach directly the Source of Power, and a great
expansion of force flows (we call it love or sympathy) that dominates, dares,
and performs!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PERSONAL SALVATION</span> <br>
<br>
Personal Salvation is the great delusion. The world is not built that way. Individualism
is only intellectual and at no time is it more than half the truth. The other
half is, that the deeper part of every human is indissolubly attached to the
human mass and responsive to every throb of pain or joy that thrills the mass.
No one can fall off the earth or rise above it. While the mass is enslaved no
one is free.
While the mass is degraded no one can be much else.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IDEALS<br>
<br>
</span>The only man who lives up to his ideals is the man who has none.<br>
<br>
Ideals are of thought which is fluidic, and wherever thought is active, ideals
keep a measurable pace in advance of conduct. When conduct catches up with ideals,
thought has ceased to flow, "mental stability" ensues, self-complacency and self-righteousness
obtain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">MARTYRDOM AND SACRIFICE<br>
<br>
</span>Self-sacrifice and martyrdom are childish concepts &#8212; when not
worse.<br>
<br>
Men seek ever their own good &#8212; what is most congenial to themselves, to
whatever element of self is then uppermost.<br>
<br>
Martyrdom and self-sacrifice are &#8212; cant. <br>
<br>
No one sacrifices himself &#8212; he "sacrifices" one part of himself to another
part. He relinquishes, rejects, that which he conceives to be the lesser in order
to obtain what appears to him to be the
greater &#8212; having learned that he cannot have both.<br>
<br>
Our acts are for self, for the gain of self, be the gain of gold, pride, love
personal or impersonal.<br>
<br>
Forever we search for the more desirable &#8212; to Us &#8212; for the thrills,
surges,
feelings, exaltations (or degradations) peculiar to ourselves.<br>
<br>
How blindly we grope! &#8212; for the excitations of alcohol, the soothings of
peace, or the ecstacies of the heretic burned at the stake!<br>
<br>
I want that, and only that, which it will give me the greatest satisfaction to
obtain.<br>
<br>
What is gain for one man appears as dross to another.<br>
<br>
Fear, prejudice, habit, keep many from finding their best gain. Ignorance keeps
all from their best. But that which each seeks is ever the best that each knows
and feels at the time.<br>
<br>
Some find their best in seizing, robbing, exploiting &#8212; or in ease and yielding.
Some find theirs in giving and in doing. But each seeks always his own best,
and martyrdom and self-sacrifice are &#8212; cant.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">OODLES OF KNOWLEDGE<br>
<br>
</span>If socialism, anarchism, or singletax means a kinder and
decenter world &#8212;<br>
<br>
We are ready for it Now!<br>
<br>
All our economic education pertains only to life in the christian
jungle &#8212; and doesn't ease it or help it. If singletax, socialism, or anarchism
means to perpetuate this jungle existence, then they are all
negligible.<br>
<br>
If they mean the end of robbery and exploitation, if anyone of them will shear
the state of its power to bestow privileges that despoil &#8212;<br>
<br>
Then we are ready for it Now, without another moment's education or
preparation.<br>
<br>
All that lacks is the Power.<br>
<br>
"Knowledge is power" &#8212; not at all. Intellect is only the perceiver of things,
the knower, the director. Power is one thing, quite another
is knowledge.<br>
<br>
Already we have knowledge &#8212; mountains of it, books, tomes, libraries of
ancient and modern knowledge. Life is cluttered with knowledge &#8212; the heart
is cloyed with it &#8212; we have shrivelled to pusillanimity beneath the heavy
load of our knowledge &#8212; most of which is self-contradictory and all of
it negligible while a million human beings are jobless!<br>
<br>
Knowledge has robbed us of Power.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE LINE OF CLEAVAGE<br>
<br>
</span>Those who Care and those who don't &#8212; this is the line of cleavage
in human society. It does not run between exploiter and exploited, the robber
and the robbed: those are later accidents of environment and opportunity and
circumstances. The still earlier "accident" &#8212; so it must
appear to our&nbsp; comprehension &#8212; that we have to deal with is the "accident" of
birth which gave this man a quickened heart and this man
a dull one &#8212; this man a heart responsive and this man a heart obtuse.<br>
<br>
Some men Care and some men don't &#8212; this is the line of cleavage. It does
not parallel any of the artificial lines that superficially separate society
into classes. It is not between the masses and the classes, not between labor
and capital nor between worker and parasite; it is not between proletariat, bourgeois,
and tinsel aristocrat, nor between
the educated and the ignorant.<br>
<br>
The true line of cleavage runs perpendicular thru all the classes &#8212; even
thru radicalism itself &#8212; and divides the world into those who Care and
those who don't.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT THE WORST THING<br>
<br>
</span>War is not the worst thing in the world.<br>
<br>
It is not so evil and hideous a thing as the gallows or the electric
chair.<br>
<br>
The war passion is fine &#8212; that men will leave all that is dear to them
to go off and face death for an ideal, however mistaken. Slavish peace is worse
than war, and infinitely worse are the degradation's of
disemployment.<br>
<br>
War at worst is ignorance &#8212; that men should make an ideal of their
slaveries.<br>
<br>
The sorrow of the war is, not the spirit of idealism that drives the millions
to it, but that the millions should mistake their chains for "something better" and
make an ideal of their slaveries.<br>
<br>
The shame of the war is &#8212; the Profit wrung from it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE HEART LEADS<br>
<br>
</span>The heart leads, not the head. Reason is to sift truth from its clinging
fancies and crass material concepts, mind is to detect error, to correlate and
to explain, but the finding of truth and peace of whatever is of real worth is
the function of the heart. It leads! And it leads not to despair, not to distrust
of Infinity or carping at its seeming cruelties, but to a wider sphere of consciousness
with profounder depths of feeling and loftier intellectual reaches, where the
antinomies and perplexities of external life are softened gradually till they
disappear &#8212; where the sharp blacks and whites merge into grayness and the
garish midday colors are lost in azure mists thru
which rise those "half-glimpsed battlements of eternity" &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not where the wheeling systems darken, <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And our benumbed conceiving soars!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The drift of pinions, would we hearken, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beats at our own clay-shuttered doors."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">THE WORLD IS AWAKE<br>
<br>
</span>The world is awake as never before. <br>
Its heart is aflame with daring.<br>
Mankind is ready for wonderful changes. <br>
It is the time for the fruition of dreams!<br>
<br>
Huge things are going on &#8212;<br>
Robberies and exploitations that stagger the imagination,<br>
A world holocaust of senseless murder,<br>
Half of human energy making death machines, <br>
Privilege reaping monstrous streams of wealth <br>
That flow from the life blood of countless children, women, and men &#8212;<br>
Human life crushed into Profit!<br>
<br>
The world is awake &#8212; Only for blood, lust, and death?<br>
Wait! You will see. Great things are coming &#8212; Quickly!<br>
The heart of the world is aflame.<br>
It is the hour for the fruition of dreams!<br>
<br>
