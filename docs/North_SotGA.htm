Indeed, on earth with Fate we shall conspire, <br>
Recast the wolfish Scheme of Things entire,<br>
&nbsp; Break feudal codes that hold men from the earth, <br>
Remold the nations to the Heart's Desire.<br>
<br>
'Tis Fear that cozens Hope of its caress <br>
And leaves your piety all comfortless.<br>
&nbsp; 'Tis Fear, I say, that robs e'en Love of joy <br>
And tinges human life with bitterness.<br>
<br>
'Tis Fear, 'tis Fear of flesh, of death, of "lust" <br>
In Nature, God, or Self, no helpful trust,<br>
&nbsp; All modern life is ruled by dead men's codes &#8212; <br>
Its Faith is based on shining bits of dust.<br>
<br>
O Man! stand up, and dare be What thou art; <br>
Dare live, enjoy, demand; forget the mart;<br>
&nbsp; Dare to be free, dare even that thine <br>
Heart Shall lead! O, be the very God thou art.<br>
<br>
Dare lift thy head from custom's slavish yoke, <br>
Tear from Society its tradesman's cloak.<br>
&nbsp; Dare take the Soil, thy heritage of birth &#8212;<br>
Dare all, dare all! Thyself alone invoke!<br>
<br>
O, be a gambler bold and freely throw <br>
The dice of life, lay all its hollow show<br>
&nbsp; Of dross upon the cloth &#8212; its Gold to win &#8212;<br>
And play the greatest game the heart can know!<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WHO WILL WORK FOR A FREE EARTH?</span><br>
Who will work for a Free Earth &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; To establish the rule that no one shall hold more land than he
uses &#8212; <br>
Who will &#8212; Work! &#8212; not merely talk and attend lectures and banquets &#8212; Who
will Work<br>
&nbsp; To end poverty quickly by establishing the rule and the law &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the Earth shall be open to all on equal terms?<br>
<br>
Who will do his share Now &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Here in California, Oregon, Texas &#8212; wherever &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At This Moment to apply the Golden Rule at the
base of life &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; To abolish basic laws and customs that pauperize the many by
giving the land and its resources to monopolists and speculators &#8212;<br>
Who will Work now to establish the rule of a Free Earth?<br>
<br>
Who will give all he can &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Of himself, his talents, his time, his thought, his cash, and
his energy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Whatever he has to give &#8212; give it freely, finely, generously,<br>
&nbsp; For no private gain higher or lower<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the satisfaction of doing his utmost to
halt the starving of children, the prostitution of maids, the wage
slaveries of men and women, the disemployment of millions &#8212;<br>
Who will give and work Now?<br>
<br>
Here is the Opportunity &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; To take an actual, tangible, definite step in a legal and
orderly manner<br>
&nbsp; To achieve the First Necessity of an unenslaved Manhood &#8212; A Free
and Open Earth!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rule of which once gained, the downward pressure
toward greater and greater human degradation &#8212; toward increasing suicide,
crime, prostitution, and disemployment &#8212; will be halted!<br>
<br>
On a free and open earth &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Cooperation will be practicable,<br>
&nbsp; Real Individualism will be possible, <br>
&nbsp; Fraternalism's profit can be shared by all, <br>
&nbsp; The parent Privilege will be dead!<br>
&nbsp; The root cause of War will be gone!<br>
&nbsp; The institutions of Comradeship may then begin to grow.<br>
&nbsp; Dreams and longings of the enlightened human heart may then take
shape.<br>
&nbsp; Man's innate sense of justice (sans quibble) &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; The human passion to utter freely the Soul's fondest boldest
deepest urges &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Manhood's need to be fearless and expansive &#8212; his everlasting
search for the Intangible!<br>
&nbsp; Womanhood's need for a wholesome earth on which to breed
Courageous Men &#8212; and lure them to higher daring with the "starry
treachery of her eyes!" &#8212;<br>
<br>
All these &#8212; and all the lesser or greater things of growth, happiness,
peace, comfort, expression and experience &#8212;<br>
Whatever it is that all or any of us are after &#8212; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these must Begin!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can they otherwise begin save &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On a Free and Open Earth?<br>
<br>
And here we have made a start &#8212;<br>
Here in California and in Oregon and in Texas &#8212;<br>
Here we have drawn a Human Bill<br>
&#8212; a peoples' measure, to be enacted by the People &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bill that says in essence: "Use your
land or get off it and let some one else use it &#8212; use the oil, coal,
timber, ores of the earth or yield the titles by which you hold them
idle!"<br>
<br>
By the terms of this bill the People assert<br>
(grant and establish to themselves) &#8212; <br>
&nbsp; To the Whole People on Equal Terms <br>
&nbsp; The earth and its resources! &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Grant and Establish to Themselves at least the legal power to
control and share fairly the land and its produce.<br>
<br>
If there develop "other bridges to cross"<br>
&nbsp; Before the earth can be opened to all men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; We shall be the better able to cross them having crossed this
one unitedly, compactly. <br>
If other power than legal power<br>
&nbsp; Shall be necessary to open the earth to man <br>
&nbsp; We shall be thrice armed and doubly strong <br>
&nbsp; For having taken the legal power Together!<br>
<br>
Here now is the struggle for a Free Earth Fairly begun!<br>
What will You do to further it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">GIVE LABOR THE VISION OF A FREE EARTH</span><br>
Comes a voice: "Labor is Life &#8212; Not Vision!"<br>
Comes to rebuke the idealists, those "dreamy men and women filled with
ideas."<br>
A voice<br>
Echoing the masters' dictum <br>
That whatever is must be;<br>
And the church's dogma &#8212;<br>
A few are chosen of God and many not.<br>
<br>
It is not true. What is<br>
"God and my country" but a vision?<br>
What are all the shibboleths of the masters &#8212;<br>
Law and Order, Progress, Posterity, Patriotism, Majesty of the Law,
Preservation of the State &#8212;<br>
Would you call them actualities? &#8212;<br>
And a thousand other sounding phrases <br>
By which the masses are chained &#8212;<br>
What are these but visions? &#8212;<br>
False ideals impressed upon Labor, <br>
Dreams (nightmares) dogmas<br>
By which Labor was led to captivity <br>
And is held there?<br>
<br>
Labor does not originate its own visions <br>
But its capacity for them is inherent <br>
Unending profound.<br>
Labor is led imprisoned bound <br>
And might be Freed <br>
By visions!<br>
<br>
Above all is Labor Vision &#8212;<br>
Too much so for that it lacks wisdom<br>
To sift the false from the true<br>
And falls victim to the abstract ideals<br>
Most insistently impressed upon it.<br>
Only by Visions &#8212;<br>
By ideals unattaint of narrow petty personal cash or material
considerations &#8212;<br>
Shall Labor be led to its own unfoldment,<br>
<br>
For only by visions<br>
Is Labor deeply stirred<br>
And blindly led.<br>
As Labor is led to the shambles<br>
So it can be led to the Light &#8212;<br>
By Visions.<br>
<br>
Give Labor the vision of a Free Earth<br>
And a Splendid Manhood<br>
Here! &#8212; in this world &#8212;<br>
Now! &#8212; in this generation.<br>
Give it the vision of an earth free<br>
Of hate and its gallows &#8212;<br>
An earth with no prisons or penal codes,<br>
No judges and detectives,<br>
No landlords and paupers &#8212;<br>
Give Labor a vision<br>
That will stir its soul to Action,<br>
Awaken its heroism and daring<br>
And Manhood!<br>
<br>
Labor is not all blind<br>
All content with its chains.<br>
See, it turns toward the Light &#8212;<br>
Yearns for other Visions!<br>
<br>
And we meet Labor's soul hunger<br>
With logic! with political economy!<br>
With lectures and resolutions &#8212;<br>
Of a thousand differing and contradicting kinds.<br>
We greet Labor with our own <br>
Lack of Vision<br>
Or with hopeless theologic platitudes<br>
A little changed in phrasing.<br>
<br>
Labor staggers confused bewildered<br>
At the multiplicity of counsel.<br>
Our mechanized logic frightens it.<br>
Whom shall it follow &#8212;<br>
Which ist or ism of a dozen?<br>
And where is the Vision &#8212;<br>
The saner, better, purer Ideal<br>
Than "God and my country"?<br>
<br>
Labor is not Vision, say you?<br>
Labor is all Vision &#8212; a prisoner to its visions.<br>
It is we who think a little<br>
That lack vision.<br>
Think a little harder, friends &#8212;<br>
Open the heart &#8212;<br>
And back will come the vision &#8212;<br>
The beautiful vision of a Free Earth<br>
Without paupers, parasites, and prostitutes &#8212;<br>
The vision we have lost<br>
In wrangling over its distant details,<br>
In debating how (not) to obtain it &#8212;<br>
The vision of a decenter Home for Man<br>
On Earth &#8212; on a free earth! &#8212;<br>
Forgetful that only Labor can build it.<br>
<br>
We have lost the Vision.<br>
Open the Heart for its return.<br>
Let it burn out<br>
The dissonances of our differences<br>
And knit us into a compact priesthood<br>
To lead the human mass<br>
To its own unfoldment.<br>
<br>
With our regained Vision <br>
Let us greet Labor. <br>
With our Vision<br>
We will arouse in Labor<br>
Its deepest wildest strongest <br>
Holiest and boldest Passion <br>
Of Man for Man,<br>
The passion of Life and daring <br>
And High Adventure<br>
That shall tread down <br>
Tyrants and tyranny,<br>
Exploiters and exploitation,<br>
In a mad mighty rush of Man <br>
Toward the Light &#8212;<br>
In a sweep as impetuous<br>
As a band of a thousand bisons <br>
Obliterating everything in its path &#8212;<br>
As irresistibly as the manhood of Europe <br>
Swept across the nations and the seas <br>
To rescue the Holy Sepulchre!<br>
<br>
Labor has no vision? <br>
It once had!<br>
And can have again.<br>
<br>
Labor has no vision! <br>
Whose fault is that? <br>
Ours.<br>
We, the makers of visions &#8212;<br>
The natural priesthood of the mass &#8212;<br>
We have failed<br>
To give Labor a Vision.<br>
<br>
When in distrust<br>
Of its theologic visions <br>
It turns to us<br>
We give it &#8212; economics!<br>
<br>
Labor has had visions, <br>
Has one now &#8212;<br>
Hell's vision of death and hate and murder <br>
In Europe.<br>
And in America<br>
It clings doubtingly to the old visions, <br>
The masters' visions &#8212;<br>
But its face is turned our way<br>
And in its eyes is a cosmic hunger <br>
A world longing &#8212; a mute<br>
Searching passion for a New Vision <br>
Ere it plunges<br>
To another sea of blood.<br>
<br>
No vision!<br>
Let us give it a Vision &#8212;<br>
An impracticable unattainable <br>
Dream Vision!<br>
In its rush to gain which<br>
It may strike off many chains <br>
And at the mid-goal<br>
Find itself on a Free Earth <br>
Potentially its own master.<br>
<br>
Do we fear?<br>
Do we doubt?<br>
What is it that stays us?<br>
Shall the mass be led only by evil visions? <br>
Can't the mass be led by <br>
Love as well as hate?<br>
Can't it be easier led by <br>
Love than by hate &#8212;<br>
To its own unfolding<br>
Than its own undoing?<br>
<br>
The cosmic tide of human progression <br>
The world wave of democratization<br>
The trend of all the human centuries<br>
Are ours to use.<br>
They await intelligent employment. <br>
They point the way<br>
Of Least Resistance!<br>
Kings priests exploiters<br>
Have to battle against them. <br>
They are on our side.<br>
All the Powers of Light, seen and unseen, known and guessed,<br>
Will aid us.<br>
Love and intelligence &#8212;<br>
The human head and heart &#8212;<br>
All their highest mightiest values &#8212;<br>
Those that have saved the race <br>
From extinction<br>
In its darkest hours &#8212;<br>
All will be on our side!<br>
<br>
Impracticable!<br>
It is the only practicable<br>
Move on the human horizon &#8212;<br>
The only one that will achieve<br>
Anything worth crossing the street to get. <br>
It is the only move <br>
That can win!<br>
<br>
Greed's tyranny is <br>
Increasing!<br>
In America, as elsewhere,<br>
Its victims grow more numerous <br>
Every year.<br>
Manhood is waning!<br>
Your hope of further education <br>
Is futile<br>
On a monopolized earth!<br>
Why do we haggle and hesitate &#8212;<br>
We, the Intelligent Minority of America?<br>
<br>
If Labor has no Vision &#8212;<br>
The fault is ours.<br>
<br>
Come, let us regain our Vision<br>
And show it to Labor &#8212;<br>
to the human mass &#8212;<br>
And start them on<br>
The Holiest Crusade<br>
The weary old world has ever known! &#8212;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop the Cosmic Hideous Joke of a million idle men on a
  billion Unused Acres!!<br>
  <br>
  Who will join a movement to release Man from needless, deadening
  poverty and free him to himself &#8212; to his better, truer, kinder, wholesome
  Self that hungers for expression and experience, and is deterred first
  and mainly by the terrible economic pressure which brings but misery
  and grief even to the few who reap its harvest?<br>
  <br>
  Who will join &#8212; Who will give themselves unreservedly &#8212;<br>
  Who will find their own keenest good &#8212;<br>
  Who will serve, and dare, with no hope of reward or preferment, for no
  honors, titles, emoluments, epaulettes, or iron crosses &#8212; the greatest
  cause the world has ever known?<br>
  <br>
  Who will join the Great Adventure! &#8212; to free, not a class, not a race

  generation! &#8212; Now &#8212;<br>

  Who will help the effort to establish a tenure of use and occupance as
  sole title to earth, air, and sky &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Thus to abolish Exploitation at its root &#8212;<br>

&nbsp; Careful to eschew ephemeral sentimentality, or the lower
  emotions that lead to violence and play into the hands of Greed &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Yet fearless of any contingency, deeming the Human Need of
  paramount importance &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  A concentrated, united appeal, by the Entire Intelligent Minority of
  America &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Of all the sociologic schools and doctrines &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Combined in a mighty effort to arouse the whole human mass from
  its Apathy &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Centering upon the One Demand, a Free Earth (intellectual
  differences of method to be considered afterward) &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Invoking as its leverage the only power of human unanimity, the
  Heart Force latent in every being &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  Who will join The Great Adventure?<br>

  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">ON AND AFTER &#8212;</span><br>
  On and after &#8212;<br>
  O, what shall the date be?<br>
  On and after which<br>
  No man shall rob another<br>
  By authority of the State.<br>
  <br>
  On and after &#8212;<br>
  Men! Let's make it soon!<br>
  On and after which<br>
  No man's daughter need sell<br>
  Her sex for bread.<br>
  <br>
  On and after &#8212;<br>
  Are we nearly ready to be Men? <br>
  On and after which<br>
  None shall kill and debauch <br>
  By power of the State.<br>
  <br>
  On and after &#8212;<br>
  The world has waited long for the date<br>
  On and after which<br>
  Greed shall not fatten<br>
  On human sweat and blood.<br>
  <br>
  On and after &#8212;<br>
  Men will blush to recall the day <br>
  On and after which<br>
  Five million jobless wanderers <br>
  Found homes and work on the Land!<br>
  <br>
  On and after &#8212;<br>
  On and after which<br>
  No man shall hold of earth<br>
  More than he can use!<br>

  He stood for Men &#8212;<br>
  Not for parties, sections, classes; <br>
  Not for dogmas, doctrines, isms &#8212;<br>
  Nor all the minutiae of over-elaborated plans for the future,<br>
  Nor for craven caution, dissimulation, equivocation &#8212;<br>
  Patience that now outrages virtue &#8212;<br>
  Program'd ways and means which if not followed <br>
  The world may stay in hell.<br>
  <br>
  He stood for Men &#8212;<br>
  For in his soul he knew the line of cleavage<br>
  Was not between the robber and the robbed &#8212;<br>
  Was not marked by external difference,<br>
  By rank or class or occupation or wealth or poverty.<br>
  He knew that poor men could be very cruel and rich men kind.<br>
  He knew the line of cleavage was in the heart &#8212; those who care and those
  who don't &#8212;<br>
  This Henry George who wrote "<em>Progress and Poverty</em>."<br>
  <br>
  He stood for Men &#8212;<br>
  And was he wrong to yield no tithe to classes?<br>
  What has now become of all the appeals<br>
  To class interest, class consciousness, class solidarity?<br>
  The human heart will not respond to them &#8212; in every class are tyrants.<br>
  The human mass forgets its every interest,<br>
  Flings to the wind all self and class advantage<br>
  And goes out to die for a word.<br>
  <br>
  He stood for Men &#8212;<br>
  And showed the world how to unshackle the chains that bind men.<br>
  He showed how poverty begins,<br>
  Where modern slavery has its roots, <br>
  And how to tear them up.<br>
  The earth is for all men, he said &#8212;<br>
  And his word has gone around the world &#8212;<br>
  And now it's time to act!<br>
  <br>
  He stood for Men &#8212;<br>
  Not creeds and doctrines, nor all the lesser details of future
  contingencies.<br>
  He bared the earth to man. <br>
  It is for us to take it.<br>
  He tried to gain it, and was beaten back to his death.<br>
  Now we will gain it &#8212;<br>
  At whatever cost!<br>

  A million jobless men &#8212;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich with unworked mines,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Webbed with highways and railroads,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Watered with rivers and brooks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Under snow-capped peaks and mountain lakes. <br>
  <br>
  A Million jobless men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In an idle, unused, vacant, fertile land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dotted here and there with villages and cities <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In which a hundred million mouths want food <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a hundred million human needs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And longings go half supplied. <br>
  <br>
  A million jobless men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Idle, hungry, roofless, shabby men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With ten million women and children dependent upon them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wandering aimlessly over twenty-three hundred million acres<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of land that is mostly fertile and mostly idle &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Idle, vacant, unused land &#8212; and a starving people!<br>
  <br>
  A million jobless men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In an idle, vacant, unused land broad enough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To house without crowding every human being in the world &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich enough to support<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; All the earth's population,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its own few people but partly housed, fed and clothed!<br>
  <br>
  A million jobless men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clerks, bookkeepers, artisans, laborers, all the
  professions &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Men with nothing to do, who can find no work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; While two million stunted children labor in mine and mill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And needy women must sell their sex for food &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A million or maybe six million jobless men! &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  A million jobless men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ten million poorly paid men who get barely enough to
  sustain their families,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a million women on the streets, and a million hungry
  children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus a million mortgaged homes, and a million business
  bankrupts &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; On twenty-three hundred million acres of inexhaustible
  richness not a thousandth part of which has been touched!<br>
  <br>
  A million jobless men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And twenty million human dolts content to live in hell &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lecture, write, legislate, investigate, resolve, and
  vote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To "cure unemployment !" with a learned President<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a cabinet and a congress of economic students<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who institute Employment Bureaus!! to feed the hungry,
  jobless, idle men tramping over idle, vacant, undeveloped land!<br>
  <br>
  A million jobless men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ten million legislators, judges, detectives, soldiers,
  sheriffs, constables, and policemen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; With clubs, guns, bayonets, legal process, penal codes,
  prisons, handcuffs, dungeons, and gallows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep these million jobless men from going on the idle,
  naked, fertile acres<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And feeding themselves, their women, and children!<br>
  <br>
  A million jobless men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1914<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now most all at work making death machinery to blow each
  other to hell!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The land still idle &#8212; and a million wage slaves making

  Hear the rumbling legions <br>
  Now the hour of war!<br>
  Not to slay the foeman <br>
  Nor to bleed a state.<br>
  War for human beings, <br>
  Love instead of hate.<br>
  <br>
  Hear the tramp of millions; <br>
  Nor bombs nor cannon roar <br>
  Only men awakened, <br>
  Aliens by birth &#8212;<br>
  Overwhelming legions<br>
  To seize and free the earth!<br>
  <br>
  Rising are the millions:<br>
  Nor fear nor hope can bar. <br>
  Not for gods or dogmas<br>
  Not for words their fight. <br>
  Singleness of purpose &#8212;<br>
  Might befriends their right.<br>
  <br>
  Race nor creed divide them, <br>
  Gathering near and far;<br>
  Puissant come the millions, <br>
  Captained by their need. <br>
  Thought and care are leading <br>
  Earth to wrench from Greed!<br>
  <br>
  War's for gain forever;<br>
  Then let the gain be ours. <br>
  Keep the braid and tinsel, <br>
  All the minted gold;<br>
  Earth alone we're taking &#8212;<br>
  Birthright of the bold!<br>
  <br>
  Scorn your death devices, <br>
  Greed's infernal powers; <br>
  Life itself we're seeking! <br>
  This our first command, <br>
  Pealing now as thunder &#8212;<br>
  Open ye the land!<br>
  <br>
  Rise the famished millions <br>
  Driven off the land;<br>
  Spurning peace or plunder, <br>
  Seeking lust nor loot.<br>
  Thralls to sloth no longer<br>
  The millions sluff the brute.<br>
  Upright humans hungry, <br>
  Fearlessly they' band,<br>
  Codes nor laws nor titles!<br>
  O, governments, beware &#8212;<br>
  Heed the need of millions &#8212;<br>
  Men who know and dare!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE WHITE MAN'S TOTEM</span><br>
  Paper titles to idle acres<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the crime and shame <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of christendom &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its prisons and brothels <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Paupers and billionaires!<br>
  <br>
  Paper titles to idle oil lands <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are gasoline at 20 cents <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus the wage slaveries <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Disemployment and slums <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of civilization.<br>
  <br>
  Paper titles to idle acres<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the white man's idol <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His totem and fetish <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His bloody sacrifice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of women and children!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THAT THE LAND BE OPENED TO MAN<br>
  <br>
  </span>That the land be opened to the people.<br>
&nbsp; That every adult stand in actu or potenitally on his own piece
  of earth<br>
&nbsp; From which only death can dislodge him.<br>
  <br>
  That the whole people say to Greed:<br>
&nbsp; "The parent privilege is dead: the primal monopoly has ceased:
  the base of exploitation is destroyed.<br>
&nbsp; All have access to the earth without toll or price."<br>
  <br>
  That the people say to Ignorance:<br>
&nbsp; "We have changed the system of land tenure, on which rested your
  power to enslave.<br>
&nbsp; Every man shall own himself, and by the privilege to withhold
  land shall no man have the power to own another.<br>
&nbsp; The unused earth is free."<br>
  <br>
  And if Doubt and Envy linger to question: <br>
&nbsp; "Why one man will have better land than another &#8212; acres more
  fertile, lots nearer market, sites more pleasing for residence?"<br>
&nbsp; A child may answer: "Those who hold the better sites will
  gladly, freely equalize the difference to others &#8212; when exploitation's
  necessity no longer stifles the better impulses: 'tis a detail that
  free men will settle in a manly way."<br>
  <br>
  And the people say:<br>
&nbsp; "But never again shall Greed or Ignorance gain power to
  rack-rent, distrain, wage-slave, pauperize, and disemploy the millions <br>
&nbsp; Thru the primal curse of land monopoly."<br>
  <br>
  And if Doubt or Doctrine hesitate and ask:<br>
&nbsp; "How then with railroads, carriers, utilities, banks, trusts,
  and mines ?"<br>
&nbsp; Even the Child may answer: "How about them now? Free land will
  not increase their power."<br>
&nbsp; And the Student will interpose to say: "Free land will greatly
  or entirely destroy their power of exploitation. What is left we can
  then consider."<br>
  <br>
  That the whole people say to Greed and Ignorance:<br>
&nbsp; "There shall be no mortgage on the bare land, nor any title
  thereto but use and occupance; land is to live on, cultivate, and
  develop &#8212; not for speculation.<br>
&nbsp; None shall own or hold of earth an inch more than he can use:
  every idle lot or acre shall be as free as air and sun to him who needs
  it for a home, a store, a workshop, a garden, or a farm."<br>
  <br>
  And if the Disputer arise with, "But &#8212;  If &#8212;" <br>
&nbsp; He shall be silenced by a child again:<br>
&nbsp; "These are not issues for slaves to settle. Free men each with a
  foothold on the soil will settle them in a bold, kind, free way &#8212; let
  us
  not doubt."<br>
&nbsp; And the Student will add: "Every social and industrial problem,
  nay most of the psychologic problems too, that men now rack their
  ingenuity to solve, will under free land assume entirely different
  aspects &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Free land will change the surface and the heart of civilization."<br>
  <br>
  That the Human Heart thunder to the world: <br>
&nbsp; "Poverty is dead. Disemployment is ended. The earth is open.<br>
&nbsp; The poor, the weak, the ignorant, the blind shall never be
  trampled and vampirized again by the withholding of the unused land &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; For I have bared the bosom of earth to man and&nbsp; in her
  breasts is sustenance inexhaustible."<br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">OMITTED FROM THE SPOON RIVER ANTHOLOGY<br>
  <br>
  </span>I was the leading singletaxer in Spoon River<br>
  I organized its first singletax club <br>
  I once saw Henry George himself <br>
  And I knew Louis F. Post <br>
  And Daniel Kiefer.<br>
  <br>
  I wrote articles for the press <br>
  About taxation problems, <br>
  Was a fluent talker<br>
  And could prove the falsities of Karl Marx to anybody<br>
  But a socialist.<br>
  I was called the John Z. White <br>
  Of Spoon River.<br>
  We had a flourishing club,<br>
  With after dinner lectures and discussions <br>
  One a month &#8212; regular.<br>
  And weekly luncheons at which we discussed the shipping bill or the
  currency question<br>
  And entertained any noted person<br>
  Who came to Spoon River.<br>
  <br>
  Singletax became favorably known<br>
  To the Better Elements of Society. <br>
  The congregational minister <br>
  Preached a sermon on it.<br>
  We had a debate at the high school, <br>
"Resolved that singletax is scientific."<br>
  <br>
  We had an exclusive membership <br>
  Of cultured persons<br>
  Tirelessly devoted to the cause of<br>
  Rational taxation.<br>
  <br>
  If I had lived another year<br>
  I would have gone to the legislature <br>
  Where I could have scrutinized <br>
  Every measure<br>
  In its relation to the Philosophy <br>
  Of singletax.<br>
  <br>
  But there arose in our midst<br>
  A band of irresponsible agitators <br>
  Who stirred up the people <br>
  To open the land!<br>
  They were emotionalists<br>
  And would not discuss calmly a compromise with those who do not care
  for the immediate Practise of their preaching.<br>
  <br>
  They ranted about the army of disemployed, <br>
  About women driven to prostitution, <br>
  Men toiling for a pittance, <br>
  Children as wage slaves, <br>
  Babes starving.<br>
  They joined with socialists,<br>
  Anarchists, syndicalists, I. W. W's &#8212;<br>
  People like that!<br>
  <br>
  With anybody who would struggle <br>
  To change the land tenure <br>
  To use and occupancy <br>
  Right away!<br>
  <br>
  I opposed them eloquently <br>
  And with stratagem<br>
  For their radical demands<br>
  Would alienate from our Cause<br>
  The growing tolerance of the corporations and business men,<br>
  <br>
  The interest of the politicians<br>
  And the curiosity of club women.<br>
  Bankers, leading citizens, the daily press<br>
  Would view us with distrust.<br>
  <br>
  Could anything be worse<br>
  For the success of a Forward Movement?<br>
  I tried to rally the old war horses<br>
  To stand by their colors<br>
  And preserve the sacred<br>
  And respectable<br>
  Singletax philosophy<br>
  In unsullied purity<br>
  From these anarchists<br>
  And disturbers.<br>
  <br>
  But the agitators<br>
  Had the voting strength,<br>
  So Mrs. Jonesburg and I resigned<br>
  And started a Singletax Philomathic Society <br>
  For the discussion of proper methods <br>
  To alleviate poverty<br>
  Three-quarters of an inch a year <br>
  Without causing any annoyance <br>
  To Existing Conditions.<br>
  <br>
  If I had lived<br>
  We might have rehabilitated<br>
  Singletax in respectable circles. <br>
  But the idea<br>
  Of unscientific people <br>
  Led by agitators<br>
  Demanding the whole earth <br>
  Immediately!<br>
  Was too great a shock.<br>
  <br>
  They said I died <br>
  Of heart failure.<br>
  But I don't understand that <br>
  For the autopsy surgeons<br>
  Couldn't find such an organ <br>
  And said it had probably <br>
  Been absorbed<br>
  In my brain development.<br>
