<p><a name="ABSTRACT"></a><b>ABSTRACT</b></p>
<p>The optimal timing of development is an important allocative
function that can be either enhanced or degraded by the impact of
land taxes on land speculation. This paper discusses four types of
taxes on land: </p>
<ul>
  <li>taxes on the rental value of land, </li>
  <li>taxes on the sale value of land, </li>
  <li>taxes on realized income from land, and </li>
  <li>taxes on realized gains from the sale of land. </li>
</ul>
<p>All four taxes reduce incentives for speculation in land, which is
generally beneficial. The third and fourth produce distortions with
respect to incentives to develop land, while the first and second do
not. All four taxes have some beneficial effect of mitigating
imperfections in capital markets. All permit reduction or elimination
of taxes with significant dead-weight losses, such as those on
improvements.</p>
<p><a name="I. Introduction"></a><b>I. Introduction</b></p>
<p>As formerly centralized economies move to adopt market practices,
it will be very important for them to develop markets for land.
People with good ideas for new businesses cannot implement their
ideas unless there is some place where they can do so. It will not
work to require every potential entrepreneur to convince a government
official that his or her idea deserves an allocation of land. People
who want to use land must be able to buy the right to use land from
those who have that right. Land rights must be transferable to
achieve a well-functioning market economy.</p>
<p>Of course, land will not be transferred by those who have the
right to use it unless some payment is made. The possibility of
payments for transferring the right to use land raises the specter of
land speculators receiving large undeserved profits while holding
economic development hostage. Is land speculation an unavoidable
concomitant of a market economy?</p>
<p>It is important to understand first that withholding land from
development can be a productive activity. Land that is developed
prematurely will not be improved to the extent that is efficient when
the land is ripe for development, because that later development
would require the sacrifice of the earlier, inefficient improvements.
To insure that resources are not wasted on premature development of
land, it must be possible for those who make development decisions to
profit from making them well. This perspective on land speculation
was developed by Richard T. Ely (1920).</p>
<p>While there is thus social value in the activity of identifying
the optimal time for land to be developed, it is possible for a
society's institutions of land possession and transfer to reward land
speculation in excess of its social value, leading to a waste of
resources as people compete to acquire speculative gains. This paper
discusses the distinction between productive and unproductive
withholding of land from development and the ways that various taxes
can be used to inhibit unproductive withholding of land. </p>
<p><a

II</a> develops
the theory of productive and unproductive reasons for leaving land
unused and for spending effort to determine the future value of land.

comments.</p>
<p><a name="II" id="II"></a><b>II. The Private
and Social Returns from Land Speculation</b></p>
<p>To see how land speculation can lead to a waste of resources, it
is useful to develop a somewhat formal model of land management and
land speculation. Abstract from the continuous divisibility of land
and suppose that land comes in "sites." At each moment in time, each
site is in one of three states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>1. Suitable for agriculture.
    <p>2. Suitable for housing.</p>
    <p>3. Suitable for commercial activity.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While each site can be used for any activity, the net return will
be greatest if it is used for the activity for which it is suited,
provided that it remains in that activity long enough to fully
amortize the associated capital that is state-specific, durable and
immobile. What could keep a site from remaining in an activity long
enough to amortize the associated capital is that from time to time a
site makes a transition from state 1 to state 2 or from state 2 to
state 3. These transitions are imperfectly predictable. When a
transition from state 2 to state 3 occurs unexpectedly, the course of
action that maximizes the net return to the site may entail scrapping
prematurely the residential structure built there and building a
commercial structure. In such an instance, one may be able to look
backward and say that it would have been better not to have built the
residential structure at all, but rather to have left the site in
agricultural use until the transition to state 3 occurred. However,
such reckoning can affect investment decisions only to the extent
that transitions can be foreseen.</p>
<p>The transitions are assumed to be costly to foresee, and to be
more costly to foresee when they will be occurring further in the
future. Like signs of spring, symptoms of a possible transition are
at first faint and unreliable, becoming more and more obvious and
certain as the time of the transition approaches.</p>
<p>In addition to the land management motive for seeking to foresee
transitions, there is a speculative motive, which differs in form and
magnitude. While the land management motive is concerned with the
possibility that capital will be wasted on a site that is soon to
undergo a transition in state, the speculative motive arises from the
gains to be made from owning title to land at the time that its
better future prospects become generally known. </p>
<p>People differ in the costs they incur in ascertaining whether the
signs present at a particular site herald a pending transition, and
how soon it will occur. Therefore those who have a comparative
advantage in foreseeing the transitions tend to do the speculating. A
speculator will incur the cost of ascertaining the significance of
the signs at a particular site if, based on that speculator's
experience, the probability of a transition given the signs,
multiplied by the increase in the current value of the property if
there is a transition, is greater than the sum of the cost of making
the determination, the transactions costs of acquiring the site and
the net cost of holding the site until its future prospects become
generally known. The activity of speculation yields a normal expected
private return to the funds spent on speculation, with particularly
skillful speculators also obtaining unusual returns to their unique
talents.</p>
<p>The speculative return from foreseeing future transitions arises
from holding title to land when pending transitions become generally
known. This return is a purely private return, with no corresponding
social return, since the land will increase in value whether or not
any given speculator holds it. The land-management return from
foreseeing future transitions, on the other hand, arises from knowing
not to employ capital on sites where future transitions will cause
the capital to depreciate prematurely. This is a social return, since
it involves improving the allocation of scarce resources. There is no
necessary connection between the private return and the social
return.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of a lack of any necessary relation between the
private and social returns to knowledge has previously been noted by
Jack Hirshleifer, in connection with inventive activity. He wrote
(1972, p. 572):</p>
<blockquote>Do we have reason to believe that the potential speculative
profits to the inventor, from the pecuniary effects that will follow
release of the information at his unique disposal, will be so great
that society need take no care to reserve for him any portion of the
technological benefit of his innovation? The answer here is
indeterminate. There is no logically necessary tie between the size of
the technological benefit on the one hand, and the amplitude of the
price shifts that create speculative opportunities on the other.</blockquote>
<p>While there are no logically necessary ties between social
benefits and required incentives, there are systematic differences in
the social returns from different kinds of knowledge. For transitions
from state 2 to state 3, there are both land management and
speculative reasons for wanting to foresee the transitions. If there
were no expenditures on predicting the transitions, there could be
significant social costs from the inefficient construction of
residences on sites that were soon to undergo a transition. It is
valuable for a society's land possession institutions to provide an
incentive for efficient use of resources in predicting these
transitions.</p>
<p>For transitions from state 1 to state 2, on the other hand, there
may be only a speculative reason and not a land-management reason for
wanting to foresee the transition. If agriculture is conducted
without improvements to the land that are durable, immobile and
state-specific, then there is no land-management reason for wishing
to foresee the transition from state 1 to state 2. When the
transition occurs, the use can be changed. The ability to foresee the
change confers no added benefit. Thus there is only a private return
and no social return from being able to foresee transitions from
state 1 to state 2. Any resources that are spent on predicting
transitions from state 1 to state 2 for the sake of the speculative
gains that can thereby be obtained are, from a social perspective,
purely a waste of resources.</p>
<p>The possibility that there could be no social gain from an
activity that produced private speculative gains was recognized by
Paul Samuelson (1957, p. 209), in a discussion of the effects of
uncertainty on intertemporal price equilibrium:</p>
<blockquote>Suppose my reactions are not better than those of other
speculators but rather just one second quicker. (This may be because of
the flying pigeons I own or quickness of my neurones.) In a world of
uncertainty I note the consequences of each changing event one second
faster than any one else. I make my fortune &#8212; not once, but every day
that important events happen. Would anyone be foolish enough to argue
that in my absence the equilibrium pattern would fail to be
reestablished? By hypothesis, my sole contribution is to have it
established one second sooner than otherwise.</blockquote>
<p>An additional social cost of land speculation was elucidated by
Harry Gunnison Brown (1927). He pointed out that when it is possible
to profit from land speculation, land will tend to be acquired by
those who have the most extreme beliefs about how much it will rise
in value, and that such beliefs will generally be more optimistic
than is warranted. Economists have given the name <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"winner's curse"
</span>(Milgrom &amp; Weber, 1982) to the phenomenon that those who bid
the
most tend to bid too much. The winner's curse can cause the whole
land market to become dominated by persons with extreme beliefs about
future rises in value, creating an artificial scarcity of land for
current use, as those who have land wait for illusory future
opportunities. The winner's curse is thereby shifted to society.</p>
<p>The next section discusses the features of various taxes on land,
and in particular their capacity to remove the incentive for
inefficient land speculation.</p>
<p><a name="III" id="III"></a><b>III. Effects of
Land Taxes on Speculation</b></p>
<p><a name="IIIA" id="IIIA"></a><b>A. Taxes on the
Rental Value of Land</b></p>
<p>The rental value of land is sometimes defined as the net return
from possessing land, after paying the costs of other factors. Such a
definition suffices if land has unchanging opportunities. However,
when the use to which land can best be put varies with the time when
the use begins, such a definition leads to ambiguity regarding the
rent of land at any specified time. This ambiguity can be resolved by
defining the rent of a site as the opportunity cost of leaving it
unused. That is, the rent of a site for the span of time from a to b
is the present value of net returns from use of the site beginning at
a, minus the present value, discounted to time a, from use of the
site beginning at time b (Tideman, 1990). Another way of expressing
this is that the rental value of a site for the year beginning now is
the amount of money that a person would be willing to pay for the use
of the site for one year beginning now, if use carried with it an
option to use the site into the indefinite future, upon payment of
future rent, which would be defined in the same way. To implement
such a recursive definition of rent, there would need to be similar
recurring transactions involving similar land, so that amounts due in
the future could be specified.</p>
<p>The initial effect on the sale value of land of a tax on the
rental value of land (disregarding general equilibrium effects and
the value of any services financed by the tax), is to reduce the
value of all land by the same percentage as the tax rate. That is,
the tax is capitalized into the purchase price of land. It is borne
by those who hold land at the time the tax is announced. Feldstein
(1977) has shown that in a closed economy, a tax on rent can generate
income effects that produce a new equilibrium with higher saving and
lower interest rates, which have an upward effect on land prices,
thereby shifting at least part of the tax. These effects do not arise
in a small open economy, as when a single urban area taxes land.
Furthermore, if the proceeds of the tax are used to finance public
services that add to the value of land, it is possible for those who
hold land to be better off with the combination of taxes and public
expenditures than they would be with neither. In any case, income
effects do not constitute economic distortions. A tax on the rental
value of land has no distorting effects as long as it is assessed in
such a way that there is no action that possessors of land can take
that will increase or decrease their taxes.</p>
<p>The effect on land speculation of a tax on the rental value of
land is to reduce the return from being the one who possesses land
when its improved prospects become known. Less effort will be spent
in seeking to discover what land will rise in value and in seeking to
acquire land in advance of when the rise in value becomes generally
known. Because the winner's curse will be less prominent, less land
will be withheld from development.</p>
<p>With the incentive to speculate in land reduced by taxes on land,
it might be expected that there will be a tendency for land to be
developed prematurely out of ignorance of its future prospects.
However, the land management motive for anticipating transitions
remains. With taxes on the rental value of land, those who
contemplate developing land will have an incentive to discover
whether the land they plan to develop will rise in value, because if
they do not take account of such prospects, they will find themselves
with tax bills higher than they anticipated, and possibly with no
additional revenue with which to pay them. In addition, as long as a
tax on the rental value of land takes only part of the rental value,
potential developers of land will also be motivated to perceive
future opportunities because of the greater profit that can then be
attained from improved development decisions.</p>
<p>The consideration that could lead to premature land development is
that, with a tax on the rental value of land, it will be harder for
those with a special talent for perceiving future opportunities to
profit from that talent. When it is possible to profit from land
speculation, the high price of land informs potential developers of
the future opportunities that other market participants anticipate.
However, if land were taxed so heavily that no one bothered to
speculate, the same information might be conveyed by the development
of a "land value insurance" market, where those with the talent to
perceive future opportunities sold insurance to land developers,
against the possibility that land would rise in value, with a
resulting rise in taxes. But such a market would involve a different
set of transactions costs than the market through which land
speculation provides information about perceived future
opportunities. Information might therefore be transmitted less
efficiently. On the other hand, with land speculation affected by the
winner's curse, there may be significant inefficiency entailed in the
signals that are provided when the land speculation market
functions.</p>
<p>Gaffney (1961, 1973) has suggested an additional reason why taxing
land will improve the efficiency of land development decisions: It
mitigates friction in the lending market. Land, he says, is an
investment that commends itself to investors with low discount rates
and high opportunity costs of their time. It requires little
attention; unlike investments in on-going enterprises, land is
unlikely to fall greatly in value as a consequence of neglect.
Potential users of land, on the other hand, tend to be people who
have above-average discount rates. Because of the combination of
differing capacities of borrowers to offer collateral and the
difficulties in identifying borrowers who will be good risks, an
equilibrium can persist in which competing bidders for land have
quite divergent discount rates. In such circumstances, the taxation
of land ameliorates the variation in discount rates. The
capitalization of land taxes into lower purchase prices constitutes a
substitution of a recurring annual charge for a one-time charge. This
makes land relatively more attractive to people with high discount
rates, and relatively less attractive to people with low discount
rates, shifting land out of the hands of people who will tend to
leave it idle and into the hands of people who will tend to develop
it. Since this circumvents friction in the lending market, the
consequent earlier development of land is more efficient.</p>
<p><a name="IIIB" id="IIIB"></a><b>B. Taxes on the
Sale Value of Land</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A tax on the sale value of land, or
"</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">ad valorem</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">" tax, is a
recurring (e.g., annual or monthly) tax proportional to the price at
which the land would sell.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Ad
valorem</span> taxes on land have been praised
by many economists for the fact that they do not impair incentives to
use land productively. The characteristic of an <em>ad valorem</em> tax that
keeps it from impairing incentives to produce is that, when such a
tax is properly administered, the amount of the tax is independent of
any action taken by the taxpayer. Whatever course of action maximizes
the wealth of a taxpayer before a tax is levied also maximizes his or
her wealth after the tax is levied (apart from income effects, which
do not entail allocative distortions). A taxpayer can reduce the
taxes he or she pays by selling the land, but the new purchaser will
acquire a tax burden of the same magnitude. The total of taxes to be
paid is independent of any reshuffling of land titles among
taxpayers. For this reason, <em>ad valorem</em> taxes on land, like taxes on
the rental value of land, are capitalized into the purchase price of
land and entail no economic distortions.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A tax on the sale value of land is
very much like a tax on the
rental value of land, but with a somewhat different incidence. </span>If
land is not taxed, its sale value in a market in which the
participants foresee the same opportunities can be described as the
present value of future net returns, discounted at the market
interest rate, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">r</span>,
when the land is used in such a way as to maximize
those returns. The effect of an ad valorem tax at an annual rate of <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">t</span>
is to increase the annual holding cost of a dollar's worth of land
from r to r + t. Thus the value of a site in the presence of a tax at
a rate of t is computed by discounting future returns at a rate of r
+ t. The sale price of a site with a net return of x per year falls
from x/r to x/(r + t), so the tax takes the fraction t/(r + t) of the
pre-tax value. Thus for land that is not changing in value, an ad
valorem tax at a rate of t is equivalent to a tax at a rate of t/(r +
t) on the rental value of the land.</p>
<p>If the net return from the use of a site is not constant but
rather grows from an initial value of x at a rate of g, then the sale
value of the site in the absence of a tax is x/(r - g). When the tax
raises the annual holding cost to r + t, the sale price becomes x/(r
+ t - g). The fraction of value that is taken by the tax is t/(r + t
- g). For example, if the tax rate is 4% and the interest rate is 8%,
then the tax takes 1/3 of the value of a site that is not growing,
but 40% of the value of a site whose return is growing at 2% per
year. When paths of returns through time cannot be expressed as
simple growth rates, it continues to be true that, other things being
equal, a site with relatively more attractive future prospects will
bear a higher proportion of current taxes under a tax on the sale
value of land than under a tax on the rental value of land. Thus an
ad valorem tax falls more heavily on land that might be the object of
speculation than on other land. It thus tends to discourage
speculation more than a tax on the rental value of land does.
Otherwise, its effects are the same as those of a tax on the rental
value of land. There is an upper limit of 100% on the feasible rate
of a tax on the rental value of land. There is no such upper limit on
the feasible rate of an <em>ad valorem</em> tax on land. The tax could be 10%
per year or 10% per day or 10% per hour, with the sale value falling
as the rate rose. In the limit as the tax rate of an <em>ad valorem </em>tax
approaches infinity, the tax approaches a tax that takes 100% of the
rental value of the land.</p>
<p>An <em>ad valorem</em> tax is administered by having assessors who estimate
the sale value of land. When tax rates are modest, it is easy enough
for assessors to do this by monitoring sales of land that is vacant
or has only structures that are about to be demolished. However, if
the rate of an <em>ad valorem</em> tax is very high, then the influence of
inherent value of land will be overwhelmed in prices by idiosyncratic
features of transactions between particular buyers and sellers.
Assessors would need to rely on processes in which sale prices were
linked directly to taxes. These could be either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">auctions</span>, where
participants knew that the auction result would be used to set the
tax for a specified period, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">options</span>,
where potential uses of land
offered specified payments for any site meeting certain standards.
Because <em>ad valorem</em> taxes on land have no distorting effects, they
neither retard nor advance the timing of land development in a world
of perfect information. This has been denied by Shoup (1970, p.
38-39), Bentick (1979, pp. 861-63; 1982) and a variety of other
writers who have followed them. The tax that Shoup and Bentick
analyze, however, is not an <em>ad valorem</em> tax, but rather a tax whose
base is the present value of the future net income that is expected
to result from the plans for a site. Thus a change in the plan
produces a change in the tax bill, generating an incentive for
inefficient changes in plans (Tideman, 1982).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">An element of truth in the analyses
of Shoup and Bentick is that
it is possible that while the tax base will be called "land," the
size of the tax bill will in fact vary with land development actions
of the holders of land. If assessors assign a different value to land
if it is developed than if it is not developed, then a tax on land is
not neutral. </span>This may occur in particular if assessors use a "<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">land as
residual</span>" method of assessing sites with old improvements,
estimating
the selling price of land as the difference between the selling price
of the improved site and the undepreciated value of the improvements.
For a tax on the assessed selling price of land to be neutral,
assessors must assess land according to what its sale value would be
if it were bare.</p>
<p><a name="IIIC" id="IIIC"></a><b>C. Taxes on
Realized Income from Land</b></p>
<p>Land can also be taxed according to the income realized from it.
This also reduces the gain from land speculation relative to the gain
from using land. However, a tax on realized income from land does
less to discourage land speculation than taxes on the sale value or
rental value of land, because it imposes no explicit cost on holding
land idle.</p>
<p>Bentick (1979) has argued that a tax on realized income from land
would be neutral because whatever actions would maximize the wealth
of a landholder who received all of the rent would also maximize the
wealth of a landholder who received any specified fraction of the
rent. However, Wildasin (1982) has pointed out that if the rate of a
tax on realized income from land is expected to vary, then there will
be an inefficient incentive to choose development plans that
concentrate income in periods when the tax is low. In addition, there
are significant practical difficulties with a tax on realized income
from land. First, there are problems with taxing land that is used
for consumption purposes by the person who holds title to it. There
will be no transaction incorporating the rent, so the tax either
leaves owner-occupiers untaxed or else requires the services of an
assessor to specify the implicit income. If land is used for
production by those who hold title to it, a different set of problems
arises. It would be necessary to find a way to separate the return to
land from the returns to all other factors that were used. Even if
returns to all other factors were excluded from the tax base, in the
way that labor costs and interest expenses are excluded from the
corporation income tax, there would be virtually no way to exclude
the entrepreneurship of the landholder from the tax base, which could
be expected to induce landholders to economize on the use of
entrepreneurship, to put less effort into securing the greatest
possible net return.</p>
<p>Whether economizing on entrepreneurship results in more rapid or
less rapid land development is not clear. If the choice that a
landholder faced were simply one of when to undertake a given level
of development, then at a time of indifference between developing the
land and postponing development, a tax on entrepreneurship would have
a lower present value if development were postponed. On the other
hand, if the choice were between modest development now and extensive
development later, it is possible that the present value of the tax
on entrepreneurship would be greater with the later development, and
that therefore the tax on entrepreneurship would tilt the decision
toward earlier, less extensive development. In any case, the
inclusion of entrepreneurship in the base of a tax on realized rental
income from land will tend to have adverse effect on the timing of
development, whether it causes earlier or later development.</p>
<p><a name="IIID" id="IIID"></a><b>D. Taxes on
Realized Gains from the Sale of Land</b></p>
<p>A tax on realized gains from the sale of land shares with a tax on
realized income from land the characteristics of imposing no explicit
cost on holding land idle and falling on entrepreneurship as well as
land. It has the additional unfortunate feature of being avoidable by
continuation of ownership. If there were no improvements in the
efficiency of land use that depended on transferring land title, a
tax on gains from the sale of land would have no distorting effects
and would also raise no revenue. To avoid the tax, people would
simply lease land rather than sell it, and no tax would be collected.
The general principle involved here is that if a tax is levied on a
good for which there is an untaxed perfect substitute, everyone will
use the substitute, there will be no welfare losses, and there will
be no tax revenue.</p>
<p>Another set of conditions under which a tax on realized gains from
the sale of land would have no distorting effects is if landholders
were able to obtain a return from land only by selling it, and if
there were no entrepreneurship involved in obtaining the best
possible sale price. A person indifferent between two options
involving different timing of development would be indifferent
between the two when what was received was a constant fraction of the
returns from the two. However, because it is possible to obtain a
return from land not only by selling it but also by using it oneself,
and because entrepreneurship is involved in the sale of land, a tax
on gains from the sale of land will have the effect of reducing sales
and therefore, typically, postponing development. It is also possible
that the prospect of paying the tax would induce a landholder to
undertake a modest, premature development under on his or her own,
when in the absence of the tax the landholder would wait and sell the
land to specialists in development. Whether the development is
advanced or postponed, however, the effect of the tax is to reduce
the efficiency of development.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">In the U.S., a further consideration that
causes development to be
postponed is the possibility of avoiding Federal income taxes on
increases in land value by including the land in one's estate. Estate
taxes are paid according to the actual value of the land (as they
would be paid on the proceeds if the land were sold), but one's heirs
pay taxes only on the increase in value after it leaves the estate,
so that taxes on the increase in value during one's lifetime can be
avoided.</p>
<p><a name="IV" id="IV"></a><b>IV. Indirect
Effects of Taxing Land</b></p>
<p>One consequence of levying additional taxes on land is that it
becomes possible to lower taxes on other things. One of the things
most likely to be taxed less when land is taxed more is improvements.
Lowering taxes on improvements makes the present value of land
development very much less costly, and hence is likely to accelerate
development although it would be possible to construct cases in which
the effect of lowering taxes on improvements would be to postpone
development. Whether it retards or accelerates development, the
lowering of taxes on improvements results in more intensive
development when development occurs. The possibility of promoting
more intensive development by reducing or eliminating taxes on
improvements is an important beneficial effect of an increase in
taxes on land.</p>
<p>A second consequence of levying additional taxes on land is that
it becomes possible to price public services more efficiently.
Services to land such as sewers, water and electricity are used most
effectively when they are priced at marginal cost. The costs of these
services, however, are generally such that the sum of marginal costs
will not cover total costs. Land taxes have the potential to provide
a fund to cover the difference between total costs and the sum of
marginal costs. If land taxes are so used, the reductions in the
costs of using services that complement development will promote more
efficient development.</p>
<p><a name="V" id="V"></a><b>V. Summary</b></p>
<p>There are both speculative and land-management reasons for
spending resources on foreseeing changes in the opportunities to use
land. The speculative reason is purely private, while the
land-management reason is both private and social. Taxation of land
reduces (in the limit, eliminates) the speculative reason for
foreseeing land use opportunities, and thereby eliminates the waste
of resources in seeking to be first to perceive such opportunities.
In the absence of a speculative reason for foreseeing changes in
land-use opportunities, a market might develop in insurance against
changes that would generate land-management losses.</p>
<p>All four taxes analyzed have the beneficial effect of reducing the
waste of resources involved when people seek to be the ones who own
land when its improved prospects become known. Taxes on land also
have the beneficial effect of reducing the extent to which society
suffers from an artificial scarcity of land induced by the winner's
curse. In addition, taxes on land ameliorate the consequences of
capital market imperfections.</p>
<p>The least beneficial taxes on land are taxes on the realized
income from land and on realized gains from the sale of land. They
impose no explicit costs on those who hold land idle, and they tax
entrepreneurship as well as land. A tax on realized income from land
also has conceptual difficulties when applied to those who own the
land they use. A tax on the realized gain from the sale of land has
the unfortunate characteristic of being avoidable by refraining from
transferring land.</p>
<p>Taxes on the sale value and rental of land have no such
unfortunate consequences. Taxes on the sale value of land do the most
to discourage speculation. However, if assessors treat developed land
as if it is more valuable than similar land that is not developed,
there will be an inefficient incentive to postpone development.</p>
<p>A very important effect of taxing land is the opportunity it
provides for removing non-neutral taxes such as those on
improvements. This is highly stimulative of development. A related
stimulative opportunity that is created by taxing land is the
opportunity to provide services such as water, sewerage and
electricity at marginal cost.</p>
<p>If nations that are setting up systems of private possession of
land are concerned about land speculation, the best course of action
is not to seek to regulate or prohibit speculation, but rather to tax
land enough to make speculation not worthwhile.</p>
