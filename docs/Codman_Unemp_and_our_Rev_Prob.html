<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I.&nbsp; The Absurdity of Involuntary
Unemployment<br>
<br>
</span>Whatever may be the real or fancied diversity of interest
between the so-called wage-earning class and their employers the
business men of the country, on one thing at least both sides will
agree, namely: that the curious and chronic phenomenon of involuntary
unemployment is an unmitigated curse.&nbsp; Of this there can be no
doubt whatever among the wage-earners who must sell their labour in a
market overcrowded with competitors for a limited number of jobs; an
among business men there must be few indeed today who really believe
that the opportunity to buy labor cheap because of a scarcity of jobs,
is in any way&nbsp; an adequate compensation for the loss of
purchasing-power which follows from unemployment and the resulting low
wages.&nbsp;&nbsp; When unemployment is acute and wages are low,
business is usually depressed and its profits are uncertain or, all too
frequently for many, entirely absent.<br>
<br>
Assuming, then, that we can all agree concerning the baneful effects of
involuntary unemployment, which, for convenience, I shall hereafter
designate by the one word "unemployment" -- are we not all immensely
interested to discover what maladjustment of our economic system is the
cause of this unnatural phenomenon?&nbsp; For surely it is unnatural
that a man should lack the opportunity to utilize his faculties in
earning a living.&nbsp; Theoretically, under our present form of
government, every individual is free to employ himself in the
production of those things which he needs, or of those things which he
can exchange for&nbsp; what he needs; or, if he prefers, he is free to
sell his labour to others in return for wages by means of which he can
purchase what he needs.&nbsp; Practically, however, the great majority
of our people have no opportunity to produce unless they can find
someone to employ them, and at times there are millions for whom
employers can not be found.<br>
<br>
A vast amount of time and energy is wasted in the endeavour&nbsp; to
secure accurate information concerning the extent, character and
distribution of unemployment with a view to ameliorating it when it is
acute; but it is seldom recognized that if even one able-bodied man is
unable to find an opportunity to use his powers, an unnatural condition
exists.&nbsp; When millions find themselves in such a position it is
plain that the situation is unnatural to the point of absurdity.<br>
<br>
We are accustomed to say that there is no demand for the labour of the
unemployed, but all we can mean by such a statement is that no employer
wants their services.&nbsp; We must admit that there is the same demand
for the labour of every many that there was for the labour of Robinson
Crusoe alone on his island, namely: the need of satisfying his own
wants.&nbsp; Why, then, can not this demand be met?<br>
<br>
Robinson Crusoe needed no employer.&nbsp; He required only that there
be no interference with his use of the natural resources of the
island.&nbsp; Here, then, in this country, where we have natural
resources greatly exceeding the needs of our comparatively scanty
population, where we have all the advantages of modern knowledge
concerning methods of facilitating production in co-operation with our
fellow-men, why should not all of us who are able-bodied and
sane-minded be able to earn an independent living far better than that
to which a Crusoe could aspire, instead of being periodically obliged,
many of us, to walk the streets begging for an opportunity to
work?&nbsp; Such an existence is even worse than the loneliness of a
Crusoe; for it is better to live alone, or nearly alone, as so many
pioneers have done from choice, than to dwell in a society where
opportunity for all to make a living independent either does not exist
or is denied, and where dependence on the charity of others becomes
therefore a necessity.<br>
<br>
Let us face the question.&nbsp; Is the lack of economic opportunity,
evidenced by unemployment for some even in prosperous times and by
unemployment for millions in times of stress, a necessary concomitant
of civilization; or is economic opportunity in some way denied or
abridged in so-called civilized society; and is unemployment,
therefore, but a symptom of economic maladjustment arising from an
artificial cause and hence preventable? &nbsp; If we accept the former
view that unemployment is natural and abiding, then we ought to revise
all our theories of what constitutes virtue.&nbsp; It has been our
habit to praise the individual who through his determination secures a
job, and by his industry and ability holds on to it.&nbsp; But if
unemployment is a natural phenomenon, ought we not instead to admire
the individual who, rather than take a position which some one else
could fill, would prefer to starve to death?&nbsp; To be sure some one
must do the work or the nation can not live, and if no one else can do
a certain job as well as can the reader, for example, it might be
argued that he should hold that job if he can, as a matter of duty to
society.&nbsp; But if the work can be done just as well by another,
does not true altruism require him to step aside and let the other
person do it? &nbsp; That people actually hold this view is shown by
the not uncommon opinion that a person with an independent income
should not render any public or private service with or without pay, or
engage in industry with or without profit to himself, if by so doing he
deprives some needy competitor of an opportunity.<br>
<br>
If unemployment be, in fact, a natural phenomenon of civilization, then
the industry of the individual is not, as we have supposed, for the
good of all, and our industrial system must always remain what to many
it seems to be today, namely: a dog-eat-dog fight for opportunity; a
system in which competition has come largely to mean, not the
competition in service which is properly called "the life of trade,"
but a cut-throat fight for opportunity which can lead to nothing but
selfishness and crime.<br>
<br>
It is difficult, however, even when one faces squarely the facts of
present-day existence, to believe that this curse of unemployment is
natural and will always exist in greater or less degree.&nbsp; But if
it is not natural, then it is artificial&nbsp; and consequently
preventable. <br>
<br>
In further proof that unemployment is an artificial and extraordinary
phenomenon, let us consider in connexion with it some of the glaring
inconsistencies and incongruities which exist in the industrial
organization of civilized society.&nbsp; In the first place, it may be
observed that when civilized nations are engaged in wholesale
destruction of lives and property, the phenomenon all but
disappears.&nbsp; Then the services of the individual are so much in
demand that governments even compel him to labour, and the need of
production for purposes of destruction becomes to great that no one
need be idle or feel himself to be useless, unless perchance he inquire
too closely into the ultimate value to humanity of his
occupation.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when peace returns, the need of the
services of every one to satisfy the manifold needs and desires of all,
seems no longer to exist.&nbsp; Gradually unemployment reappears, then
becomes acute, and what some of us have the colossal effrontery to call
"overproduction" and "surplus products" are once again in evidence,
while millions remain without proper food, clothing and shelter. <br>
<br>
Then also, when the destruction ends and the victorious governments
feel that they must have material indemnification for their losses,
they at once become fearful lest the acceptance of indemnities in any
form may mean unemployment for their people.&nbsp; Thus there begins a
frantic attempt simultaneously to demand and to refuse.&nbsp; The
vanquished must be made to pay, but if they offer to restore the
devastation in the regions of the victors, the offer is refused because
it will deprive the people of the victorious countries of the
opportunity to do it themselves.&nbsp; If goods are offered in order
that the victors may the more easily and quickly restore the
devastation by their own labour, this offer also is refused because it
is only by producing the goods themselves that the victors can avoid or
lessen unemployment.&nbsp; Even the offer of goods in trade, that is,
in exchange for goods produced by the victors themselves, is feared,
lest it injure the industries of their peoples and produce
unemployment.&nbsp; Therefore, up go the tariff-barriers of the
victorious nations.&nbsp; In every so-called civilized country
unemployment is always so dreaded that the government fears to allow
its citizens to accept freely from foreigners either services or goods.<span class="style1"> 1</span><br>
<div class="style2" style="margin-left: 40px;">1See Appendix: "How to Secure the
German Indemnity." for a development of this subject.<br>
</div>
<p><br>
  Undoubtedly, involuntary unemployment is an absurdly artificial
    phenomenon and undoubtedly, therefore, it can be done away with -- but
    how?&nbsp; The tendency of the times is to postpone the solution of
    every question while private and public agencies pile up a mass of
    unrelated and often unimportant statistical information by means of
    which the judgment of the people is confused.&nbsp; It is better to
    depend less upon statistics, which often exaggerate the importance of
    superficial symptoms, and to depend rather more upon the
    reasoning-faculties of the human mind.&nbsp; Then, frequently, the
    truth is found to be obvious and simple.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">II. Robinson Crusoe Up-to-Date</span><br>
  <br>
  If Daniel Defoe were to rewrite in these times his history of Robinson
  Crusoe, he would doubtless be aware of the necessity of altering it
  greatly.&nbsp; In the light of present-day industrial conditions,
    Crusoe's first though after the shipwreck would have been to get a job,
    and his despair in finding himself entirely alone with no hope of an
    employer would be vividly portrayed by the author of his history. <br>
  <br>
  After he had "walked the streets" in vain, however, it would
    undoubtedly have at least occurred to Crusoe, since he was a man of
    unusual ingenuity, that he might just as well be his own
    employer.&nbsp; He would then have hastened back to the wreck, and, as
    he did in the original version of the story, he would have landed what
    stores and tools he found there and with these as his stock in trade
    would have started to do business.<br>
  <br>
  Very soon, however, another question would begin to trouble him,
  namely: how to do business without a landlord; but having already
  overcome one difficulty, his resourceful might would easily surmount
  this second one, and finding that no one interfered with him and not
  seeing any "no trespassing" signs about, he would promptly decide to be
    his own landlord and would hand himself a title to the island by right
    of discovery or conquest.&nbsp; Then at last his modern mind would be
    at rest, and in his own person would be represented all those who share
    in the products of industry under the institutions of
    civilization.&nbsp; He would be, first, the landowner, secondly, the
    tenant and employer of labour, and thirdly, the employee or wage-earner.<br>
  <br>
  When this new version of the story reached the discovery of the
  footprint in the sand, there would be great rejoicing on Crusoe's part,
  not because he would anticipate the arrival of an employer or a
  landlord (all that idea would have been forgotten), but because now he
  would see visions of many tenants from whom he would receive rent, some
  acting as employers and some as wage-earners, and upon whose shoulders
  he would be able to throw the burden of organizing and carrying on
  production.<br>
  <br>
  Since the savages encountered by Crusoe could hardly be expected to
  recognize his title to the island, the story might well continue as in
  the original version, ending with the defeat of the cannibals and the
  release of their prisoner, Man Friday.&nbsp; Then another change in the
    story would be necessary, since, with his modern views, Crusoe could
    not hold Friday as a slave.&nbsp; He would therefore free Friday and
    would offer to rent to him for, let us say, so many cocoanuts, a small
    portion of the island, so that Friday might have at least a place to
    rest his head at night, while during the day he could work on Crusoe's
    estates and thus earn enough cocoanuts to pay the rent, and to buy from
    Crusoe a few of the other things which he (Friday) might need and had
    himself produced.<br>
  <br>
  The social arrangements of the island community would now begin to
  resemble the institutions of modern civilization, but it would require
  the presence of a few more civilized beings to make the resemblance
  really close.&nbsp; This could easily by arranged by supposing that
    another shipwreck had thrown a group of men, women and children upon
    the island.&nbsp; These new arrivals, being assumed to be thoroughly
    civilize, would of course recognize Crusoe's prior title to the island,
    and their first thought, therefore, would be to secure jobs in his
    service, or to rent from him (or even to buy if they had anything to
    offer) some portion of the island.&nbsp; It may be assumed that some,
    at least, of the newcomers would secure leases of the land, if not
    freeholds, and that some of the others, but perhaps not all, would
    secure jobs either from Crusoe or his tenants.&nbsp; Thus very soon the
    society of the island would be capable of some such&nbsp;
  classification as the following:<br>
  <br>
  1. Robinson Crusoe himself, owning the island through right of
    discovery or conquest and living comfortably, without need of labour,
    on the rents received from his tenants.<br>
  <br>
  2. Crusoe's tenants, striving to utilize their opportunities in
  production, often organizing and directing the labor of others, but
  squeezed between Crusoe's demand for all the rent he can get and the
  demands of employees for all the wages they can get.&nbsp; <span class="style2"><br>
  <br>
    </span>3. Those neither owning nor renting land and therefore without
    opportunity to produce except as employees.&nbsp; These hire themselves
    out, when they can, to Crusoe's producing tenants, helping the latter
    to pay Crusoe's rents and receiving their portion of what is left to
    the producers after paying Crusoe. <br>
  <br>
  Now in such a society as this, Crusoe would be in a position to dictate
  to what extent others should use the island for productive purposes,
  and he would expect tribute to be paid to him whenever his permission
  was granted for the use of any part of it.&nbsp; When his demands were
    not too exacting and he was willing to rent even the best locations at
    reasonable prices, his tenants would have the hope of some profit from
    production and would employ many others to assist them.&nbsp;&nbsp; At
    times, however, observing the prosperity of his tenants, Crusoe would
    be tempted to try for a larger share of the product of industry, and by
    demanding higher rents would check business, force it perhaps to be
    carried forward on inferior locations, thus diminishing his tenants'
    ability to employ the labour of others.&nbsp; In such a society
    opportunity to produce would be restricted, unemployment would be
    chronic and at times acute, and the cause of this condition would
    obviously be Crusoe's ownership of the island.<br>
  <br>
  Let us take one step farther in the story of Robinson Crusoe.&nbsp; Let
    us suppose that he has died, that the island is no longer owned by one
    individual, but has, through successive division of estates and through
    sales from time to time, passed into the hands of a considerable number
    of persons who, however, still aggregate but a small minority of the
    whole people.&nbsp; Let us suppose that most of these new owners of the
    island have obtained their holdings by actual purchase and that many
    even have paid too high a price for the privilege and are therefore
  "land poor," that is, are unable to sell what they hold for as much as
    they paid for it.&nbsp; Is there any reason to suppose that the
    economic conditions in the island will be to any material extent
    changed by this division of land-ownership?&nbsp; Not at all; for the
    power to control the use of the island and to exact tribute from the
    producers without rendering any service in return will remain as
    before.&nbsp; Those who own no land will still be dependent on others
    for the opportunity to produce, and the competition of these landless
    persons among themselves will force them to pay high rents or prices
    for land, or to accept the position of employees at low wages, while
    unemployment of a greater or less number will still be a feature of the
    system.&nbsp; In other words, to summarize briefly, those who own the
    island will determine, just as Crusoe did, to what extent its
    productive capacity shall be utilized and how many of the inhabitants
    shall have the opportunity to earn a living.<br>
  <br>
  Now, finally, let us suppose that the people of the island are
  determined to end a state of affairs so unsatisfactory to the great
  majority of present and future generations.&nbsp; What would be the
    best way to proceed?&nbsp; Would it be to dispossess the landowners and
    abolish the system of private property in land?&nbsp;&nbsp; By no
    means.&nbsp; Such a proceeding would be unnecessary and therefore
    unwise.&nbsp; The proper step to take would be obvious as soon as the
    people of the island came to recognize the following principles
    essential to community life:<br>
  <br>
  First, as recognized by every modern State, that the people as a whole
  are sovereign.&nbsp; Second, that therefore the island was in fact the
    property of the whole people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, that individual
    possession of a part of the island was not therefore absolute in its
    nature, but was essentially a privilege conferred on the holders by the
    people as a whole.<span class="style2"><strong><em>2</em></strong></span><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="style2">2 "It is a received and undeniable
principle of law that all lands in England are held immediately by the
King." &#8212; Blackstone.<br>
"The first thing the student has to do is to get rid of the idea of
absolute ownership.&nbsp; Such an idea is quite unknown in English
law.&nbsp; No man in law is absolute owner of his lands, but only holds
estate in them."&nbsp; &#8212; Williams, on Real Property</span><br>
</div>
 <br>
From these principles the conclusion follows that the holders of the
privilege of exclusive possession of land should be required to pay
periodically proper compensation to the people as a whole.&nbsp; It
also follows naturally that this compensation for privilege should be
in proportion to the value of the opportunity afforded and should not
depend upon the use of that opportunity.&nbsp; In other words, he who
utilized his opportunity should pay no more and no less than another
who with equal opportunity failed to make use of it.&nbsp; If this plan
were put into effect, the economic troubles of the island would rapidly
disappear, as it would become distinctly unprofitable for landowners to
withhold valuable opportunities from industry.&nbsp; Since they would
have to pay for their opportunities what they were worth, whether they
used them or not, they could not afford to let valuable opportunities
lie idle.&nbsp; They would be under pressure to employ labour, and if
they were not willing to do so they would feel obliged to rent or sell
their holdings to others who in their turn would employ labour.&nbsp;
Furthermore, this pressure upon landowners would make it impossible to
demand excessive rentals or prices.&nbsp; Thus the inducement to
landowners to restrict or obstruct industry would be removed, while at
the same time the payments for privilege would furnish revenue to the
community to be used for community purposes, thus avoiding the
necessity of penalizing industry by taxation.<br>
<br>
It has been the object of this new version of the story of Robinson
Crusoe to demonstrate that unemployment with all its evil consequences
is certain to exist if private possession of the land and the natural
resources of a State is permitted, unless the power to withhold
valuable land from industry is prevent, by requiring from the holders
an adequate and properly proportionate payment for the privilege of
ownership.&nbsp; To what extent and in what manner is this requirement
met in a modern state?<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">III&nbsp; Securing Payment for
Privilege</span><br>
<br>
The preceding discussion has, I hope, made it clear that unemployment
is an artificial phenomenon, and that it is certain to exist in a
society which invites the restriction of opportunity by permitting
private possession of land without adequate compensation to the
community for the privilege.&nbsp; It has also, I hope, been made
sufficiently clear that the institution of private possession of land,
with its many advantages, is not in itself the cause of unemployment,
and that a system of leasing by the State would have the same result if
the privilege of possession were granted for an inadequate
rental.&nbsp; In either case the use of valuable opportunities would be
denied to industry and chronic unemployment would result.&nbsp; Since,
therefore, there are in the United States enormously valuable economic
opportunities lying idle, and since unemployment is chronic, is it not
possible that this condition may be the result of inadequate payment
for the privilege of possessing land and natural resources?&nbsp; It
would be well to consider just how, if at all, landowners pay for their
privileges and, whether the payments, if any, are made, are adequate
and proportion to value. <br>
<br>
It is true that landowners in the United States do make, in the form of
taxes, a payment to the community.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is also true
that for the privilege of land-ownership as such, no compensation is
required by any government, federal, state or municipal, and that,
therefore, whatsoever payment is made to these governments is merely
incidental to the needs of revenue for governmental purposes.&nbsp; If
no revenue were required, or if revenue were supplied from some outside
source, then no taxes would be levied, and the owners of the land would
hold their privileges without compensating the community and would
therefore be in a position to monopolize opportunity and thus control
the lives of others.&nbsp; That some tax is levied upon landowners may
be looked upon as a sort of happy accident.&nbsp; Since, however, it is
not required as a payment for privilege, but is levied as part of a
general tax on property, there results a great disproportion in the
relation of the amount of tax to the value of the opportunity.&nbsp;
Those landowners who fail to utilize their opportunities&nbsp; pay
relatively little for their privileges, while others, who with no
greater opportunities make use of them in industry or for home
purposes, are required to pay very much more.&nbsp; Thus the
enterprising and industrious are sacrificed to the forestallers of
opportunity.<br>
<br>
For example, in Massachusetts, the holder of unused land is required to
pay only the municipal tax on the supposed market-value of his
holdings, which value, moreover, is usually assessed at too low a
figure for the very reason that the land is unused.&nbsp; On the other
hand, if the owner erects buildings and makes other improvements on his
land, he is taxed by the municipality on all this property as well as
on his land, and at the same rate.&nbsp; Should the owner be a
corporation endeavouring to enter into productive industry, not only
does the corporation have to pay taxes to the municipality on its
buildings, improvements and machinery, but in addition it must pay to
the Commonwealth another property-tax on its "corporate excess," which
is the market-value of its capital stock in excess of the value of its
property locally taxed; and it must also pay to the federal government
a "capital-stock tax" on the market-value of its capital stock in
excess of $5000.&nbsp; If in spite of these penalties on doing business
the corporation can still make a profit and therefore can continue its
productive activities, it becomes subject to still further exactions
levied by the state and federal governments.&nbsp; Principal among
these last are the taxes, state and federal, on net income.<br>
<br>
The following illustration is submitted in order to give some idea of
the amount of these various taxes which a corporation is called upon to
pay as a penalty for using its land for productive purposes, as
compared with the amount it is required to pay if it makes no use of
its opportunity.&nbsp; Let us assume, first, a plot of suburban land
valued at $10,000 and entirely unused, being held perhaps to secure a
profit from its rise in value as the city grows in population.&nbsp;
The only tax levied upon it would be the local tax of perhaps
twenty-five dollars in $1000, or a total of $250 annually.&nbsp; Next
let us assume a similar plot of land of equal value, and therefore
representing an equal opportunity, but in use by a corporation for
manufacturing-purposes.&nbsp; We may, in regard to the corporation's
business, make the following additional assumptions, which seem fairly
reasonable:<br>
<br>

In this illustration the tax on the land without regard to use, which
may be considered the tax on the privilege of possession, is only
$250.&nbsp; The additional taxes levied because of the use of the land
in industry amount to $1305, or more than five times as much.&nbsp;
Thus the practice of withholding land from industry for speculative
purposes is directly encouraged while its use in industry is heavily
penalized.<br>
<br>
The above example is probably not exceptional. There is reason to
believe that the tax on the use of land is in even a greater ratio than
five to one as compared with the tax on the privilege of holding.&nbsp;
Other taxes not paid directly by the corporation in the above
illustration, but which nevertheless discourage industry, are import
taxes on the materials of industry, various stamp and other
miscellaneous excise-taxes and (very important) the income-taxes levied
on the wages and salaries of its employees, on the interest of its
creditors and on the dividends of its stockholders.<br>
<br>
It has been estimated by a committee of the Boston Chamber of Commerce
that in 1920, the taxes, municipal, state and federal, for
Massachusetts amounted to $457 million.&nbsp; But the tax on land
exclusive of buildings in that year was only about $48 million, and
since a portion of that land-tax was laid on improvements other than
buildings, something should properly be deducted from the above figure
of $48 million to arrive at the actual tax levied on the value of sites
without regard to use.<br>
<br>
One need look no farther than the above facts for the cause of
recurring business depression, of unemployment accompanied by low
wages, of poverty, disease and crime.&nbsp; Throughout the country
industry and enterprise are loaded down with taxes and restrictions in
order that those who control opportunity may escape with a trifling
payment for the privilege.&nbsp; Why rail against profiteers and
monopolists when we deliberately encourage monopoly and speculation by
not requiring adequate payment for the holding of opportunities? &nbsp;
Why break our hearts over depression in business and all the horrors
that go with it, when we not only allow the opportunities indispensable
to business to be withheld from use, but in addition ruin business with
the penalties which we impose upon it?&nbsp; That industry accomplishes
what it does under the circumstances is a demonstration of the
remarkable ability of individuals and groups to make headway under the
most difficult conditions and it is an indication of what wonderful
results industry might accomplish if freed from the restrictions of
monopoly and from the blighting effects of governmental penalties.<br>
<br>
Unemployment will remain and business depressions will continue to
occur until those who own the opportunities to produce are required to
pay adequately for the privilege, whether they utilize their
opportunities or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the power to forestall
opportunity in order to get an unearned share of the product of
industry will cease to exist.&nbsp; To secure this payment it is not
necessary to overthrow our institutions, nor is it even necessary to
demand a specific payment for the privilege of land-ownership as
such.&nbsp; If it but come to be recognized that this payment for
privilege ought to be made, it can be readily secured through
taxation.&nbsp; We can tax more fully the ownership of opportunity and
can reduce or abolish the taxation of its use.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IV The Liberation of Industry</span><br>
<br>
Involuntary unemployment appears as the outstanding symptom of economic
disorder in modern civilization, and it rises, as I have shown, from
the general failure to understand that private possession of land and
natural resources can be a socially expedient institution only if the
rights of the public are protected against monopoly.&nbsp; I have also
shown that protection is complete, if those who hold exclusive
possession of land or natural resources are required to pay to the
community adequate compensation for the privilege; and I have stated
that this compensation can be secured through the taxing-power of the
State which is at present exercised in&nbsp; such a manner as to foster
monopoly and penalize every form of productive effort.<br>
<br>
We may appreciate the close&nbsp; connexion between unemployment and
our revenue-problem if we stop to consider that the failure of our
government to secure revenue from the payment for privileges has drive
it&nbsp; into levying intolerable penalties upon industry.&nbsp; So
inured to this by custom have most of us become that we actually
believe that the collection and spending of governmental revenue must
necessarily be destructive of industry and must necessarily raise the
cost of living.&nbsp; This is a fundamental error.&nbsp; The collection
of revenue, when taxes are levied as payment for privileges, serves to
protect industry from the exactions which monopoly is otherwise able to
put upon it.&nbsp; Thus a tax levied on the value of the privilege of
land-ownership, instead of depressing industry and raising the cost of
living, encourages industry by opening up to its use the most
favourable opportunities.&nbsp; It preserves competition, lowers costs
and reduces the cost of living.<br>
<br>
So, also, the spending of governmental revenue should create values
greater than the amount of the expenditure.&nbsp; This, unfortunately,
is not true of our federal government, which spends most of its revenue
in paying for past wars or in preparing for future ones.&nbsp; It is
true, however, to a very great extent of our municipalities, which
spend large sums in public improvements, especially for the cheapening
of transportation; but unfortunately the effect of these improvements
is to increase the value of the land-owning privilege, and therefore
what the people gain in one direction they lose in higher rents.&nbsp;
Here again, an increase in the amount paid for the privilege of
land-ownership would turn these publicly-created values into the public
treasury.<br>
<br>
The confusion of ideas on this subject is particularly well exemplified
by the methods of our municipalities in the collection of revenues, and
especially in the levying of taxes upon real estate.&nbsp; In fact much
of this confusion arises directly from the use of the term "real
estate," under which we combine two things utterly different in
character; one, the land (representing opportunities) the possession of
which is clearly a privilege; and the other, the buildings and other
improvements upon the land, which are equally clearly the result of
human effort in production.&nbsp; To levy a tax upon the former is to
require payment for a privilege.&nbsp; To levy a tax on the latter is
to penalize human industry.&nbsp; The first tax is preventive of
monopoly; the second is destructive of industry.&nbsp; The failure to
recognize these vital distinctions results in a practice of lumping
together as property in real estate the value of the land-owning
privilege and the value of improvements upon land, and levying a tax on
both together.&nbsp; In some of our States it is even unconstitutional
to tax these values at different rates, so complete is the failure to
see that land-ownership is a privilege.&nbsp; But recognition of this
fact must come, and come soon, or there is a grave danger that the
forces of discontent, justifiably aroused but blind to causes and to
consequences, will drive this country into a bureaucratic tyranny or a
bloody and fruitless revolution.<br>
<br>
At the present moment a strong and militant minority of these forces of
discontent is striving for a complete overthrow of the existing
economic order.&nbsp; Apparently without the knowledge that monopoly of
land and natural resources does and must lead to monopoly also of
wealth and credit, it is demanding nationalization of both land and
"the tools of industry" and "the abolition of rent, interest and
profit."&nbsp; Although these confused ideas are not finding general
acceptance, there is nevertheless a widespread desire to penalize
wealth, without regard to its source, by re-enacting the federal
excess-profits tax and by increasing the surtaxes of the federal
income-tax.&nbsp; Many make no distinction between an Astor, growing
rich on the tribute paid by the citizens of New York for the use of
Manhattan Island, and a Ford, profiting by means of his great service
to the community.<br>
<br>
To require heavier payment for the privilege of land-ownership&nbsp;
would be to turn a larger proportion of the ground rental of New York,
a publicly created value, into the public treasury for the benefit of
the whole community, and to make possible the reduction of taxation
which cripples business.&nbsp; On the other hand, taxes on the profits
of the motor-industry, or any other productive industry, do but
discourage business, thus restricting output, increasing costs and
prices and aggravating unemployment.<br>
<br>
The taxation of profits is economically unsound.&nbsp; In so far as
profits are the result of service to the community, a tax upon them
discourages enterprise and industry and is therefore contrary to the
public interest.&nbsp; But in so far as profits are the result of
monopolistic control they can be curtailed or destroyed by the direct
taxation of opportunity as represented by the ownership of land and
natural resources.&nbsp; Thus, if the United States Steel Corporation
is enjoying monopoly profits through its control of ore beds, taxation
of these natural resources will put an end to the Corporation's ability
to withhold them from use and thus restrict output.&nbsp; It will be
obliged to operate these beds or to release them to others who will
then be competitors.&nbsp; But taxation of the operations of the Steel
Corporation, or taxation of its profits without regard to source, will
restrict its operations and add to the cost of steel.<br>
<br>
So also with the coal-mines.&nbsp; Today the low taxes on the
opportunity represented by their ownership make it possible, and in
fact act as an inducement, to let the mines lie idle, thus restricting
output and holding up the price of coal, while the taxes on operation
penalize mining.&nbsp; The State of Pennsylvania levies a tax on each
ton of anthracite mined in the State, which tax is wholly pernicious,
adding directly to price and discouraging mining.&nbsp; If such taxes
as these were abolished, and increased taxes were levied on the
privilege of the ownership of mines, it would be profitable to mine
more coal.&nbsp; The best mines, therefore, would be in full operation;
there would be more men employed; there would be higher wages, few
strikes and cheaper coal. <br>
<br>
"Big business" dominates the industry of the country only through its
control of natural resources -- mines, oil-fields, water power, etc. --
but the great majority of corporations and individuals employing labour
are not part of "big business" and have no such monopoly, and it is a
mistake to suppose that their interest are antagonistic to those of the
wage-earners.&nbsp; Most of them, however, are so oppressed by the
unjustifiable exactions and restrictions of privilege and government
that they are often obliged to oppose the perfectly justifiable demands
of the wage-earners for decent wages and constant
employment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it is now proposed to penalize industry
still further by forcing upon employers the expense of unemployment
insurance, or -- what is even more foolish -- by requiring them to pay
wages to those whom they lay off.<br>
<br>
Employers and wage-earners alike are vitally interested in unhampered
business, and should co-operate to remove taxes and other governmental
restrictions upon it.&nbsp; More important still, they should
co-operate to secure from the holders of opportunity adequate payment
for their privileges.&nbsp; Only thus can industry be freed from the
obstruction of monopoly, and only thus will it become possible in the
future to secure revenue for government without penalizing industry by
taxation. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">V&nbsp; The Nature of Land-Value</span><br>
<br>
In the previous chapters of this book, I have shown that the industry
of the United States (and this applies to the civilized countries in
general) is restricted and obstructed to such an extent that
unemployment with all its accompanying evils is a chronic
condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also shown that this condition is
primarily due to the failure to secure from the holders of land and
natural resources adequate payment for the privilege of exclusive
possession, while at the same time, and as a direct result of this
failure, revenue is collected for governmental purposes by destructive
taxation, of all those engaging in industry including the landowners
themselves.<br>
<br>
It is pertinent now to inquire to what extent it would be wise and
expedient to increase the payments for the privilege of land-ownership,
and in what manner the increase can best be made.&nbsp; In determining
this,&nbsp; it will be of assistance first to imagine a condition
somewhat different from that which actually exists.&nbsp; Let us
suppose that actual title to the land and natural resources of the
country vests in the people as a whole, as represented by their
government, and that when they are required for industrial or
residential purposes, these lands and natural resources are leased for
an annual rental.&nbsp; Under such a system, obviously, the wise thing
to do, in order to protect the interests of all, would be to grant
these leases to those who would pay the community the most for
them.&nbsp; If, for example, a certain tract of land could be leased in
the open market for $7000 a year, the natural thing would be for the
government to charge no less than this sum to the tenant of the
State.&nbsp; But suppose it did otherwise; suppose it charged the
State's tenant only $2000 annually for a tract of land which in his
turn he could sub-let to another for $7000; what would be the
result?&nbsp; The power to secure $7000 annually in ground-rent from a
sub-tenant, while paying to the government only $2000 annually for
exactly the same opportunity, would be a privilege having a net value
of $5000 a year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidently, therefore, the tenant of the
State would find that he had a lease which he could transfer to another
at a premium, which in this case would be approximately equal to the
amount of this net rental of $5000, capitalized at the current rate of
interest.&nbsp; Assuming this rate to be five per cent, this lease
would carry a premium of somewhere near $100,000, and if it were the
regular practice for the State to lease its land for only two-sevenths
of its true ground-rental value, as in the above case, all its leases
would carry premiums having roughly the same proportion to the rental
value; that is, $100 of premium to every seven dollars of ground-rental
value.&nbsp; Such a practice would have tremendously evil consequences
of the nature already described as resulting from inadequate payment
for the privilege of holding land in exclusive possession; and under a
system of leasing by the State, the folly of the policy of renting land
at so much less than its true rental-value would be so obvious that it
would not be tolerated.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless the existing system of land-tenure is essentially no
different, for the peculiar and injurious feature of our system of
so-called private property in land is the small fraction of the rental
value which land-owners are required to pay to the State.&nbsp; As a
result, holding title to land has a money-value, which we speak of as
the value of the land, but which in reality is the value of the premium
which attaches to the title because of the privilege of exemption from
payment of full rental to the State.&nbsp; In fact, as I have already
pointed out in a previous chapter, land-owners are in theory not
required to pay any rental at all for the possession of land; and the
only reason that the State succeeds in collecting any of the rental, is
because it reserves the right to tax as property the value of the
"no-rent" premiums which arise because rent as such is not paid.<br>
<br>
To illustrate the above, let us again take as an example the tract of
land which can be rented in the open market for $7000 and let us
determine what will be the approximate selling price of the tract under
our present system of requiring no rental to be paid by the owner
himself; that is, let us determine the value of the "no-rent" premium
attaching to the title.&nbsp; A prospective purchaser of the privilege
of appropriating $7000 of ground-rent, will have to consider the loss
of interest on funds withdrawn from investment to make the purchase,
and the amount of the tax which he will be required to pay annually on
the value of the privilege when secured.&nbsp; If then the current rate
of interest is five per cent and the rate of taxation is two per cent
($20 per $1000) the prospective purchaser will naturally expect the
ground-rent to be at least 7 per cent of his investment which in this
case, therefore, he will limit to $100,000, of which $7000 is 7 per
cent.&nbsp; In other words, under such conditions, the selling price of
a tract of land having a rental value of $7000 would probably not
exceed but might approximate $100,000.&nbsp; Now the tax on this sum at
the assumed rate of 2 per cent would be $2000, which is two sevenths,
or about 30 per cent, of the ground-rent of $7,000; and this figure (30
per cent) is perhaps fairly representative of average conditions
throughout the United States.&nbsp; If so, it indicates that about 70
per cent of the ground-rental value of the land is not collected for
the benefit of the community, but is being appropriated by the land
owners; and in order to make up this loss of revenue, the various
governments, federal, state and municipal, are obliged to levy all
sorts of pernicious taxes on industry and enterprise.<br>
<br>
The owner of an office-building has business-opportunities represented
by offices which he leases in return for rents which vary in proportion
to the value of the opportunity offered.&nbsp; From these rents he
secures all the revenue which is required to operate the building; and
it is of no consequence to him whether his tenants make good use of
their opportunities or not.&nbsp; If a tenant can not pay the rent, he
is expected to vacate; but as long as the rent is paid, the owner of
the building does not concern himself about his tenant's
business.&nbsp; But now let us suppose that the owner of an
office-building, in disposing of the opportunities represented by
offices, has adopted a system similar to that in use by modern nations
in disposing of the opportunities afforded by exclusive possession of a
portion of the public domain, and that you, the reader, have approached
the owner of the building for the purpose of leasing an office.&nbsp;
In the first place, you will be informed that the owner does not have
any offices to dispose of, or at most only the less desirable
ones.&nbsp; He will tell you that he charges no rent for offices and
that, therefore, those who hold them do not often give them up, even
when they cease to use them themselves, but instead they sub-let them,
or sell title to them at a premium; and that if you wish to secure an
office you will have to find some one ready to rent or to sell and will
have to make terms with him.&nbsp; Should your curiosity then impel you
to ask the owner how he secures the revenue required to operate the
building he will reply somewhat as follows: -- "In the first place, I
ascertain the value of the premium which each office-lease carries
because of the fact that I charge no rent and, by levying a tax upon
this 'no-rent' premium, I collect a small part of the rental value of
the office.&nbsp; As, of course, this does not supply me with enough
revenue to run the building, I raise what more is needed in a number of
different ways, but principally by levying a tax on the value of the
equipment in each office, on the capital invested in the business, and
on the net income derived therefrom.&nbsp; Also, in order that I may
have the necessary information to levy these taxes, I require of each
possessor of an office a detailed statement of his business."&nbsp; The
absurdity of this proceeding is obvious and yet it is the counterpart
of our equally absurd system of land-tenure and collection of revenue. <br>
<br>
The remedy for the situation is to collect a larger proportion of
ground-rent, and there are two ways in which this may be done.&nbsp;
The&nbsp; first is to recognize that a tax on land-value, that is on
the "no-rent" premium which title to land carries, is in effect a
partial collection of ground-rent, or as John Stuart Mill put it, "the
existing land-tax ought not to be regarded as a tax, but as a
rent-charge in favour of the public."<span class="style2"><strong><em>4</em></strong></span>&nbsp; Next, this land-tax or
rent-charge should be increased while actual taxes, properly so called
&#8212; that is, taxes on buildings and other improvements upon land, on
machinery, merchandise, live stock, etc., and on the profits of
industry &#8212; should be reduced.<br>
<div class="style2" style="margin-left: 40px;">4"Principles of Political
Economy,"&nbsp; Book V, Chapter 2, Section 6.<br>
</div>
<br>
This levy of a tax on the no-rent premium is, to be sure, a clumsy
method of accomplishing the desired result, and it would be far better
to require of all land-owners a payment of rent to the community, based
directly upon the potential ground-rental value of their
holdings.&nbsp; Whichever method be used, however, whether a land-tax
or a direct charge as rent, the amount of ground-rent collected for the
benefit of the community should be steadily increased until the
increase accomplishes two results: (1) until it destroys all inducement
to own land for the purpose of forestalling, or monopolizing it; and
(2) until it furnishes sufficient revenue to make unnecessary the
penalizing of industry by taxation. <br>
<br>
Theoretically, the present system of production is based on the
principle of freedom for the individual to produce, and to hold what he
produces as his property.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, therefore, in theory at
least, the antithesis of socialism, which aims to control the
productive activity of the individual and to distribute the product of
industry in accordance with needs.&nbsp; The fault of our present
system does not lie in its theory of individual liberty, but in the
fact that it fails completely to carry out that theory in
practice.&nbsp; We insist on "the right to work," and especially so in
these days of strikes when the labour-unions appear to be interfering
with that right; and we also prate about the sacredness of
property-rights.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, at the same time, we deny the right
to work, by permitting the monopoly of the basic necessities of
industry which are raw materials and land; and we violate the
sacredness of property-rights, by permitting the government to
confiscate the property of the individual through taxation of the
fruits of his industry.<br>
<br>
By increasing the rental charge for the privilege of land-ownership, we
can break monopoly and abolish taxation, and thus bring into agreement
the theory and practice of our system of production.&nbsp; Then we
shall have a system of production in accordance with the principles of
liberty upon which this nation was founded, a system infinitely
superior to any form of socialism which denies the liberty of the
individual.&nbsp; At present, however, we can not boast that any such
superiority to socialism exists.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">VI Taxation of Land-Value</span><br>
<br>
I have shown that a small portion of the rental value of land is
secured for the community by means of the tax levied by all
municipalities upon the market-value of the privilege of
land-ownership, or, in other words, upon the so-called value of
land.&nbsp; I have pointed out that this is a clumsy method of
procedure and that it would be far better to replace these taxes on
land-value by a direct rent-charge for the privilege of land-ownership,
since the nature of the payment would then be unmistakable, and
consequently the desirability of increasing it would be apparent.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, it is probably that the increase which I have shown to be
necessary in the amount of ground-rent to be taken by the community,
will be most easily and quickly secured by an increase in the taxes on
land-value, merely because that method of collecting ground-rent is
already in practical use; and in fact a few localities have already
begun to increase these taxes while simultaneously reducing taxes on
buildings and on improvements to land and other taxes detrimental to
industry.<br>
<br>
If much is to be accomplished in this direction, however, it is certain
that the public must be educated to understand that the tax on
land-value is in truth a payment for a privilege, and is not a tax in
the ordinary sense; that is, it is not a burden on the creative effort
of mankind.&nbsp; That this is not so understood, even by business men
otherwise astute and intelligent, is clear if we consider the widely
prevalent but mistaken believe among such men that all taxes, not
excepting the tax on land-values, can be, and actually are, shifted to
the consumer in the shape of increased prices, and must, therefore
necessarily restrict and hamper business.<br>
<br>
The recent active campaign by business men for the adoption of a
federal sales-tax, which of course would restrict business and increase
the cost of living, was clearly the result of the belief that all taxes
must have these effects but that the sales-tax would be, perhaps, the
least injurious.&nbsp; It is certainly inconceivable that the men
behind this movement to increase prices to their own customers and thus
to restrict their own business, could have had any understanding of the
nature of the tax on land-value, or could have supposed otherwise than
that taxes on land-value, like other taxes, would restrict business and
would be shifted to the consumer. Yet clearly this can not be so, as
the tax on land-value is but a payment for the privilege of exclusive
possession of an opportunity, and is in amount, as I have shown in the
last chapter, but a small proportion of the true rental value of that
opportunity.&nbsp; It is because this payment for privilege is too
small that valuable opportunities are withheld from use and industry is
thereby restricted.&nbsp; To increase this payment, through an increase
in the tax on land-value, will help to free industry; and therefore
instead of raising the cost of living, it will lower it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
It would certainly be ridiculous to imagine that it could be
detrimental to the interests of the community to require a payment for
a privilege conferred by the community.&nbsp; Suppose, for example,
that some individual had acquired the right to draw annually a certain
sum from the public treasury without rendering any service in return,
and that this privilege were transferable.&nbsp; Then, unquestionably,
the privilege would sell in the open market at a premium and might be
taxed as property; but how could such a tax in any way restrict
industry or increase the cost of living?&nbsp; So also with the
land-owning privilege; adequate payment for it merely safeguards the
rights of the community and, instead of discouraging industry, prevents
the monopoly of its indispensable prerequisite.<br>
<br>
To strengthen our conviction that this is true, let us take another
aspect of the question; let us consider what results, under present
conditions, must follow an increase of taxes on land-value.&nbsp; In
every city and town of this country, there is land of very considerable
value which is entirely unused and unimproved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
big cities these values are stupendous, approximating in greater New
York the huge sum of $600,000,000.&nbsp; We are all aware that on such
land there are "carrying charges" to be paid, in the shape of lost
interest and taxes, and that these charges are to some extent a
deterrent from holding land out of use for a long period of time.&nbsp;
It ought, then, to be obvious that if, in spite of these charges, lands
of great value are nevertheless held out of use, then to increase these
charges by increasing the taxes on land-value would be to make the
holders more inclined either to utilize their holdings or to dispose of
them.&nbsp; The resulting competition among them for purchasers or
tenants would cause them to offer their holdings for sale or for rent
at lower prices than they had previously asked, to the great benefit of
industry which could thus secure its prime necessity, land, at a
reduced cost.<br>
<br>
It is often said that taxes on real estate increase house-rents; but a
little consideration will show the falsity of this notion.&nbsp; It is
true that taxes on that part of real estate which consists of buildings
are certain to discourage building and to increase house-rents, but
taxes on the ground upon which buildings must be erected serve to bring
vacant land into the market at lower prices and thus furnish better
opportunities for building-purposes.&nbsp; Thus building is encouraged
and house-rents are lowered.<br>
<br>
It is an unfortunate fact that in most of our States it is either a
constitutional requirement or an apparently unbreakable custom to tax
land and buildings at the same rate, and in consequence it is very
generally imagined that the burden of taxation on real estate is too
heavy and that other sources of revenue must be found.&nbsp; As a
matter of fact it is not true that in any municipality of the United
States, taxes on real estate as a whole are too heavy.&nbsp; The whole
difficulty lies in the above-mentioned requirements of a uniform rate
of taxation on all kinds of real estate, with the result that improved
real estate is over-taxed, while unimproved real estate escapes with
inadequate payments for the privilege its ownership represents.<br>
<br>
For purposes of taxation, real estate should always be separated into
its component parts; that is, land, on the one hand, and, on the other,
buildings and improvements upon the land.&nbsp; While the taxes on the
former should be increased, those on the latter should be
diminished.&nbsp; Actual results from such a policy may be seen in New
York City and in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; In New York, the law exempting new
buildings from taxation for a period of ten years, although grossly
unjust to the owners of old buildings, is nevertheless furnishing an
object lesson in the encouragement of building.&nbsp; In Pittsburgh
also,&nbsp; where the assessment of building of their&nbsp; is
gradually being reduced to fifty per cent of their value, while the
assessment of land is maintained at 100 per cent, building has notably
increased.<br>
<br>
If, however, involuntary unemployment is to disappear, or, in other
words, if restrictions upon the opportunity to produce are to be
abolished and "the right to work" is to be firmly established, this
policy must be carried much farther and all taxes which penalize
industry must be completely done away with, while the tax on
land-value, which is the payment for the privilege of land-ownership,
must be increased not only to the point of providing sufficient revenue
for governmental purposes, but still further if necessary to prevent
the monopoly of the land and raw materials provided by nature for the
use of all.<br>
<br>
The industry of farming is basic, and upon its prosperity depends the
prosperity of all industry.&nbsp; Yet our present blind system of
collecting revenue bears upon it with especial heaviness.&nbsp; The
value of farm land per unit of area is very small, as compared with the
value of urban land.&nbsp; If, therefore, farmers were required to pay
only for the privilege of land-ownership, the total of taxes collected
from them would be much less than now.&nbsp; At present, every
productive effort in farming is destructively taxed.&nbsp; Farmers have
but little property which they can conceal, while every cent spent in
adding to the productiveness of their farms comes promptly under the
eyes of the assessors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything done to increase
fertility -- that is, clearing, draining, irrigating and fertilizing --
is promptly assessed and taxed, as are also all buildings and
improvements to buildings, rolling stock and live stock.&nbsp; Nothing
escapes the&nbsp; destroying hand of the government.&nbsp; To make
matters worse, it is a common practice to assess unused farm land as
much less than its true value.&nbsp; Thus the most important industry
of the nation carries a staggering and wholly unnecessary burden
imposed by the government, while at the same time encouragement is
given to the practice of monopolizing its opportunities.&nbsp; The
results of this policy are what might be expected.&nbsp; Huge amounts
of valuable agricultural lan are held out of use, at times speculation
is rampant, and tenant-farming is steadily on the increase.<br>
<br>
If we seek the industrial salvation of our nation, we must require full
payment for privilege and must stop penalizing industry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">VII&nbsp;&nbsp; The Class-War</span><br>
<br>
In the previous chapters of this book of which this chapter is the
last, I feel that I have made clear that the economic distress of
civilized society is entirely artificial and therefore preventable, and
that it arises from a faulty system of land-tenure which permits the
exclusive possession by individuals of the gifts of nature without
adequate payment for the privilege.&nbsp; For the existence of this bad
system of land-tenure we are all responsible.&nbsp; Therefore it is a
narrow-minded point of view which attributes the ills of society to the
greed or selfishness of any class in the community, unless it can be
shown that there is a class which profits from the present system at
the expense of the community and has both the will and the power to
prevent a change.&nbsp; That there is any such class may well be
doubted.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the system remains unchanged, it is not because
of the opposition of any class selfishly interested in keeping things
as they are; but rather because of the ignorance and apathy of the
great majority of the people who suffer its evil consequences. <br>
<br>
At least we may be certain that neither side in the so-called "class
war" of today gains nothing from the continuance of the present
economic system.&nbsp; This war is between the employers of labour and
their employees; that is to say, between those who organize and direct
the industry of the country and those who take part in it only as hired
help.&nbsp; Both groups alike are wage-earners in the true sense, since
both are utilizing their mental and manual abilities in the production
of wealth; and both alike are necessarily interested in having
production completely untrammelled.&nbsp; Both, therefore, are, or
should be, absolutely opposed to the present economic system which
restricts the use of natural resources and obliges governments to
secure their revenues by means of penalties on production. <br>
<br>
The two sides in the class-war of today are fighting over the division
of the product of industry; and in the heat of battle they are losing
sight of the fact that the amount of this product is greatly reduced
because of the restrictions on the use of natural resources, and
because of the discouraging interference of government.&nbsp; Not only
that, but a large and increasing portion of the product of industry
goes to neither of the belligerents.&nbsp; It is absorbed in the form
of ground-rent by those who hold the privilege of possessing land and
who, as land-owners, contribute nothing to production but merely exact
tribute from it.<br>
<br>
If there be any excuse for a class-war at all, such a war should not be
between the two producing classes, but should be fought with all the
producers on one side, and on the other the landowners who take from
the producers a part of their product without rendering any service in
return.&nbsp; It would be a mistake, however, to attempt to classify
the population into producers and land-owners and to assume an enmity
between them, because so many individuals who are producers are also
land-owners either directly, or through their interest in corporations
as stock-holders or creditors.&nbsp; Even the labourer who lives in
lodgings and has not a foot of land to call his own, but who has a
deposit in a savings bank, may by virtue of that deposit be a landowner.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Furthermore, it can not be assumed that landowners as a class derive
any benefit from the present system.&nbsp; It is true that they can and
do absorb a part of the ground-rent foe which they render no service;
but this privilege of taking ground-rent, carrying with it&nbsp; the
power to interfere with industry and to exact tribute from it, can not
be obtained for nothing.&nbsp; The privilege has a market-value which
is reflected in the price of land, as I indicated in the fifth chapter
of this book, and that price generally offsets any advantage arising
from the privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not always true, of
course.&nbsp; In some cases the purchaser may be lucky enough&nbsp; to
secure his privilege of land-ownership for much less than it is worth,
or after purchase it may greatly increase in value; and because these
things frequently happen, land-owners are frequently led into keeping
land which they do not use, from those who could make good use of it,
in the hope of securing this rise in value.&nbsp; On the other hand,
the purchaser of land often pays more for his privilege than it is
worth, or sees it decrease in value after purchase.&nbsp; It is true
that the price of land on an average is steadily increasing throughout
the country, thus forcing industry to pay more and more for its prime
necessity, but there are comparatively few land-owners who do not
suffer more from the loss in general prosperity which this increase
causes, than they do from the increase itself.<br>
<br>
Doubtless there are in this country certain big interests which are
able to exploit the people through the monopolistic control of natural
resources, and are reaching out for foreign concessions so that they
may also exploit the peoples of other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; But even
those interests are not to be blamed for taking advantage of a system
which encourages their attempts to forestall and monopolize opportunity
and deliberately penalizes legitimate business.&nbsp; In fact there is
no scapegoat upon which the sin of our economic system can be
laid.&nbsp; Nor will the bitterness of feeling and abuse of others lead
to reform.&nbsp; We are in an economic muddle which is to the
disadvantage of all, just as the institution of slavery was to the
disadvantage of all, even though the slave-owners were unable to see
that it was so.<br>
<br>
What is needed now is dispassionate thought and intelligent
action.&nbsp; The belief in an unavoidable class-war makes both of
these things impossible.&nbsp; How prevalent, however, is this idea of
an irrepressible conflict between employers and employees!&nbsp; Not
only is it held by the socialists and communists, who expect the war to
end in a victory for the proletariat and the establishment of the State
as the sole employer of labour; but the idea seems also to be widely
accepted by business men and by the leaders of organized labour.&nbsp;
How pitiably little have the labour-unions accomplished towards the
betterment of the economic position of labour!&nbsp; How little,
indeed, can be expected from organizations which rely mainly on
collective bargaining backed by the destructive strike to raise or
maintain wages, and whose policy has so often included advocacy of
legislation destructive to industry!&nbsp; As long as the
phenomenon&nbsp; of involuntary unemployment continues to exist, the
competition of the unemployed for jobs will operate with irresistible
force to keep wages at a low level; and since strikes can do nothing to
reduce unemployment, their use in industrial disputes can only make
matters worse.<br>
<br>
Among business men there are many who still look upon the employees as
the natural enemies of business with whom it is necessary to wage
constant war in order to keep wages down, forgetting that by doing so
they are destroying the market for their goods.&nbsp; There are many
others with more enlightened views who consider their employees to be
co-workers and expect to get beneficial results through various forms
of welfare-supervision and through profit-sharing and other
co-operative schemes; but they are bound to be disappointed, as long as
they continue to look with equanimity upon the monopoly of the
indispensable requisites of industry and accept as inevitable the
penalties put upon industry by government. <br>
<br>
There is another phase of the question which needs some
discussion.&nbsp; I have previously pointed out that the taxes
collected from the people should be, and by municipalities often are,
expended in such a way as to create land-values; but that these
publicly created values are not taken for the benefit of the
community.&nbsp; Examples of this sort of thing are to be met with
every day.&nbsp; For instance, the following item appeared in the
Boston <span style="font-style: italic;">Herald</span> of 27 August,
1922:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Oxford, 26 August.&nbsp; The tax-rate
for the year 1922 has been set at $52.10 a thousand, more than double
that of last year, $22.50.&nbsp; The assessors explain the tremendous
jump by pointing to a long stretch of cement road, recently laid, and
by referring to the doubling of appropriations at the last town meeting.<br>
</div>
<br>
One cannot be certain from the above that the greatly increased
appropriations of the town of Oxford were wholly due to the building of
a cement road, but one may infer that a very substantial portion at
least was for that purpose, and one may be sure that the road added to
the value of much of the land.&nbsp; But the increased value does not
go to the town.&nbsp; All that the town can get is the right to tax the
increased value at the regular rate of taxation on property.&nbsp; The
bulk of the increase goes to the owners of the land.&nbsp; Thus the
taxes of the town are spent to enrich individuals, and the deficit must
be made up by an increase in the penalties upon industry and homeowning.<br>
<br>
In the same paper, of the same data, appeared the following item:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Real estate in the vicinity of
Wollaston, Savin Hill, and the Neponset water-front will increase
greatly in value upon the completion of Neponset Bridge and the
construction of the proposed Old Colony Boulevard.&nbsp; In
anticipation of increased land-values along the boulevard upon its
completion, many real estate investors are quietly buying up.&nbsp; . .
. As the result of improvements made along the Columbia road boulevard,
South Boston, real estate in that section has almost doubled in value
since 1917.<br>
</div>
<br>
&nbsp;In other words, the taxpayers of Boston invest money in civic
improvements and private individuals take the greater part of the
values thus created; and this sort of thing, we know, is going on all
over the country.&nbsp; How foolish, then, is the idea of a class-war,
when all classes alike continue to support a system so unsound.<br>
<br>
In concluding, I will briefly summarize the situation.&nbsp; Our system
of land-tenure permits the private possession of land without adequate
payment for the privilege; that is, only a small portion of ground-rent
is taken by the community.&nbsp; The right of the land-owner to take
the greater part of ground-rent gives rise to a premium on the title to
all land having any rental value, which premium is the price of the
land, or, in common parlance, its value.&nbsp; From this system, the
following evils are the direct result:<br>
<br>
1. The activities of the people and the expenditure of public revenue
create land-values which in greater part are taken by the
land-owners.&nbsp; Thus public funds are appropriated to private
individuals.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
2. The possibility of rise or fall in land-values makes the possession
of land a speculation, and injects a gambling spirit into industry.<br>
<br>
3. The failure of government to take sufficient ground-rent for the
collective needs of society obliges government to penalize industry and
enterprise with destructive taxes. <br>
<br>
4. (The principal evil result.) The possibility of increase in
land-value, coupled with low taxes for holding land idle and high taxes
on its use, leads to the withholding of valuable land from
use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus economic opportunity is restricted and there is
produced the phenomenon of involuntary unemployment, which in turn is
the underlying cause of low wages, poverty, crime and disease. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Appendix: How to Secure the German
Indemnity5</span><br>
<br>
5Reprinted from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Dial</span>,&nbsp;
April, 1919, through the courtesy of the publishers of that paper.<br>
<br>
Every man who will allow his reason full sway rather than his passions
and emotions, every man who cares more about the restoration of Belgium
and France and the other countries devastated by the Germans more than
he does about punishing the Germans for the devastation, must realize
that the only practical way to secure the great financial indemnity
demanded on behalf of the devastated countries is to set the German
people to work in productive enterprise.&nbsp; There is, however, a
real fear that if this be done the payment of the indemnity may turn
out to be a boomerang injuring those who receive it more than those who
pay it.&nbsp; This fear among the statesmen of the Allied nations is
well expressed by Lloyd George in a speech made at Newcastle on Nov. 29
last, in which he said that Germany must pay the cost of the war up to
the limits of her capacity, and then uttered these words: "But I must
use one word of warning.&nbsp; We have to consider the question of
Germany's capacity.&nbsp; Whatever happens, Germany is not to be
allowed to pay her indemnity by dumping cheap goods upon us.&nbsp; That
is the only limit in principle we are laying down.&nbsp; She must not
be allowed to pay for her wanton damage and devastation by dumping
cheap goods and wrecking our industries."&nbsp; In other words, the
danger appears to be that if the Germans are allowed opportunity to
produce and exchange, their competition will wreck the industries of
other nations, causing unemployment and disaster.&nbsp; Already with
the end of war, unemployment is becoming a serious problem
everywhere.&nbsp; How then can the Germans be put to work without
lessening the opportunities of employment for the peoples of the Allied
nations?<br>
<br>
There is one way, perhaps, of side-stepping the whole question of
giving Germans employment.&nbsp; It can be done by excluding them
altogether, or in part, from access to the natural resources of their
own country and then securing the indemnity by developing those natural
resources by means of Allied and American capital and labour.&nbsp; To
be sure, we could hardly say that under such circumstances the Germans
would be paying the indemnity.&nbsp; They would simply be deprived of
the opportunity to pay; the Allies therefore would have to pay
themselves, merely securing the advantage of free access to Germany's
natural resources.<br>
<br>
In addition, in so far as the Germans were deprived of access to their
natural resources, their mines, their agricultural lands and so on,
they would become unable to help themselves and would therefore starve
or become the objects of Allied and American charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Neither of these alternatives can be considered.&nbsp; On humanitarian
grounds alone the first alternative is out of the question; and
further, in either case, a stupendous army of occupation would be
required to war upon the German people whether the object was to
pauperize them or to starve them.&nbsp; We cannot avoid, therefore,
giving employment to the German people if we desire the indemnity paid,
and the larger the indemnity demanded the greater must be the
opportunities afforded to German labour. <br>
<br>
It might be thought, however, that if German labour must be employed,
then at least it should not be employed for the profit of German
capitalists, but should be employed directly in the service of the
Allied nations; and it might be suggested, therefore, that Allied
capital, or confiscated German capital, or both, should be used in the
employment of Germans in Germany.&nbsp; But to this suggestion of
directly diverting capital to the employment of Germans in German all
the labouring men in every Allied country would protest.&nbsp; They
will insist that, at this time of all times when employment appears to
be scarce, all capital available shall be employed at home. <br>
<br>
Another plan of securing reparation, which has actually been suggested,
is that German labourers shall be forced to go into Belgium and France
and there be made to repair the actual damage done, rebuilding the
shattered cities and towns, repairing the damaged minds, and restoring
the devastated fields.&nbsp; This would look like stern justice to some
people, who fail to consider that the particular Germans forced into
this slavery would almost surely be those least responsible for the
outbreak of the war and the atrocities committed in carrying it
on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Justice aside, however, it is certain that any such
plan would be condemned at once by the labouring classes of the
devastated regions.&nbsp; They would no more permit their jobs to be
taken away from them in this way by Germans than they would permit the
government to use convicts as strike breakers.&nbsp; This plan, too, is
entirely out of the question. <br>
<br>
It appears then that after all it will be necessary to permit the
Germans to exploit their own resources by their own labour and capital;
and that the more quickly and effectively they are able to produce, the
more quickly will the Allies receive the indemnities demanded.<br>
<br>
But does it follow that the Allied nations and ourselves should trade
with the Germans?&nbsp; If it will enable the Germans to produce more
quickly and effectively, it would seem that the Allies ought to allow
trade with them, and we also, if we desire to help the Allies; but if,
as Lloyd George seems to think, the dumping of cheap goods will wreck
British industries, or our industries, then surely we ought to think
twice about it.&nbsp; How to secure indemnity to a nation, without
injuring the nation getting the indemnity, seems in truth to be a real
puzzle despite the apparent absurdity of the idea at first
thought.&nbsp; It may be that Lloyd George, in warning against the
dumping of cheap goods, refers only to the practice of selling goods in
a foreign country at less than the cost of production. &nbsp; This
seems unlikely, however, since any good cheap enough to be imported
from Germany, whether sold at less cost or not, would, if imported,
displace similar goods in the markets of the importing country and
would, therefore, be just as likely to wreck home industries.<br>
<br>
What is more, it would seem that cheap goods from France or Italy or
from this country would also wreck the industries of Great
Britain.&nbsp; If, therefore, Lloyd George is to allow the importation
of such goods, he is in the position of permitting the destruction of
British industries out of deference to his Allies; or if, on the other
hand, the danger from cheap goods is imaginary, he is then in the
position of penalizing the Germans for no reason at all -- with the
result that they will be less able to pay the indemnity.<br>
<br>
In fact, if the cheap goods argument is not a fake, it might be
suggested that a good way for the Allies to deal with Germany would be
to prevent her from exporting anything to the Allied countries and at
the same time to forbid the German government to establish a tariff on
Allied goods imported into Germany.&nbsp; In this way it might be
argued that the cheap goods would go into Germany instead of out, and
thus it would be the German industries that would be wrecked&nbsp;
rather than those of the Allies.<br>
<br>
The first objection to this suggestion is that wrecking German
industries would hinder the payment of the indemnity. Second, however,
and more important, the plan would not work out as above supposed
because if the Germans could not export anything they would have no
means of paying for the imports, and for that reason no imports would
there be.<br>
<br>
To some it would seem that the best plan would be to allow nature to
take its course, or in other words to permit trade between the Germans
and other peoples without governmental interference.&nbsp; It is
certain that if this were done, trade would soon spring up not only
between Germans and English, between Germans and Americans, but also
even between Germans and French.&nbsp; Unless trading is mutually
advantageous to the traders, it will not take place.&nbsp; On the other
hand, if mutually advantageous, nothing will stop it except direct
governmental interference.&nbsp; Perhaps the interference of government
with the trade of its citizens may not always be harmful, but at all
events it is certain that if the Allied governments are all going to
put restrictions on German trade, the Germans will not be able to pay
the indemnity as soon as they otherwise could.&nbsp; Unless they can
import raw materials, their industries cannot prosper, and unless they
can export their manufactures to pay for the imports, then they cannot
obtain the raw materials.&nbsp; They will have to be sufficient unto
themselves, using only their own raw materials which are limited in
character; thus their productive powers will be stunted and the
indemnity will be hard to exact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, too much
economic pressure on the German people will drive them into a bloody
revolution; then all hope of getting reparation for Belgium, France,
Serbia, Poland and Roumania will be gone. <br>
<br>
The conclusion seems to be unavoidable that the Allies ought, for their
own sake, to permit the Germans to exploit their own natural resources
with their own labour and capital, and ought to accord them also
liberal trading privileges in order to increase their productive
power.&nbsp; The Allies might very wisely go even further, however, and
in order to insure that the productive power of the Germans shall be
increased to a maximum, they might dictate to them just how the revenue
required to run the government and pay the indemnity should be
raised.&nbsp; The Allies may well insist that the method adopted be one
that will stimulate productive effort, that will encourage the
enterprising and industrious Germans, and will prevent the monopoly of
economic opportunities.<br>
<br>
This can best be done by making all owners of agricultural land, of
mines, of water power, and of valuable urban sites pay over for the
benefit of the Allied governments as indemnity the full rental value of
the exclusive privileges enjoyed through such ownership.&nbsp; These
payments should not include rental for agricultural improvements, nor
for mine shafts and machinery, nor for hydro-electric installations,
nor for buildings of any kind, but only rental for the privilege of
exclusive access to natural resources.<br>
<br>
Such a plan ought to be welcome to the great mass of the German
people.&nbsp; Sentimentally, it would make little difference to the
factory hands, to the peasants, to the tenant farmers, to the
employers, and to the owners of German capital if the rent which had in
any case to be paid to the discredited Junker and landlord class were
simply passed on to the allies to settle the indemnity.&nbsp;
Practically, however, the plan would be of great advantage to the
productive and enterprising classes, since, in the first place, they
would be relieved of taxation to just the extent that the Junkers had
to pay; and -- what is more important -- access to natural resources
would no longer be open to them only at exorbitant prices, or closed to
them altogether.&nbsp; The power of the land-owning class to withhold
natural resources from use or to demand for their use
industry-prohibiting rentals would be broken.&nbsp; Being obliged to
pay over to the Allies the full rental values of the natural resources,
whether used or unused, the land-owning class would be under the
imperious necessity of renting or selling to the industrious classes,
or of giving them employment.&nbsp; No longer would it pay to own the
land and other natural resources merely to draw tribute from others.<br>
<br>
The plan would redound enormously also to the advantage of the
Allies.&nbsp; With free access to the natural resources and raw
materials of industry, unemployment among the German people would
largely disappear.&nbsp; With the German people all busily engaged in
productive enterprise, the indemnity which the Allied nations desire to
obtain as quickly as possible would be forthcoming in a remarkably
short time, and the fear, moreover, that Germany might become a plague
spot of revolution and anarchy, or be restored to its former autocratic
masters, would soon fade away.<br>
<br>
At this point, however, the reader may protest that if this plan is
carried out, the German people, freed from the shackles of monopoly,
will be on the high road to become the most prosperous and happy people
in Europe, if not in the world -- and this as a reward for their guilt
in bringing on the most criminal assault on civilization in all
history.&nbsp; True, but nevertheless the Allied peoples will have got
what they wanted, namely, quick payment to the people of the devastated
regions and a stable government in Germany, one neither aggressive nor
anarchistic because of the happiness and contentment of its people.<br>
<br>
If, finally, the question arises, how then should the Allied peoples
gain an equal prosperity and contentment, the answer is plain:&nbsp;
Let them, too, destroy the monopoly of their natural resources by
forcing the holders to pay in full for the value of their privileges,
payments not to be made to any foreign governments, but to their own
people.&nbsp; Then the preposterous phenomenon of unemployment will
disappear from among the Allied nations as well as in Germany; the
labouring classes, freed from the competition of the unemployed, will
secure the full value of their labour; and the great captains of
industry, freed from monopolistic exactions, will be able to establish
greater industries than the world has yet seen, in which the savings of
the workers will be invested.<br>
<br>
Then will the time come when a League of Free Nations will be in truth
a permanent reality and the peace of the world will be definitely
assured.<br>
