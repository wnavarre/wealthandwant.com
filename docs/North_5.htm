    <span style="font-weight: bold;">SONG OF THE PRINTING PRESS</span><br>
    <br>
  I am the Printing Press &#8212; Anarch of christendom.<br>
  Breeder of discontent, fomenter of strife, destroyer of hopes and delusions:<br>
&nbsp; I am the thunder and the flash bursting palls of sacred superstition &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; The earthquake sundering anointed forms, <br>
&nbsp; The wind that topples reverent customs,<br>
&nbsp; The flood that drowns creeds and churches &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; I am the sunlight in which men rear new temples, <br>
&nbsp; Gain new illusions, fresh hopes, larger ideals.<br>
  <br>
  I am the Printing Press &#8212; Dooming authority,<br>
&nbsp; Unseating gods and kings, plotting revolutions, stirring to rebellion,
revealing to slaves the chains that bind them:<br>
&nbsp; I am the danger of a little knowledge that precedes more knowledge and
ripens to wisdom:<br>
&nbsp; I am the pain and the ecstacy of quickened growth, the bitterness of knowing,
the pang of disillusion, the dregs at the bottom of the cup:<br>
&nbsp; I am that which is clothing right with might.<br>
  <br>
  I am the Printing Press &#8212; Time's analyst,<br>
&nbsp; Sifting, dissecting, assorting, evading or hiding nothing;<br>
&nbsp; Searching the dark corners, dragging into sunlight the dust of centuries,
the slime of lust, the mold of weakness, the debris of ignorance;<br>
&nbsp; Lending myself to all shams, shames and villainies, to all graces and
divinities:<br>
&nbsp; Culture and crudeness I blazon, faith and doubt unmask, hate and love
mingle, pride and humility, prejudice and sympathy uncover &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; I reveal man to himself.<br>
  <br>
  I am the Printing Press &#8212; The silver thread <br>
&nbsp; That binds the human whole:<br>
&nbsp; I am that Messiah foretold by the prophets. <br>
&nbsp; Buddha and Jesus were my heralds:<br>
&nbsp; I am the resurrection and the life, the cross and the circle, regeneration
and destruction;<br>
&nbsp; I am the trinity of pain, knowledge and growth; <br>
&nbsp; I am the power to roll the stone from the tomb of death and reveal life:<br>
&nbsp; I shall uncover the secret place of the Grail and cleanse all men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To drink from the golden chalice.<br>
  <br>
  I am the Printing Press &#8212; The means and the end <br>
&nbsp;Of external progression &#8212; the journey out and the return.<br>
&nbsp; I shall marry the heart to the head of man &#8212; wed intellect and sympathy,
care and art, purpose and genius, passion and reason, religion and logic, poetry
and usefulness, morality and nature:<br>
&nbsp; I am wearing away the crudities and intensifying the realities &#8212; transmuting
the primitive instincts to finer perceptions:<br>
&nbsp; I am fitting man for his new environment:<br>
&nbsp; I am the prophet of that time when the written word shall be obsolete &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When men shall speak soul to soul.<br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">A PLEA FOR MAN</span><br>
</p>
<p>I plead for Man &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Against the Written Word: <br>
&nbsp; The state and the statute, <br>
&nbsp; Preamble and resolution,<br>
&nbsp; Theology and philosophy,<br>
&nbsp; The fixed belief and the static thought &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Reason's fumbling clutch, logic's icy touch; <br>
&nbsp; Against the sorcery of syllables and <br>
&nbsp; The hypnotism of hyperbole.<br>
&nbsp; Against all the tomb's tentacles <br>
&nbsp;I plead for living men.<br>
  <br>
  I plead for Man &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Against the guns and creeds of Greed <br>
&nbsp; And the black blindness <br>
&nbsp; Of orthodox and infidel<br>
&nbsp; To the law as unbroken as gravity <br>
&nbsp; That the only gain<br>
&nbsp; From the commerce of death machines <br>
&nbsp; Is hate and pain.<br>
&nbsp; Against the world's darkest hour <br>
&nbsp; Of the tradesman's triumph I plead for human beings.<br>
  <br>
  I plead for Man &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Against hell's heresy<br>
&nbsp; That growth and joy and wisdom <br>
&nbsp; Must come thru suffering,<br>
&nbsp; That good lies in the bitterness of strife <br>
&nbsp; And grief is integral in life;<br>
&nbsp; That sweets grow in sour and purity in filth <br>
&nbsp; Or anything of worth accrue to one <br>
&nbsp; By forcing misery on another.<br>
&nbsp; Against the exploiter's creeds of Death and Destruction<br>
&nbsp; I plead for human life.<br>
  <br>
  I plead for Man &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Against God<br>
&nbsp; And all his plutocrats and prophets <br>
&nbsp; And their religions to bind vassals,<br>
&nbsp; Their morals to promote mediocrity, <br>
&nbsp; Their dogma of Rights<br>
&nbsp; To maintain "mine and thine" <br>
&nbsp; Against the human need <br>
&nbsp; And the heart's demand.<br>
&nbsp; Against the glory of God and the gluttony of Greed<br>
&nbsp; I plead for Man!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">SONG OF THE RAILWAY CROSSING </span><br>
  <br>
  Hear the bells at the railway crossing. <br>
  Ding dong, they sound, <br>
  If the wind is right,<br>
  Above the roar of the hastening train <br>
  Of electric cars<br>
  Whirling a hundred passengers <br>
  From the city to their homes.<br>
  <br>
  It's a dangerous crossing. <br>
  The smooth auto road <br>
  Bisects it diagonally.<br>
  Therefore the warning bells &#8212;<br>
Ding dong, they sound, <br>
  When the wind is right.<br>
  <br>
  A dozen people a year <br>
  Were killed here.<br>
  That's why the bells were installed &#8212;<br>
  Cunning electric automatic bells. <br>
  Now the death record <br>
  Is reduced to six.<br>
  <br>
  Hear the bells<br>
  At the dangerous crossing. <br>
  Ding dong, they sound, <br>
  Sometimes,<br>
  Loud and clear above the wind <br>
  And the rushing trains.<br>
  <br>
  Glorious bells! <br>
  Six lives a year <br>
  They save &#8212;<br>
  And six are killed.<br>
  <br>
  Four interurban electric tracks <br>
  Cross the county road here.<br>
  The trolley cars pound along <br>
  At thirty miles an hour,<br>
  The autos glide at twenty-five.<br>
  <br>
  Last night in the wind and rain <br>
  There was a crash!<br>
  Only one was killed <br>
  And one crippled.<br>
  <br>
  Whose life went out? <br>
  Not yours or mine, <br>
  Anyone we know? <br>
  A. B. Smith.<br>
  Never heard of him. <br>
  Read the next item.<br>
  <br>
  What are the bells saying? <br>
  Ding dong, they talk. <br>
  This is their song:<br>
"Cheap skates are we.<br>
  We cost a hundred dollars <br>
  And save the railroad<br>
  And the county the expense<br>
  Of obviating a dangerous grade crossing."<br>
  <br>
"Cheap bells are we,<br>
  As cheap as human life.<br>
  We save dividends for the company <br>
  And every taxpayer Fifty cents."<br>
  Ding dong, ring the bells<br>
  <br>
  At the dangerous crossing. <br>
  One was killed<br>
  And one crippled <br>
  Last night.<br>
  <br>
  Not you or me &#8212;<br>
  Only some stranger.<br>
  <br>
  Taxes are high<br>
  And life is cheap.<br>
  Ding dong, ring the bells. <br>
  Dividends are more than life <br>
  And taxes than a cripple! <br>
  When the life <br>
  Or the limb Is not<br>
  Yours or mine.<br>
  <br>
  All the dividends of the world <br>
  Were not worth my life, <br>
  Or yours.<br>
  But the other fellow's &#8212;<br>
  Ding dong, ring the cheap bells.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
  THAT LOVE BE BOLD</span><br>
  <br>
  That Love should be as bold as Hate &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audacious, fearless<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For light and joy and freedom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Hate is for darkness and pain;<br>
  That Love should dare to seize and hold its own.<br>
  <br>
  For what is all the world's attainment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If pain with growth and knowledge&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep the pace?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While crime and hunger stalk<br>
  What profit all the piety and grace?<br>
  <br>
  That Kindness be as strong as Cruelty &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To mold the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And have its heart's desire;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To kill the thought or thing &#8212;<br>
  Remove whatever bar its way!<br>
  <br>
  For what are all the dreams and ideals <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If love be meek?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If kindness, thought, and care <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gain only &#8212; patience!<br>
  The dream is but a snare if Love be weak.<br>
  <br>
  That Sympathy should outrun Prejudice <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And have its way on earth!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor wait the toilsome centuries' <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blind and groping growth.<br>
  That Sympathy be quick, courageous, true!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">A MAN BELIEF<br>
  <br>
  </span>I believe in Man &#8212;<br>
  In men, women, and children; <br>
  In their welfare,<br>
  Their freedom from exploitation, <br>
  Their opportunity to grow &#8212;<br>
  Every human being's chance <br>
  Freely to develop<br>
  His own Individuality <br>
  Without hindrance <br>
  From Greed.<br>
  <br>
  I believe in Man &#8212;<br>
  In living, breathing human beings <br>
  The "least" or the "worst" <br>
  Of which<br>
  Is more precious<br>
  Than all the minted gold,<br>
  Than any state or government,<br>
  Or any institution or church <br>
  Or property<br>
  The sun ever shone on.<br>
  <br>
  I believe in Man &#8212;<br>
  Every man and every woman <br>
  And every child,<br>
  The raggedest of whom<br>
  Is more to be considered <br>
  Than all the railroads <br>
  And corporations<br>
  And temples and mansions <br>
  And riches<br>
  In the whole wide world!<br>
  <br>
  I believe in Man &#8212;<br>
  Whose Present Hour<br>
  And chance to live a full life <br>
  Now and Here<br>
  Is more than all the Gods <br>
  And theologies &#8212;<br>
  More than all the dreams <br>
  Of superman<br>
  Than all the means and methods <br>
  Of Utopia!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">SONG OF THE HANGMAN<br>
  <br>
  </span>I am the hangman &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Paid to strangle boys, men, women &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Whoever is caught in the snarled meshes <br>
&nbsp; Of the Big Net<br>
&nbsp; Threaded of the vengeful penal code, <br>
&nbsp; Woven by detectives, judges, and lawyers <br>
&nbsp; On the warp of Poverty.<br>
  <br>
  I am the hangman &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;Hired by the Ladies and Gentlemen&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Of wealth, piety, position, and culture<br>
&nbsp; To suffocate their brothers and sisters &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Because ten thousand years ago <br>
&nbsp; Marauding herders imposed "the law" <br>
&nbsp; On conquered peasants.<br>
  <br>
  I am the hangman &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Who throttles the victims of the Net <br>
&nbsp; In an obscure corner of a<br>
&nbsp; Gloomy room in the state prison <br>
&nbsp; Where the moans and curses <br>
&nbsp; Will be hushed<br>
&nbsp; From the delicate ears <br>
&nbsp; Of wives and mothers.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
  But they hear and feel me!<br>
&nbsp; Ill-fed mothers embrace me;<br>
&nbsp; Their unborn babes are mine <br>
&nbsp; When chance calls;<br>
&nbsp; In the womb I brand them. <br>
&nbsp; Vain is your hiding of me &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; All the fearsome and weak are mine,<br>
&nbsp; Whose passions outrun their mentalities,<br>
&nbsp; Whose spleens are more developed <br>
&nbsp; Than their brains!<br>
  <br>
  For I am, the lethal god &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Whose face is hidden in<br>
&nbsp; Clouds of red passion.&nbsp; I am <br>
&nbsp; The god of the abnormal.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; I obsess the weak of will<br>
&nbsp; And possess the perverted.<br>
&nbsp; Into every open ear I whisper <br>
&nbsp; "Murder!" I am<br>
&nbsp; The color red that turns to black &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; And while I live<br>
&nbsp; No soul evades me!<br>
  <br>
  I am the public hangman &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Focus of the world's cruelty, <br>
&nbsp; Cumulous of its hate,<br>
&nbsp; Sum-total of its fear and ignorance. <br>
&nbsp; My days and ways and dreams <br>
&nbsp; Are of blood.<br>
&nbsp; I am he who kills, kills, kills &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; For a monthly wage <br>
&nbsp; Paid by the State.<br>
  <br>
  I am the hangman &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Mercenary descendant, <br>
&nbsp; Of old Judge Lynch,<br>
&nbsp; Whose ways were quick, crude, merciful &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; And I, more often than he did, <br>
&nbsp; Hang the wrong man.<br>
&nbsp; My ways are refined. I am<br>
&nbsp; Cold and mechanical &#8212; the paid ghoul <br>
&nbsp; With critical eye for the long tortures <br>
&nbsp; Of those who wait in the Death Cell.<br>
  <br>
  I am the State's hangman &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; The conscience of every voter,<br>
&nbsp; His malice and savagery.<br>
&nbsp; And I am bolder than he, for <br>
&nbsp; I do what he dare not. <br>
&nbsp; My blood lust is his &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; My courage is my own.<br>
  <br>
  I am the hangman &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; The State's hired butcher of men. <br>
&nbsp; I am the avatar<br>
&nbsp; From dungeons of the Inquisition, <br>
&nbsp; And ye are the mob that gloated.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Long live the lust of blood! <br>
&nbsp; When my trade is gone<br>
&nbsp; Men will cease to kill each other.<br>
  <br>
  I am the hangman &#8212;<br>
&nbsp; Who does the work the judge <br>
&nbsp; Orders but has not the "sand" <br>
&nbsp; To perform.<br>
&nbsp; I am the sign of the incapacity <br>
&nbsp; Of modern people to treat<br>
&nbsp; The crime of murder intelligently. <br>
&nbsp; I am the ignorance and stupidity <br>
&nbsp; Of the Christian mob.<br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE DOCTRINE OF RIGHTS</span><br>
  <br>
  The Doctrine of Rights &#8212;<br>
  Dogma of intolerable wrongs &#8212;<br>
  Wrongs to little children, to nursing mothers, to youth of immaturity, to helpless
  age &#8212;<br>
  The food stolen from their mouths<br>
  And heaped in gluttonous piles around a few greed-blinded inhuman beings &#8212;<br>
  Billionaires who riot in luxury while millions drudge and pinch and go without &#8212;<br>
  Wrongs that Men, real men, courageous men with the natural dignity of a Hottentot,
  the human sympathy of an Apache, the nascent manhood of a wolf or porcupine
  would never tolerate &#8212;<br>
  Babes starving by the thousand<br>
  Children's lives ground out in mine and mill <br>
  Women on the street corners offering their bodies for bread &#8212;<br>
  And we haggle over Rights!<br>
  <br>
  Under the dogma of Rights &#8212;<br>
  The greatest wrongs the world has ever known! <br>
  No one has a Right to anything<br>
  While a child lacks food.<br>
  It is avarice and envy <br>
  That demand their Rights. <br>
  The brave take and leave.<br>
  <br>
  The Doctrine of Rights is a quibble &#8212;<br>
  A dogma of caste<br>
  Artificially dividing<br>
  An invertebrate people<br>
  Who argue and pass resolutions<br>
  While their weaker ones starve <br>
  And broken human lives <br>
  Litter every pathway &#8212;<br>
  In a land of Plenty, in a land of Plenty, in a land of Plenty!<br>
  In a land where all the necessities and luxuries of life<br>
  Are so abundant they choke the warehouses <br>
  And the surplus is destroyed.<br>
  <br>
  The state's Rights<br>
  The church's Rights<br>
  The landlord's Rights <br>
  The army's Rights<br>
  The prison keepers' Rights <br>
  The hangman's Rights<br>
  The millionaire's Rights <br>
  The exploiters' Rights <br>
  The bankers' Rights<br>
  The money lenders' Rights <br>
  The brokers' Rights<br>
  The merchants' Rights <br>
  The employers' Rights<br>
  The brothel keepers' Rights <br>
  The prostitutes' Rights<br>
  The wage earners' Rights <br>
  The people's Rights<br>
  The paupers' Rights &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inalienable Rights!<br>
  <br>
  Up and down the christian earth men &#8212;<br>
  Are we Men? &#8212;<br>
  Prescribing, discovering, balancing, maintaining, defining, defending, enacting
  Our Rights!<br>
  Bench and bar ransack tombs and tomes <br>
  For definitions and precedents<br>
  To establish Rights!<br>
  While a million shop girls sell their bodies for ribbons and bread &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  (Ribbons count more <br>
  Than bread<br>
  With the woman I<br>
&nbsp;would love) &#8212;<br>
  <br>
  And bread and ribbons so plenty <br>
  That the markets are glutted &#8212;<br>
  While men &#8212;<br>
&nbsp;Men?<br>
  Haggle over their Rights!<br>
  <br>
  Prisons, gallows, penal codes, death machines &#8212;<br>
  Ten hundred thousand<br>
  Toiling, slaving, sweating<br>
  Night and day &#8212; dying! &#8212;<br>
  In the munition hells<br>
  To make fiendish contrivances by which living beings are mutilated and murdered &#8212;<br>
  To establish and maintain Rights! <br>
  Whose Rights? &#8212;<br>
  Of the cunning, the stronger, the cruel, the heartless;<br>
  To rob, cheat, kill, debauch, and exploit <br>
  The weaker and the trusting.<br>
  <br>
  All up and down<br>
  The christianized parts of earth <br>
  Spies and detectives<br>
  Are peeping thru keyholes<br>
  Of cabinets and bedchambers <br>
  To uphold Rights!<br>
  And children are dying in the streets <br>
  And men are entombed in mines<br>
  Youth poisoned and life blackened<br>
  In sweatshops &#8212;<br>
  While we haggle over Rights!<br>
  <br>
  The Doctrine of Rights<br>
  Is hell's dogma of servant and master. <br>
  Manhood will cast it out<br>
  And put decency, courage, kindness &#8212; Love! <br>
  A bold defiant daring love <br>
  In its place.<br>
  O have done with the quibbling! <br>
  The world needs Men &#8212;<br>
  The starving children need <br>
  Men To feed them<br>
  Now!<br>
