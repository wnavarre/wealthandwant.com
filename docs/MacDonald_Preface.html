<div style="text-align: center;">Preface to <br>
<a href="Ogilvie_Essay_1782.html">Ogilvie&#8217;s Essay
on The Right of Property in Land</a> <br>
by D.C. MacDonald<br>
edited from <br>
the 1891 Edition of <span style="font-style: italic;">Birthright in
Land</span>, <br>
by George Morton</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Professor Ogilvie&#8217;s Essay was written
between 1776 and 1781, about a hundred years before Mr. Henry George
wrote his <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress
and Poverty</a></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Both authors traversed the sorrowful
jungle of Political Economy, and both discovered &#8220;the central truth.&#8221;
The independent testimony of the one is corroborated by the equally
independent testimony of the other.<br>
<br>
The same truth was revealed to John Locke between the years 1680 and
1690. And is there any doubt that it was seen by Moses, David,
Socrates, and a host of prophets, poets, and philosophers, ages and
ages before?</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Do we not find the Birthright of Man
stereotyped in the words &#8220;OUR FATHER&#8221;? The Faiths of the world, ancient
and modern, whether considered natural or revealed, have all something
in them, in common with genuine Christianity, which declares &#8220;Equality
of Rights&#8221; between man and man.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Whether,&#8221; says Locke,* &#8220;we consider natural reason, which tells us
that men, being once born, have a right to their preservation, and
consequently to meat and drink and such other things as Nature affords
for their subsistence, or &#8216;revelation&#8217;, which gives us an account of
those grants God made of the world to Adam, and to Noah and his sons,
it is very clear that God, as King David says (Psalm cxv., 16), &#8216;hath
given the earth to the children of men,' given it to mankind in common.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1">* Essay on Civil Government.</font></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8220;As much land as a man tills, plants,
improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his
property. He, by his labour, does, as it were, enclose it from the
common.</div>
<br>
<br>
&#8220;God gave the world to men in common; but since He gave it for their
benefit and the greatest conveniencies of life they were capable to
draw from it, it cannot be supposed He meant it should always remain
common and uncultivated. He gave it to the use of the industrious and
rational (and labour was to be his title to it); not to the fancy or
covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious.&#8221; And adds Professor
Ogilvie: &#8220;Nor yet that it should be appropriated in such a manner as
that, when not more than half cultivated, the farther cultivation and
improvement should be stopped short, and the industry of millions
willing to employ themselves in rendering the earth more fertile should
be excluded from its proper field, and denied any parcel of the soil,
on which it could be exercised, with security of reaping its full
produce and just reward.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;This title to an equal share of
property in land&#8221; is declared by Professor Ogilvie to be a &#8220;BIRTHRIGHT
which every citizen still retains.&#8221; We shall see how far he advanced
the question towards the standpoint of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&#8220;The reform&#8221; - says Mr. Henry George -
&#8220;I have proposed . . . is but the carrying out in letter and spirit of
the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence - the
&#8216;self-evident&#8217; truth that is the heart and soul of the Declaration - &#8216;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">That all men are created equal; that they
are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that
among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!</span>&#8217;<br>
<br>
&#8220;These rights are denied when the equal right to land - on which and by
which alone men can live - is denied. Equality of political rights will
not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of
nature. Political liberty when the equal right to land is denied,
becomes, as population increases and invention goes on, starvation
wages. This is the truth that we have ignored.&#8221;</div>
<br>
Such being the disease, what is the cure?<br>
<br>
&#8220;It is necessary,&#8221; says the Philosopher of Pittensear,* &#8220;that the
object to be aimed at, and the means by which it may be obtained,
should be again and again stated to the public in a variety of
speculative views, and so rendered familiar to the understandings of
men.<br>

</font></div>
&#8220;Internal convulsions have arisen in many countries by which the
decisive power of the state has been thrown, for a short while at
least, into the hands of the collective body of the people. In these
junctures they might have obtained a just re-establishment of their
natural rights to independence of cultivation and to property in land,
HAD THEY BEEN THEMSELVES AWARE OF THEIR TITLE TO SUCH RIGHTS, and had
there been any leaders prepared to direct them in the mode of stating
their just claim, and supporting it with necessary firmness and
becoming moderation. Such was the revolution of 1688, at which time,
surely, an article declarative of the NATURAL RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN LAND
might have been inserted in the Bill of Rights, HAD THE PEOPLE AT LARGE
BEEN BEFOREHAND TAUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WERE POSSESSED OF ANY
SUCH CLAIM. Such also was the late convulsion in America (1776), the
favourable opportunities of which are not yet exhausted.&#8221;<br>
<br>
It is interesting, as well as instructive, to notice the harmony that
pervades the writings of these three Apostles of Man's natural right to
independence, his liberty to labour, and his Birthright in land. 
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">John Locke</span> stirred up the
English Revolution of 1688, and in doing so he set a good example to
the rest of the world, and raised his country to a glorious position
among nations. We are only beginning to see this now.&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">William Ogilvie</span> was
neither an idle spectator of the French Revolution of 1789, nor of the
American Revolution of 1776. The man who regarded Revolutions as
&#8220;favourable opportunities&#8221; for restoring the natural rights of mankind
was, like John Locke, a practical philosopher.&nbsp;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mr. Henry George</span>, as a
political philosopher, is equally practical. He is a child of 1776, in
spirit and in truth! He is a Lockist as regards the rights of labour -
labour being the title and also the measure which alone can give to the
individual an exclusive right of property in natural products. And he
is an Ogilvist (which is only a logical development of the Lockist) as
regards man's BIRTHRIGHT IN LAND - the basis of the SINGLE TAX *, and
the door through which LABOUR may freely enter into possession, and
enjoy, not a mere portion of its fruit, which some tyrant may set
apart, but &#8220;its full produce and just reward&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">* The measure proposed in this
book confusingly goes under several
names today - The Single Tax, Land Value Taxation, Community Ground
Rent, etc.. It is the last of these names however - COMMUNITY GROUND
RENT - which most roundly and accurately describes, in modern terms,
the nature of the reform we propose. [Editor].</font></small></div>
<br>
Sad and strange to say, amidst our boasted civilisation, our profession
of the Christian Faith, and our avowed belief in one impartial God, all
knowledge in regard to the just and equal right of mankind to
participate in the bounties of Nature, has hitherto been systematically
boycotted. Until recently, the teacher of such principles was treated
by Law and Order as a dangerous criminal. John Locke had to take
shelter in Holland. William Ogilvie had to conceal himself under a
bushel in Scotland. Many a noble son of Erin had to mount the gallows,
while thousands suffered imprisonment, and millions were exiled from
that unhappy country - a country which is still held like a mangled
corpse in the crocodile jaws of commercial landlordism; and the monster
will not let go its hold except on one condition, namely, to be allowed
to gorge itself with British blood.<br>
<br>
But why not utterly destroy this monster? What better service for our
soldiers, blue-jackets, and policemen, than to employ themselves in
destroying this common enemy of mankind? Parliament could do it, a
royal warrant could do it, the sufferers have a right to do it, nay
&#8220;every man hath a right&#8221; to destroy such monsters. &#8220;In transgressing
the law of Nature,&#8221; says John Locke, &#8220;the offender declares himself to
live by another rule than that of reason and common equity, which is
that measure God has set to the actions of men for their mutual
security, and so he becomes dangerous to mankind; the tie which is to
secure them from injury and violence being slighted and broken by him,
which being a trespass against the whole species, and the peace and
safety of it, provided for by the law of Nature, every man upon this
score, by the right he hath to preserve mankind in general, may
restrain, or where it is necessary, destroy things noxious to them, and
so may bring such evil on any one who hath transgressed that law, as
may make him repent the doing of it, and thereby deter him, and, by his
example, others from doing the like mischief. And in this case, and
upon this ground, every man hath a right to punish the offender, and be
the executioner of the law of Nature.&#8221;*<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>*The renowned George Buchanan,
the great-grand-father of British Liberty, puts it even stronger than
this.</small></font></div>
<p><br>
    The benevolent and magnanimous Professor Ogilvie had this passage
  before him when he wrote the first section of his Essay. In a footnote
  he says: &#8220;It were unjust to censure the proprietors of land, however,
  for retaining and exercising, as they do, a right whose foundations
  have not been inquired into, and whose extent no one has yet
  controverted.&#8221; Then he goes on to explain that ignorance is the root of
  the evil. There were many cases to which the modified doctrine of
  Professor Ogilvie would apply, e.g., the &#8220;humane landlords of England&#8221;
  of his own time, and some of the princes of ancient times, &#8220;who lived
  for the happiness of their people.&#8221; The commercial landlord, who, he
  tells us in the same note, is &#8220;of all citizens the most pernicious,&#8221; who
  burkes all inquiry into the foundations of his right, and who with the aid
  of lawyers and priests, fills the eyes of mankind with the dust
  of ignorance, he would leave to be dealt with in accordance with the
  principles approbated by Locke. We should not degenerate from these
  principles, and it is to be hoped that few readers will grudge the
  references here made to the once famous, but now forgotten - strangely
  forgotten - writings of one of the best of men, and one of the greatest
  philosophers the world ever produced, namely, John Locke.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Ogilvie, who came after Locke, devotes himself in this
  treatise to one subject - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Birthright
  in land</span>, it may be called. And the Author may be justly styled -
  The Euclid of Land Law Reform. He has left little or nothing unsolved
  in connection with the Land Question. He has given us a true base line
  -- man&#8217;s equal right to the raw material of the earth, to the air, to
  the water, to the rays of the sun, and all natural products -- from
  which we can work out any problem, and by which we can test the &#8220;title
  and measure&#8221; of every man&#8217;s property. Resting on this baseline -- man&#8217;s
  natural rights -- he represents to us the perpendicular line of man's
  right to labour, &#8220;with security of reaping its full produce and just
  reward.&#8221; Here we have the question in a nutshell. Take away the base
  line, and you have no right to labour, and no produce or reward, except
  what may be meted out by the usurper of your natural rights. You have
  to beg for leave to toil! We thus see clearly how the robbery of labour
  may be prevented, and how impossible it is to put a stop to such
  robbery while the industrial classes neglect to claim and exercise
  their natural right -- their right to an equal share in the earth, and
  all its natural products.<br>
  <br>
  Strikes against low wages, high rents, unjust taxation, absurd
  conflicts between capital and labour, rebellions against this or that
  form of government, are futile skirmishes, and very frequently are of
  the suicidal cock-fighting order, at which the real enemy, elevated on
  a grand stand, simply laugh. To contend successfully with these evils,
  society must learn to begin at the source thereof. While labourers are
  content to remain deprived of their natural rights, they must pay
  whatever ransom the <a href="../glossary.html">brigands</a> who have
  seized these rights choose to demand. Not only is industry robbed,
  taxed, and crippled, but the brigand, as <a href="../glossary.html">dog-in-the-manger</a>,
  very often puts an entire stop to it, and thus the happiness and comfort of
  millions of mankind, who are willing to work, are curtailed or wholly
  sacrificed, and misery and starvation reign instead. I am somewhat
  afraid to say hard things against brigandage. An institution that is
  still propped up by Law and Order, and supported (or winked at) on
  almost every hand by the avowed servants of Jesus Christ, must be
  touched with a &#8220;gentle hand.&#8221; William Ogilvie has done so in the
  Essay now before us. Although a landlord himself, he did not disregard the
  truth, and it will be found that his pen was guided by an impartial and
  benevolent spirit.<br>
  <br>
  It may be noted that the practical schemes propounded in the Essay,
  were intended only as &#8220;examples and beginnings of reformation,&#8221; to
  use the author's own cautious language, and should be read as such, and in
  the light of the circumstances of his own time. Let the reader then
  peruse once more the close of the Essay, and ponder over the contents
  of the work, comparing his own ideas with those of the author, before
  coming to a hasty decision, and let no scheme for the happiness of
  mankind be rejected without at least attempting to substitute and
  promote a better one. The reader, in applying the author's principles
  to the present time, and having regard to present and future
  circumstances, will find that these principles are not of the hard and
  fast kind, but that they are in accordance with Natural Law, and
  therefore may be accepted as eternal and universal in their application.<br>
  <br>
  When a child is born, we recognise that it has a natural right to its
  mother's milk, and no one can deny that it has the same right to
  mother-earth. It is really its mother-earth, plus the dew and sunshine
  from heaven and a little labour, that supplies the milk and everything
  else required for its subsistence. The monster that would deprive a
  babe of its mother's milk, or would monopolise the breasts of several
  mothers, to the exclusion of several children, is not more deserving of
  being destroyed than the monster who seizes absolute possession of more
  than his share of the common mother of mankind, to the exclusion of his
  fellow-creatures.<br>
  <br>
  Professor Ogilvie&#8217;s Essay is a pastoral prose poem, through which we
  can realise this beautiful world, with its ample provision for
  satisfying man's instinctive and rational faculties of enjoyment. The
&#8220;Sovereign Power&#8221; from which all blessings flow is manifested as
a wise, just, and impartial Creator, who invites us to make His laws our
  laws, and who in these latter days has delegated to us some wonderful
  powers, by which -- with equality of rights and freedom of labour --
  the comforts of this life, and the products of the world, may be
  multiplied more than a thousand fold, purposely (shall we not say?) to
  increase the happiness and virtue of mankind.<br>
  <br>
  The sun never sets, and when one group of workers are retiring to rest,
  on his &#8220;going down,&#8221; another group are rising with him. Light and
  labour thus go their incessant rounds; and so it is with the seasons of
  seed-time and harvest -- the eternal law of revolutions seems to
  regulate all things! Human speech, borne on the mysterious wings of
  thunder, revolves round the earth, and &#8220;man to man the world o'er&#8221; can
  hold instantaneous converse. Man himself revolves round the world,
  carried by his fire-souled amphibious steed from places where he lacks
  food, raiment, or enjoyment, to more hospitable regions. Or he can,
  with magic-like power, cause the superfluous granaries, larders, and
  wardrobes, to move from one side of the globe, to feed and clothe the
  hungry and naked on the other. Nature seems to have decreed -- &#8220;There
  shall be no more famines!&#8221; But although the sun shines ceaselessly, and
  man's labour follows him steadily in his course, the flow of blessings
  which such evolutions naturally produce is polluted and diverted by the
  influence of landlordism, which, like a <a href="../glossary.html">upas
  tree</a>, poisons the surrounding atmosphere, spreads desolation in the
  country, and crowds the town with vice, want, disease, misery, and
  crime, far beyond the power of churches, charities, hospitals, divorce
  courts, and police courts to cure. There is only one cure - &#8220;Cut it
  down: why cumbereth it the ground?&#8221;</p>
