<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
"Living Wage"</span><br>
by Fred E. Foldvary <br>
Senior Editor, The Progress Report</div>
<br>
There is a proposal in San Francisco, California, to
establish a minimum wage of $11 per hour for companies that provide
services or lease land from the city. Those who favor this argue that
the high cost of living in San Francisco warrants requiring this wage
floor so that those workers can afford housing and other living
expenses.<br>
<br>
Starting with Baltimore in 1994, some 30 local
governments in the USA have enacted such "living wage" laws in which
firms which contract with the government pay their workers no less than
the set wage. In San Francisco, the proposed wage of $11 per hour is
almost double the $5.75 minimum wage in California. According to the
"Economic Letter" by economist Rob Valletta published by the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, October 15, 1999, the highest "living
wage" amount is currently San Jose, which requires a wage of $9.50 with
and $10.75 without fringe benefits.
<ul>
  <li>If a company were awarded a contract with a city
without any competitive bidding, then if it is earning monopoly
profits, the higher wage will shift revenue from profits to wages. But
even then, the higher cost of labor will increase the firm's marginal
cost, the extra cost from providing more services. As any student of
economics knows, this extra cost reduces the quantity at which the firm
maximizes profits, resulting in less service to the public. If the
quantity does not go down, then the quality will.</li>
  <li>If the firms obtained the lease or contract by
competitive bidding, then they don't have monopoly profits. The extra
cost of labor cannot be absorbed by the firm's owners, but must be
passed on to the government. The gains obtained by the workers are
offset by losses to the taxpayers, the public, and the unlucky workers
who lose their jobs. Companies will reduce their bids for leased land
and increase their bids for contracted services. The loss of city
revenue will either reduce city services or result in higher taxes.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The least skilled workers will also
suffer. If the
firm must pay $11 per hour, the firm can hire workers whose market wage
is already $11. They have better skills and working attitudes and
habits than those whose pure market wage would be $5.75 or less. Since
firms will tend to hire the more productive workers, the living wage
law will hurt the poorest and least able workers, just those workers
that the law is intended to help.</span><br>
<br>
In addition, workers whose wage is raised from $5.75
to $11 will lose some tax benefits, such as the earned income tax
credit. So their net gain will be less than the gross gain from the
wage increase. The overall loss from higher taxes to the State and
federal governments will result in an outflow of funds and resources
from San Francisco to those governments. So there may not be much
overall net economic improvement for the city.<br>
<a href="Churchill_TPL.html"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If many
workers in the city were to receive a net
increase in wages, this extra money would be a pot of gold for their
landlords.</span></a> 
<ul>
  <li>Those landlords not under rent control would be able to
raise the rents of their low-income tenants, since if the tenant could
afford to live there before the raise, he can also afford it if the
higher rent brings him back to the same after-rent income. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Those
tenants in rent-controlled apartments would get a double subsidy, rent
and wages, increasing the inequality between those with privileges and
those who were not lucky enough to get the government grants.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So the effect of local
"living wage" laws are
    generally higher taxes, higher rents and fewer services for the
    residents, greater inequality, and not that much improvement in the
    well-being of the poorest workers and of the city community.</span> The
    superficial appeal of this programs that only treats the effects of
    poverty dissolves when subjected to economic analysis.<br>
    <br>
    The fundamental reason why the least-able workers
    have low wages is that their labor has a low productivity and that a
    large chunk of their wage is taken away by taxes. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The best remedy is to deal with the root
    cause of the problem: change the school system to raise the educational
    level of the students, and stop taxing wages when earned or spent.
    Shift the tax base from wages to land rent.</span> These reforms would
    raise the pure market wages of the least able workers. Then employers
    would willingly pay the higher wages because the workers are worth it.<br>
    <br>
    Artificial mandates impose costs on taxpayers and
    the public and ultimately are less helpful to the poor than they seem
    at the surface. They are popular only because an ignorant public often
    sees only the superficial surface of policy. What we learn from
    economics is the reality beneath the superficial appearance. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If the public had economic enlightenment,
    it would demand real remedies rather than superficial and ineffective
    nostrums like the "living wage."</span><br>
