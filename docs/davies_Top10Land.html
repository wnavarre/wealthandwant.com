<center><small><small><b>The Top Ten Reasons Why 
Land is More
Important than Ever</b></small></small>
<p>by Lindy Davies </p>
</center>
<p> The <a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/rem0.htm">Georgist
economic proposal</a> insists on the primary importance of land as a
factor in the economy. Many people dismiss that as a quaint, agrarian
notion. "Perhaps," they scoff, "land was that significant back when
most people had to work the soil for a living, but modern agriculture
has moved far past that! Nowadays we deal with modern issues of
technology, global markets, information -- land is no longer a big
deal." </p>
<p> But take another look. This "global information economy"
has by no means liberated itself from the need for a place to stand,
a material to make things out of, and a path to send things on. Such
opportunities can only come from the material universe -- or in other
words, the land (which includes the air, water, and all natural
resources). There's one thing we know for sure about land: they ain't
making any more of it. </p>
<p> Here are ten reasons why land is more economically,
politically and spiritually important than ever before: </p>
<p> <b>10. There's no place to dump your trash for free.</b> The
advent of global environmental problems has, at last, removed the
"frontier" for polluters. There really is no longer any cost-free
place to dump wastes that harm the air, water or soil. We will either
have to pay rent for the increasingly limited space in which to store
these harmful things, or find ways to produce wealth without creating
so many of them. </p>
<p> <b>9. Scratch a financial crisis, find a real estate bubble.</b>
Commentators blame the current Asian crisis on the bursting of an
"asset bubble", which left untold billions in bad loans. The words
"real estate" are often quickly mumbled in these reports -- but what
they're not saying is that every "asset bubble" is blown up primarily
by the speculative value of land. Entrepreneurs were borrowing all
that money that was so recklessly flowing into their countries. The
major part of the collateral for those loans was the galloping price
of their land! But when a "crisis of confidence" set in -- and real
estate owners suddenly realized that they could never sell for
anything near what they'd been asking -- the bubble burst, toppling
stock markets and interest rates in its wake. This process gets
played out again and again - - but like casino gamblers, land
speculators tend never to remember the lesson. </p>
<p><b> 8. Information (like railroads) needs routes.</b> The
information superhighway will link each point to every other point,
supercharging commerce and making location irrelevant -- right? It
could happen... and telecommunications companies are positioning
themselves for it, getting bigger and bigger, trying to guess what
form the finished "superhighway" will take. Will the gigabytes travel
over phone lines? Coaxial cables? Fiber optic lines? Radio
frequencies? Satellite relays? All of them have one thing in common:
they occupy space -- space that is (or will be) owned by someone, and
space for which there is an immense demand (which will only get
bigger). </p>
<p><b> 7. Cities can no longer afford to be inefficient.</b> The last
decade has seen an unprecedented worldwide migration of poor people
to urban centers, in search of economic opportunity. They don't find
it, of course -- and they end up in burgeoning slums that put
ever-greater pressure on overloaded infrastructures. And to raise
desperately-needed revenue, cities place huge tax burdens on
buildings and businesses -- encouraging land speculation and urban
sprawl! Urban land has become the most costly squandered natural
resource in the world today. </p>
<p><b> 6. Global climate change is too likely to ignore</b>. No one
knows for sure whether the bills have already started to come due for
rising sea levels and other climatic havoc, but almost all agree that
they soon will. There is one resource that can serve to ameliorate
the effects of "greenhouse pollution" -- the few large belts of
undisturbed forests that are left. Yet these forests are being
rapidly decimated, to benefit an exceedingly small group of
landowners. </p>
<p><b> 5. The loss of biological diversity cannot be reversed</b>.
Sensible-sounding notions of "intellectual property rights" are
turned on their heads in Orwellan fashion, to allow corporations
exclusive rights to substances and medicines that indigenous peoples
have used for centuries. (Their homes, meanwhile, and ways of life
are wrecked in the process.) </p>
<p><b> 4. Two out of every five people lack a safe and dependable
source of drinking water</b>. Those who "own" the water can charge
what the market will bear. Disputed access to water is one of the
most frequent causes of war. </p>
<p><b> 3. The myth of overpopulation causes cultural sickness.</b> We
continue to hear that the world's poor nations must control their
population growth. Again and again the lie is told that the earth
simply cannot support all these people, that they are doomed by
nature to poverty and hunger. Yet, around the world, huge tracts of
arable land go unused, or are unneccesarily surrendered to
desertification. Still more billions of acres are wastefully devoted
to livestock or animal-feed production. The cruel lie that the earth
lacks enough resources to feed its people forces people to make the
judgement that some people's children -- but not theirs -- simply
shouldn't have been born. </p>
<p> <b>2. We have forgotten what nations are.</b> If, indeed, we ever
knew... As the Cold War dragged on, people became accustomed to the
notion that a nation must fortify itself against an implacable enemy
(on one side or the other) bent on subjugation and conquest.
"National sovereignty" became a contract handed out to a mercenary.
Meanwhile, ethnic and religious groups watched as their ancestral
lands were handed, seemingly arbitrarily, to better-armed or
better-connected rivals. This contemptuous splitting and fracturing
of national identities (along with an obscene largesse of deadly
small arms for every faction) seeded a whirlwind that is now being
reaped on every continent. </p>
<p><b> 1. "The land shall not be sold forever, for ye are strangers
and sojourners with Me."</b> This admonition to the Israeilites by
their God is echoed in every major religion. And it is a perception
that is supported both by common sense and legal tradition. Legally,
"land ownership" is defined in terms of a "bundle of rights" that
attach to the land. These rights -- not the land per se -- are what
gets bought and sold. It really is not possible to own the land. The
most that any person, corporation or nation can do is to secure a
contract for its tenancy and use -- and pay a price for it. If we
actually believe that we own the land, we find ourselves on perilous
spiritual footing -- for we are really equating ourselves with the
land's Creator.</p>
