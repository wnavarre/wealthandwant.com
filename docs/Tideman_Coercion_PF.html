<p><a name="Introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Taxation began as extortion by conquerors. Over the centuries,
regimes that started as tyrannies have evolved into democracies. The
public sector has evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will
of despots into a mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions.
But public finance continues to rely on the power of tax collectors,
developed under early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The
wrath that citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the
strongest antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a
governmental institution. Nevertheless, few economists question the
need for continued reliance on coercion to collect public revenues in
democracies.</p>
<p>How do we justify coercion? Legislators and bureaucrats who devise
coercive tax collection rarely bother to address the question. Nor do
interest groups that promote expansions of the public sector, with
their inevitable accompaniment of higher coercively collected taxes.
Thus coercive tax collection has every appearance of a power play
against the weak by those who have the strength to get away with
it.</p>
<p>We need to reexamine our acceptance of coercion in public finance.
If we are going to continue to rely on coercion, we need to develop a
consensus about the framework that justifies it.</p>
<p>This paper begins with a <a href="#What%20is%20Justice?">definition
of justice</a> and a taxonomy of
theories that might be used to justify coercion in public finance. I
argue that theories based on <a href="#Conservatism">Conservatism</a>,
<a href="#Contractarianism">Contractarianism</a>,
<a href="#Utilitarianism">Utilitarianism</a>, or <a
 href="#Libertarianism">Libertarianism </a>all have value in some
circumstances, but not for justifying the use of power to extract
resources from people. <span style="font-weight: bold;">None of these
theories are consistent with
what we ought to understand justice to be, because they do not accept
the equal standing of all persons in defining what is good. </span>A
theory
of justice that does accept the equal standing of all persons in
defining what is good is <a href="#Liberalism">Liberalism </a>as
elucidated by Bruce Ackerman
(1980).</p>
<p>To oblige people to pay taxes while satisfying the limitations
that Liberalism sets on the use of power, three conditions must be
met:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1. People must be free to emigrate to
any jurisdiction that will
accept them.
<br>
2. If the fraction of natural opportunities claimed by a
jurisdiction exceeds the fraction of population in the jurisdiction,
the jurisdiction must compensate those who would otherwise be
accorded smaller-than-average shares of natural opportunities.
<br>
3. Sub-units of jurisdictions must be allowed to secede, provided
that they are willing to pay appropriate costs. </div>
<p><a name="What is Justice?"></a><b>Justice</b></p>
<p>Begin with what justice is not. Justice is the antithesis of
might-makes-right. A powerful person might say, "This is just because
I say it is just, and if you voice any disagreement I will silence
you," and he might have the power to make his threat stick. However,
he would be misusing language.</p>
<p>Justice entails the recognition by those who have power that the
use of power ought to be constrained by principles whose relevance
does not depend on the views of those with power. </p>
<p>Justice is well represented by the classical figure of the
blindfolded goddess, with scales lifted up in one hand and a sword in
the other. The scales convey the idea of equal division. The
blindfold represents complete impartiality in determinations of what
constitutes equal division. The sword says that there will be power
to ensure that the determinations of justice are carried out. In
other words, </p>
<blockquote>Justice is the evenhanded adjudication of conflicting
claims, backed by the threat of force.</blockquote>
<p>To achieve the impartiality that justice requires, we generally
insist that the person making a judicial determination have no
personal interest in the matter being decided. The maxim that no
person should be the judge of his own case is offered repeatedly in
classical discussions of justice. But in the most fundamental
questions of justice, we have no choice but to abandon this valuable
rule. When it comes to determining the foundations of justice, there
are no disinterested parties. When a person determines what we must
all accord to one another, he determines for himself as well as for
others.</p>
<p><a name="Liberalism"></a><b> Liberalism</b></p>
<p>The lack of disinterested parties to define justice is confronted
in the principles that underlie Liberalism, as set forth by Ackerman
(1980, pp. 4- 12). In Ackerman's Liberalism, every person who
exercises power is obliged to defend his exercise of power with a
consistent set of reasons that do not violate <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Neutrality</span>, which is
the principle that: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">No reason [for exercising power] is a
good reason if it
requires the power holder to assert:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">a) that his conception of the good is
better than that asserted by
any of his fellow citizens, or
<br>
b) that, regardless of his conception of the good, he is
intrinsically superior to one or more of his fellow citizens.</div>
<p>Neutrality blocks the appropriation for oneself of a greater value
of natural opportunities than the per capita value of the natural
opportunities that one leaves for others. In other words, a Liberal
abides by Locke's famous proviso (1960 [1689], pp. 328-29)
that there be "as much and as good left in common for
others."<font size="-1"><b><i>1 </i></b></font>While Ackerman extends
Liberal theory to a wide variety of topics in very interesting ways,
the Liberal analysis of claims to natural opportunities will be
sufficient for discussing the ethics of coercion in public
finance.<font size="-1"><b><i>2</i></b></font> The subsections that
follow evaluate various alternatives to Liberalism for dealing with
the lack of disinterested parties to define justice.</p>
<p><a name="Conservatism"></a><b>Conservatism</b></p>
<p>One way to sidestep the lack of disinterested parties to define
justice is to identify justice with tradition. To the extent that
tradition can be identified unambiguously, it is at least a
disinterested source for justice. Conservatives stress the further
virtue of tradition, that it has passed the test of evolutionary
success. The traditions that we have inherited may have hidden
strengths that we do not discern and would lose if we sought to
design our own institutions.</p>
<p>As valid as these claims for tradition are, they are not
sufficient to make tradition an adequate source for justice. In some
times and places, tradition has given us slavery, serfdom, denial of
voting rights to women, and any number of other inequalities that we
have come to realize we cannot accept. While the Conservative
perspective is valuable for the insights it provides into rationales
for the status quo, its automatic acceptance of tradition cannot
guarantee the evenhandedness that is essential in a theory of
justice.</p>
<p>In rejecting tradition as a fundamental source for justice, we
must also reject the ultimate authority of laws and constitutions as
sources for justice. Justice is the standard to which we hold laws
and constitutions; it is not defined by them. Nevertheless, our
traditions often embody promises that we have made to one another,
which we may need to take into account when we decide how we will get
from where we are to where justice tells us we must be.</p>
<p><a name="Contractarianism"></a><b>Contractarianism</b></p>
<p>A second common way of coping with the lack of disinterested
parties is through Contractarianism. This is the axiom that it is
just to coerce people to abide by rules to which they would have
agreed before they knew how they would be personally affected by the
rules.</p>
<p>There are several theories of justice that employ the
Contractarian axiom. In The Calculus of Consent (1962), Buchanan and
Tullock develop a theory of democratic principles growing out of a
"constitutional setting." In this setting people are presumed to
reach a consensus on rules with the greatest aggregate value, because
they do not know what their roles will be in conflicts to which the
rules will be applied. </p>
<p>The most famous modern application of Contractarianism is John
Rawls' 1971 book, <b><i>A Theory of Justice</i></b>. Rawls argues
that behind a "veil of ignorance" regarding one's personal
characteristics, a person would want the rules that maximized the
well-being of the representative member of the least advantaged
class. To most economists, Rawls' specification of what would concern
people behind a veil of ignorance sounds completely arbitrary and
unfounded. If people are going to be overwhelmingly concerned about
losing in the lottery of life, why would they focus on the
representative member of the least advantaged class and not on the
worst possible individual outcome? Why would people be unwilling to
trade a minute loss by the least advantaged class for a substantial
gain by the second-least advantaged class?</p>
<p>John Harsanyi (1975) argues that behind Rawls' veil of ignorance,
people would not be concerned exclusively with the well-being of the
representative member of the least advantaged class. Rather, they
would recognize that they had equal chances of being all persons, and
therefore, to maximize their expected utility, they would choose the
rules that maximized the sum of individual utilities. The Buchanan
and Tullock framework is consistent with Harsanyi's claim.</p>
<p>Another theory that applies the Contractarian axiom is Ronald
Dworkin's (1981) theory of justice as equality of resources. Dworkin
justifies an income tax as the expression of an insurance policy that
people would desire before they knew their talents. </p>
<p>The fact that people using the basic idea of Contractarianism
could come to conclusions as different as those of Rawls and Harsanyi
is a reflection of a limitation of the axiom. Even if one of them has
it wrong and the other right, the disagreement suggests that the
Contractarian axiom is inevitably too vague and too subject to
self-serving or idiosyncratic interpretations to serve as a basis for
achieving consensus.<font size="-1"><b><i>3</i></b></font></p>
<p>To put the difficulty with Contractarianism in a somewhat
different light, suppose that a person asks, "Why is it just for you
to use your power to deprive me of what I want?" The Contractarian
exercising power responds, "Because you would have agreed to the rule
that deprives you, before you knew what your role in this dispute
would be." The deprived person can respond, "No, not me. I never
would have agreed to that." To justify the deprivation, the
Contractarian must declare that the deprived person is mistaken or
deceitful about that to which he would have agreed. Anything that the
deprived person says about who he is or what has happened in his life
can be declared to be irrelevant to the question of what rules he
would actually have favored in a properly constructed contractual
setting. The flesh-and-blood person asking for a justification of
power goes unanswered. </p>
<p>Contractarianism does have potential value as an organizing
principle for seeking to resolve disputes, because sometimes it will
be possible to persuade a person involved in a dispute that what he
seeks is inconsistent with a rule to which he would have agreed
before he knew his personal role in the particular dispute. But
Contractarianism is dangerously vague as limit on what people with
power accord to themselves. It is too easy to convince oneself that
people would have agreed to whatever you like in the hypothetical
contractual setting.</p>
<p><a name="Utilitarianism"></a><b>Utilitarianism</b></p>
<p>While Utilitarianism is presented above as a version of
Contractarianism, some people might argue for Utilitarianism
independently of any such foundations. If the argument simply begins
with the proposition that aggregate utility should be maximized, then
there is a similar disregard for personhood. A person is then simply
a device for generating utility; whether the utility is for herself
or for someone else is irrelevant. People matter only to the extent
that they are generators of utility. To those seeking explanations of
why it is right for power to be used to prevent them from achieving
their ends, this is just as dissatisfying as explanations based on
hypothetical people in a contractual setting.</p>
<p>The great value of utilitarianism is as an ethical principle for
allocating largess that is rightfully one's to allocate. If a person
must decide whether to allow A to achieve purpose 1 or B to achieve
purpose 2, the judgement that purpose 1 would contribute more to
person A's utility than purpose 2 would contribute to person B's
utility is an excellent reason for deciding in favor of person A. But
justice is not concerned with largess. It is concerned with what is
due to persons just from being persons, without having to prove their
worthiness any further.</p>
<p><a name="Libertarianism"></a><b>Libertarianism</b></p>
<p>Utilitarian and Contractarian theories of justice share the
feature that they do not acknowledge self-ownership. Under
Utilitarianism, persons are inputs into the generation of aggregate
utility. Under Contractarianism, persons might have owned themselves
in the contractual setting, but there they sold themselves. The
rights of real people are gone. Theories in these classes can be
contrasted with a class of theories that justify power with direct
responses to those who question power, treating them as individuals
who own themselves. <b>There are two theories in this class:
Liberalism and Libertarianism. The two theories share the idea of
self-ownership, the idea that each person is free to decide the
purpose of his or her life, provided that the rights of others to do
the same are respected.</b></p>
<p>T<b>he fundamental difference between Libertarianism and
Liberalism concerns the basis for claims to own things. The
Libertarian axiom (Rothbard, 1982, pp. 29-43) is that everything in
nature is the property of the first person who transforms it. This
contrasts with the Liberal axiom (Ackerman, 1980, pp. 11, 31- 68)
that the claims that people make on natural opportunities are
respectable only if the person making the claim leaves as much for
others as she takes for herself.</b></p>
<p>When a Libertarian is asked, "Why should you have that opportunity
instead of me?" he can reply, within his own theory, "Because I got
here first and did something." The Liberal says that any
appropriation of natural opportunities that leaves less for those who
come later fails to satisfy the condition of evenhandedness that is
required for justice.</p>
<p>The Libertarian and Liberal theories both have limitations in
terms of efficiency. Acceptance of the Libertarian theory promotes a
land rush, in which people waste resources doing the minimal work
necessary to establish claims to land, so that they can later sell it
to others. (Whoever burns down the most rain forest gets the most
land.) This first inefficiency is compounded by a continuing
inefficient use of land, arising from the inability of people to
manage all that they have claimed. If the Liberal theory is accepted,
an opposite inefficiency occurs. There is no incentive for people to
seek to discover opportunities hidden in nature, because whatever is
discovered belongs equally to all.</p>
<p>While it may be difficult to avoid having these inefficiencies
color our evaluations of the theories, we should remember that the
pursuit of justice does not guarantee efficiency. It is possible that
a commitment to justice will entail accepting some inefficiency.</p>
<p>The basic problem with the justice of Libertarian theory is that
it allows the first arrivers to deprive those who come later of any
natural opportunities that it suits the first arrivers to claim and
transform. To permit this is inconsistent with the evenhandedness
that justice requires.</p>
<p>A Libertarian might allege that it would never be possible for the
first arrivers to leave as much for all later arrivers as they take
for themselves, because there may be an endless stream of
generations, and each person would be unable to claim even enough
land to stand on. This objection presumes that any claims would be
made on the stock of land, rather than on the flow of land services.
Under Liberalism, each person may respectably claim the use of an
amount of land during her lifetime that leaves as much land rent per
person for others who are alive at the same time as the rent of the
land that the claimant reserves for herself. People may also
respectably reserve more for themselves, if they compensate those who
therefore have less. There will be plenty of room for everyone to
stand.</p>
<p>Libertarianism is an excellent framework for analyzing justice
when there is no scarcity of natural opportunities. But when natural
opportunities are scarce it denies the equal rights of those who come
later.</p>
<p><a name="Justifications" id="Justifications"></a><b>Justifications of
Coercion in Economics</b></p>
<p><a name="Cost-Benefit" id="Cost-Benefit"></a><b>Cost-Benefit
Analysis</b></p>
<p>The most common way that economists justify coercive governmental
actions is through cost-benefit analysis. This is oversimplified
Utilitarianism, and it is subject to the same criticism as
Utilitarianism. If it were pure Utilitarianism, it could be
criticized for treating persons as deserving concern only to the
extent that they generate utility. Being oversimplified, cost-benefit
analysis treats persons as deserving concern exactly to the extent
that they experience financial gains and losses. </p>
<p>Any financial harm to one person can be justified by a financial
gain of a greater magnitude to someone else. It is imaginable that
people in a constitutional setting would agree to a rule that
projects that passed cost-benefit analysis could be financed by
coercive taxes, but this is plausible only if all reasonable efforts
are made to finance projects by taxes whose incidence is in
proportion to the benefits of the project. An suggestion that people
can respectable be coerced to finance projects simply because they
pass a cost-benefit analysis is a mockery of justice.</p>
<p><a name="Social" id="Social"></a><b>Social Welfare
Functions</b></p>
<p>A social welfare function is fancy cost-benefit analysis. If the
social welfare function were defined as the sum of the money incomes
of the members of society, it would be exactly equivalent, and again
subject to the criticism of Utilitarianism. If one accepts
Samuelson's (1947, p. 221) invitation to employ a more general
welfare function specified by some individual, then that individual
becomes a dictator. The evenhandedness required for justice is
completely absent.</p>
<p><a name="Pareto" id="Pareto"></a><b>The Pareto Criterion</b></p>
<p>The Pareto criterion is closely connected to Conservatism. It
declares that there is no way to judge whether one initial allocation
is better than another, while any action that benefits at least one
person and makes no one worse off (How would we know?) is undeniably
good. This implicitly puts questions of the justice of the initial
situation beyond consideration. Unless the initial situation is
subject to scrutiny, there is no justice. </p>
<p><a name="Public" id="Public"></a><b>Public Choice</b></p>
<p>Economists often analyze public decisions as predictable
consequences of self-interest operating in democracy and bureaucracy.
This is fine as positive analysis, but not as normative analysis. As
normative analysis it is an example of Conservatism and has nothing
to do with justice. If one were to declare that an outcome is just
simply because it resulted from democratic process or from procedures
that are consistent with a constitution, that would eliminate any
possibility of scrutinizing the actions of tyrannical majorities or
biased constitutions.</p>
<p><a name="Near" id="Near"></a><b>Near-Unanimity</b></p>
<p>Knut Wicksell (1958 [1896]) offered a theory of public
finance that comes close to justice. He argued that for every
worthwhile public expenditure, there must be an allocation of taxes
to finance the expenditure that would make everyone better off. If
legislatures were required to achieve unanimity to pass spending
programs, then they would have to find an allocation of taxes that
was unanimously acceptable before they could pass a spending program.
Thus majorities would have no opportunity to exploit minorities, and
inefficient proposals would be prevented from passing as well.
Wicksell recognized that if complete unanimity were required,
strategic holdouts would prevent any program from passing, so he was
content to recommend a rule approaching unanimity, without being
specific about what this meant. But any departure from unanimity
means that there must be a Conservative principle at work to justify
coercion, and this opens the door to injustice.</p>
<p><a name="Competing" id="Competing"></a><b>Competing Local
Governments</b></p>
<p>Another economic tradition that comes close to consistency with
justice is the Tiebout (1956) tradition, which is concerned primarily
with efficiency. In the Tiebout tradition, people sort themselves
into communities composed of individuals who have the same
preferences for local public expenditures. They are treated justly
when they are required to pay taxes to finance public goods, because
anyone who is unhappy with his tax bill is free to move to another
community.</p>
<p>The principal difficulty with Tiebout's suggestion as a way of
achieving justice is that it is developed in the context of a world
with an unlimited amount of land. In today's world, people have
little opportunity to form communities that express their own tastes
for public services, because all land is already claimed by some
sovereign nation that specifies the taxes that people who live there
must pay.</p>
<p><a name="Framework" id="Framework"></a><b>A Just Framework
for Taxation</b></p>
<p>Consider how Ackerman's principle of Neutrality constrains a
person who wishes to levy taxes. How can person say to others, "You
must pay these taxes," without violating Neutrality? One possibility
is by permitting emigration. If there were unclaimed land with
natural opportunities as good as those of existing nations, where
those who did not like existing nations could form their own nations,
then a right of emigration would make taxation consistent with
Neutrality. The person who levied taxes would not be claiming more
for himself than he left for others. In fact, the best natural
opportunities are fully claimed. Still, a right of emigration goes
some of the way toward making taxation just. It prevents at least the
worst exploitation of taxpayers.</p>
<p>When the most valuable natural opportunities are fully
appropriated, Neutrality requires that any effort to induce people to
accept an obligation to pay taxes provide an alternative of leaving
the tax-levying jurisdiction while retaining a level of access to
natural opportunities that is no less than the per capita level
within the tax-levying jurisdiction. "Leaving" could mean emigrating,
or it could mean seceding.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way of achieving equal access to natural
opportunities for emigrants is to recognize the requirements that
Neutrality places on relations among nations or their subunits with
respect to claims on natural opportunities. To guarantee equal access
to natural opportunities, governments must acknowledge that their
claims to natural opportunities, that is, their claims to land and
natural resources, are just only if they are not disproportionate to
the number of persons making the claim.</p>
<p>If land were uniform in its economic potential and there were no
depletable natural resources, the application of such a rule would be
straightforward. But land is not economically uniform and there are
depletable natural resources, so the problem of equal access is
conceptually more difficult.</p>
<p>To consider a simple case first, suppose that there is no
disagreement about the relative value of land in different places and
that there are no depletable natural resources. Equal access to
natural opportunities is satisfied if the ratio of aggregate land
rent to population is the same in all jurisdictions. Equal access is
also satisfied if there is a set of transfer payments among
jurisdictions, such that the ratio of the sum of aggregate land rent
and net transfers received to population is the same in all
jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The rent of land in these formulas is not calculated on a
site-by-site basis, but rather on an aggregate basis, under the
assumption
that there are no man-made improvements in the territory being
evaluated. Thus, in asking whether the United States was claiming
more than its share of natural opportunities, one would ask what the
rental value of the territory occupied by the U.S. would be if it
were completely devoid of human improvements and human habitation,
and the only bidders were other nations or their citizens. A similar
calculation would be made for every other nation. Of course there can
be no guarantee of agreement about such valuations, but agreement on
the need to make such estimates and to try to reach consensus on
their magnitudes would constitute enormous progress in global
justice.</p>
<p><b>Next, suppose that there are depletable natural resources.
</b>This raises two new issues: appropriate depletion and
intergenerational equity. Appropriate depletion is depletion on a
path that maximizes the present value of net returns from using a
resource. Devising a set of incentives that identify and achieve
appropriate depletion is not an issue of justice and is therefore
outside the scope of this paper.</p>
<p><b><i>Intergenerational
equity</i></b> requires that the value of natural opportunities
available to the members of all generations be equalized. The value
of depletable natural resources can be shared among generations by
investing the net proceeds of depletion in capital and paying
dividends to all generations. This could be done centrally or by
individual nations. In any case, a determination of whether a
nation's claim to territory is disproportionate requires
consideration of the nation's appropriation of depletable natural
resources as well as its appropriation of sustainable rent.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which harmony is promoted by a world order in
which nations acknowledge an obligation not to make disproportionate
claims on natural opportunities is through the incentives that such
an order generates for nations to amalgamate. </p>
<p>Consider the question of whether the Sri Lankan Tamils will have a
separate nation. If the Tamils have a separate nation, then in
evaluating the proportionality of their territory, one would include
the bids that other Sri Lankans would make for the land that they
occupy. If the Tamils are part of Sri Lanka, on the other hand, only
bids by others would be considered, and these might be considerably
lower.</p>
<p>Within any nation, justice requires equality of access to natural
opportunities among subdivisions. This is achieved by a similar
process. The rental value of any subdivision is evaluated as if the
subdivision were completely unimproved and uninhabited. The potential
bidders would be the citizens of other subdivisions. Because of the
value of proximity to the economic activity in the other
subdivisions, the sum of such valuations would generally exceed the
rental value of the nation. If subdivisions or their citizens claim
rights to extract depletable resources, the opportunity cost of such
extractions is added to the sustainable rental value of the land of
the subdivision. Transfer payments among subdivisions equalize
aggregate rent per person among the subdivisions. This amount is
larger than the amount used to equalize rent per person among
nations, because of the value that each subdivision receives from
proximity to the others. </p>
<p>In the next step, equal access to natural opportunities for each
locality in the subdivision is achieved by a similar process of
evaluation and transfer payments. There is another increase in rent
per person, because of the value that localities receive from
proximity to each other's economic activities.</p>
<p>Finally, at the local level, assignments are made of the rental
value that each parcel of land would have it were unimproved. Land
value per person is yet higher, because of the value that
improvements on one site add to surrounding sites, and transfers
among individuals equalize this value.</p>
<p>The transfers that have been described provide equal access to
natural opportunities, and to the advantages of being near the
economic activities of others. The transfers would also tend to
promote an acceptance of immigration, because with each immigrant
that a jurisdiction accepted, it would gain an added claim on
rent.</p>
<p>While the transfers described above are discussed as if they were
obligatory, justice actually allows them to be discretionary, in the
following sense. If the citizens in a locality share an understanding
of justice that entails some pattern of entitlements or transfers
other than that described, they are free to implement that pattern
among themselves. Anyone who doesn't like it is free to go somewhere
else, where he will have an undiminished claim on natural
opportunities.</p>
<p>Similarly, the localities within a national subdivision are free
to implement a pattern of locality entitlements that differs from the
ones described, provided that they allow any locality to "emigrate."
Since locations do not move, "emigration" here means secession. But
secession is potentially expensive, because of the difference in the
way that entitlements are calculated when membership in larger
entities changes.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that Toronto wanted to secede from Ontario
and become a separate province. As long as Toronto is a part of
Ontario, the group that shares the rental value of Toronto (in an
unimproved condition) consists of all Ontario localities. If Toronto
were to become a separate province, that rental value would be shared
among all Canadian provinces, and a much smaller share would come
back to Toronto. The opportunity to share such rent would be glue
that would tend to bind localities in provinces and provinces in the
nation. But if the pressures to separate ever became great enough,
the right to do so would be recognized. </p>
<p>If localities are permitted to secede from national subdivisions
in place of emigrating, one might ask whether individuals may secede
from nations. The answer is, in principle, yes, but it is likely to
be impractical for them to do so, except on the fringe of
civilization. If an individual who wants to declare himself an
independent nation, the share of rent that he can claim is the land
value per person in the equalization of rent among nations. But,
unless he wants to live on the edge of civilization, he will need
land in the midst of other people, where rents will be very high.
Furthermore, his neighbors would not be treating him unjustly if they
responded to his secession with an economic boycott. Thus it could be
expected that people would not propose to secede in the middle of
existing jurisdictions.</p>
<p>When all individuals and jurisdictions are free to emigrate and to
secede in whatever ways they find practical, and equal access to
natural opportunities for all members of any entity is the default
option from which the entity is free to depart, then any taxes that
are imposed as a condition of continued membership in the entity are
consistent with Neutrality. People really can go somewhere else if
they don't like it, and the equal access to natural opportunities
required by Liberalism is satisfied. </p>
<p>If people were entirely selfish, and if outcomes were dominated by
competition among jurisdictions, then in the Liberal world that has
been described we would see efficient taxes -- on externalities and
on the appropriation of natural opportunities. To the extent that
people have feelings of community and of compassion for one another,
we would find people agreeing to accept obligations to share the
rewards of their efforts with others, though justice could not oblige
them to do so.</p>
<p><a name="Notes"></a><b>Notes</b></p>
<p>1. Whether Locke should be classified as a Liberal is not clear.
He seems to have believe that there was enough unclaimed land in
North America that no one who enclosed land would be diminishing the
opportunity of anyone else to do the same (1960, pp. 334-35). He did
not address the issue of justice in claims on natural opportunities
when those opportunities are limited. </p>
<p>2. It should be noted that some of the conclusions that I reach
from Ackerman's premises conflict with conclusions that he
reaches.</p>
<p>3. For a more detailed argument along these lines, see Ackerman
(1980), pp. 336-42.</p>
