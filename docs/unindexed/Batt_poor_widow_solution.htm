<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>  Rising property taxes, it is often alleged, are driving people out of their
    homes. While parcels rise steeply in market value, and hence their assessed
    value, household incomes often increase only moderately, the result being
    that the burden of paying taxes for the support of municipal services and
    schools is deemed to be both onerous and unfair. Allusion is typically made
    to the &quot;poor widow&quot;<strong><em>1</em></strong> who, on a fixed
    income of a pension and/or social security is compelled to sell her home
    in which she lived for years
    and where she hoped to spend her remaining days.<em><strong>2</strong></em>  Although pundits and
    politicians are often hard put to provide an instance in which this has happened,
    it
    makes for excellent copy, for what greater case of heartlessness can be offered
for relief of property taxes!</p>
<p>  The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) begins its 2002 Report<strong><em>3</em></strong>  on Property Tax Relief for low income and elderly households by stating, &#8220;older
  Americans frequently live on fixed incomes and own their homes. [Therefore]
  in retirement the ratio of property wealth to income tends to rise as income
falls, so the burden of property tax increases.&#8221;</p>
<p>In truth, real property values, and hence taxes where assessments have been
  kept abreast, do cause households to feel an increased burden when contrasted
  with alternate tax regimes such as those on sales and income. But those other
  taxes also have their downsides. This paper is an examination of various solutions
  that have been proposed, even while maintaining the tax on real property. NCSL
  identifies four measures typically employed as a solution to the &quot;poor
  widow&quot; dilemma: property tax caps, the homestead exemption, the circuit-breaker
  program, and the deferral program. All are widely enough employed among the
  fifty states and the District of Columbia that clear lessons should be apparent
  upon examination. It appears, however, that no efforts have been made to do
  comparative analysis of their merits and liabilities or successes and failures;
  rather the studies that exist are for the most part statistical and enumerative.
  Studies are difficult because relief measures have been changing so frequently.
  The data on property values, tax formulas, thresholds and relief measures cannot
  keep up with continually changing economies of which they are apart.<strong><em>4</em></strong></p>
<p>Because political demand for adjustments has become so frequent, this discussion
  does not pretend to be up to date in its tabulation of various state programs.
  It is directed more toward discussion of the administrative, economic, and
  moral issues inherent in their designs. It is intended rather to be an analysis
  and evaluation of such relief measures, and secondly to show how policies can
  be instituted that will accord with both the political demands for mitigation
  and the widely held principles of sound tax theory.<em><strong>5</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Problems with the Conventional Real Property Tax</strong></p>
<p>  Modification of the real property tax as it now exists is difficult because
      it is fundamentally flawed at its base. Several polls show that it is the
      most reviled of all tax regimes,<em><strong>6</strong></em> and much of
      the criticism is warranted. This stems as much from its poor administration
      as from the conceptual
      design of the tax itself, but these flaws can be remedied with better understanding.
      With only slight modification and better management, this tax could be
      the
      most perfect tax of all.<em><strong>7</strong></em> Presently, however,
      it violates all the principles of sound tax theory enumerated since Adam
      Smith.<em><strong>8</strong></em> The property tax,
      as it now exists, violates </p>
<ul>
  <li>the principle of neutrality, because it influences
          and alters decisions from what would occur in its absence;</li>
  <li> the principle of efficiency, to the extent that it, as well as other taxes,
    reduces market performance and economies by the &quot;deadweight loss&quot; it
    generates;</li>
  <li> the principles of horizontal and vertical equity: those in similar circumstances
      don't typically bear comparable obligations, nor are those in different
    circumstances treated in a uniformly commensurate way;</li>
  <li> the principle of administrability, insofar as its management is likely
    to be quickly affected by external forces, and because maintaining adequate
    and
      reliable records is so costly;</li>
  <li> the principle of simplicity, which leads to misunderstanding and opaque
    application, with the consequent loss of its legitimacy; and</li>
  <li> the principle of stability, which requires it to be continually jiggered
      and otherwise modified to provide adequate revenue on which governments
    depend.</li>
</ul>
<p> Inherent in these downside effects is the distortion of locational decisions
  so that land use configurations do not unfold in optimal ways and lead those
  who must make such choices to second best alternatives. The tax creates centrifugal
  forces that foster sprawl development and lead urban cores to be underused
  and neglected.<em><strong>9</strong></em> It leads further to the adoption of costly public incentives
  to negate these tendencies, thus requiring measures that favor select constituencies
  and thereby raise the tax burdens on others to pay for them.</p>
<p> These liabilities' only saving grace, goes the argument, is that alternative
  revenue designs suffer from even more egregious flaws. Many tax designers maintain
  that all taxes have their defects, and we must therefore rely upon several
  revenue streams to ensure and stabilize support for public services. I have
  elsewhere challenged this claim, and I urge us to scrutinize the property tax
  more closely both in its dynamics and its impact.<em><strong>10</strong></em> If
  we are to fix the problems inherent in our tax structure, the property tax
  as well as others, we have
  to look at the economy systemically, not with ad hoc patchwork remedies as
  crises arise. The biggest problem stems from the belief that the economy would
  operate with maximum efficiency and productivity if only taxes didn't exert
  a leaden influence. In fact this is not true, because it is not taxes themselves
  that impose a drag and burden, but certain kinds of taxes, along with what
  classical economists call rents. As with most other taxes, there is a close
  relationship between aspects of the real property tax and economic rent, suggesting
  that the best solution to restoring harmony to economic systems and approach
  optimal market exchanges is by removing the rent, wherever it may flow or come
  to rest. It is economic rent that figuratively &quot;gums up the works,&quot; but
  which would allow markets to perform far more smoothly if it were completely
  removed by taxing it away.<em><strong>11</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>The Real Property Tax as a General Design</strong></p>
<p>  Understanding the real property tax is peculiarly difficult because its
  complexity and dynamics confound our conventional ideas about property, and
  is therefore
    typically underestimated. The most profound misunderstanding about real property
    stems from its misapprehension as an object, or as a &quot;thing&quot; similar
    to a car, a house, or a refrigerator. Some part of the tax is indeed imposed
    on &quot;things,&quot; the part we call &quot;improvements.&quot; That is
    actually the easiest component to understand. But the tax on improvements
    is both administratively and economically inefficient. So, for this among
    other reasons, many tax experts argue for placing the tax on the other component
    alone, the part on land, which is really the value of locations, and which
    is due to the presence of rent. This can be understood easily by considering
    the value as a site, ignoring any &quot;earth&quot; qualities. I prepared
    testimony for the Assembly Real Property Tax Committee on the challenges
    of assessment, and don't need to repeat that here.<em><strong>12</strong></em> Suffice it to say
    that assessment of land values is far easier to do than for the value of
    structures.</p>
<p> Yet one can understand why both land and improvements as bases for taxation
  should have come to be viewed in rem, (i.e., as things as opposed to being
  in personam, the other commonly understood base of taxes); after all, both
  have a solid form and a tangible quality that would appear for all practical
  purposes to be alike. To some observers, taxing real estate is the final and
  vestigial instance of the practice of taxing tangible objects, a practice that
  should be eliminated entirely along with the decreasing reliance upon ad valorem
  taxation of personal property. They would prefer to tax income, which is viewed
  as commensurate with one&#8217;s ability to pay. As noted, however, the land
  component of real property needs to be appreciated not as a &quot;thing,&quot; but
  rather as a locational site, distinct from improvements that may attach to
  it. This gives land locations attributes that differ fundamentally from any
  objects that may attach to them. Rent, as linked to locations, constitutes
  an entirely separate and different potential base of taxation than does income
  as reflective of wage labor, or the value of things, which are capital.</p>
<p>Contemporary economic theory is not helpful in presenting a third base on
  which taxes can be built. This is because one needs to go back to 19th century
  classical economics (as opposed to the contemporary neoclassical school) to
  appreciate the significance of what was then called economic rent.<em><strong>13</strong></em> Rent
  is somewhat analogous to water, which flows through parcel sites, and in no
  way &#8220;resides&#8221; in the sites themselves. Furthermore, rent is reflective
  of the enterprise of a community as a whole rather than due to the efforts
  of any single titleholder. Better, therefore, that property parcels be understood
  not as the repository of value but rather as the loci through which value flows.
  Rent constitutes one attribute among many that characterizes and reflects the
  value of real property. It helps that property law abjures use of the word &quot;ownership&quot; in
  preference to the term &quot;bundle of rights&quot; which refers to the privileges
  that attach to locations as they are defined.<em><strong>14</strong></em> Typically enumerated among
  the several rights that are linked to titles are the rights to sell, to mortgage,
  to bequeath, to lease, to use and occupy, to alter and install, and to subdivide
  and develop. The right to the retention of the ground rent is overlooked because
  its understanding is an artifact of classical economic theory. Market prices
  really attend to those privileges as they relate to the various uses to which
  sites can be employed, all of which create rent. To discuss this further would
  take us far afield of the concern of this paper, but is worth at least note
  in passing.</p>
<p> The critical component of the real property tax, the part that should ideally
  bear the burden, and indeed the part that actually improves the performance
  of the economy, is the tax on land sites according to their market value. A
  properly administered land value tax, as noted above, comports with all the
  textbook principles of sound tax theory, and indeed deserves the attention
  and understanding of students of fiscal policy far more than has been true
  in recent years. The market value of sites reflects the community enterprise
  of neighborhood communities and whole regions, and derives not from what any
  single titleholder does but rather from the economic vitality of the society
  generally. The flow of economic value, which is labeled rent, was understood
  well by classical economists as far back as Adam Smith,<em><strong>15</strong></em> and was given increasing
  clarity over the next century by Malthus, Ricardo, Mill, and Marshall. More
  than anyone, however, it was Henry George who constructed a comprehensive political
  and economic philosophy based upon the existence of rent that flowed through
  locations and reflected the level of market activity that those sites held.<em><strong>16</strong></em></p>
<p> Rent, as a flow of economic value, is fundamental to an understanding of
  the market value of land sites. Absent a full understanding of rent, sometimes
  also called ground rent, site rent, or economic rent (to distinguish it from
  the contemporary vernacular use of the word), leads to confusion and misapplication
  of tax designs, and the consequent controversies that ensue in this regard.
  Attempts to design tax regimes that take into account not only the requirements
  of public funding but the vicissitudes of the economy and the circumstances
  of individual property owners has led to a succession of Jerry-built &quot;Rube
  Goldberg&quot; systems that invite criticism, and usually quickly fail on account
  of their inability to contend with changing times. Enumerating the ways that
  forces interplay between changing economic situations and formulas cast in
  fixed form allows one to visualize the problems inherent in current designs. </p>
<p> The first consideration in how multiple variables affect property taxation
  is the condition of the economy itself. The most easily identifiable impact
  on property value at any given time is the vitality and exuberance of the economy.
  Areas where activity is booming will have higher property values than those
  areas that are in the doldrums. The east and west coasts of the US have far
  higher property values than many locations interior, not just on account of
  the limitations of space on sites proximate to coasts and ports but on account
  of the manifold economies that feed the markets of those areas. New York City
  and its environs have been booming for the past two decades, in good part due
  to the activity of the financial markets but due also to the other ancillary
  industries and other amenities that attract people. Where people want to be,
  site values are higher. Upstate New York State, on the other hand, has been
  dying for decades, because most of the industries that served to enrich that
  region for decades have moved or been made obsolete by a changing economy.
  It has yet to recover.</p>
<p> Moreover, it has become an article of faith that economies have periodic
  cycles, and that these phases are reflected more in property values than in
  any other sector. As this is written, observers are talking about a &quot;bubble&quot; in
  real estate values that may this time perhaps be more profound than any since
  the 1930s. Laws enacted to collect revenue from real property taxation are
  usually unable to accommodate to the rises, falls, and shifts in economic circumstances.
  In some instances, this is a virtue. Because the property tax is levied using
  an ad valorem formula (tax base times tax rate), however, it often fails more
  than other tax regimes to take into account changing factors and needs. This
  is not to say that doing so is administratively impossible; it is to recognize,
  only, that doing so is costly, and inadequate understanding of its nature leads
  inevitably to manifold problems.</p>
<p> A second important perspective comes from the significance mentioned earlier
  that the real property tax is really two separate taxes &#8212; a tax on the
  value of landsites and a tax on the value of improvements. The improvements,
  as noted,
  typically depreciate in market value over time, even as the land values appreciate.
  For this reason, assessors are usually required by law to valuate land and
  improvements separately. Yet when governments fail to update the market value
  of property parcels frequently and regularly, disparities between actual market
  prices and assessed values quickly result. In any given area, even at a local
  level, distortions from one neighborhood to another eventuate with the consequence
  of shifting burdens. Comparability of parcels is often difficult, especially
  when judgments about the separate assignments of value to land and building
  components must be estimated. This becomes even more difficult for the assessment
  of property parcels that cannot be compared with market sales: residential
  parcels have a far more frequent turnover than non-residential parcels; as
  a consequence the standards for the latter are far more relaxed.<strong><em>17</em></strong></p>
<p> This leads to still another consideration affecting valuation: the importance
  of timeliness in assessments. Some localities have been known not to carry
  out revaluation of their parcels on a comprehensive basis for decades, with
  all the distortions and loss of faith in their soundness that this entails.
  The state of Maryland has removed responsibility from local governments entirely,
  and placed the charge with professional state agency officials. Its office
  conducts revaluation for one third of all its counties each year so that no
  parcel has a valuation more than three years old. In fact modern computer technology
  has the potential for referring sales data over to assessment rolls and using
  formulas that could maintain a running valuation of every property parcel on
  a real-time basis. Instant reference to the market value of any and all parcels
  in any area would lead to the restoration of sounder valuation as well as greater
  assessment legitimacy.</p>
<p> Because one component of a real property parcel is continually depreciating
  while the other is likely appreciating, it becomes a challenge to know what
  proportion of the market value to assign to each factor.<em><strong>18</strong></em> There
  are strong incentives, particularly given conventional political pressures
  especially
  by non-residential interests, to over-value the improvements and undervalue
  the land components. This advantages titleholders for purposes of bookkeeping
  and tax write-offs, even while it distorts comprehensive market forces and
  assessments.<em><strong>19</strong></em> Again, computer technology has the potential to overcome
  such abuses, but has been underused to date. </p>
<p> These above-mentioned factors are considerations that lead to questionable
  validity of valuations of real property at local government levels. It means
  that there will be unfairness and disparities from place to place, from time
  to time, and from titleholder to titleholder. Because so many state formulas
  feed into and are based on local assessments, the distortions are amplified
  when state school aid formulas, housing assistance, highway decisions, health
  policies, welfare aid, and other such instruments are implemented. The criticism
  of the real property tax stems as much from its poor administration as from
  lack of understanding of its design. But one should emphasize that these are
  technical and administrative problems and not at all inherent in the economics
  or design of the tax itself. Treatment of these concerns is addressed later.</p>
<p> The most important insight needed to appreciate how the real property tax
  works &#8211; at least for the land component &#8211; is the reciprocal relationship
  between the market value of land locations and the taxation of the economic
  rent that flows through those sites. The more the rent on land is taxed, the
  more stabilized the price of locations becomes; failure to recapture the socially
  created rent from land sites inflates the market price of sites and bidding
  up their purchase level to form distortionary bubbles in the whole economy.
  One way or another, rent streams flow through locations, to be linked to sites
  or to be collected in taxes. Leaving the rent untaxed allows it to be capitalized
  in the market price until it is ultimately apparent in a sale. </p>
<p> It should be emphasized again that leaving the economic rent to pass through
  locations raises their market price. So when titleholders ultimately cash out
  they reap the benefits of a windfall gain. As a corollary, the increase in
  market value of sites is subsequently reflected in higher assessments (if reappraisals
  are kept current), and, of course, in still higher tax levies. So it is that
  titleholders face the challenge of paying their property taxes on a regular
  schedule, even though they often don't experience the capital gain until later.
  The normal and expected return to owners is viewed as a sound investment payoff
  when property is sold, but meanwhile paying taxes evinces lots of &quot;crocodile
  tears.&quot; This is not to deny that property owners, especially households,
  may experience stress when facing a large tax bill. Sympathy arises particularly
  for retired and elderly homeowners, who likely have substantially decreased
  income, just when home values, and hence taxes, jump. This dilemma, however,
  reflects simply a cash flow problem; no genuine loss of ability to pay the
  amounts due. There are available answers to this situation, and easily implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Special Adjustments Applied to the General Design</strong></p>
<p>  Beyond the frequent criticism directed at the application of the property
  tax is the charge that the property tax is inherently unfair because it shows
    no relationship to the income of households and titleholders, and that it
    taxes people with comparable parcels differently. These complaints arise
    with little understanding of the factors that assessors take into account
    when making valuations, and show even further misunderstanding about ideas
    of fairness. Tax equity is usually measured by one of two criteria: on ability
    to pay or amount of use. Property tax revenues the public pays for use are
    sometimes referred to as &quot;user fees,&quot; not taxes. But this is a
    distinction without a difference, because a tax that relates to the value
    of a location corresponds closely to community services rendered and is an
    ideal user fee.<em><strong>20</strong></em> Therefore the rent that flows through sites is a precise
    measure of its use value. Explaining this logic would allay many of the criticisms
    on the land component of the tax. But land value taxation is too little known
    or used in American states, despite its wide application elsewhere. </p>
<p>The assumption underlying all property tax relief is that homeownership constitutes
  a public good. It fosters family integrity and stability, facilitates a more
  active and involved citizenry, promotes activity and growth of the economy,
  and provides financial equity and security in a relatively innocuous and automatic
  way. More than any other element, it is the bulwark of the consumer economy,
  which is regarded as an unmitigated good. Housing is used as the bellwether
  measure of economic health.<em><strong>21</strong></em></p>
<p>On the other hand, it entails an element of economic 'lock-in' that reduces
  the liquidity of capital and the mobility of populations, thereby distorting
  economically efficient use of housing as well as land use configurations.xxii
  It is just one more reason why the real estate market is far from having perfect
  competition. Inefficiencies abound, such as the way young growing families
  are denied the full availability of homeownership while empty nesters and elderly
  widows continue living in homes far larger than they really need or can use.
  An inordinately high proportion of earnings are dedicated to homeownership,
  land use configurations grow out of sub-optimal location choices, greater automobile
  dependency results, and a number of related disamenities make for distorted
  markets in site locations. Pundits note significant numbers of households have
  no adequate housing at all while a sizeable number have two and even three
  homes. Arguably there is as much unfairness imposed by these relief measures
  as there are instances of their alleviation.</p>
<p>Hardships that arise are then remediated on a patchwork basis. Special consideration
  is usually granted to primary homeowners who are elderly, disabled, veterans,
  low income, or who secure special privileges. The benefits and relief accorded
  are explained as much by special pleading as they are by justice and demonstrable
  need. Every state has at least one such modification of the basic property
  tax design, and most have more. Variously, the property tax burden is relieved
  for selected parties by methods like</p>
<ul>
  <li> exemptions or deductions for those below certain poverty income lines, </li>
  <li> exemptions from the assessed values or from tax burdens due, and </li>
  <li> formulas for limiting the assessments or tax rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>When such tax breaks are offered, sometimes by automatic eligibility, sometimes
  after special application procedure, states may then reimburse the local governments
  for revenue foregone. Some measures of this order are applied across the board
  and some are at the option of local governments. After giving relief to owners
  of residential property, one frequently then sees differential tax rates applied
  to non-residential property to induce economic revitalization there too. The
  result is a hodgepodge of measures that are as contradictory in their impact
  as they are ineffective.</p>
<p>The eligibility for such relief varies greatly. In fact the fifty states'
  ways of relieving aggrieved parties of treatment adjudged to be unfair differ
  so much that it is hard to compare these programs in any organized way. The
  NCSL study has constructed several tables of summary descriptions. But none
  of these tables and framework arrays can capture the variety of solutions and
  the permutations employed to adjust tax burdens. Nor is likely that they can
  or will be. The complexity of factors determining property value is beyond
  the anything snapshots can capture, and so are the remedies that are instituted
  in response.</p>
<p> The National Conference of State Legislatures identifies four measures typically
  employed as a solution to what is typically known as the &quot;poor widow&quot; dilemma:
  property tax caps, the homestead exemption, the circuit-breaker program, and
  the deferral program. At least half the states now employ one or another of
  the aforementioned provisions; several employ all of them. These measures of
  relief for financial hardship were initially envisioned for households with
  low income, or for those with special and extraordinary expenses like the blind
  and handicapped. But, politics being what it is, the relief has often been
  extended to reward preferred titleholders like veterans and clergy. </p>
<p><strong>Property Tax Caps</strong></p>
<p>  The most simplistic measure devised to limit property tax burdens has been
      the use of caps on assessments, on rates, or on both. The most notable
      was California's Proposition 13, passed in 1978, and followed by measures
      in
      Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Oregon, Florida, and other states. Thirteen others
      have frozen assessments just for elderly households.<em><strong>23</strong></em> Counties in
  California are instructed by state law to revalue parcel only when ownership
  changes
      hands; otherwise any rise in assessed value is the lesser of 2% or the
      increase in cost of living. This means that some homes have not been revalued
      since
      1978; and adjacent parcels can bear widely different tax burdens, thereby
      invalidating any hope of achieving equity. Because this was presented to
      the voters as a ballot initiative, there was no prior research and no legislative
      hearings for a measure with such profound consequences. Moreover, it was
      presented as an amendment to the California Constitution, which makes it
      now very difficult to alter, despite its limitations.</p>
<p> The greatest beneficiaries of this tax revolt were parcels that change hands
  infrequently, mostly non-residential properties, especially large businesses
  and industries. Because the state is so large and because property values vary
  so widely, the cost of owning a home, especially in the coastal areas has skyrocketed.
  The greater the disparity between property taxes and the economic vitality
  of an area, the more the property values widened. The ceilings imposed have
  led to a shift of tax burdens to the state level, while at the same time starving
  many public services and programs of support. It is fair to say that no other
  single tax measure has so disrupted the performance of government as has Proposition
  13.<em><strong>24</strong></em> For the moment, however, it remains the &quot;third rail&quot; of
  political discourse, and there have been no efforts to challenge its position. </p>
<p> The impact of Proposition 13's passage reverberated throughout the nation
  when it was passed, and other state efforts were initiated before too long.
  The next successful enactment, also by ballot initiative (although not a constitutional
  amendment) was in Massachusetts. The name of the initiative, Proposition 2
  1/2, came from the assessment adjustments it imposed on all taxable property
  in a municipality. It stipulated that no property tax rate could exceed 2 1/2
  percent of the assessed value of a parcel, and that no increase could be more
  than 2 1/2 percent in any one year. The tax applied to residential, commercial,
  and industrial parcels, as well as to the motor vehicle excise tax, and has
  been in effect since 1982. Five states now limit the growth in property tax
  revenues to no more than 3% annually: Arizona, Idaho, Massachusetts, Washington,
  and West Virginia.<em><strong>25</strong></em></p>
<p> Other states' designs arise from similar sentiments. Measures to freeze property
  taxes take one of three forms: a freeze or annual ceiling on the increase of
  the assessed value of property parcels or a freeze on the mill rate of a tax,
  or both. A freeze on assessed values makes the whole valuation program essentially
  worthless; markets continue to operate and property taxes then remain fixed
  at whatever last point they were set at prior to the freeze, even if sometimes
  annually adjusted by a fixed percentage. A cap on the tax rate, regardless
  of background inflation rates or surrounding economic climate, leaves the land
  rent to flow through locations in ways that boosts their market price. As time
  goes on the injustices and differential economic permutations create even greater
  distortions in the tax regime. The result of such mischief is also to distort
  real estate markets, for taxes are never sufficient to brake values. Whatever
  inflation or surplus not otherwise captured by taxes is ultimately reflected
  in market prices. Failure to stabilize property prices results in higher site
  values and a greater gulf between the tax bases and actual aggregate real market
  values. </p>
<p>It is again appropriate to note the reciprocal relationship between the market
  value of locational sites and the amount of economic rent recaptured in taxes.
  Rent flows through a region in relationship to the vitality of economic activity,
  and taxes either recover that socially created rent or else leave it to affect
  the market value of sites. Leaving aside the questions of whether assessments
  are performed in a sound and timely manner, capping the taxes simply leaves
  rent in place to raise prices, thereby further increasing the assessed value
  when it is eventually recognized. Capping taxes actually exacerbates the problem:
  by allowing or ignoring the continual accretion of rent, it raises market prices
  far beyond what the normal recovery of rent in taxes would dictate. Arizona
  imposes a property tax cap of 1 percent on residential parcels, which of course
  has sent home prices through the roof during the recent real estate bubble.<em><strong>26</strong></em>  Many
  California communities today have experienced such enormous growth in real
  estate values that they are no longer competitive in attracting business,
  and are so out of proportion to reality that they sit at the top of the real
  estate bubble, until of course, it collapses.<em><strong>27</strong></em> Speculation feeds the
  process further until supply and demand finally offer the inevitable corrective. </p>
<p><strong>The Homestead Exemption and Credit</strong></p>
<p>  As normally designed, a homestead exemption subtracts a specified amount
      from total property taxes due. This can be accomplished by subtracting
      a stipulated
      base amount from the assessed value of a parcel or from the tax bill itself.
      About half the states impose an upper income limit on eligibility; the
      District of Columbia, the highest, links to a household's adjusted gross
      income of
      up to $100,000. There are also instances where the taxes are applied as
      a credit against state income taxes instead of as a deduction (as is normally
      the case). Sometimes the tax applies only to municipal taxes; in other
      instances
      to school taxes as well (which are often levied separately). There are
      even instances where localities are reimbursed, totally or in part, from
      revenue
      foregone by state funding sources. </p>
<p> The most recent available (2002) count reveals that a total of 48 states
  and the District of Columbia allow homestead exemptions or credits of one sort
  or another.<em><strong>28</strong></em> A few states make eligible only
  narrow groups like veterans and the disabled, and some states allow localities
  to employ homestead relief
  as an option rather than offer it as a statewide program. Some 32 states allow
  some level of exemptions for homeowners of all ages, and with a ceiling set
  by income level. The remainder, most often, employ the provision for the elderly,
  with the threshold set at age 65. The age threshold can be as low as 61 (Washington)
  and as high as 70 (Massachusetts). Hawaii is unique in having both a phased-in
  age schedule and a sliding exemption. In most instances, enrollment is automatic,
  so that the benefit of tax relief is granted as a matter of course. There are
  instances, however, where qualifying homeowners must apply to obtain their
  benefit, or else to fill out income tax forms that depend upon their own initiative. </p>
<p> Arguments for the homestead exemption programs depend very much on the assumption
  that assessments are up to date and accurate. But assessment standards vary
  widely: instead of using 'full market value' for 'highest and best use,' the
  professional standard, some states mandate a percentage value or some other
  approach. Assessors don't always rely upon economically and technically sound
  valuation procedures. In fact law often requires them not to do so, for example,
  usually by making a distinction between appraisal value and assessed value.
  Even when assessors perform their job satisfactorily, administrative and political
  considerations may then call for levying differential tax rates on one class
  of property parcels versus another. This relieves favored titleholders of a
  portion of their tax, and shifts the burden to another class or classes. Of
  course, political decisions instituted in favor of homeowners lead to an increased
  burden on commercial and industrial classes &#8211; typically employers &#8211; and
  are disincentives to their expansion. </p>
<p> To a lesser and sometimes equal extent, the same problem of assessment gimmickry,
  disparities and inequities exists in just about every state and locality. The
  value of property parcels typically differs from one part of a state to another,
  even though the same formula is applied throughout. If the same formula applies
  statewide, it should be palpably obvious that a $200,000 home in Denver itself
  will be far more modest than one in more remote areas of the state. Colorado&#8217;s
  homestead exemption of 50% for the first $200,000 of actual value is applicable
  if the resident has lived in it for at least ten years. Moreover, the state&#8217;s
  assessors don't use the conventional standard of 'highest and best use,' but
  use 'actual value' instead. This means that a location that warrants more intensive
  use relative to its site value will likely continue to languish as a derelict
  or vacant lot, with little advantage except for speculative gain. Many urban
  officials, prompted by pressures to induce development in moribund neighborhoods,
  are induced to adopt other tax incentives like enterprise zones, tax increment
  financing, and various subsidies, precisely what speculators wait for to happen.
  This leads, of course, to economic lethargy and to burden shifting to other
  property taxpayers. Inequities such as these result in enormous potential tax
  revenue foregone. The homestead exemption, however finely tuned, can never
  be but a blunt instrument in satisfying the requirements of a fair and efficient
  tax regime.<em><strong>29</strong></em></p>
<p> New York State is unique is its homestead design, and its complexity is somewhat
  baffling. Localities have the option of holding constant a percentage of the
  gross tax yield from residential parcels relative to non-residential parcels.
  The provision is employed when their governments have neglected to revalue
  property parcels for long periods, and then, having done so, face radical jumps
  in the tax burden on residential parcels. According to state law, localities
  may, if they then wish, keep the aggregate portion levied on homeowners constant
  by taxing them at a lower rate than others. This is done with the intention
  of reverting to a phased-in single rate in due course when presumably fiscal
  circumstances are improved and rates can be equalized once more. But that opportune
  time tends to fade into the distance. </p>
<p>This of course puts the additional burden on non-residential property owners,
  businesses typically. The extra load, which can increase over time since the
  split is held constant and businesses often leave, puts a city on a downward
  spiral from which it is difficult to extricate itself. Several major cities
  in New York State, among them Albany, Buffalo, Binghamton, Kingston, Niagara
  Falls, Poughkeepsie and Rochester, as well as many smaller localities, worked
  themselves into this box years ago, and have now experienced the consequences.<em><strong>30</strong></em>  Some cities have even seen their businesses raze perfectly good structures
  rather than be saddled with burdensome taxes. General Electric tore down some
  serviceable buildings in Schenectady, and Kodak recently did the same thing
  in Rochester, all to reduce their tax burdens. </p>
<p> New York State localities can adopt the homestead option for both their school
  taxes and their municipal taxes. Besides this provision, which affects only
  about twenty five of its over 900 localities, there is a second measure known
  as STAR: School Tax Relief program, and then both a Basic and an Enhanced STAR
  program to boot. Although administrative agencies and local governments now
  claim to have mastered the task of dealing with this complexity, there is no
  indication that any analysis of the equity issues has been addressed. The Basic
  STAR is available to anyone who owns and lives in his or her home and whose
  tax burden and income fall within certain specified ranges. The Enhanced STAR
  program is for senior citizens with (2006) incomes under $70,650. A further
  program is available for New York City homeowners. To further confuse things,
  a 'Middle Class Star Rebate program' enacted by the Pataki administration in
  2006, allows additional relief on a phased-in sliding scale for homeowners
  with incomes below $90,000 upstate and $120,000 in the metropolitan New York
  City region. As this is written, further legislative tinkering seems to be
  in store in order to further relieve the burden upon homeowners, which will
  likely add even more complexity to a design of already 'Rube Goldbergian' dimensions.<em><strong>31</strong></em></p>
<p> The New York Homestead Relief program and these others illustrate in graphic
  fashion the real difficulty with all such programs. Many distinguishing failures
  sum up their problems with the homestead exemption: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1) it relies upon assessment
      data which is seldom accurate for reason of being out of date, incompetently
      performed, or reliant upon inappropriate standards; <br />
    2) it relies on formulas
      that fail to keep up with those market values and assessments; <br />
    3) it fails
      to take into account disparities in property values from one part of a
    state to another; <br />
    4) it fails to accurately comport with any standards of
    fairness &#8211;either
      one's ability to pay or one's benefit derived; <br />
    5) it shifts the burden
    to non-residential properties which, in some cases, may find it more onerous
    than households.
      <br />
    Lastly 6), it has been an administrative nightmare. In the final analysis,
      the benefits provided are not nearly as generous as might first appear. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet
  the homestead credit and exemption programs survive because of limited understanding
  of land economics and of the dynamics of the real property tax. Political leaders
  can claim to have &#8220;done something,&#8221; and mention the typical $300
  state check homeowners receive in the mail.</p>
<p><strong>Property Tax Circuit-Breaker Programs for Homeowners</strong></p>
<p>  Circuit-breaker property tax provisions adopted by various states are explainable
      by the metaphor that they employ. The circuit-breaker mechanism is an automatic
      shut-off when an electrical circuit is overloaded. Here, a tax burden similarly
      shuts off, by either a credit or exemption, as it relates to both real
      property taxes and income. It is intended to assist low-to-moderate income
      homeowners
      and, in two cases (Alaska and Oregon), to renters. Benefits can be based
      on an absolute threshold or a sliding scale. As of 2006, only four states
      provided for circuit breakers without regard to age, using income alone
      as a qualification.<em><strong>32</strong></em> But a full 34 states have provision for circuit-breaker
      relief, and just about all set the eligibility threshold at age 65.<em><strong>33</strong></em>  According
      to the NCSL study, benefits range widely, from a modest $125 in
      West Virginia to $2,000 in North Dakota, and phase out as income rises.
      Relief is granted sometimes by an initial exemption, other times by a rebate
      from
      state sources. Eligibility may pertain to other assets as well; in the
      case of Maryland the limit is $200,000. In some instances the administration
      provides
      for a rebate depending upon when state income tax is filed; in other instances,
      eligibility is determined by formula set beforehand. </p>
<p> At last count, the range of initial eligibility phase-in runs from a low
  of $3,750 (single) and $5,550 (joint) income in Arizona (West Virginia is not
  far behind with a threshold of $5,000) to a maximum of $30,000 in the State
  of Washington. Maryland and Massachusetts limit the benefit by the value of
  the home, the latter using an assessed value ceiling of $400,000. The mean
  maximum benefit of all 34 states looks to be approximately $600, but the high-cost
  states of New York and New Jersey allow credits from a household&#8217;s state
  income tax payment, but cap them at a mere $90 and $75 respectively. This same
  New York formula applied in 2006 when a median arm&#8217;s length residential
  sale was $630,000 in Westchester County, just north of New York City, and $69,000
  in Chautauqua County at the western edge of the state.<em><strong>34</strong></em> Minnesota and
  Vermont have a benefit cap of $1,500 even though differential housing costs
  might not
  be quite so dramatic. All this description simplifies what are in some cases
  inordinately complex formulas, making it difficult for homeowners to know and
  understand how fairly the burden is being imposed. When floors and ceilings
  of eligibility become dated, as well as assessments, whatever results from
  legislative compromises for fairness or advantage is lost by a lack of simplicity
  and transparency. </p>
<p> Many of the same liabilities apply to the circuit-breaker program as exist
  with the homestead exemptions and credits. This broad-brush formula program
  invokes relief without regard to relative need. Given the variability of income
  and home property values, it is difficult to guarantee any uniform degree of
  fairness even within a state. Like other measures, an extraordinarily modest
  benefit in one region of a state can well be an inordinately generous windfall
  in another. And, as earlier noted, any exemption from taxation reflected by
  the land component of the levy is of course capitalized in the total market
  value of the parcel: the market price immediately rises to the extent that
  this burden of taxation is relieved. Depending upon the status of the owner
  and without bearing upon the value of the parcel itself, this is done selectively,
  and it constitutes a distortion reaching far beyond the owner, the parcel,
  and ultimately to the neighborhood itself. Far from being neutral, it means
  that tax programs affect decisions about ongoing uses of sites whenever the
  same owners retain title.</p>
<p> The first circuit-breaker program was adopted in Wisconsin in 1964, and twenty-five
  additional states adopted programs between 1970 and 1979. It has been all but
  impossible to link blanket adjustments in benefits to the sporadic and haphazard
  attention to local revaluation of parcels. Even though localities are frequently
  reimbursed for tax revenue foregone, the efficiency (and fairness) of the programs
  is compromised by reliance upon the homeowners to initiate applications for
  program eligibility. Even when percentages are employed in formulas rather
  than fixed amounts, it becomes difficult to incorporate any semblance of equity
  in such a far-reaching and broadly applicable program. Where renters' eligibility
  qualifies, any estimates of what proportion of a tenant's payments constitute
  the tax component is largely a matter of guess. The difficulty in maintaining
  any integrity in the circuit-breaker program is most exacerbated by the rapidity
  with which assessments become obsolete, inflation factors alter income, and
  the corresponding formulas applied to them as well. It is no accident that
  the benefits of the circuit breaker have dropped drastically since most of
  them were first instituted.</p>
<p> The single universal feature of circuit-breaker eligibility is a homeowner's
  income; it has no way of taking wealth into account. And since economic rent,
  left untaxed on land sites, is capitalized in a parcel's market value, it results
  in an unrealized capital gain to the titleholder. The result is a two-fold
  gift: first the exemption from payment of a share of the property taxes, second,
  a capitalized rent flow increase resulting in a windfall gain when ultimately
  a parcel is sold. The upshot is that circuit breakers provide a solution to
  a misdiagnosed problem. If the programs were truly transparent and the public
  understood their real-world applications, it would realize that they represent
  a diversion to appeals for relief of a genuine predicament. Still, for lack
  of imagination of tax designers or due to an inadequate understanding of the
  economic dynamics of land markets, circuit-breaker provisions have been enormously
  popular. Given the recent run-up of property values in various localized areas,
  there will likely be enormous pressure for their expansion and for their further
  adoption unless more adequate relief designs are put forth.</p>
<p><strong>Property Tax Deferrals</strong></p>
<p>  With a few exceptions, most of the existing deferral programs are limited
      to elderly homeowners. In these uncertain times some states' leaders have
      come
      to appreciate that many other households experience setbacks, but once
      recovered still manage to continue their tax obligations reliably. Because
      such arrangements
      constitute a lien on a home (perhaps in addition to a mortgage), there
      is often some discomfort when homeowners assume such an obligation. The
      burdens
      of opting for this provision can be stringent: In Florida, the amount deferrable
      is only that portion of taxes exceeding 5% of the applicant's household
      income, and in Texas any debt outstanding carries an interest rate of 8%
      per year,
      which discourages people from using it. </p>
<p>The District of Columbia allows qualified owners to apply for deferral each
  year only if the tax on their home is in excess of 110% of the preceding year's
  tax. States that address their concern exclusively to the elderly are generally
  more lenient in their designs. Those eligible must typically be at least 65
  years old (although Washington sets the threshold at 60 and California and
  Oregon at 62). Two states &#8211; Arizona and South Dakota &#8211; hold out
  the eligibility till age 70. The total amount that can be deferred also varies
  widely, up to $40,000 in Massachusetts, $50,000 in Virginia, and $60,000 in
  Minnesota. Michigan indexes its cap to inflation and Wisconsin sets its cap
  at 150% of poverty level. </p>
<p> While homeowners in eligible categories may defer payment of their tax duties,
  their relief is only temporary. They are deferred so that they can continue
  occupying their homes without any pressing concerns about tax payments. Whenever
  the homes are ultimately sold or transferred, the lien, including interest,
  must be satisfied. In one sense (although not in others) this design functions
  somewhat as a 'reverse mortgage.' But the terms are typically far simpler and
  more generous than reverse mortgage arrangements in most instances. A total
  of twenty-five states and the District of Columbia now employ some system of
  property tax deferral. &#8220;Deferral programs,&#8221; says the NCSL study, &#8220;are
  the most cost effective method of alleviating the concern that elderly homeowners
  might lose their homes because they cannot afford taxes.&#8221; It is cost
  effective to both homeowners and to governments. Unfortunately records of program
  use are lacking, but the general impression is that it is not as widely used
  as might be. One can surmise that the elderly regard their home, likely their
  most important possession, as their financial security. They may want to pass
  their asset, typically accumulated over the course of a lifetime, to their
  heirs free from encumbrance. One can also assume that children would tend to
  resist the use of this relief provision as they stand to gain when a title
  is ultimately transferred. To them it constitutes a windfall gain, and who
  doesn&#8217;t enjoy a windfall!</p>
<p> Part of the explanation for the reluctance to employ deferral options may
  stem from the unwillingness, and perhaps even the inability, to appreciate
  the distinction between earned and unearned gains. The bald fact is that Americans
  have come to regard the windfall wealth of rising home value as much as an
  entitlement as they do earned wealth, sometimes more so. The real estate industry
  urges people to regard their home as an investment. Even though a lifetime
  depreciation of a house might reduce its value to a fraction of its replacement
  cost, the land appreciation typically more than compensates, and is regarded
  as a rightfully acquired capital gain. The distinction between structures and
  land values is ignored, and society and government make little effort to bring
  that distinction to light. We have witnessed, particularly in recent years,
  an enormous dependence upon unearned income by large elements of the population,
  and no effort is made to identify how much of this income is passed-through
  economic rent.xxxv In reality rent is windfall income, created by the community,
  and ought to be understood as such, morally speaking. The increasing dependence
  of so much of the American population on unearned income, much of which relies
  on the capture of such rents, has led to the use of new economic language.
  People are said to live in an economy of finance capitalism, in contrast to
  an earlier era of industrial capitalism.</p>
<p> Nonetheless, one must appreciate that when one segment of the population
  is relieved of its tax burden, others must take responsibility for assuming
  it. The abstruse dimensions of other property tax relief measures fail to make
  clear where justice and fairness lie in the total scheme of things. With deferral
  owners of residential property are not relieved of their tax burden; they still
  shoulder it fully. They are simply given the privilege of deferring it until
  they move to other quarters, die, or otherwise cash out. The provision for
  its use also makes clear that the burden is linked not to the person of the
  titleholder but rather to the property parcel. This distinction is critical
  for its message in making clear the moral dimension of a tax regime.</p>
<p> It is sometimes argued that the instrument known as a &#8220;reverse mortgage&#8221; can
  accomplish the same thing. Recent figures show that an increasing number of
  seniors are making use of this option where it is allowed. One advocacy website
  cites the increase in numbers since it was first authorized. US government
  records show that the total number of policies contracted was only 157 in FY1990,
  but was 107,558 in FY 2007.<em><strong>36</strong></em> Earlier experiences
  showed that exorbitant interest, points, and penalties, a matter of less concern
  often victimized
  seniors with property tax deferral instruments.<em><strong>37</strong></em> Perhaps the increased
  popularity of reverse mortgages is due to their closer government regulation.</p>
<p> The potentially distorting effects of property tax regimes on behavioral
  choices have been alluded to earlier, beyond family and parcel use itself.
  Whereas the homestead, circuit breaker and tax freeze programs all have profound
  consequences for and upon the wider community, and upon land use decisions
  and configurations, deferral programs in contrast are likely to have a very
  limited impact. Real estate prices in deferral programs still maintain the
  same integrity they would have absent their use. Tax burdens are still incorporated
  in pricing structures, much as in deferral's absence. </p>
<p> A final concern is the impact upon a local community's fisc. The deferral
  option in no way shifts the tax burden onto others or excuses an elderly homeowner
  from his obligation, even if payment is delayed. The arrangement is a financially
  neutral transaction. If a peculiarly large number of applicants were to be
  involved in the tax schedule at a program's inception and was onerous to a
  local government, there is no reason why a state might not be able to offer
  transitional aid. But no transition difficulty has been reported in any of
  the 24 states offering a program.</p>
<p><strong>Uniqueness of the Real Property Tax and the Georgist Alternative </strong></p>
<p>  Further discussion of the pros and cons of each remedy for the &#8220;poor
  widow&#8217;s dilemma requires more exploration of the real property tax itself.
  The real property tax to a land economist is really two separate taxes: the
  tax on the land value and the tax on the improvement value. Land must be treated
  separately because of the limited supply elasticity (i.e., the fixed amount)
  of land available, in contrast with the variable supply of structures that
  can be produced. The tax on land value comports with all the principles of
  sound tax theory; it is the tax on improvements that is so problematic. </p>
<p> It is impossible to deal with any modifications of the real property tax
  without first restoring its integrity. The present failure to adequately adapt
  real property taxes stems from their unique character, as well as from the
  fact that contemporary neoclassical economics gives no special place to land
  as a factor of production. Recapturing the rent from locations rather than
  letting it attach to those sites actually increases the efficiency of economic
  performance, even while it provides revenue for the support of government services.
  Taxing improvements, on the other hand, makes no sense whatsoever, from any
  perspective. It discourages titleholders from improving their sites to the
  full extent that their locational value warrants, and it penalizes them for
  maintaining them in good order. When a parcel is built upon or added to, the
  current property tax increases, a perverse incentive which discourages the
  behavior that policymakers should be encouraging. A bit of reflection should
  make it clear that taxes on improvements should be eliminated entirely.</p>
<p> If first the property tax were modified in ways that conformed to the principles
  of sound tax theory, it would then be easier to make modifications that address
  concerns such as those faced by the reputed &#8220;poor widow.&#8221; Otherwise,
  any relief or adjustments run afoul so many of those basic tenets, and create
  so many other difficulties of both a technical and ethical nature, that the
  challenge remains unresolved. Addressing the matter de novo helps in framing
  the problem in a way that makes a solution both easy to understand and to implement
  administratively.</p>
<p> Examining the application of tax theory as it is applied in classical economics
  makes clear that taxing &#8220;land,&#8221; in any of its forms, has no downside
  effects; it is indeed the perfect tax. It is totally neutral with respect to
  its influence upon behavioral choices, efficient insofar as there is no &#8220;excess
  burden&#8221; (a fancy word for productivity loss and economic drag), equitable
  to the extent that one pays according to one&#8217;s ownership and use of sites,xxxviii
  simple and comprehensible in that the public can appreciate it, and administrable
  because of the transparency and certitude of land values. The major distinguishing
  reason for the advantages of taxing land is the existence of economic rent,
  a phenomenon that is essentially ignored in contemporary economics. Rent is
  the economic surplus that flows through and links to any location that has
  a market price. It connects to places that have an inelastic supply, especially
  land sites. Restoring the special place of land in economic theory would solve
  many of the problems associated with both tax design and administration as
  well as for larger economic policy discussions. </p>
<p> There was a time when one could argue that discerning the relative value
  of the land component versus the improvement component of a site was impossible.
  Although assessors have always regarded this as a bogus argument, modern computer
  applications and full command of sales data, as well as the ongoing redevelopment
  inherent in teardowns in many areas, have put an end to this purportedly insurmountable
  obstacle. In the aggregate, the land value of urban localities is typically
  between 30 and 50 percent, sometimes even higher. In some particularly noteworthy
  high-traffic or especially productive locations, the aggregate land value of
  cities reaches well above 70 percent of total real property value.<em><strong>39</strong></em> Although
  some people assume that a land value tax can be passed forward, this is not
  so, because the rental price to tenants for office or apartment units is necessarily
  set by the market and not by the overhead costs of the landlord. So also with
  imputed rent of homeowners. Improvements, in contrast, are elastic, especially
  in the longer term, and taxes on improvements, therefore, are susceptible to
  being shifted both forward to tenants and even backward to the building industry.<em><strong>40</strong></em></p>
<p> Although not typically mentioned as a consideration in evaluating tax policies,
  one more criterion should be considered as important to any review of the real
  property tax, and that is its effects upon land use configurations and upon
  the environment generally. Land, being a limited resource, needs to be husbanded
  and used with care. Tax regimes should be designed so that they at least do
  not confound rational land use policies, and if possible even facilitate them.
  Current tax programs give little thought to such matters, and the consequences
  are to be seen in the rampant development of sprawled communities, the evisceration
  of urban centers, and the profligate use of energy and raw materials far beyond
  what prudence and ecological consciousness promotes. Indeed taxes on real property
  as they currently exist actually foster foolish development, and it is adequately
  demonstrated that shifts to land value taxation alone go far toward reversing
  the centrifugal tendencies of sprawl as they are so ubiquitously practiced.</p>
<p> The utilization of economic rent as the basis for public spending has both
  an economic and a moral foundation. The recapture of rent in the form of a
  land value tax restores a clear moral dimension to both economics and to tax
  policy, and is the only tax regime that is morally sound. It makes land value
  taxation more clearly comprehensible and justifiable to the average person
  than any other regime of raising revenue. Inasmuch as economic rent is socially
  created value, it is returned to society for the support of social services.
  Rent is far from a trivial component of our economic system. Although our own
  US government statistics preclude it from being adequately calculated in ways
  that measures it in full, it has been so identified for the Australian economy,
  where the land portion of real estate totals at least 29 percent.<em><strong>41</strong></em> Suffice
  it to say, therefore, that even if substantial amounts of rent is recaptured
  for support of public services and in lieu of taxes that tap other revenue
  bases, the remaining rent attached to land sites would still appreciate property
  parcels.</p>
<p> Were every bit of economic rent from land sites recaptured in taxes, site
  values would, of course, fall to zero; there would be no flow of rent to sites
  and there would be none to be capitalized in the market prices of land components.
  Only the stock value of improvements would have a marketable price. Full implementation
  of a tax regime based on the recapture of all economic rents would obviate
  the need for taxation of people&#8217;s wage labor and other capital resources.
  Nowhere in the world is so much land rent recaptured at the present time. But
  no more than a small fraction of rent taxation is necessary to supplant the
  current local property tax regimes in any case, much as proponents of land
  value taxation regard it as desirable. But without reducing reliance on sales
  taxes or income taxes or hotel occupancy taxes, much can be gained at the local
  level by increasing the collection of land rent while decreasing the tax on
  buildings, i.e., remaining revenue neutral. But smart state and local leadership
  will examine the merits of going further, reducing sales taxes and/or local
  and state wage taxes and collecting a larger share of local land rent. Gradual
  tax shifts in some twenty Pennsylvania cities that are now shifting from the
  conventional property tax to a land value tax &#8211; a phasing out of taxes
  on improvement values and a replacement increase in the taxation of land values
  &#8212; still leaves the bulk of economic rent to flow through sites and appreciate
  their market value. It has also provided marked improvement to the economic
  vitality of those places.</p>
<p> Despite the strong public sentiment for the protection of windfall gains,
  people pay much more in other tax revenues than they would likely reap from
  cashing out on their home appreciation. This is because there is so much inefficiency
  inherent in those tax regimes.<em><strong>42</strong></em> In reality, the
  proportion of the nation's population and households that are &quot;winners&quot; in
  the property investment sweepstakes is quite low, even though the proportion
  of households that own
  their own homes is currently over 65 percent. We nonetheless read frequent
  stories about people investing in homes and even &quot;flipping&quot; them
  to get rich in astonishingly short time periods.<strong><em>43</em></strong> (At the moment, we
  are seeing stories of the households who have not been so lucky, who over-extended
  themselves with sub-prime mortgages, and are now hoping to have a stable place
  to live.) </p>
<p> One typically also hears much more from well-situated winners who are threatened
  with loss of their property than we are from those who either are safely ensconced
  or never got into the game. This accounts for public policy measures that provide
  relief to those who feel so threatened. But for every long-term property owner
  that walks away with a lifetime's benefit of increased rent attached to a land
  title, there are just as many - if not more - young households or emerging
  businesses that are prohibited from acquiring a property because of exorbitantly
  expensive prices. In this sense, a title to a socially created stream of rental
  benefits constitutes a monopoly privilege to an unearned windfall gain for
  a lucky few. Yet, American culture has learned to see land speculation as common
  sport, if not as an entitlement, and has done so since its historic beginnings.<em><strong>44</strong></em></p>
<p> One must go back to classical economic theory, and to its culminating figure
  and exponent, Henry George, for an appreciation of the importance of land.
  It meant at that time, and before, all natural resources &#8212; air, water,
  mineral wealth, and, today, by extension, the electromagnetic spectrum, airport
  time-slots,
  and any other elements that have a market value not created by human hands
  or minds. The primary exponents of this tradition today are the remaining carriers
  of the classical economics heritage. The Georgist tradition sees considerable
  unfairness, as well as inefficiencies, in the real property arrangements that
  have evolved in the US and are taking hold in other societies.</p>
<p> In Henry George&#8217;s moral order, calculated effort to capture elements
  of common wealth was tantamount to theft. It was the moral equivalent of owning
  slaves.<em><strong>45</strong></em> He viewed decisions by society to tax the effort of people&#8217;s
  own minds and muscle as equally repugnant. He interpreted the rampant land
  grabs prevailing during his time and earlier as an historical aberration. His
  knowledge of Biblical history and his reading of practices led him to see that
  the classic source payment for the privilege of using land and other natural
  resources was economic rent, deliverable, of course, in labor, in goods, or
  in money, but always only as rent payment. One of his most eloquent speeches,
  delivered on May 8, 1887, to the Anti-Poverty Society when running for the
  Mayoralty of New York City, was &#8220;Thou Shalt Not Steal.&#8221;<strong><em>46</em></strong> To
  George, the rightful and natural source of tax revenue was the economic rent
  yield from land, and he argued for and looked to a time when his tax reforms
  would arrive. </p>
<p> In contrast to the prevailing neoclassical economic tradition today, classical
  economics was all built on three factors of production &#8211; land, labor,
  and capital. Neoclassical economics sees nothing particular or special about
  land as a production factor, and therefore conflates it with manufactured items
  (essentially tools for further productivity) into a single category of capital.
  In classical economics, land cannot be &#8220;owned&#8221; as one might own
  a car or a pencil. As an element of nature it can only be used, and the meaning
  of its possession relates to its use and not to the rights inherent in fee
  simple titles. The importance of this cannot be underestimated, as land, then,
  is not regarded as wealth. Elements of nature, rather, are the common heritage
  and birthright of humanity. Only our own creations reflect our wealth, and
  come about only as the products of labor and past capital. To Georgists, our
  house may be wealth but the land is not, a gigantic difference. Based on neoclassical
  economic premises, the NCSL Report has considerable difficulty as it unfolds
  in explaining and justifying the relief options that it describes. A high proportion
  of land economists subscribe to the Georgist tradition, and therefore find
  great difficulty, therefore, in addressing the problems of real property taxation
  living within the framework of neoclassical economics. </p>
<p> The distinction between stock and flow in economics is particularly important
  when discussing economic rent, for the reason that real estate parcels are
  typically marketed for their stock value, whereas the land rent on those sites
  constitutes a flow. </p>
<p>  Economic rent or land rent is reflected in the value of site locations as the
  local and regional economy&#8217;s surplus. All the value of market enterprise
  flows through locations and is capitalized in their market value. Absent its
  capture and diversion to interests bent on aggrandizement in what is known
  as &#8220;rent-seeking&#8221; or in taxes other than on land sites, the site
  value is ultimately reflected in market price. Directly recapturing the added
  value from site rents in the form of land taxes can stabilize real estate prices
  and obviate the need to tax people&#8217;s labor and capital goods. Adherents
  to the Georgist economic tradition employ the physiocrats&#8217; acronym ATCOR &#8211; all
  taxes come out of rent &#8211; to explain this. South African Georgist Godfrey
  Dunkley prefers to say, &#8220;All taxes are at the expense of rent.&#8221; Taxing
  rent directly, or land as the source of rent, avoids all the downside effects
  that are associated with other taxes, while at the same time stabilizing prices
  and the economy itself as no other tax can.</p>
<p> Georgist economists, and indeed many others, have long argued that land value
  taxation is the best solution to fiscal challenges, especially for local government
  finance. As policy stands now, however, the two components of the property
  tax are like a train with an engine at each end. The tax on improvements exerts
  a penalty upon those who would improve their sites, while the tax on land values
  provides an inducement for titleholders to build to the full extent that carrying
  costs warrant. Eliminating the tax on improvements would remove all the downside
  consequences of the property tax as it now exists. Doing so would foster development
  in high-value locations and thereby reverse the centrifugal forces of sprawl
  development. This would lead to an increased supply of housing and commercial
  office space, and in precisely those locations that are economically and, with
  proper zoning, environmentally desirable. With all the tax relief to residential
  property owners likely to eventuate under a regime that shifts gradually to
  a land value tax over time, the animus against taxation at the local level
  could well abate. Not only are most homeowners likely to see their overall
  burdens reduced, it would lead to positive results in the financial health
  of urban configurations as well as more support for public services. <br />
    <br />
  Some adherents in the Georgist tradition abjure the word tax totally, and employ
  the word &#8220;ground rent,&#8221; to refer to the revenue collected from
  the public for the privilege of using parts of nature. Others talk about taxing
  economic rents. It is a trivial point. The important challenge is to restore
  a moral basis for economics and taxation that has disappeared in the course
  of the neoclassical heyday now passing. As this paradigm collapses, recovering
  the tradition of classical economic theory is a task of the first order. There
  is no better approach to achieving this than by tackling the questions of taxation.
  If Georgist approaches are to be part of this reconstitution of the field of
  economics, matters involving the specter of poverty, respect for nature, and
  their relationship to democratic systems will surely follow. One sees a renewed
  interest in this tradition worldwide, as other tax regimes are revealed to
  be unworkable or have greater liabilities.<em><strong>47</strong></em></p>
<p> The Georgist solution offers a well-founded starting point in designing a
  sound structure for property tax adjustments where warranted, because it comports
  most perfectly with sound tax principles. A land value tax is neutral insofar
  as behavioral choices are not altered by its imposition. It is efficient because
  it imposes no excess burden or deadweight loss (often described as productivity
  loss and economic friction). It is equitably progressive because only individuals
  or households that own land pay any tax at all. Middle class homeowners for
  the most part own only modest parcels under their houses and farmers&#8217; holdings
  are where land is cheap. High value parcels in urban cores are typically owned
  by institutions and wealthy people and end up shouldering most of the burden.
  A land tax is simple enough to be easily understood and transparent enough
  for all to see. It is stable because land values are less subject to periodic
  cycles and abrupt changes than are taxes on other factors. And it is easily
  administered and certain because the parcel values on which it is based are
  readily assessed relative to other parcels and to sales records. No other tax
  provides such an elementary and feasible beginning from which to make further
  analysis. Despite its century old explication as a coherent paradigm, it owes
  its strong rebirth to the advent of computers and easily available data. The
  results of recent interest in and simulation of Henry George&#8217;s claims
  shows that he was right: that taxing land value is a win-win-win for all elements
  of the community.<em><strong>48</strong></em></p>
<p> With a soundly conceived tax on the land value of parcel locations, implementing
  a stopgap adjustment to relieve households that have for whatever reason become
  unable to pay their taxes is an easily included amendment. What has come to
  be known as the deferral option addresses the needs and expectations of both
  the titleholder and the community, in ways also that encourages an efficient
  housing market, efficient land use configurations, easily administered relief
  without undue government intrusion, equitable outcomes for all parties, and
  stable revenue streams. </p>

<p>  1.  The reference to the poor widow is intended to be metaphorical.  This
        could, of course refer just as well to a widower, an indigent family,
      or any other
  householder threatened with loss of a home when not able to make tax payments.</p>
<p>2. The &#8220;poor widow&#8221; argument has a venerable history, traced even
to the Bible; see Luke, Chapter 21:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;When he looked up he saw some wealthy people putting their offerings
        into the treasury and he noticed a poor widow putting in two small coins.
    He said, 'I
        tell you truly, this poor widow put in more than all the rest; for those
    others have all made offerings from their surplus wealth, but she, from her
    poverty,
      has offered her whole livelihood.&quot; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&chapter=21">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=21</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton frequently invoked the &#8220;poor widow&#8221; argument
  in her political campaigns:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;If all those magnificent cathedrals with their valuable lands in Boston,
      Philadelphia and New York were taxed as they should be, the taxes of women
      who hold property
        would be proportionately lightened...I cannot see any good reason why
    wealthy churches and a certain amount of property of the clergy should be
    exempt
      from taxation, while every poor widow in the land, struggling to feed,
    clothe, and
        educate a family of children, must be taxed on the narrow lot and humble
      home.&quot; <a href="http://htomc.dns2go.com/atheism/cookie.41b%20">http://htomc.dns2go.com/atheism/cookie.41b </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poor widow rose again in a veto by Governor Billings of Vermont in 1925: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;And
      now upon a plea to help out the poor widow who owns a few shares of bank
    stock, all the well-to-do bankers who are perfectly able and ought to pay
    as much
      tax as the owner of real estate and tangible personal property, and who
    can easily sell their bank stock when the taxation burden gets too heavy,
    are to
      be given a gratuity in a reduction in 50% of their tax so that when extra
    taxes are to be raised in their towns to build roads and school houses and
    to pay
      debts which are getting to be quite a municipal burden, the man struggling
      to pay for his real estate or business must absorb all of the extra burden.
      This seems to me to be unfair.&#8221;  <a href="http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/governance/Vetoes/pdf/1925BillingsH254.pdf%20">http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/governance/Vetoes/pdf/1925BillingsH254.pdf </a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Winston Churchill, when arguing for land taxation in the House of Commons
  in 1909, was exasperated by the poor widow objection, <em>i.e</em>., that it would evict
  her from her home. In defending land value taxation, he responded with classic
  Churchillian eloquence: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;When we seek to rectify this system, to break
      down this unnatural and vicious circle, to interrupt this sequence of unsatisfactory
      reactions, what happens? We are not confronted with any great argument
    on behalf of the owner. Something else is put forward, and it is always put
    forward in
      these cases to shield the actual landowner or the actual capitalist from
    the logic of the argument or from the force of a Parliamentary movement.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Sometimes it is the widow. But that personality has been used to exhaustion.
    It would be sweating in the cruelest sense of the word, overtime of the grossest
    description, to bring the widow out again so soon. She must have a rest for
    a bit; so instead of the widow we have the market-gardener &#8212; the market-gardener
    liable to be disturbed on the outskirts of great cities, if the population
    of those cities expands, if the area which they require for their health and
    daily life should become larger than it is at present.&#8221; Speech in the
    House of Commons, 4 May 1909, in response to Mr. AJ Balfour, Leader of the
  Opposition. <a href="http://www.earthsharing.org.au/node/32%20">http://www.earthsharing.org.au/node/32 </a></p>

  even given their neoclassical economic predilections. See among other places:
  <a href="http://www.urbantools.org/research-and-studies">http://www.urbantools.org/research-and-studies</a>, &#8220;Can a Site Value Tax
be an Answer?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Milton Friedman</strong>: &quot;I share your view that taxes would
    be best placed on the land, and not on improvements.&quot;<br />
    <strong>Paul Samuelson</strong>: &quot;Pure land rent is in the nature of a &#8216;surplus&#8217;,
    which can be taxed heavily without distorting production incentives or efficiency.&quot; A
    site value tax can be called &quot;the useful tax on measured land surplus.&quot;<br />
    <strong>Franco Modigliani</strong>: It is important that the rent of land
    be retained as a source of government revenue. Some persons who could make
    excellent use of land would
    be unable to raise money for the purchase price. Collecting rent annually
    provides access to land for persons with limited access to credit.&quot;<br />
    <strong>Robert Solow</strong>: &quot;Users of land should not be allowed
    to acquire rights of indefinite duration for single payments. For efficiency,
    for adequate revenue
    and for justice, every user of land should be required to make an annual
    payment to the local government equal to the current rental value of the
    land that
    he or she prevents others from using.&quot;<br />
    <strong>William Vickrey</strong>, 1996 Nobel Prize Winner, also endorses
    site value taxation: &quot;It
    guarantees that no one dispossesses fellow citizens by obtaining a disproportionate
    share of what nature provides for humanity.&quot;<br />
    <strong>James Tobin</strong>: &quot;I think in principle it's a good idea
    to tax unimproved land, and particularly capital gains (windfalls) on it.
    Theory says we should
    try to tax items with zero or low elasticity, and those include sites.&quot;<br />
    <strong>James Buchanan</strong>: &quot;The landowner who withdraws land from
    productive use to a purely private use should be required to pay higher,
    not lower, taxes.&quot;</p>

  : &#8220;Ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are, therefore, perhaps,
  the species of revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax imposed upon
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>17. The official handbook of The International Association of Assessing Officers
  states (p.547) that &#8220;the chief measure of uniformity [in aggregate analysis]
  is the coefficient of dispersion (COD), which, depending on the nature of the
  properties involved, should not exceed 10.0-15.0 for residential properties,
  15.0-20.0 for commercial properties, and 20.0 for vacant [<em>i.e.</em>, rural] land.&#8221; Joseph
  K. Eckert, et al, Property Appraisal and Assessment Administration, Chicago:
IAAO, 1990.</p>

<p>26. The March 3, 2006, issue of <em>Mortgage News Daily</em> carried the story that &#8220;Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale,
  Arizona [is] the top ranking Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in the country
  with an annualized appreciation of 39.67 percent and a 7.77 rate for the quarter.
  Other markets with high annual appreciation are Naples-Marco Island, Florida
  (38.89 and 9.49 percent) Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida (36.19 and 7.19 percent)
  and St. George, Utah (35.27 and 8.21 percent). Of the twenty top MSAs in the
  county 10 were in Florida, four wholly or partially in Arizona and three in
  California. One year ago 14 were in California, four in Florida and two in
Nevada.&#8221; </p>

<p>29. The NCSL 2002 Report offers an illustration of the complexity involved
    in real property tax administration, especially comparing state to state. It
  illustrates with the comparative cases of California and Louisiana:  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;The degree of property tax relief provided by homestead exemption and
        credit programs varies tremendously from state to state. The tax reduction
        depends
        upon the dollar amount of the exemption provided and the assessment ratio
    used to determine the taxable value of the property. In Louisiana, for example,
        each homeowner receives a $7,500 homestead exemption, while California homeowners
        receive a $7,000 exemption. Louisiana's program is much more generous, however,
        because the state uses a 10 percent assessment ratio to determine the taxable
        value of the home. A $100,000 house in Louisiana has a taxable value of $10,000,
        so the $7,500 homestead exemption effectively exempts $75,000 in actual value
        from property taxes. California's assessment ratio is 100 percent, so its
    homestead
    exemption is worth $7,000 in actual value.</p>
  <p>&#8220;After the homestead exemptions are calculated in the example above,
          the taxable value of a $100,000 house in California becomes $93,000, while
          the taxable
          value of a $100,000 house in Louisiana becomes $2,500. This represents a
      significant difference in benefit level because these are the amounts to which
      the property
      tax rate is applied when calculating the total tax bill.&#8221; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even tax law professor Susan Pace Hamill&#8217;s survey, done with sixty-five
  research assistants, makes no attempt to summarize them in tabular format.
  This is the most recent compilation with exhaustive documentation, concerned
  primarily with matters of equity, simply describes each state&#8217;s tax regime.
  See Susan Pace Hamill, <em>As Certain as Death: A Fifty-State Survey of State
  and Local Tax Laws</em>. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2007. Connecticut
  Law School Professor Richard Pomp compiles a frequent update of changes in
  state and local taxation on a comprehensive basis, including relevant legal
  cases. It too is chary in its effort to summary trends and patterns in a comprehensive
  manner. See. Richard D. Pomp and Oliver Oldman, <em>State and Local Taxation,
  Fifth edition</em> (2005), Hartford, CT: University of Connecticut Law School.</p>

<p>38. Despite frequent claims to the contrary, the progressive nature of the
  real property tax becomes particularly apparent when looking at who pays: typically
  about half the burden is paid by commercial and industrial parcel owners, while
  farmers&#8217; land is so remote that it usually has inconsequential market
  value. Tenants pay no tax on any land component of their rental, and share
  the incidence of the building component with builders and landlords. Only two
  empirical studies have ever been done on the subject, but both concluded that
  the real property tax is mildly progressive. See Peter Mieszkowski, &#8220;The
  Property Tax: An Excise or a Profits Tax,&#8221; <em>Journal of Public Economics</em>  1 (April 1972): 73-96, cited and discussed extensively by James Heilbrun, &quot;Who
  Bears the Burden of the Property Tax?&quot; in Lowell Harriss (ed.), The Property
  Tax and Local Finance, <em>Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science</em>, Vol
  35, #1 (1983), pp. 56-71; and Henry J. Aaron, <em>Who Pays the Property Tax:
  A New View</em>, Washington: the Brookings Institution, 1975. These are reprinted

<p>42.  Harvard Professor Martin Feldstein calculates that that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  The efficiency loss from current income taxes is more than 30 percent. If
        Social Security taxes are included, there is a 50 percent efficiency loss.
        A 10 percent
      increase in taxes would raise revenue by only $21 billion, while reducing
        efficiency by $44 billion. The study finds that these conditions are aggravated
        because
      of the progressive tax structure of the U.S. tax code. Review of Economics
    and Statistics, November, 1999. </p>
