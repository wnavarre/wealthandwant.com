</strong></p>
<p align="center">  America's No.1 pacifist, now its No.1 munitions-maker, looks at the world today-<br>
  The
most revealing interview he has ever given</p>
<p align="center">by Donald Wilhelm<br>
<em>Liberty</em> Magazine<br>
issue of September 5, 1942<br>
    <font size="-1">READING TIME. 21 MINUTES 15 SECONDS</font></p>
<p>MR. FORD'S famous 1915 peace ship established him as our number one pacifist.
  On that fantastic Babel, as it set out to stop the last war with words, he
  quickly retreated to his stateroom. And as soon as the Oscar II reached the
  other side he hurried back home, having learned much, he still says, from the,
  experience. &quot;All we're here on earth for,&quot; he likes to say, &quot;is
  to get experience.&quot;</p>
<p>He was the only American favorably mentioned in <em>Mein Kampf</em> by Hitler. This
  fact plus his pronounced, but recently renounced, views about the Jews, his
  isolationist associates and utterances, and his refusal early in this crisis
  to make airplane motors for Britain, put him on the spot.</p>
<p>He is still a pacifist, a conscientious objector. He makes no bones about
  it. He views this war, like the last, as the greatest of catastrophes; doesn't
  want to think or talk about it, and when pressed said: &quot;I hate war. I've
  always hated war. . . . You can't get me to say anything in favor of war, except
  that it gives us experience.&quot; Nevertheless, today he is probably more
  feared by Mr. Schicklgruber and the Japs than any other American except the
  President. Today he will soon be turning out a $325,000 four-motor B-24 flying
  fortress every hour, a $15,000 Pratt &amp; Whitney air-cooled airplane motor
  every half hour, with his own liquid-cooled motor also on the way; an armored
  car or a jeep every minute or two, and mountain ranges of other war items to
  blast the Axis. Today he is our number one munitions-maker.</p>
<p>His birthday is July 30. At seventy-nine one finds him on the go from sun-up
  to sundown. To interview him, you have to catch him in transit.</p>
<p>  From Washington I wrote to him asking for an interview. Back came a letter
  saying, &quot;We shall be glad to refer this to Mr. Ford at the first opportunity.&quot; I
  sent an urgent telegram. No answer. At my home in Connecticut the following
  Monday evening I took up the phone and asked our long-distance operator to
  get Henry Ford on the wire at his home at Dearborn, Michigan. She laughed,
  but I bet her a box of candy I'd get him, and won. In a minute or two his voice
  came, clear, easygoing, informal.</p>
<p>When I apologized for calling him at his home, he said, &quot;Oh, that's all
  right; Mrs. Ford and I were just sitting here reading. Where are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In Connecticut.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Golly, that's quite a distance,&quot; he
  said. &quot;Could you be here Wednesday morning, at ten, say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At nine, if you wish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right. I'll meet you at my office in the engineering building at
  nine, Wednesday morning. I'll be glad to see you.&quot; But none of his staff there
  knew
    anything about all this. At the very hour I appeared, my office in Connecticut
    was receiving a telegram saying I couldn't see Mr. Ford at all. He rarely
  came to his office, I myself was now told. He was always on the go in his car. &quot;His
    car is his office.&quot; Told to cool my heels in the reception room there,
    a moment later: I saw a Ford sedan roll up to the door. The driver slipped
    out, came in. In the front seat was a slender, small figure in gray, his
    gray hat on his lap, completely relaxed in the morning sunlight. &quot;Isn't
    that Mr. Ford out there?&quot; I asked the receptionist on his throne.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't know about that,&quot; he said, smiling.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Guess I'll go out and ask him.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Mr. Ford himself reached over to shake hands, saying, with his characteristic
    Midwest hospitality, &quot;Glad to see you. Hop in. I've got to go out to
    some kind of a doings at our new Willow Run plant. We're making bombers out
    there.&quot;</p>
<p>Bombers! I wondered how he, our number one pacifist and conscientious objector,
  felt about making bombers. I aimed to find out.</p>
<p><br>
  WE started. He was on the front seat, now and then turning his blue-green eyes,
    amazingly alert and clear for those of a man of seventy-nine, my way. I sat
    forward on the back seat, shorthand notebook on my knee.</p>
<p>&quot;This seems like a pretty good car, Mr. Ford,&quot; I began, to keep
  things informal.</p>
<p>He laughed. &quot;Step on it, Wilson. Now watch that meter!&quot;</p>
<p>It moved up to fifty miles an hour. &quot;Step on it, Wilson,&quot; he repeated
  impatiently.</p>
<p>The meter swung to sixty.</p>
<p>&quot;She'll do better than that, Wilson!&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But there's a stiff side wind, Mr. Ford,&quot; Wilson objected.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides,&quot; I said, &quot;the road's full of ruts.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    With a triumphant glance over his shoulder, the great, almost legendary Henry
    Ford now said, as proudly as a boy with some new gadget he himself has made, &quot;She'll
    do ninety!&quot;</p>
<p>First impressions: Looks like a Vermonter; . . . Looks fit. Skin clear. Hands
  young for seventy-nine. Says proudly that he never wears glasses except for
  the very closest work. . . . Eats lightly, he adds. No stimulants. Has never
  smoked (no one in the executive dining room or on a Ford job smokes, nor did
  even on Ford property until lately). . . . No sports.  No exercise except
  riding his bike now and then around his place in Dearborn. . . . What keeps
  him young?
  He and Mrs. Ford often read to each other, he says. He likes to sit in the
  sun. He never argues with anyone. He likes to relax with the children in the
  schools of the New England community he has reproduced, Dearborn Village, where,
  that they may learn by doing, he likes to help them make things. . . . So far,
  he seems an extraordinarily simple man whom interviewers and public relationists
  have chosen to make complex.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the young people who will make the future,&quot; he said. &quot;Their
  lives haven't been messed up. They're honest. But they have to know how to
  do things, how to think and work. <strong>Education is the hardest job in the
  world, the way most people have to live, without land and nature to help. .
  . . </strong>Production
  is education. People who work are learning all the time. They're getting experience.
  It's work that gives them character.</p>
<p>&quot;Politics never produces anything. It's the decaying apple.</p>
<p>&quot;Industry has given us some great educators, like the radio, the motion
  picture, and the motorcar. The motorcar brought about a greater intermingling
  of people than any other thing in history. I've never thought of it as just
  something to get around in, to be made and sold at a profit. I like to think
  about what the 25,000,000 cars and trucks we've made here at Dearborn alone
  have meant to people. You can't get more than you give. That's where God steps
  in.&quot;</p>
<p>Money as such appears to mean little to him, who probably hasn't the remotest
  idea of how much he has. <strong>&quot;Money isn't wealth,&quot; he said. &quot;People
  are always confusing money with wealth. &quot;Production is the only way to
  create wealth. </strong>Money is necessary to organize businesses and keep homes running.
  <strong>It saves transportation when you want to exchange the work you've put
  into raising a bushel of wheat, say, for the work some one else has put into
  making
  something, maybe a tool, in another part of the country.</strong> Idle money never does
  anybody any good. Gold is about the most useless metal we have. We've kept
  about the same amount of money in banks for thirty years. The main reason is
  that if we had to borrow, the bankers would try to take our institution away
  from us. They tried that &#8212; once.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  HE is probably the richest man on earth. But it's easy to believe while with
    him that money-making has never been his main interest and urge, his great
    passion, the key to his make-up. Instead, this probably has been his inventive,
    creative turn. He didn't invent the automobile. His great invention was a
    formula, first for producing watches, his first love, in a time when they
    were a luxury, then for producing cars. The formula:</p>
<p>To make things in a big way, make them cheap. To make them cheap, cut costs.
  To cut costs, make many all alike, use <strong>machines</strong> to make them. To make it possible
  for people to buy them, pay the highest wages.</p>
<p>This formula was Mr. Ford's great contribution. He didn't invent mass production,
  but he was the first to make it work in a big way. He has lived to see it adopted
  by countless other makers of things, to see it multiply and cheapen the things
  on sale, change our way of life and living, become basic to our success in
  war.</p>
<p>Lest we forget: This idea of his was at first deemed crazy. His partners quit
  him. Manufacturers here in the land of the free and brave went though the ceiling,
  came down hopping mad, when in 1914 he established five dollars as his minimum
  daily wage and cut his working day from ten to eight hours. In 1922 he increased
  his minimum wage to six dollars. In 1928 he adopted the five-day week. In 1929,
  when his friend President Hoover was begging American employers not to lower
  wages, he increased his minimum wage to seven dollars, and he held to it until
  forced by hard times back to six dollars, now his minimum for every Ford employee,
  man or woman, old or young, including many who are physically handicapped.</p>
<p>Mentioning the great company of inventive souls, I told him about stepping
  into the tent hangar of the two Wright brothers at the first big aero meet,
  at Squantum, Massachusetts, in 1910: &quot;There they were, Mr. Ford, sitting
  on their trunks on the dirt floor. And what do you suppose they were doing?
  They were studying the wings of a dead sparrow one of them had picked up coming
  back from lunch. If only they had applied the lessons of flight built into
  the wings of that sparrow, they might have advanced aviation by ten or twenty
  years.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  HE shook his head. &quot;You can't do mechanically,&quot; he objected, &quot;what
  the bird does. A bird can flap its wings. A plane can't.&quot;</p>
<p>When I said I was thinking of the shape of the sparrow's cambered wing, thick
  and rounded at the front and not kitelike as were early airplane wings, 
  he agreed: &quot;Yes, you're right.&quot; Then he said that on a Florida beach
  one day he and Mr. Edison had found a dead frigate bird. They gathered it up,
  took it home, studied it for days. &quot;It kept very well,&quot; he said. &quot;There
  was hardly any fat on it.&quot; After a pause, he added, &quot;The plover is
  one of the best flyers. I've got interested in it lately. It's becoming extinct.
  That's too bad.&quot;</p>
<p>The moment his eye lights on anything, especially anything made, his mind
  appears to be groping back to its making, to the way it was made, to the time
  given to its making by one or many craftsmen or machines. What made the Model
  T so light and cheap turned on the pioneer production of a strong vanadium
  alloy steel. All that steel companies cared much about in those days was the
  production of ordinary carbon steel. He could find only one company that would
  even try to make vanadium steel in big tonnages for him &#8212; a little outfit
  that was willing to take a chance, at Canton, Ohio. The superintendent once
  told me how Mr. Ford spent most of his hours while waiting for the first heat: &quot;He
  spent his time climbing over the scrap pile. Every now and then he'd come to
  me with a piece of metal in his hand, as excited as a boy finding something
  special. He'd say, 'I think I know, Griffith, where this came from&#8212;what kind
  of a machine, who made it.' &quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Work for some good, be it ever so slowly, <br>
    Cherish some flower, be it ever so lowly. <br>
    For work, all work, is noble and holy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He wanted, at once, a copy of this bit quoted from the blackboard of a humble
  schoolmaster in the mountains of Colorado. Deep in him is his homage to work,
  to the craftsman, to skill.</p>
<p>Deep in him, too, is his love of the soil. Not far from the throbbing great
  River Rouge plant is the modest, unmarked white farm cottage where he and Mrs.
  Ford first lived, before he quit farming, his father's vocation, to go back
  to Detroit to make his first automobile in the brick shed now located in Greenfield
  Village. Several times a year, he told me while talking about housing old and
  new, he and Mrs. Ford go there, all by themselves, to prepare and have a meal
  by themselves. <strong>While we rolled through his thousands of acres, he shook his
  head each time I mentioned the war, but warmed to talking about the soil.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;We're raising soybeans here,&quot; he said. &quot;The time will
    come when not an inch of the soil, not a single crop, not even weeds, will
    be wasted.
  Then every American family can have a piece of land. We ought to tax all idle
  land the way Henry George said &#8212; tax it heavily, so that its owners would
  have to make it productive.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>He wants everyone to see the many small factories he has built within fifty
  miles of Dearborn and operates at a loss, no doubt. These small factories,
  each making a single item &#8212; magnetos, for example &#8212; reflect <strong>his
  hunger to get people back on the land.</strong> <strong>&quot;The family of every American workingman,&quot; he
  insists, &quot;should have a piece of land.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>A prime reason why he has never given a dollar to Detroit charities (his son,
  Edsel, makes up handsomely for him) is that public relief, as he sees it, prevents
  people from going back, or being driven back, to the land. &quot;Public relief,&quot; he
  said, &quot;is the greatest curse that ever struck the earth. No one ever gets
  anything for nothing.&quot; His idea of being helpful is manifested in other
  ways. For example, years ago he had a study made of the percentage of people
  in the State of Michigan who had physical handicaps of any kind. Then he made
  places for a like percentage of physically handicapped men and women in his
  own employment &#8212; so many who were deaf, lame, one-legged or one-armed, so
  many with arrested cases of tuberculosis, and so on. Each, of course, receives
  full pay. And because of their special devotion to their work he believes they
  do their part well, often much. better than others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHEN I mentioned the war the third or fourth time, he turned around in his
  seat and said: &quot;I have always hated war. The last war threw civilization
  back a half century. No one wins a modern war except a few warmongers, maybe
  a hundred. The common people never win. War comes to their doors and takes
  their sons, takes men away from the work they want to do in providing people
  with the things they need. It takes things away from them. It takes the money
  they've saved to educate their children. It taxes them to pay for things destroyed.
  . . . This country should be strong enough to put an end to this senseless
  destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But this war?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;War is destruction,&quot; he said. &quot;No, sir, you can't get me to
  say anything in favor of war except that it teaches us. It gives us experience,
  and all we're here on earth for is to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Not knowing that he believes we are all destined to come back to earth again
  and that he has said he only hopes Mrs. Ford will be at his side, I said, too
  lightly, &quot;I wonder!&quot;</p>
<p>Feeling his reproving look, and the driver's, I added: &quot;I don't know,
  Mr. Ford. The older I get, the less I know. For instance, I never did understand
  how my mother, a widow with six children, always knew in advance when anything
  was about to go wrong. I've always thought it was because she was French and
  the French are supposed to be intuitive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's experience,&quot; he said simply.&quot;She'd lived before.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    Where about a hundred men, including his son Edsel, Charles Sorenson, and
    a large group of British and American officers in uniform were waiting for
    him, he stepped out. A power shovel was working near by. There were questions
    these men wanted answered by him, problems on which they wanted his advice,
    as teacher and trouble shooter. This is his main function these days. Where
    he finds, by sidling alongside a workman or an executive and quietly asking, &quot;How
    are things going?&quot; that they are going all right, he is on his way at
    once. But where there is a problem or trouble, there you'll find him. There
    he'll ask, &quot;What have you done, so far?&quot; They'll tell him. &quot;Why
    wouldn't it work?&quot; he asked one group. They told him. &quot;Why not
    try it this way?&quot; &#8212; and his mind and his small competent hands went
    to work suggesting a new plan. One raised a question, another an objection. &quot;Go
    ahead and try it,&quot; he said. &quot;If it don't work, we'll learn something.&quot; And,
    as one told me, in a day or two he'll be back, wanting a report, taking up
    any new problems.</p>
<p>Also he applies his own ideas about choosing men for important jobs. Months
  back he paused on his rounds to say to the youngster now in charge of production
  at the huge bomber plant, &quot;You're going to run it.&quot; The youngster
  said, &quot;But, Mr. Ford, I don't know anything about running a bomber plant!&quot; Mr.
  Ford answered, &quot;It's time you learned,&quot; and that was that.</p>
<p>Almost every morning until this crisis came to upset all his plans, he attended
  the simple nonsectarian service conducted wholly by the young folks in his
  schools in Greenfield Village. In the little New England Martha-Mary Chapel
  (named for Mrs. Ford's mother and his) he had me sit in the balcony with him
  one morning. After the Doxology, a hymn, the Lord's Prayer, another hymn and
  the reading of the Twenty-third Psalm, then a third hymn and a recitation of
  Van Dyke's poem on work by a boy, came three songs &#8212; Old Black Joe, a solo,
  My Little Gray Home in the West, by a young miss, and Auld Lang Syne.</p>
<p>He looked on &#8212; more interested, it seemed, in the young folk, most of whom
  he knows by their first names, than in the service itself. Afterward, when
  I said I wished I could come every morning, said young people were good for
  the soul, again he said, smiling, &quot;They're honest!&quot;</p>
<p>Then, in the office of his personal secretary, he settled himself in a chair,
  pushed off the light, black low shoes that the proud shoemaker in the Village
  makes for him, put his feet on the radiator, and talked nearly two hours about
  postwar America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EVEN at seventy-nine, apparently the future interests him far more than the
  past, the present, or even the job that his big empire is doing &#8212; making munitions
  of war. &quot;There's no need of this country having hard times after peace
  comes,&quot; he said, &quot;if we pull together and use our experience. . .
  . We can look forward to many of the most prosperous years we've ever had.&quot;</p>
<p>When reminded that a depression has followed every war we've had, he answered, &quot;Things
  are different now.&quot; And when reminded that this <strong>war is destroying
  more wealth</strong>, whether measured in lives or in money, than all the wars of the past
  combined, he said, &quot;If this war ended tomorrow there'd be a big gap to
  be filled. <strong>Right now there are shortages of many things people want,
  and the shortages are increasing. Even before we had to defend ourselves you
  couldn't
  show me one man or woman who had plenty of everything. For everyone with half
  enough I could show you many who didn't have the simplest essentials of decent
  living, like good food and shelter and education.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>We Americans were a lot better off at that, he went on, than the people in
  other countries. Nature didn't distribute her gifts equally; people had never
  used them equally. We made out better than most. We lifted ourselves by our
  own bootstraps. We can do it again. <strong>&quot;This country is too rich in its land
  and other resources, in inventive, scientific, and manufacturing skill,&quot; he
  insisted, &quot;to go down.</strong> If the war goes on another year or two there will
  be demand for all we can make. We'll have to help many other countries. The
  gap is getting bigger all the time. It will be up to industry to fill it.</p>
<p>&quot;Production is the only way to have prosperity. I've been saying this
  for forty years. It was true then. It's true now. It will be true after this
  war.&quot;</p>
<p>There isn't such a thing as overproduction, he agreed. The problem is to maintain
  purchasing power, he said, and added, &quot;The first thing the country should
  do when peace comes is to issue currency in dollars to pay back to the people
  the money they've loaned the government. That money would provide purchasing
  power, keep industry going, provide jobs, until we get squared around.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That idea, of working the printing presses to make more dollars, sure
  will make some people see red, Mr. Ford,&quot; it was suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Let 'em!&quot; he answered. Then he added: <strong>&quot;The dollar is good
  all over the world. That's because there's plenty to make it good. It's backed
  up by the government, by the people of the country, by their ability to work.</strong>  It don't even need to be backed up by all that gold we've got buried underground.
  Use that, if you have to. It's no good where it is. Idle money never does anyone
  any good. It never has. You've got to put it to work. There'll be plenty
  of work for it to do.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>He looks upon our enormous wartime increase in industrial capacity
    as an asset, not a liability, especially if governments will refrain from
    erecting barriers
  to the free flow of goods.</strong> When reminded that war plants would have to be converted
  back to the ways of peace, he said, &quot;That will have to be worked out.&quot; Then,
  noting that new industries have always been necessary to prosperity, he emphasized
  the future importance of aviation. &quot;The generation before mine,&quot; he
  said, &quot;gave us the railroads. My generation produced the automobile. Everybody
  will be flying after the war. There's always been a place in the world for
  any new way &quot;to improve transportation and communication.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    When told about a transcontinental trucker who expects big planes to carry
    one's household goods from coast to coast overnight, he said, &quot;That's
    right!&quot;</p>
<p> <br>
  TAKE homes&quot; he went on. &quot;How many people have really decent homes?
  If we built new homes at the peak rate for six or seven years, it would still
  be way behind in the kind of homes that most people nowadays want. &quot;Mrs.
  Ford and I have enjoyed seeing what we could do to fix up the old farmhouse,
  but most people will want a new kind of home with the last word of economy
  in construction, care, heating, air conditioning, comforts and conveniences.
  Why not?. . .
    The only way to put such homes within the 'reach of millions or families
      is to use new kinds of material and make them, at least in large part,
      in factories
    working all the year around. This will mean a big new industry, a lot of
      work and jobs all over the country.<br>
      <br>
&quot;It only takes a couple of new industries like aviation and housing to
make a big difference. There'll be others.&quot; </p>
<p>Science and invention, he said, will help to provide new industries, products,
  and services. War always stimulates invention as well as scientific effort.
  We have the most generous patent system in the world. Our government has issued
  more than 2,000,000 patents, mostly to &quot;lone&quot; inventors. The most
  productive years in an inventor's life are those under thirty. . The young
  inventors in this country have a better chance to come through than the young
  men in most other countries, especially those countries that have been preparing
  for war and fighting longer. At the beginning of the last war we had scarcely
  200 industrial research laboratories. Now we have more than 2,000.<br>
    <br>
    Mr. Ford is enormously impressed by the achievements of our laboratories.
    Twelve years ago he became interested in a young man, the son of one of
    his employees, who had gone to school in Greenfield Village, then with his
    father
    had been transferred to Wayside Inn, near Concord, Massachusetts, a Ford
    property. In Greenfield Village Mr, Ford built a laboratory resembling an
    old flour mill, for this young man, Robert Boyer, and told him to go ahead
    and see what he could find out about using farm crops in industry.</p>
<p>One evening, a year later, he stopped in. They discussed the findings. Learning
  that the best prospects lay with <strong>soybeans</strong>, he told his research
  director to go ahead and concentrate on those. Since then the humble soybean
  has swiftly
  increased in both agricultural and industrial importance. In addition to twenty-odd
  plastic and other industrial uses for it, within the last year Mr. Boyer and
  his technical associates have found a way to produce from it a new material
  resembling wool but better for some purposes &#8212; felt, for hats, is one.
  This achievement especially pleases Mr. Ford. &quot;Heretofore,&quot; he explained, &quot;wool
  has always had to come from animals. Now we can make it in a factory. We're
  turning to wheat, and we've already found twenty different substances in it,
  a surplus crop, that we can use in our plants. There is no limit to the uses
  of crops and also farm wastes in industry.&quot;</p>
<p>He did not discuss many of the post-war pros and cons that hundreds of Washington
  weather prophets are studying. Arriving at his conclusions in his own way,
  he reveals greater confidence than many of them.</p>
<p><br>
  AFTER two hours he pulled on his shoes, got up, and with his surprising quickness
    led me out through a corridor to about an acre of a floor as clean and polished
    as any ballroom's, though many men were working at machines on it. &quot;The
    first thing we always do,&quot; he explained, &quot;is to clean up, to see
    what's to be done.&quot; He explained what was being done here, and the advantages
    of the machines being used. Next he led me to a jewelry shop serving the
    museum. Here he chatted with one of the jewelers and, with his old love of
    watches, deftly opened a tiny watch encased in a twenty-dollar gold piece
    which the jeweler could not open. Now, leading me back, he said, &quot;You'd
    better come in and use my office. I'll send in a stenographer, typewriter,
    paper, anything you want.&quot;</p>
<p>In this office he never uses, he smiled as I glanced about at the carved mantel,
  rich hangings, huge Oriental rug, and costly furniture. &quot;I never liked
  it, either,&quot; he said, laughing. &quot;I feel more at home in a barn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May I take off my coat?&quot; I asked. He answered by peeling off his. &quot;Make
  yourself at home. Do anything you like,&quot; he said, tinkering with the:
  Swiss music box in its handsome case, and observing, &quot;It needs a little
  oil.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    He got it going. His feet moved a few steps in rhythm with a waltz. He turned
    it off. At the door he said, &quot;Just push the little lever and start it
    up when you want me to come back to go over what I said.&quot;</p>
