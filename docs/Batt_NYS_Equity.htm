  <p><strong>Solution to School Finance Equity Dilemma in NY State:<br>
    A Response to the Court of Appeals Decision to provide <br>

<p>The Court of Appeals has spoken.<font size="-1"><strong><em>1</em></strong></font> The State Legislature is challenged in response
  to find an additional $4 to 6 Billion to support the New York City School System,
  as described by the continuing Campaign for Fiscal Equity, an organization
expressly designed to press for this resolution.</p>

<p>Where will the money come from? It can come from only three possible sources:
  taxes on land, labor,<font size="-1"><strong><em>2</em></strong></font> or capital.<font size="-1"><strong><em>3 </em></strong></font>Land in economics refers to all natural
  resources &#8212; air,
  water, the radio spectrum &#8212; plus land in the more common sense of acreage
  and urban sites. Unfortunately some neoclassical economists have effectively
  hidden and defined land out of existence, classifying it as capital, a grave
  mistake.<font size="-1"><strong><em>4</em></strong></font> This blinds many otherwise proficient students of economics and public
finance to an obvious solution to this school finance crisis.</p>

<p>Negative consequences of taxing labor and capital are profound. Taxing labor

<p>In contrast, if land is the tax base, there is no such loss. Clearly the same
  amount of land remains after land is taxed, as advocates of taxing the economic
  rent from land point out. </p>
<p>The beneficial effects of taxing land have been noted by at least eight Nobel
  Prize-winning economists.<font size="-1"><strong><em>7</em></strong></font> Moreover,
  taxing land value &#8211; or location value  &#8211; comports
  with all the textbook principles of sound tax theory.<font size="-1"><strong><em>8</em></strong></font> Indeed the more the
  economic rent of land is collected as a public revenue source, the greater
  the positive
  effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Taxing land fosters its more intensive and efficient use. </li>
  <li> It engenders greater economic vitality by exerting downward pressure
  on the market price of sites so that their acquisition becomes more feasible
  to potential
          users.</li>
  <li> Potential developers are able to secure their first choice of locations
    rather than being driven to second-best sub-optimal sites.</li>
  <li> Taxing prime locations discourages their being held off the market by
      speculators, making the full array of locational choices available for appropriate
      use.</li>
  <li> Taxing land reverses the centrifugal forces of sprawl development by
        making sites in core areas competitive with sites at the periphery. Cities thereby
                become more livable.</li>

  of ever greater tax rates on land than on improvements, Mayor Stephen Reed

  new investment. The number of businesses on the City&#8217;s tax rolls has
  increased from 1,908 to more than 5,900. Taxable real estate values have increased
  from
  an aggregate of $212 million to over $1.6 billion. The number of vacant properties
  has been cut by 85%.&#8221; The crime rate has been reduced 54% and the fire
  rate has dropped over 76%. Mayor Reed, re-elected continually since 1982, was
  just named one of the world&#8217;s most outstanding mayors.<font size="-1"><strong><em>12</em></strong></font> The City&#8217;s

<p>A tax on land values is eminently fair. It correlates highly with ability
to pay. At the same time it serves as a benefit fee or user charge. </p>
<p>Look first at matters of ability to pay or what may be called vertical equity.
  Households that own no land pay no land taxes even indirectly. Land, being &#8220;inelastic&#8221; or
  fixed in supply, means land owners cannot pass taxes forward to tenants. Taxes
  on structures can be shifted, but not the taxes on land.<font size="-1"><strong><em>13</em></strong></font> Thus the roughly
  one third of all households who are tenants, largely poor people, pay no property
  taxes. Of those that do own real estate -- homeowners, businesses, industries,
  and farmers &#8211; roughly half the aggregate burden in normal circumstances
  is paid by non-residential titleholders. Valuable parcels are typically located
  in the urban centers, and homeowners are at the urban peripheries. Remote farmland
  usually is inconsequential for tax revenue &#8211; if it isn&#8217;t protected
  in any case by other save-harmless clauses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>14</em></strong></font> Maps of land value typically
  look like those showing elevation above sea level, downtowns constituting the
  peaks.<font size="-1"><strong><em>15 </em></strong></font>Empirical studies on the incidence of the property tax also show that it is
  progressive.<font size="-1"><strong><em>16</em></strong></font> At the same time it fares well by the other criterion of fairness,
  payment according to use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>17</em></strong></font></p>

<p>  It is timely to note the effect of a land tax on the market price of real
        estate. It is well understood that buildings depreciate over time. Just
        as cars, computers,
      and factory equipment get old and obsolete even with maintenance, so do
      buildings. The rise in the market price of real estate comes from the appreciation
      of
      land, not from the homes or commercial buildings on the land.</p>
<p>  What creates this land value? In part it reflects the overall entrepreneurial
  activity in a location, rather than what any given titleholder does to the
  site. It also reflects the general vitality of a neighborhood or region. And
  it very much results from the totality of public facilities and services serving
a locality. In sum, the value of land is community created.</p>
<p>  Land speculation may be understood as the attempt by owners, who apparently
  have little interest in tapping the productive potential of their sites, to
  ride the upward market trends and to reap these socially created land values.
  Often the owners reap these gains by waiting to be bought out by public ventures
  after suitable time passes. John Stuart Mill noted<font size="-1"><strong><em>18</em></strong></font> that </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>landlords grow richer
    in their sleep without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the
    value of land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
    should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold title. </em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does not prevent opportunistic speculators from pirating the public birthright
  when the opportunity arises.<font size="-1"><strong><em>19</em></strong></font> A century ago commentator William Riordan aptly
  portrayed New York ex-Senator George Washington Plunkitt&#8217;s saying.<font size="-1"><strong><em>20</em></strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <em>There&#8217;s an honest graft, and I&#8217;m an example of how it works. I
    might sum up the whole thing by sayin&#8217;: &#8220;I seen my opportunities
    and I took &#8216;em.&#8221;</em></p>
  <p><em>    Just let me explain by examples. My party&#8217;s in power in the city, and
      its goin&#8217; to undertake a lot of public improvements. Well, I&#8217;m
      tipped off, say, that they&#8217;re going to lay out a new park in a certain
      place.</em></p>
  <p><em>    I see my opportunity and I take it. I go to that place and I buy up all the
    land I can in the neighborhood. Then the board of this or that makes its
      plan public, and there is a rush to get my land, which nobody cared particularly
    for before.</em></p>
  <p><em> Ain&#8217;t it perfectly honest to charge a good price and make a profit on
    my investment and foresight? Of course, it is. Well, that&#8217;s honest
    graft.</em></p>

<p>But when a land tax is in place, the economic rent is recovered by the community
      so that land doesn&#8217;t rise in market price. It is stabilized. And
      there is no opportunity for such trickery. Real estate, especially residential
      property, thereby becomes more affordable. The greater the tax on land
      parcels,
      the greater
      the downward pressure on market prices. A land tax is the only tax that
      actually works to foster economic growth. The higher the tax on land value,
      the greater
      the incentive to economic vitality. This was recognized in a notable article
in Fortune Magazine over two decades ago.<font size="-1"><strong><em>21</em></strong></font></p>

</blockquote>
<p>It is this logic, taken in total, that invites consideration of a land value
  tax, administered statewide at a single rate, as a solution to New York State&#8217;s
  need to come up with $5 billion. Keeping in mind once more that the higher
  the tax on land the more it drives down the market price of real estate, and
  the higher the tax the more it removes the deadweight loss hampering economic
  development, it should become clear that instituting such a measure would solve
  the problem of securing the necessary revenue. With sound land assessment statewide,
  a rate can be calculated that will bring in the required total. Down the road,
  the sales prices of such parcels may well be lower while titleholders pay more &#8220;up
  front.&#8221; But even this prospect needs to be qualified, as increased activity
  may work in the opposite direction.<font size="-1"><strong><em>22</em></strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">22 This argument is effectively made by Professor Nicolaus
      Tideman, in, among others, his &#8220;Taxing Land is Better than Neutral: Land Taxes, Land Speculation,
    and the Timing of Development,&#8221; in Kenneth C. Wenzer (ed.), <em>Land
    Value Taxation: The Equitable and Efficient Source of Public Finance</em>. Armonk, NY:

</blockquote>
<p>The most likely question is how the burden will be borne. Much of the obligation
  will fall on parcels that are underused relative to their value &#8211; often
  locations not as productive as they potentially could be. This will provide
  an incentive to their improvement, so that their contribution to neighborhood
  and regional economic health will further enhance overall site values. If at
  the same time local taxes on improvements are phased out, as is occurring in
  Harrisburg and other Pennsylvania cities, the overall burden on parcels which
  contribute most to economic vitality will begin to decline relative to others.</p>
<p>There is also the question of how to treat the case of the proverbial &#8220;poor
  widow&#8221; who may otherwise be driven out of her home. Such situations exist
  under current tax regimes, so that the application of a land tax constitutes
  a situation no different. What many states have done is to institute a practice
  of tax deferral, reserving the option for such titleholders to pay in full,
  with interest, when their homes are finally sold. This may come at time of
  transfer to other living arrangements or at death. Even with the recapture
  of deferred obligations, the increase in market prices is typically far greater
  than what taxes are due. One recent study notes that some 24 states employ
  property tax deferral provisions of one sort or another.<font size="-1"><strong><em>23</em></strong></font> This relief mechanism
  is far more just than others such as the oft-mentioned circuit-breaker or various
  tax credits or exemptions. The reason is that there is no net loss of tax revenue,
  and better use of residential infrastructure is likely to eventuate. There
  is no reason for young households to be locked out of housing opportunities
  for lack of ability to afford them, or for inheritors of elderly titleholders
  to reap the windfall gains from what is essentially the accretion of economic
  rent to the value of property sites.</p>

<p>A statewide tax on land values would foster efficient economic policies to
  serve both upstate and downstate regions. Real estate values are far greater
  downstate than upstate, to the point that they make housing oft-times unaffordable.
  A statewide land value tax raises the necessary revenue by driving down market
  prices of real estate. Any parcel with a building to land ratio greater than
  the average would pay proportionately less with a tax shift off improvements.
  Any parcel with a below average ratio would pay more. Vacant lots in high value
  areas would bear the greatest increase, fostering their development. By recovering
  the economic rent that otherwise accretes, the economies are relieved of the
  deadweight loss, or excess burden, that exerts a dampening influence on market
  transactions. Again, the greater the tax, the greater the impetus to economic
stimulation.</p>
<p>In upstate regions, where the economic conditions are often moribund, the
  same factors apply to a lesser degree. The excess burden of economic rent is
  removed from land markets, and the impact on land use configurations is likely
  to be positive in as much as vacant and underused parcels will be most affected.
  Because the market prices of real estate, largely reflected in land values,
  are so much lower upstate than they are downstate, a single statewide tax rate
  on land values is likely to raise the greatest proportion of revenue from downstate
  regions, even while it is viewed as &#8220;fair&#8221; by its being a single
  statewide levy. This is important as a political consideration, because any
  other revenue stream from hard-pressed upstate regions will be catastrophic.
  Only a tax on land values can have a positive impact on economic circumstances.</p>
<p>It remains to be explored how such a design will work &#8211; how accurate
  assessments of land value can be made to be,<font size="-1"><strong><em>24</em></strong></font> how
  easy it can be to educate the citizenry about a new paradigm of economics and
  taxation so that such a
  regime can be politically acceptable, and what proportion of the revenue stream
  will derive from various regions of the state. But these are empirical questions,
  and they can be quickly and easily determined. Computer-assisted assessment
  of land by itself is far easier to carry out than is assessment of land and
  building values together.<font size="-1"><strong><em>25</em></strong></font> Simulating
  the feasibility and the results would likely be achieved in a matter of hours. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">24  By far the largest component of land value is in cities,
      typically upwards of 90 percent, and the ability to accurately assess such
      parcels is very
    much dependent upon data on adjacent sites. The official handbook of The
    International
    Association of Assessing Officers states (p.547) that &#8220;the chief measure
    of uniformity [in aggregate analysis] is the coefficient of dispersion (COD),
    which, depending on the nature of the properties involved, should not exceed
    10.0-15.0 for residential properties, 15.0-20.0 for commercial properties,
    and 20.0 for vacant [i.e., rural] land.&#8221; Joseph K. Eckert, et al, <em>Property
    Appraisal and Assessment Administration</em>, Chicago: IAAO, 1990. The revolution
    in computerized assessment is fast making such tolerances far too generous,
  and will soon in fact at least be halved.<br>

<p>Apart from the technical feasibility and economic soundness of a statewide
  land value tax, there is a matter of its attractiveness as an environmental
  policy, and as a matter of economic and political justice. As an environmental
  policy, numerous organizations have come to see the virtues of a tax on land
  value; an extensive list can be found on the website of the Center for the
  Study of Economics.<font size="-1"><strong><em>26</em></strong></font> As a matter of political and economic justice, no name
  is more closely associated with these principles than the greatest advocate
  of this philosophy and approach: Henry George. At the time of his death in
  1897, he was, along with Thomas Edison and Mark Twain, the most famous man
  in America. Today, a Google search on the words &#8220;economic justice&#8221; calls
  up among the top listings the Georgist websites, <a href="http://www.progress.org">www.progress.org</a> and <a href="http://www.earthrights.net">www.earthrights.net</a>.
  Two recent articles by this writer further explain how land value taxation
  can facilitate solutions to contemporary problems of a wide-ranging sort.<font size="-1"><strong><em>28</em></strong></font> </p>

<p>In the final analysis, a statewide land tax is neither difficult nor alien
  to New York State. Almost a decade ago, the City of Amsterdam sought to institute
  it, and in fact did so for one year. Prior to so doing a legal ruling was necessary
  to deem it constitutional in New York, and the already available assessment
  roll separation of land values from totals made the shift a matter of a small
  computer adjustment. Unfortunately, however, the assessments were of poor quality,
  and titleholders blamed the land value tax regime for the disparities they
  noticed perhaps for the first time. The policy was rescinded, but not before
many lessons were gained about its future implementation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>29</em></strong></font></p>

<p>Nor is a statewide property tax something without precedent in New York.
      As early as 1799, one mill was levied on real estate and personal property,
      and this was continued intermittently until 1842. After that time an effort
      was begin in earnest and the tax continued throughout the 19th century.<font size="-1"><strong><em>30</em></strong></font>  Roughly three quarters of the property tax was on real property. In the
      early period,
      sale of public lands constituted a significant proportion of the state&#8217;s
      revenue, but records show that over $90,000 in property taxes were netted
      in the year 1800. Although the total vacillated greatly from year to year,
      the amount reached $1.25 million by 1854, and $7.8 million by 1890. Sowers&#8217; <em>Financial
      History of New York State</em> shows that by 1912 state property taxes totaled
      $6,325,823, constituting 10.5 percent of total state revenues.<font size="-1"><strong><em>31</em></strong></font></p>

<p>What are the alternatives? There are none. Every other tax choice has strong
  downside consequences. Every other revenue stream penalizes real estate development,
  depresses investment and savings, discourages work, drives out economic expansion,
  and/or stifles commerce. If New York intends to address the challenge handed
  it by the Court, it will examine, and adopt, a statewide land value tax. It
  will lead the way to a revitalized New York State.</p>
