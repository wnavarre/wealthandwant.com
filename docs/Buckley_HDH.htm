<p align="center"><strong>Home, Dear Home</strong></p>
<p align="center">By William F. Buckley, Jr. <br>
  Tuesday, October 18, 2005</p>
<p>The real estate boom is a familiar phenomenon. Most people are predicting
  that it will, if not burst, at least wilt. But the basic components aren't
  going to change, not unless we have a catastrophe of sorts, something economists
  don't feel obliged to integrate into their speculations.</p>
<p>The components are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  a relatively wealthy community;</li>
  <li> the hard desire to own one's own house, along with the ambition to make
    it more and more comfortable and pleasing;</li>
  <li> the dependence of building sites on immediate amenities (sewage,
    power); and</li>
  <li> strategic sources of nourishment (jobs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The convenience of infinitely available land faded as urbanization brought
  on heavy dependence on elements that weren't always available to homes on the
  range. Schools and hospitals are not only useful for educating children and
  curing the infirm. They are necessary to attract affluent home buyers.</p>
<p>Jon Gertner, writing for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, gives a useful account
  of the home-building industry. Here are some basic indices. </p>
<ul>
  <li>We have 34 million
        rented apartments at this point and 74 million owner-occupied homes. </li>
  <li>The
        pool is being fed
    <ul>
      <li>by immigrants seeking houses, </li>
      <li>by children growing and
                seeking their own homes, and </li>
      <li>by the elderly wanting a second
          house in which to vacation
                        or retire. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The home-building industry has constructed
          about 13.5 million single-family
                          homes since the mid-1990s.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why is the cost of housing so high?</p>
<p>We learn that the average new house nationwide now sells for nearly $300,000.
  The writer tells us, &quot;I asked (a builder) what our children -- my kids
  are both under 8, I told him -- would be paying when they're ready to buy.</p>
<p>&quot;'They're going to live with us until they're 40,' (the builder) said
  matter-of-factly. 'And when they have their second kid, then we'll finally
  kick them out and make them pay for the house that we paid for. And that house
  will cost them 45 to 50 percent of their income.'&quot;</p>
<p>Such data are dismaying, but perspective helps. &quot;In Britain,&quot; the
  builder explains, &quot;you pay seven times your annual income for a home;
  in the U.S. you pay three and a half.&quot; The Brits get 330 square feet per
  person in their homes; Americans, 750 square feet. But choice parts of the
  United States face &quot;build-out.&quot; Consider New Jersey. It currently
  averages 1,165 people per square mile -- denser than India (914) and Japan
  (835).</p>
<p>And we confront, finally and inevitably, the question: What is to be done
  about it?</p>
<p>Almost without exception, housing specialists concur, high home prices are
  owing to zoning. Twenty years ago, in many quarters of the country, one year
  would go by before the political authority would permit a developer to begin
  housing construction. In New Jersey, that interval now approaches eight years.
  Delays of that kind have the effect of shrinking the amount of land on which
  houses can be constructed. We get the inflated costs so familiar. &quot;(Some
  authorities) used sample prices from 25 areas to show that the cost of housing
  in a metropolitan area appears to be in direct correlation to its degree of
  zoning ordinances,&quot; Gertner writes.</p>
<p>This is a politically remote source of trouble. People who have to wait for
  a zoning agency to change its conventions, regulations, traditions and idiosyncrasies
  will be very old before they acquire a new home.</p>
<p> Henry George, the eminent social philosopher of a century ago, turned the
        attention of planners and economists, however briefly, to the indefeasible
        factor of
    land scarcity. Capital and labor can increase; land cannot.</p>
<p>Accordingly, George was the apostle of the single tax. It aimed most directly
  at land speculators. His insights would focus now on the limitations on the
  use of land imposed by zoning. If John Jones wants an acre protecting his house,
  he is laying claim to something that cannot expand in size. Since land, in
  George's analysis, is forever limited, it must be thought of and treated as
  common property. And therefore the rental value of one acre should constitute
  a tax (the single tax) on the person who sequesters it for himself.</p>
<p>A strong case can be made for the amenities of zoning laws. But they have
  an effect on the availability of housing, and on its cost. One result is that
  housing costs are increasing faster than inflation.</p>
<p>But is the Henry George factor likely to be espoused in political platforms?
  It cannot happen soon because too many interests are vested in zoning laws.
  But sharp political eyes should be trained on the question, in search of a
  viable formulation designed to fight against homelessness for grandchildren
  who cannot be expected to pay the projected cost of housing.</p>

            with the idea that zoning laws are the key influence on land prices.

            zoning

          land values can be as much as 100,000 times that of agricultural land!
