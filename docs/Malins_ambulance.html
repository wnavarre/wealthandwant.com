          I first heard this analogy in a sermon, and assumed it to be original
        with the preacher.&nbsp; But when I heard it from a second source, I
        went looking for more about it, and was surprised to learn that it
        dates back
        to 1895.&nbsp; I've collected several versions and references to it,
        for your reading pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last is my favorite, for
        reasons that will become obvious.<br>
        <br>
        While driving ambulances and building fences are important, I submit
        that there is a third task worthy of our attention in the twenty-first
        century: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shining
        Mount-Rushmore-at-night illumination on the cliff, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">proceeding to
        tear it down</span>.</span>&nbsp; Perhaps "<span

        cat</a>."&nbsp; If
        you don't yet see the cliff of which I speak, take a look at some of
        Henry George's speeches, such as The Irish Land Question
        or <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a>, two of the "essential documents" listed
        on the <a href="../index.htm">main

        <br>
        As you read of it, think of the cliffs of the 21st century: bankruptcy,
        homelessness, hunger, poverty &#8212; and think about the fences and
        ambulances, and
        how we might tear down the cliffs rather than simply building more
        fences or volunteering to drive ambulances. There is no shortage of natural
        disasters to which we can devote our charitable efforts; let's fix the
        manmade hazards.
        The
        cliff
        we
        face
        is
        economic injustice,
        and
        not to tear it down is to perpetuate that injustice, or allow it to be
        perpetuated in our names. <br>

<p>There was a poem written many years ago by Joseph Malens, entitled
"An Ambulance Down in the Valley." It talks about a town that had
once engaged in a very bitter debate about whether the best way to
deal with the problem they had of people falling off this cliff high
above the city was to raise funds to build a fence at the top of the
cliff, or to continue to raise funds to park an ambulance down in the
valley that was very efficiently hauling people off to the hospital.
A lot of the townspeople said, "Look, we've always had an ambulance
there and it's worked very well. Why should we raise more funds to
build a fence?" But finally common sense hit. Someone stood up and
said, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," and the old
man's logic won the day. They came to their senses. But the crux of
the problem in America is found in the spiritual condition of
Americans. We can talk about war. <em><strong>We can talk about rampant
pornography and abortion, and all of the other social problems,
including child abuse, crime, and murder, but the root cause is what
we need to treat.</strong></em></p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">The Fence &amp;
The Ambulance*
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">by Scott Nearing
</div>
<p>Fences and Ambulances. In my early years I came across a poem
called "The Fence and the Ambulance." The theme was of a dangerous
cliff from which people fell and were killed or badly injured.
Kindhearted citizens subscribed to buy and maintain an ambulance at
the foot of the cliff to take care of the victims. Others, however,
demanded that a fence be built along the cliff so that people would
no longer fall over. Social workers were those who operated the
ambulance after the accidents occurred. Radicals insisted on a fence.
For years I subscribed, figuratively and literally, to the ambulance
fund. Gradually, I turned my thoughts and energies to fence
building.</p>
<p>Does Giving Help? The Garland Fund episode was a wonderful object
lesson in the futility and iniquity of private giving. If someone is
hungry, you can satisfy him with a square meal. Such giving takes
care of the hunger temporarily but it is no answer to the problem of
poverty. At the same time, the recipient has been taught to live
parasitically and to return for a second handout and a third. Beggary
is institutionalized, poverty made tolerable.</p>
<p>Private philanthropy, even when it is directed with the best
intentions, is not an answer to economic injustice. It may help tide
an individual over emergencies, but subsidies to institutions make
the subsidized satisfied with handouts, and eager to come back for
more as soon as possible. The Garland Fund aimed to put
left-of-center institutions "on their feet." What the grants did was
make them permanent beggars from the Garland Fund and other
foundations.</p>
<p>When I resigned from the Garland Fund after a decade of service I
posed a serious question to the Board: having given away millions,
have we not done more harm than good? My own feeling was that the
harm predominated. Senator William Fulbright, who has had years of
experience with international handouts, reaches a similar conclusion
in his book The Arrogance of Power. Bilateral foreign aid, he says,
"is run as a kind of charity demeaning to both recipient and
donor."</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Reclaiming Our
Health: Fences Again*</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">by John Robbins</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a large and rich country where people
kept falling over a steep cliff. They'd fall to the bottom and be
injured, sometimes quite seriously, and many of them died. The
nation's medical establishment responded to the situation by
positioning, at the base of the cliff, the most sophisticated and
expensive ambulance fleet ever developed, which would immediately
rush those who had fallen to modern hospitals that were equipped with
the latest technological wizardry. No expense was too great, they
said, when people's health was at stake.</p>
<p>Now it happened that it occurred to certain people that another
possibility would be to erect a fence at the top of the cliff. When
they voiced the idea, however, they found themselves ignored. The
ambulance drivers were not particularly keen on the idea, nor were
the people who manufactured the ambulances, nor those who made their
living and enjoyed prestige in the hospital industry. The medical
authorities explained patiently that the problem was far more complex
than people realized, that while building a fence might seem like an
interesting idea it was actually far from practical, and that health
was too important to be left in the hands of people
[carpenters] who were not [medical] experts. Leave it
to us, they said, for with enough money we will soon be able to
genetically engineer people who do not bruise or become injured from
such falls.</p>
<p>So no fences were built, and as time passed this nation found
itself spending an ever-increasing amount of its financial resources
on hospitals and high-tech medical equipment. In fact, it came to
spend far more money on medical services than any nation had ever
done in the history of the world. Money that could have gone to
community services, decent housing, education, and good food was not
available to the people, for it was being spent on ambulances and
hospitals. As the cost of treating people kept rising, growing
numbers of people could not afford medical care...</p>
<p>The more people kept falling off the cliff, the more a sense of
urgency and tension developed, and the more of the country's money
was poured into the heroic search for a drug that could be given to
those who had fallen to cure their injuries. When some people pointed
out how fruitless the search had been thus far, and questioned
whether a cure would ever by found, the research industry answered
with massive public relations campaigns showing men in white coats
holding the broken bodies of children who had fallen, pleading,
"Don't quit on us now, we're almost there."</p>
<p>When a few families who had lost loved ones tried to erect warning
signs at the top of the cliff, they were arrested for trespassing.
When some of the more enlightened physicians began to say that the
medical authorities should publicly warn people that falling off the
cliff was dangerous, representatives from powerful industries
denounced them as "health police." A fierce battle ensued, and
finally, after many compromises, the medical establishment did issue
warnings. Anyone, they said, who had already broken both arms and
both legs in previous falls should exercise utmost caution when
falling.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a fable.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Elul's the time to
build strong fences</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By RABBI WAYNE ALLEN</p>
<p>A pundit once remarked that the difference between a surgeon, an
internist and a pathologist is that the surgeon does everything and
knows nothing, the internist knows everything and does nothing, and
the pathologist knows everything but by then it's too late.</p>
<p>The month of Elul is soon upon us. It begins our annual
post-mortem: our intensive review of our past year's behavior. It is
called the Penitential Period. And while such review is necessary for
repenting of sins of the past, it is far better to use our time to
consider ways of preventing sin in the future.</p>
<p>This thought is cleverly conveyed in a poem by Joseph Malins
entitled <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">A Fence
or an Ambulance</span>. It is a poetic rendition of a story
about a city debating what to do about the dangerous cliff within its
boundary. While some advocated putting a fence around the cliff,
those who advocated putting an ambulance in the valley won the
day.</p>
<p>"'For the cliff is all right, if you're careful,' they said, 'And,
if folks even slip and are dropping. It isn't the slipping that hurts
them so much. As the shock down below when they're stopping.' So day
after day, as these mishaps occurred, Quick forth would these
rescuers sally/To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff. With
their ambulance down in the valley."</p>
<p>This is how the situation remained until wisdom intervened. "Then
an old sage remarked: 'It is a marvel to me/That people give far more
attention/To repairing results than to stopping the cause, When
they'd much better aim at prevention. Let us stop at its source all
this mischief,' cried he, 'Come neighbors and friends, let us rally;
If the cliffs we will fence we might almost dispense/with the
ambulance down in the valley.'"</p>
<p>At first, this good advice went unheeded, but eventually, logic
swayed those who were locked in to the error of the past. "To rescue
the fallen is good, but 'tis best to prevent other people from
falling."</p>
<p>It is easier by far to annually ask forgiveness for wrongs
committed than to put into operation the appropriate mechanism to
prevent them from being done. Yet, like the sensible few described by
Mallins who agreed with the sage, it is far wiser to put a strong
fence round the top of the cliff than an ambulance down in the
valley. The month of Elul ought to be the starting point for each of
us building those strong fences.</p>

<p>THE AMBULANCE IN THE VALLEY</p>
<p>Joseph Malins</p>
<p>'Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,<br>
Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;<br>
But over its terrible edge there had slipped<br>
A duke, and full many a peasant.<br>
The people said something would have to be done,<br>
But their projects did not at all tally.<br>
Some said "Put a fence 'round the edge of the cliff,"<br>
Some, "An ambulance down in the valley."</p>
<p>The lament of the crowd was profound and was loud,<br>
As their tears overflowed with their pity;<br>
But the cry for the ambulance carried the day<br>
As it spread through the neighboring city.<br>
A collection was made, to accumulate aid,<br>
And the dwellers in highway and alley<br>
Gave dollars and cents--not to furnish a fence--<br>
But an ambulance down in the valley.</p>
<p>"For the cliff is all right if you're careful," they said;<br>
"And, if folks ever slip and are dropping,<br>
It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much<br>
As the shock down below--when they're stopping."<br>
So for years (we have heard), as these mishaps occurred<br>
Quick forth would the rescuers sally,<br>
To pick up the victims who fell from the cliff,<br>
With the ambulance down in the valley.</p>
<p>Said one, in a plea, "It's a marvel to me<br>
That you'd give so much greater attention<br>
To repairing results than to curing the cause;<br>
You had much better aim at prevention.<br>
For the mischief, of course, should be stopped at its source;<br>
Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally.<br>
It is far better sense to rely on a fence<br>
Than an ambulance down in the valley."</p>
<p>"He is wrong in his head," the majority said,<br>
"He would end all our earnest endeavor.<br>
He's a man who would shirk this responsible work,<br>
But we will support it forever.<br>
Aren't we picking up all, jut as fast as they fall,<br>
And giving them care liberally?<br>
A superfluous fence is of no consequence<br>
If the ambulance works in the valley."</p>
<p>But a sensible few, who are practical too,<br>
Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;<br>
They believe that prevention is better than cure,<br>
And their party will soon be much stronger.<br>

<p>    <b>The Ambulance Down in the Valley</b>
</p>
<p>T'was a dangerous cliff, with the wind blowing stiff,<br>
But to fly risk will always be present.<br>
Three steps, all uphill, adds a bit too much thrill,<br>
Makes the leap from the edge not that pleasant,</p>
<p>So to make it more fun, something had to be done,<br>
But suggestions they just did not tally.<br>
Well some pilots said, "Put a ramp on the edge"<br>
No "An ambulance, down in the valley!"</p>
<p>Well the ambulance way, it carried the day,<br>
In a resolution that passed in a flash.<br>
Well the joy of the crowd, was liberal was loud,<br>
For those crowds they just love a good crash.</p>
<p>And so for some time, when conditions weren&#8217;t fine,<br>
Quick forth would the rescuers sally,<br>
To pick up the men, who&#8217;d not fly again,<br>
With the ambulance down in the valley.</p>
<p>Said the local MD, "It's a marvel to me,<br>
That you'd give so much greater attention,<br>
To repairing results, than to curing the cause,<br>
Why you'd much better aim at prevention."</p>
<p>Aren't we picking up all, just as fast as they fall,<br>
And giving them care liberally?<br>
Why should we revamp, and put in that ramp,<br>
If the ambulance works in the valley?</p>
<p>With patient refrain, I went on to explain,<br>
What happens, if they let, the nose pop.<br>
It's not falling as such, that hurts them so much,<br>
But the shock down below when they stop.</p>
<p>"They&#8217;re wrong in the head," the lawyers all said,<br>
"We must end their foolhardy endeavours.<br>
If they can not be taught, to make it safe sport,<br>
Then we must act now to stop them forever."</p>
<p>"The mischief of course, should be stopped at its source,<br>
Come friends, come on neighbours, let us rally!<br>
For it makes better sense, to rely on a fence,<br>
Than an ambulance down in the valley."</p>
<p>So quite unexpected, a fence was erected,<br>
And our flying days came to an end.<br>
No longer can we, set up and fly free,<br>
It&#8217;s becoming a worrying trend.</p>
<p>Now if this story seems queer, as I've given it here,<br>
Things often occur which are stranger.<br>
For we&#8217;ve lost the right, to many a sight<br>
With our failure to control the danger.</p>

Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant.<br>
And over it's terrible edge there had slipped<br>
Many a Duke and a peasant.</p>
<p>Something will have to be done said the people,<br>
However their approach to the project did vary.<br>
Some said: "Put a fence on the edge of the cliff".<br>
Some said: "Put an ambulance down in the valley".</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Corrective action: </b> Take the fallen Duke or Peasant to
the hospital quickly. (Quality Control is an Operational function, an
after the fact correction).</li>
  <li><b>Preventative action: </b> Put a high fence at the cliff's
edge to prevent all but a few crazy teenagers from accidentally taking
a tumble. (Quality Assurance is an Engineering function. It prevents
before the fact).</li>
  <li><b>Pre-emptive action: </b> Convert the cliff to a gentle
toboggan hill. (Design Engineering - Redesign the process so that error
can not occur).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you Frank, for an entertaining explanation of approaches to
problem solving. We will keep this in mind when next confronted with
a challenge.</p>
<p>Our very best wishes for a happy holiday season. See you in the
New Year!</p>
