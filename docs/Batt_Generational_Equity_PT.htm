<p align="center">H. William Batt, Ph.D.<br />hwbatt@gmail.com; 518-462-5068<br /> 
February, 2008</p>
<p>There's an old adage about what constitutes the perfect life, at least as
  I heard it years ago as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand. It consisted of
  French (or Chinese) food, a German car, and an American Home. (Some people,
  I should note, added a Japanese wife.) An American home is something envied
  world wide, and has even become part of the advertising used by Fannie Mae
  &#8212; we've all heard the ad about &quot;fulfilling the American Dream.&quot; </p>
<p>The reality is that the American dream is a very remote prospect for an increasingly
  large proportion of our society. To be sure, some 65 percent of households,
  thereabouts, own their own home. But that's because an ever-larger proportion
  of our net income is being devoted to this commitment. In New York State, the
  percent of mortgaged owners spending over thirty percent of their household
  income on selected monthly owner costs has now reached 40.9 percent. This compares
  to a national average estimate of 36.9 percent similarly stressed. Among the
  renting population, the proportion spending 30+ percent of their household
  income on rent and utilities is 48.1 percent, compared with an estimated 46
  percent nationally. The census data shows that living in New York is expensive,
  even though people are willing to pay to be here. </p>
<p>Households, of course, also see ownership of a home as an important means,
  perhaps the only means, by which to build financial equity. So people seek
  to own their own homes even when it would otherwise make no financial sense.
  Just as people often now make choices for tax reasons, people are becoming
  homeowners for investment reasons rather than to have a place to live. Given
  the run-up in home values in recent years as well as government policies serving
  as incentives, it is easy to understand their choices. But what may be sensible
  for people as individuals may make no sense for us as a society. This is why
  market distortions created by public policy need to be closely examined.</p>
<p>In the aggregate, an enormous proportion of American investment is devoted
  to homeownership, more than anyplace else in the world. And people don't own
  just a home, a sizable number now have a vacation home, a ski lodge, a pied
  a terre in the city, a house boat, a time share, and so on. Doing so may have
  served the nation well during this era of temporary abundance, but we are increasingly
  aware that it was a passing moment, and that the public welfare may be better
  served if resources are directed more toward other purposes. Homeownership
  is a consumption item, even though our public policies have treated it as if
  it were an investment in productivity.</p>
<p>Still, if indeed we want to spend the inordinate amount of resources that
  we do on housing, policies should be such that the housing is at least equitably
  distributed. This is warranted because the public has taken such a strong stake
  in these policies. There are a number of public policies now in place that
  skew housing resources toward identifiable populations, and make it difficult
  for others to avail themselves of them. One consideration given too little
  attention is the intergenerational distribution of housing resources at the
  present time. </p>
<p>Our policies are such that young families starting out in life find it extremely
  difficult to acquire housing, whereas many households at the other end of the
  age spectrum are allowed, and even encouraged, to consume far more housing
  than they really need. These policies should be addressed in any review of
  residential property tax burdens, especially as regards homeowners pleading
  for special exemption from payment in their empty-nesting and final years of
  life. It is easy to lament the plight of the &quot;poor widow&quot; driven
  out of her home, and such stories provide the paradigmatic case for relief
  to &quot;senior citizens.&quot; But there is also merit in policies that would
  encourage young couples and families in securing title to a home. In a world
  of limited resources, choices need to be made. Better that these choices be
  laid on the table explicitly.</p>
<p>Good statistics for the most recent period are lacking, but I was able to
  find data from the 1980 and 1990 census. Using national data from the two most
  recent decades available on this matter (1980 and 1990), we see that the proportion
  of homeowners under 35 years of age went down drastically &#8212; from 43.8
  to 39.6 percent. Those over 65 years of age who were homeowners increased from
  70.1
  to 75.2 percent. In 1980 homeowners under 35 were 29.9 percent and those over
  65 were 49.1 percent. In 1990, by contrast, the same figures were 32.3 and
  57.2 percent respectively. We know that our population distribution continues
  to climb, and larger proportions are in the higher age brackets than was true
  one and two decades ago. But not this much. According to the 2006 American
  Community Survey, between 14 and 15 percent of all owner-occupied housing units
  are by those 65 years or older even though they are only about 12 percent of
  the population. Anecdotal information suggests that young people are having
  an ever-harder time in acquiring a home, while the older population brackets
  are holding onto theirs. The problem is likely more acute in New York, given
  its disproportionately higher segment of the elderly population: it is as much
  as one percentage point higher than the national average.</p>
<p>There is broad sentiment in this country that people ought to be able to own
  their own home if they can afford it. Indeed, favoring one population class
  over another, whether by race, sex, marital status or any other category, probably
  would not meet with public support. Yet favoritism by age is amply evident,
  and is a policy that has received little examination, attention, or debate.
  The greatest advantages given to older Americans in support for homeownership
  are in tax policy, and these need to be put squarely on the table.</p>
<p>With respect to federal and state income taxes, the deductibility of mortgage
  interest and property taxes are the pivotal influences. Although homeowners
  are likely to have paid off a substantial portion of their home mortgages by
  the time they reach senior status, and have little interest payment as a result,
  they are still able to deduct their property taxes. Their older station in
  life may put them in a higher income bracket (unless they are retired), but
  it is likely the case that they would also have &quot;graduated&quot; to more
  expensive homes as well. So state and national tax policy impact on home ownership
  decisions may be more complex than any off-the-cuff generalizations allow.
  There is one outstanding consideration, however: when a homeowner ultimately
  relinquishes title, the capital gains from the sale are exempted from taxation.
  This constitutes a huge windfall to titleholders (or their heirs) that constitutes
  a totally unearned transfer of community-created wealth. (As I have noted elsewhere,<strong><em>1</em></strong>  rents are, by definition, socially created, not due to the enterprise of a
  particular titleholder.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>With respect to local property taxes for the support of municipal services
  and schools, substantial measures have been enacted that afford senior citizen
  homeowners relief from full payment. Argument for such programs is based on
  the view that seniors have &quot;earned&quot; the privilege of favorable treatment
  by virtue of being responsible citizens in the course of their lives. It is
  also claimed that retirement incomes are a drop from what previous earnings
  typically are, and their ability to pay is therefore limited. The data in support
  of this second point comes mainly from analysis of income tax returns, which
  of course take account only of income but not of wealth. However, because the
  property tax is largely a wealth tax, this compares apples and oranges, and
  constitutes a certain intellectual sleight-of-hand. </p>
<p>As I have argued elsewhere,<strong><em>2</em></strong> the market value of homeownership is in good
  part the flow of rent through site locations and it is capitalized in the course
  of holding title. It is a measure of wealth and not of income, at least in
  so far as the community overlooks the collection of this rental flow. When
  both the windfall gain from home sales are exempt from taxation, and a good
  part of the property taxes are excused as well, this together constitutes a
  huge benefit to titleholders. It is both a violation of general principles
  of fairness and diverts investment decisions from more productive enterprises.
  In a word, it feeds real estate speculation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are simple and available ways to address concerns about fairness and
  about economic efficiency. The fairness issue is best addressed by deferral
  of the property taxes until such time as parcels are sold and the accrued amount
  due can be paid in full with interest. This puts all homeowners on a level
  playing field while assuring that they are not pressed unreasonably by the
  demands of taxation. Deferring property taxes assures the public that it will
  eventually receive all the revenues that it should count on. It also assures
  that households can remain in their homes without concern about expulsion by
  the tax collector. Instituting such policies, already employed by some 24 states
  in various ways, can be facilitated without initial loss to revenue streams
  through state intervention to bridge the transitions.</p>
<p>The matter of treating real estate investments (for they are, after all, investments)
  with an even hand relative to other sectors of the economy is equally important.
  Locations are not in and of themselves productive; rather they reflect the
  productivity of the collective community of enterprises. It is important that
  investment capital not be squandered by investment in parcel sites that yield
  no return. The lower the taxes on property, a significant portion of which
  is upon rent, the more sites rise in market price, thereby feeding the kind
  of speculative fever that we have already witnessed for the past decade. Indeed
  the more the public recaptures community created land rent, the more it fosters
  rational and efficient investment decisions based on the productive factors
  of labor and capital. This is because rent, one way or another, flows through
  parcel sites, and if not recaptured in taxes it is diverted to the pursuit
  of windfalls and becomes the focus of speculators. Making real estate more
  responsive market forces is achieved to the extent that the capitalization
  of economic rent doesn't obstruct its operation. </p>
<p>There are two dimensions to addressing intergenerational equity in housing.
  The first is recapturing the economic rents that flow through real estate parcels
  so that the prices of property parcels are stable and not driven by speculative
  fever. As structures depreciate over their lifetime and land sites appreciate,
  a land value tax (which is a proxy for rent collection), can temper fluctuations
  in price and assure that market stability over the long term of a community.
  Taxing economic rents at the time of their creation assures a modicum of liquidity
  in real estate markets, and maintains greater affordability in housing for
  all people of all generations. The second is allowing the option of property
  tax deferral for those who may wish to do so when suitable eligibility criteria
  have been established. I have addressed the merits of property tax deferral
  in greater detail in another paper.<strong><em>3</em></strong></p>
