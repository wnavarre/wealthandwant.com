<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Nexus of Transportation, Economic Rent, and Land Use</span></div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H. William Batt,
Ph.D., April, 2002</div>
&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is Land Rent?</span><br>
<br>
John Houseman, an actor perhaps most widely known as Professor
Kingsfield in the long-running TV series, The Paper Chase, later became
the pitchman for Smith Barney. In that advertisement, his tag line was
"We make money the old-fashioned way -- we earn it."<br>
<br>
That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts of
others seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its
cogency in contemporary economic thought. More than a century ago John
Stuart Mill noted that<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords
grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
title.</span><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1)
</span></small></div>
<p align="left">  Today, on the other hand, the unearned surplus which classical
  economists called rent attaches to monopoly titles -- largely the
  scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
  totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
  vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
  recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
  comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
  eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
  the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
  explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
  efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The
  surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
  rightful entitlement.<br>
  <br>
  Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of cities
  where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
  such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
  hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
  personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
  than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
  only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
  Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
  luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
  million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
  obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> Land
  values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
  to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
  a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
  mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
  direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
  attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
  areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
  United States illustrate the point.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Case 1: Ithaca, New York:</span>
  Tompkins County, where the city of Ithaca sits at the center, has land
  values many times those within a short walk. Dividing the county land
  parcels into quintiles, the highest fifth have values of $56,000 per
  acre and above. The lowest fifth have a value of less than $3,000 per
  acre. The high value area collectively constitutes only a minute
  proportion of the total number of square miles because most of it is
  farm or forest land.<br>
  <strong>Tompkins County</strong><br>
  <img src="../graphics/batt%20nexus%20fig%201%20ithaca.gif" width="289" height="410"><br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Case 2: Des Moines, Iowa:</span> Polk
  County, where Des Moines sits near the center, has land values even
  more disparate between urban and rural locations. The highest quartile
  there are those $97,400 per acre and above, the single highest parcel
  of all worth an astonishing $31.4 million per acre. Yet, the lowest
  quartile, a roughly equal number of far larger parcels, all have a
  value of less than $30,000 per acre.<br>
  Polk County, Iowa<br>
  <img src="../graphics/batt%20nexus%20fig%202%20des%20moines.gif" width="289" height="429"><br>
  <br>
  Yet because society has not elected to recapture the socially created
  land value of the highest priced parcels, the rent that accrues to
  those sites becomes the windfall gain of their titleholders. Regardless
  whether those titleholders use their landsites productively or not, the
  continuing rent that accretes in those land sites drives up their
  market price. This forces developers who might wish to improve parcels
  not used to best advantage to settle instead on sites that are
  sub-optimal. Were the rent collected from the current titleholders of
  those sites, their use would be encouraged to the full extent that
  their value warrants. They would be encouraged to seek the best return
  for the carrying costs of those underused parcels -- the higher the tax
of rent, the greater the incentive to use landsites well.</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/batt%20nexus%20image004.gif" width="288" height="422"></p>
<p><br>
  <br>
  To secure the fullest results of collecting land rent, structures
    should be removed entirely from revenue base and imposed on the land
    component alone. Phasing out the tax burden on improvements and placing
    it on land value alone removes the penalty now placed on those who do
    invest in and maintain their buildings. And, as mentioned earlier, it
    prompts titleholders to abjure practices for speculative gain. If only
    the land value component of the property tax is collected and tax on
    buildings is eliminated, those who do use landsites to the full extent
    that their value warrants are rewarded for doing so.<br>

<br>
The failure to collect site rent leads to a distortion in land use
configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
of land sites is what we know as sprawl.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Rent is Capitalized
Transportation Cost</span><br>
<br>
There is another dimension to the distortion of land use in
contemporary life. That is the heavy subsidy granted to motor vehicle
transportation services. Estimates are that the typical driver pays
only about a tenth of the true cost of his travel; society picks up the
rest. This profuse subsidy paid to private automobile and truck
transportation further encourages people to locate on sites at far
greater distances from where they would choose than if they had to pay
the full burden of that travel.<br>
<br>
From the standpoint of an economic geographer, and for some land
economists, land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land
rent is the surplus generated by social activity on or in the vicinity
of locational sites which accrues to titleholders of those parcels.
Whether or not it is recaptured by public policy, rent is a natural
factor deriving from the intensive use of natural capital. More
intensive use of high value landsites leads to site configurations that
are less dependent upon transportation services. People can access them
easily even by walking. One must remember that transportation is not an
end in itself but rather a means. This is something often forgotten
even by urban planners, the distinction between accessibility and
mobility. As explained well in a recent text, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Geography of Urban Transportation</span>:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Accessibility
</span>refers to the number of opportunities, also called activity
sites, available within a certain distance or travel time. Mobility
refers to the ability to move between different activity sites (e.g.,
from home to a grocery store).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(4)</span></small></div>
<br>
The result is that we do an awful lot of traveling to get what and
where we want. We have paid enormously for mobility even at the expense
of access. Subsidizing motor vehicle transportation makes the problem
worse! Author Kirkpatrick Sale recognized this when he argued that<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Cities are meant to stop traffic. That
is their point. That is why they are there. That is why traders put
outposts there, merchants put shops there, hostellers erect inns there.
That is why factories locate there, why warehouses, assembly plants,
and distribution centers are established there. That is why people
settle and cultural institutions grow there. No one wants to operate in
a place that people are just passing through; everyone wants to settle
where people will stop, and rest, and look around, and talk, and buy,
and share.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span></small></div>
<p><br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Site Rent and Transportation Costs
Linked</span><br>
<br>
Higher density development has all the economies of scale, savings in
cost, reduction in externalities, dividends in community and political
enhancement, and benefits to urban areas that we all say that we want.
The greater the proximity to points of desirable accessibility, the
lower are typically the transportation costs. Conversely, sites remote
from the urban centers of greatest locational value will have higher
transportation costs. When the fixed costs of transportation
infrastructure and parcel site improvements are accounted for (which
tend to be relatively the same regardless of location), one is left
with the marginal costs of operations.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(6)</span></small> This
is illustrated most easily in conceptual Figure 1:</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/batt%20nexus%20srtc.gif" width="324" height="243"><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  This relationship has been demonstrated more empirically in a recent
  study by the Urban Land Institute. The author concluded that, for
  Portland Oregon,</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">each additional mile [traveled]
translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in
locations command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile
difference, all other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000
in new home value.</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For a household in which one worker
drives downtown (or at least to a more central location) to work, that
ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles annually, assuming 230
days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each day. Moreover, if
non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled that amount,
the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could mean a
higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
saved/spent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(7)
</span></small></div>
<p>  That's the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles.
  If the urban resident has to rely upon a car nonetheless, subtracting
  some $3,000 annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again
  that much, and likely more, to own a car. Seven years ago James
  Kunstler put the true costs along with other experts at about $6,100
  annually.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(<small>8</small>)</span> The
  American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000 miles in
  2001 cost 51&cent; per mile or $7,650.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(9)</span></small> Even
  that figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not those passed
  on to society. One study calculated that the total costs of motor
  vehicle transportation to our society equal approximately one-fourth of
  our Gross Domestic Product (GDP)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(10)</span></small> In
  1991 road user fees totaled only about $33 billion whereas the true
  costs to society were ten times that;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(11)</span></small> put
  another way, drivers paid only 10% of the true costs of their motor
  vehicle use.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(12)</span></small><br>
  <br>
  The latter figures include externalities like pollution and the costs
  of highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their
  engines so they pollute less, inflate their tires properly, and drive
  more safely are not likely to change the reality that people are
  forgetful and fallible. Regardless, pollution-free cars are not
  available; people must drive to participate in this society. The
  consequences of SO2, CO2, and ozone are no longer a matter of debate;
  they are scientific fact. Despite frequent headlines about replacing
  the internal combustion engine, all the realistic substitutes also rely
  upon fossil fuel power directly or indirectly; solar powered cars are
  far in the future, if at all, and also fail to deal with any
  transition. And every person driving his or her own car multiplies the
  probabilities of accidents. Those crashes alone, nothing else,
  represents a figure equal to 8 percent of the American GDP.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(13)</span></small> In
  human terms nationally, this is about 43,000 deaths and 2 million
  hospitalizations annually. When people step into a car they are seldom
  mindful of such odds. However, if the direct pecuniary costs of driving
  increase in any substantial way, such as for an increase in motor fuel
  as many experts forecast, there will surely be significant changes in
  the tradeoffs involved in housing/transportation choices.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(14)</span></small> And
  indeed a radical shift in the use of petroleum looms closely on the
  horizon. The consensus view of most oil geologists is that worldwide
  oil extraction will peak sometime in about 2009 or shortly thereafter,
  then to fall off rather quickly. That graphic record and projection of
  oil mining is shown in Figure 3.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(15)</span></small>
  Making costs visible and linked to private personal behavior is one way
  to ensure that transportation pays its own way -- if it isn't already
too late to save us.</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/batt%20nexus%20image008.gif" width="351" height="308"><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Public opinion polls are practically unanimous in their demonstration
    of the kind of environment most Americans say they would like to live
    in.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(16)</span></small> Sociological
    studies have documented graphically how alienating the car-dependent environment
    really is. There is an inverse correlation
    between the ability of a street to move and to park cars and trucks,
    and the amount of social interaction between neighbors on that street.
    One study two decades ago compared three similar residential streets in
    San Francisco, with different levels of traffic volumes. Residents on
    the different streets were asked to indicate on the base maps of their
    streets where friends and acquaintances lived. Those living on streets
    with the least traffic volume had three times as many friends and twice
    as many acquaintances as those living on the streets with heavy traffic
    volumes<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(17)</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(18)</span></small> More recently
    Harvard Professor Robert Putnam has made similar findings in his book Bowling
    Alone, and concluded that every ten minutes of
    additional commuting time means ten percent less time devoted to
    communal activity. Driving is no longer regarded as fun, not on today's
    typically congested highways. There was a time when most people drove
    cars for pleasure; today people resent their having to drive so much
    and often see driving as a burden.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(19)</span></small> It
    is also no accident also that on measures of livability, those
    locations regarded as most attractive are also the ones that are most
    bicycle-friendly.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(20)</span></small> A
    number of recent books and their popularity reflect resentment over our
    forced dependency on motor vehicle transportation Jane Holtz Kay's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Asphalt Nation</span>, Clay McShane's <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Down the Asphalt Path</span>, Wolfgang
    Zuckerman's <span style="font-style: italic;">End of the Road</span>,
    and Katie Alford's <span style="font-style: italic;">Divorce Your Car</span> are
    only a few such examples.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(21)</span></small> But
    despite their vague discomfort people typically lack the perspicacity
    to incorporate these non-pecuniary costs into their decisions about
    locational choice.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Distortions by Pricing:
  Increasing the Collection of Land Rent</span><br>
  <br>
  Recovering the economic rent from urban parcels helps people to
    appreciate the true costs of the transportation versus location
    trade-off. It brings the carrying costs of site choices back to the
    present time and makes them comparable with travel choices. The payment
    of site rent becomes an operating cost. The other corrective policy
    needed is to raise transportation costs to a level commensurate with
    their full value as private goods. Transportation user fees, in the
    form of motor fuel taxes, green taxes, congestion fees, and
    administrative costs (for the administration of drivers' licenses and
    registration fees) could easily provide the needed price corrections to
    bring into balance marginal transportation costs and land rent
    collection. Doing so would equilibrate choices between people living
    and working in high rent urban centers and those in peripheral low rent
    (but higher travel cost) locales.<br>
  <br>
  Figure 2 shows how a tax on land value (or alternatively the tax on
    land rent) coupled with the proper design of transportation fees can
    equilibrate the competitive advantage of markets in urban areas
    relative to suburbs, thereby reducing, and perhaps even reversing, the
    centrifugal forces of sprawl development. The land tax cannot alone
    redress the problem, especially so long as such inordinate social
    subsidies are granted to private motor vehicle transportation services.
    Nor can transportation fees, raised to a level fully commensurate with
    the social and private costs they incur, alone ensure that the price of
    locations will be matched. But to the extent that both are assessed,
    they reach far toward correcting this disequilibrium. One could even
    argue that all site rent should be recaptured by society and that all
    transportation costs that are identifiable as consumption of private
    goods should be priced accordingly. Some advocates even suggest that
    doing so will not only foster economic efficient behavior but also
    provide sufficient revenue for a citizen's dividend consistent with
economic justice.</p>
<p><img src="../graphics/batt%20nexus%20rfees.gif" width="416" height="313"><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Arriving at the appropriate revenue formulas is the challenge.
      Recapturing land rent is likely best achieved by setting the rates at
      levels that stabilize the market price of landsites in the face of
      speculative pressures. Because the collection of rents fosters economic
      activity in the regions of highest value, it may just be that market
      prices will remain stable even with very high levies. The downward
      pressure on market prices exerted by a tax is countered by the
      increased incentive to improve parcel sites with the highest value.
      Many economists as early as the French physiocrats have argued that
      ultimately all tax revenues come from rents in any case; that it is
      only a question of how much they are shifted through to other sectors
      of the economy before they are collected. Professor Mason Gaffney
      explains this by noting that</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">After-tax interest rates are determined
in world markets and the local supply of capital funds is highly
elastic. So, local taxes on capital do not stick to capital. Even
national taxes on capital typically fail to stick, because capital is a
citizen of the world. Local labor supplies are also pretty elastic,
although not so totally. Local taxes on labor, therefore, do not stick
to labor, either. Payroll taxes drive people out of localities that
impose them, for example. Ditto for sales taxes. Customers move, or
shift their purchases, to where taxes are lower, or zero. Sellers
shift, too, to the extent they bear the tax. What else is left? Just
land, and land cannot emigrate or immigrate from the local jurisdiction.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><strong>(22)</strong></span></small><br>
</div>
This means that taxing away land rent more relieves it from circulating
through labor and capital, allowing those factors in turn to be more
productive. Significantly, perhaps most importantly, the collection of
land rent, on account of its inelasticity, incurs no deadweight loss
like tax levies on labor and capital. The economy thus functions more
efficiently -- i.e. with less drag and friction.<br>
<br>
Lest one believe that this excess burden, or so-called deadweight loss,
is a negligible drag on the economy, studies show just the opposite.
One study calculates that it was equal to about 20 percent of the total
US economy in the mid-1990s, annually at least one trillion dollars in
lost output.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(23)</span></small>
Put another way, a well designed efficient revenue structure would
allow productivity to rise by that amount and effectively make our
income that much higher. For Great Britain, the comparable figure was
shown to be &pound;400 billion annually.<br>
<br>
Deadweight loss is a concept understood by economists but not by the
general public. But this is likely to change as discussion about the
merit of various taxation approaches is presented to the public.
Nations in the European Community are now required to publish their
calculations about the deadweight loss of the various tax schemes being
reviewed, precisely because of the recognition of its importance as a
factor of production.<small><span

<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></small>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
The one kind of tax where there is no deadweight loss whatsoever is
that imposed upon an base with inelastic supply. Since land and some
other elements of nature cannot be increased in quantity resulting in a
completely vertical supply curve, no inefficiency is incurred by such a
tax. Consider two cases of a tax commonly found worldwide on real
estate. Because a real property tax is actually two taxes from the
standpoint of economic dynamics -- the tax on the land component and
the tax on the improvement component, each is considered here as a
separate case. In the first case, the tax on the land component alone
is illustrated. In the other case, the tax on the improvement component
(i.e. the building) is shown. What happens?<br>
<br>
The tax on land alone is completely capitalized in the market value of
the land parcel and is not passed forward to the tenant. This is
important, because when the roughly 1/3 of all American households that
rent rather than own their own homes are removed from the burden of
property taxation, it has the effect of making the land tax far more
progressive. Those land parcels that do pay taxes are split between
residential and non-residential titleholders. Even though the
residential households are likely to constitute the overwhelming number
of parcels in the tax base, they are likely to bear only about half the
taxes paid, the remaining share borne largely by commercial sites.
Agricultural parcels may in some instances represent a large area of
land, but it is likely to be of far lower market value and represent
less than five percent of the revenue paid. The land component of a tax
on real property then is actually highly progressive.<br>

</div>
<br>
Consider now the tax on the improvement portion of the property parcel.
Here, depending upon the slope of the supply curve and the demand
curve, the tax is likely to be passed forward to a greater or lesser
extent to the tenant. Very little of it in fact is typically borne by
the landlord. The existence of the tax on structures incurs a
depressing effect upon the rate of investment, just like all such taxes
with more than zero elasticity. And the greater scarcity of sites for
rent, either commercial or residential, has the impact of driving up
prices for their use. What is even more significant, as noted earlier,
is that the shift of taxes off improvements and onto landsites
encourages the use of those sites to the full extent of their
locational value, thereby halting and even reversing the centrifugal
forces of sprawl development. Greater investment in high value
landsites creates greater density and proximity in the community,
enhancing the accessibility of those sites to one another and reducing
the need for transportation mobility.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting Distortions by Pricing:
Increasing the Recovery of Transportation Service Costs</span><br>
<br>
With respect to charges upon transportation services and externalities,
there are several components to a proper pricing design.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(25)</span></small> The
first step to proper pricing is to identify the proportion of
transportation services that ought rightly to be seen as private goods
as opposed to public goods.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(26)</span></small>
Although this is a daunting task, the frequent figure used is 80
percent - 20 percent proportion. 
<ul>
  <li>The public good proportion of road use
reflects the amount of reliance by services provided by the government
and associated agencies like mail service, national defense, public
safety (ambulance, police and fire departments), and so on.  </li>
  <li>The private
use of the roads constitutes the overwhelming amount of its use. This
means that as a rule 80 percent of the highway use charges should be
paid by individual drivers, directly or indirectly.  </li>
</ul>
It is easy to
distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: 
<ul><li>capital
investment, 
  </li>
  <li>maintenance costs,  </li>
  <li>regulation costs,  </li>
  <li>environmental
externalities and  </li>
  <li>congestion costs.  </li>
</ul>
Each of these calls for a different
treatment with respect to revenue design.<br>
<br>
As noted earlier, capital investments affect the market value of
locational sites by conveying rent to those in any way benefitting from
the service. That rent accruing to proximate sites and can easily
recaptured to pay off the debt service of project construction.
Typically rent collection is ignored, however, left instead in the
hands of titleholders whose sites are serviced by the infrastructure
investment. This drives speculation in land, with all the negative
effects it brings both economically and politically. In fact the rent
created by capital investment in transportation can be enormous. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One nine-mile stretch
of interstate highway in Albany, New York, costing $125 million to
construct has yielded $3.8 billion in increased land values within just
two miles of its corridor in the 40 years of its existence.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(27)</span></small>
This is a thirty-fold return in a timespan typically used for bond
repayment!  </li>
  <li>The Washington Metro created increments in land value along much
of the 101-mile system under of construction in 1980 that easily
exceeded $3.5 billion, compared with the $2.7 billion of federal funds
invested in Metro up until that time.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(28)</span></small> No
doubt the return is far greater today.  </li>
</ul>
The component of transportation costs constituting capital expenditure
can and should be recaptured through the collection of land rent since
it accounts for the creation of that value particular to proximate
locational sites.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintenance costs on the other hand
are best paid for from user fees,
and can range from excise taxes on motor fuel, tires, heavy truck
charges and others still. </span>Such pricing has received
considerable
attention in recent years, even though it has been difficult to
implement for political reasons. Heavy trucks, for example, pay special
mileage charges, which should ideally be based upon axle-weight and
distance, commensurate with the wear and tear on the roads that they
cause. High-tech innovations using transponders for electronic road
pricing according to time and place of vehicle travel are being
explored and implemented in Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand and on
modest scales elsewhere.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(29)</span></small> The
virtue of a tax on motor fuel, at least for automobiles, is that
charges are roughly commensurate with miles driven if rates are set at
the proper levels. But electronic road pricing can be far more precise
if concerns about personal privacy can be overcome by computers that
calculate user charges based solely upon point calculations. Bringing
prices into line with marginal costs is the most efficient and
equitable way to pay for highway transportation services, and one can
expect to witness significant advances in this realm before too many
years pass.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Separate from maintenance operations
are the costs involved in the
regulation and supervision of drivers and motor vehicles themselves.
License and registration fees should ideally be designed only to
recover the costs involved in their administration. </span>To be sure,
such
administration may reach to operations beyond license plate
bureaucracies to safety inspections, certain judicial functions, and so
on. But charging for road use through such measures is not only
inefficient but inequitable.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(30)</span></small><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Charging for pollution externalities
of motor vehicle travel invites
more complex issues.</span> One approach widely explored involves
reliance
upon what are known as Pigou taxes, after noted British economist
Arthur Pigou.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(31)</span></small>
It attempts to recover the costs of externalities in the natural
environment and even involving health damages. Yet Pigou taxes are more
often talked about than actually implemented. Related to such designs
are those growing out of the theories of Ronald Coase, designed not
necessarily to recover the full social costs of negative externalities
but rather to foster the most efficient economic choice among options,
even if some parties are disadvantaged.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(32)</span></small>
Taxes recovering such costs are most easily collected at the production
stage -- at the wellhead or the refinery for oil, and from the
manufacturer for tires and other materials.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(33)</span></small>
Still a third approach is that represented by the Georgist tradition,
which would recover the costs of specified pollution externalities by
accepting them to the extent that the environment is capable of
absorbing them, and charging polluters for the use of the environment
as a sink for such wastes. This approach is particularly attractive as
a way to charge for the release of noxious gases in motor vehicle
exhaust.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(34)</span></small><br>
<br>
The last dimension of motor vehicle transportation charges can be
designed to reflect the costs of <span style="font-weight: bold;">congestion</span>.
To some extent, those costs are already borne by drivers since they pay
in the value of their time for that lost by slowed traffic. But not
everyone's time has the same value, and proper pricing of road use
reflective of time and place is an attractive solution to maintaining
the efficient flow of highway service. Here again, electronic road
pricing can help with efficiency.<br>
<br>
These pricing approaches taken together offer the prospect of both
recovering costs in their varied forms as well as fostering efficient
transportation services. There are grave misconception in how much
fiscal policies distort social and economic behavior. And the fiscal
policies that foster the greatest distortions of all are those
involving road costs and the failure to collect economic rent. Rather
than resort to traditional command-and-control approaches which are
frequently just as cumbersome and distorting as current unthinking
fiscal measures, now is an opportune time to consider models which will
help us to get things right.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Costs of Conventional Taxes and
Subsidies</span><br>
<br>
The conventional property tax, one taxing both land values and
improvement values, is analogous to a train with an engine at each end.
The tax on land value fosters improvement on the parcels with the
highest market and social value, while the tax on structures
discourages that very same thing. No wonder it is that economic
activities is stymied most in the urban centers and manifests itself in
areas where the least imposition of all has taken hold. As scholar
Jessica Matthews once put it,<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">In a now familiar sequence, developers
reach for the cheapest land, out in the cow pastures. Government is
left to fill in behind with brand new infrastructure roads, sewerage
systems and schools paid for in part by those whose existing roads and
schools are left to decline. Property values rise in a ring that
marches steadily outward from the city and fall in older suburbs inside
the moving edge. Because residential development can't meet the public
bills, local governments compete for commercial investment with tax
discounts that deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes
then rise, providing an incentive for new development. Years of such
leap-frogging construction devours land at an astonishing pace.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(35)</span></small></div>
<br>
Developing land use and transportation patterns that assume walkability
or transit service rather than individual and private motor vehicles is
the very definition of livability. Experts agree that the minimum
density necessary to make public transit services economically viable
is 10 to 12 households per acre, although cities developed in the
post-automobile era, lamentably, one sees very little prospect of
altering automobile dependency.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(36)</span></small> One
study found that "the range of costs induced by spread-out development,
. . [i.e.] houses built in sprawling developments, may cost 40 to 400
percent more to serve than if they were located close to major
facilities, were clustered in continuous areas, and in corporate a
variety of housing types."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(37)</span></small> But
by bringing prices into line with costs, both on the transportation
services side and on the site-rent side, it is possible both to foster
those personal choice calculations that are consistent with sustainable
urban environments.<br>
<br>
There remains the problem, however, of rearranging a century of site
choices, for both residential and commercial purposes, at a time when
circumstances may not afford us the time or resources to make such
shifts. Land uses, once established, tend to be intractably embedded,
and buildings retain their use for work, commerce and livability for
decades if not centuries. What will happen when the costs of
transportation limit our mobility and our access to a level that energy
costs allow? What will happen when suburbs, now the most attractive of
residential location choices become irretrievably remote and
inaccessible? If they do become the next century's slums, as observers
like historian Kenneth Jackson predicts,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(38)</span></small> the
United States may quickly find itself unable to compete economically
and even survive politically in a fashion that it has enjoyed in the
twentieth century.<br>

6. There is some empirical evidence for this. Anthony Downs notes that,<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Housing and transportation costs are
inversely related. In outlying settlements, households with more than
one worker usually need two or more vehicles to get everyone to their
jobs. That increases their transportation costs. Because their homes
tend to be built on lower-cost rural land, however, their housing costs
are relatively low. Conversely, in denser urban areas that are well
served by public transit, households with two or more workers can get
by with one vehicle--or even none. For these households, transportation
costs are likely to be a lower percentage of their budget than their
rural counterparts. But urban land is usually valuable real estate, so
their housing costs are likely to be steeper.<br>
<br>
"Data on consumer spending in specific regions backs up these
observations. The highest fraction of consumer spending on
transportation was 22.8 percent in the Houston area, which is notorious
for traffic congestion. The lowest was 15.3 percent in the New York
City area, which has an extensive public transit system. But Houston
households spent only 30.6 percent on housing, whereas New York
households spent 36.9 percent. Combined, both types of spending were
about the same in the two cities. Similar inverse relationships between
housing and transportation spending prevailed in all of the 28
metropolitan regions for which data were available.<br>
<br>
"Another piece of evidence that partially supports this relationship
comes from "The Costs of Sprawl 2000," a recent study conducted by
Rutgers University, the Brookings Institution and several other
organizations. Part of the research examined how housing prices vary
with distance from the regional downtown of each metropolitan area.
Although only a few areas were analyzed, the study showed consistently
that prices of similar homes tended to decline about 1.2 to 1.5 percent
per additional mile from the regional downtown, except where proximity
to the ocean had more influence on prices--as in Southern California.
Meanwhile, longer-distance commutes added to fuel and travel-time costs
by about the same amount per mile in every region. The study also found
that per-mile housing-cost savings from added commuting distance were
much larger in regions with absolutely very high housing costs than in
those with absolutely low housing costs." "Can Transit Tame Sprawl?"

26. As economists use the term, a public good is one whose consumption
is non-rival and non-exclusive. To be non-rival means that consumption
of a good or service by some does not preclude its consumption by
others. To be non-exclusive means that non-payers cannot be prohibited
from using that good or service. One economics textbook offers the
following alternative definition: "A public good is a commodity or
service whose benefits are not depleted by an additional user and for
which it is generally difficult or impossible to exclude people from
its benefits, even if they are unwilling to pay for them. In contrast,
a private good is characterized by both excludability and
depletability." William J. Baumol and Alan S. Blinder, Economics:
Principles and Policy, Third Edition (New York: Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich, 1985), p.543. National defense, clean air, and mosquito
control are usually offered as cases of services that come as close to
being "pure" public goods as the real world offers. A private good, in
contrast, is one which has the attributes of being both rival and
exclusive. That is, its consumption by one party depletes its
availability to others, and consumers can be required to pay in order
to obtain it. A hamburger can be considered a private good insofar as
it cannot be eaten by two persons at the same time. For a good to be
exclusive means that those who do not pay can be barred from its
consumption: the metering of electric, gas, cable, and phone lines is
done to prevent non-payers from tapping in. Radio and television are
non-exclusive, and therefore are paid for not by consumer listeners but
through advertising. Highways have elements of both public and private
good, and the demand for each should ideally determine how much each
sector should pay. See also Musgrave, pp. 6-ff.<br>
