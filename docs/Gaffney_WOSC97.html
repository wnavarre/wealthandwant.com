The large holders have held their land much longer than the median
small property holder, and therefore have received very effective
protection from California's Proposition 13, which limits annual
increases in the assessed value of properties to the lesser of 2% or
the California cost of living, and caps the property tax at 1% of that
assessed value.&nbsp; Only when majority ownership changes does the
property get reassessed to market value.<br>

Notes by Mason Gaffney</div>
<p>  These notes on concentration of landholdings were originally compiled
  in 1988 and have been updated from time to time since then. The most
  recent revisions were made in 1997.<br>

  <br>
  Several million persons, perhaps half the resident adult population,
  hold titles to land in southern California. With so many holders, the
  median holding is perforce small, although well above the national
  median. But the mean holding is well above the median, indicating a
  skewed distribution.<br>
  <br>
  All wealth distributions are skewed; so, to a lesser degree, are income
  distributions. Landholding, however, is more skewed than other
  distributions. In 1985 the Internal Revenue Service released a Report
  based on a study of 1983 estate tax returns. According to the Report, "More than one half of his (the mean top wealth-holder's) wealth was
  held as real estate and corporate stock, with real estate surpassing
  corporate stock as the most prominent asset in the top wealth-holder's
  portfolio." (AP dispatch by Jim Luther, Riverside Press Enterprise, 8
  March 1985, p. A3.) This Report warrants careful study.<br>
  <br>
  A 19th century California editor turned economist had observed the
  same: "The great cause of inequality in the distribution of wealth is
  inequality in the ownership of land ..." (Henry George, <a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and
  Poverty</a>,1879). It was a recurring theme: a century before, Thomas
  Jefferson, Tom Paine, Adam Smith and others were of the same opinion. A
  century later Robert <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fellmeth </span>et
  al. redocumented the point for California (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Nader Report: Politics
  of Land</span>, 1973). Between George and Fellmeth, scholars like
  Walter
  Goldschmidt, Paul S. Taylor, Paul Gates, Adon Poli and many others had
  documented the same point. Carey McWilliams (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Factories in the Field</span>),
  and novelists like Frank Norris (<span style="font-style: italic;">The
  Octopus</span>) and John Steinbeck (<span style="font-style: italic;">The
  Grapes of Wrath</span>) found popular success with the theme.<br>
  <br>
  The Fellmeth-Nader study was too ambitious for its resources, and
  flawed by haste. Critics seized on the flaws to discredit or dismiss
  the substance. Nevertheless its main theme, the concentration of
  landownership, may be tested by reference to more conventional sources
  today. That is our method here.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="1._HOLDINGS_BY_ALIENS"></a>1.
  HOLDINGS BY ALIENS</span><br>
  <br>
  Several studies have shown the largest holders of land in any region
  are likely to be diversified large holders from outside the region.
  This seems to hold here as well.<br>
  <br>
  Non-resident aliens own about 75% of the "major" buildings in the L.A.
  CBD west of Broadway [L.A. Times 21 Sept 86].<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles Grosvenor</span>, an
  Englishman, <span style="font-weight: bold;">a.k.a. The Duke of
  Westminster</span>, is one of these is.
  Grosvenor owns half the Wells Fargo Building on a valuable site in
  downtown L.A. &nbsp;&nbsp;Grosvenor also holds 17 acres in Silicon Valley. He also
  holds Annacis Island, 1200 acres near Vancouver, B.C. He is a major
  owner in downtown Melbourne. He is diversified around the world. These
  are parts of his overseas holdings. Their value was estimated in 1985
  at $1.3 billion, but they were not for sale and the basis for the
  valuation is not given. Like city land worldwide, they must have
  doubled in price, 1985-89 - and then dropped again.<br>
  <br>
  The core of Grosvenor's holdings is 300 acres in central London,
  including half the Mayfair District, most of Belgravia, and Grosvenor
  Square where the U.S. Embassy is one of his many lessees. His country
  estate is 4500 acres. Grosvenor, along with Earl Cadogan, the Duke of
  Bedford, Viscount Portman, and Lord Howard de Walden, pretty well
  control London land. [L.A. Times, 9/85]<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Mitsubishi Estate Company.</span>
  Westmec is the American subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Estate Company. It
  recently bought into Sunrise Company of Palm Desert, a developer of
  country club communities. Sunrise has developed 7 private golf
  communities and is developing Sunterra resort near Indian Wells, which
  includes two golf courses and one 80-acre lake. Westmec also holds
  Pacwest Center, Portland.<br>
  <br>
  The core asset of Mitsubishi Estate Company is the Marunouchi District,
  the business and financial center of Tokyo, where land prices rise over
  $10,000 per square foot. Mitsubishi holds 85% of that land, an asset
  valued at $50 billion. It also owns land in Yokohama. On such
  collateral they can borrow easily, at low Japanese interest rates, to
  acquire or develop land anywhere.<br>
  <br>
  In 1989, Mitsubishi flexed its muscles by buying a controlling interest
  in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rockefeller Center</span>, a
  highly visible "trophy" property. It also owns
  several downtown L.A. skyscrapers [L.A. Times, 12 September 1995, A11].
  In this case, pride went before a fall: the timing of Japanese
  purchases was pessimal. Now (1995) they are trying to liquidate many of
  their trophies, taking great losses. Many properties are being
  foreclosed by their Japanese creditors, who in turn are trying to fob
  off their losses on Japanese taxpayers. Rockefeller Center is one of
  those properties. A likely new owner is to be Sam Zell of Chicago, in
  conjunction with the Walt Disney Company.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Shuwa Company Ltd</span>. of Tokyo
  is a recent entrant. It recently bought Arco Plaza and Chase Plaza,
  where the Bank of America and the Chase Manhattan Bank remain as their
  tenants. [L.A. Times, 21 Sept. 86]<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Canadian Daon Company</span> in
  the early 1980s had 13,000 acres in Southern California, 6,000 of them
  in Riverside County, 3,744 acres of these in Temescal Valley, including
  the Wild Rose project of 220 acres. [Riverside Press-Enterprise, 4/84,
  9/82]. One of its projects, the Riverside Centre Building, has been
  taken by its foreign bank, the Bank of Montreal [Riverside
  Press-Enterprise, 5/88]. The Riverside City Council had provided the
  site and imprudently subordinated it for the loan, so the Montreal bank
  now holds the site, too.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Edward Halvajian</span>. Daon was
  liquidating its surplus lands in the early 1980s. One big buyer was
  Edward Halvajian and Associates, Newport Beach. In April, 1984,
  Halvajian acquired 2400 acres from Daon. This consists of 800 acres in
  the Corona Foothill Company tract in Corona (between Chase Drive and
  Foothill Drive, Lincoln Avenue and Garretson Avenue). This was in
  citrus, convertible to urban. The other 1600 acres is developable land
  in Temescal Canyon along the then-new I-15. The foreign-owned company
  was able to sell at a better price because of the benefits of the
  highway, paid by American taxpayers. Halvajian also has 400 acres in
  Thermal, and "substantial amounts" of land elsewhere. (TPE, 4/84)
  [Note: <span style="font-weight: bold;">TPE</span> refers to the <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Riverside
  Press-Enterprise or The
  Press-Enterprise</span>.]<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">BCE</span>. In 1985 Daon was acquired
  by BCE of Vancouver, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">American
  landholding arm of Bell Canada</span>. BCE
  in turn is now seeking buyers for part of its holdings, retaining
  mainly<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">commercial and
  industrial (C&amp;I)</span> investments for permanent
  holding. BCE is now offering 4,400 acres en bloc. This bloc includes
  2200 acres in Carlsbad, by the La Costa Resort [Riverside
  Press-Enterprise, 5/88].<br>
  <br>
  BCE is separately offering the Temescal Water Co. TWC was a Mutual
  Water Company (owned by its customer-landowners) for 100 years, but was
  sold to Daon in 1981. TWC owns Railroad Canyon Dam and Canyon Lake and
  the water rights of the San Jacinto River, plus rights to 4,250
  acre-feet/year of Santa Ana River water from the Bunker Hill and Colton
  basins.<br>
  <br>
  The price of Metro water in the area is $238/acre-foot this year, and
  rising. Water rights are generally exempt from the property tax, so a
  capitalization rate of 3-4% (the real interest rate) might be
  appropriate. 4250 x 238/.04 = $25 million for the Santa Ana water
  rights alone, not including the main right which is to the San Jacinto
  River.<br>
  <br>
  Likely buyers are the City of Corona, and Eastern Municipal Water
  District (EMWD). EMWD wants to use Canyon Lake to store treated water
  from four upstream sewage plants.<br>
  <br>
  BCE is retaining C&amp;I holdings including MacArthur Place, a 66-acre
  commercial complex by John Wayne Airport; and the 58-acre Corona
  Shopping Centre, McKinley at Freeway 91, jointly owned with Sol Price
  of the Price Clubs. Price, of La Jolla, is the 253d richest American in
  Forbes' 1987 ranking. Price also controls the wealthy Ben Weingart
  Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  The Riverside Cement Company is a division of Gifford Hill, Dallas. In
  1986 C.H. Beazer Holdings of Bath, England, acquired Gifford Hill.
  Riverside Cement may sell 296 acres for development on speculation as
  an industrial park. (TPE 4 Feb 88.)<br>
  <br>
  <a name="2._AMERICANS_FROM_OTHER_STATES"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">2. AMERICANS FROM OTHER STATES</span><br>
  <br>
  A second kind of holder is the out-of-state American, individual or
  corporate.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Union Pacific Railroad</span> is
  headquartered in New York. Upland (U.P. Land) Industries is its real
  estate management division<span style="font-weight: bold;">. Oil </span>is
  its major asset, but here we look at
  its local surface holdings. These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>420 acres Vintage Industrial
Park, between Etiwanda Ave &amp; Wineville Ave [Riverside
Press-Enterprise, 6/86].  </li>
  <li>570 acres in Mira Loma near Space Center.  </li>
  <li>30
acres undeveloped land near Riverside Airport  </li>
  <li>156 acres in Fontana
[Riverside Press-Enterprise, 9/86].  </li>
  <li>300 more acres south of Van Buren,
and south of San Sevaine Industrial Center [Riverside Press-Enterprise,
4/88].</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gulf+Western Corporation</span> has
acquired Mann Theatres of Calif, a chain of 360 screens, 8th largest in
the U.S., including the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, and 2/3 of those
in Westwood Village, for $220 million, 1986; it already owned Paramount
[L.A. Times, 10/86].<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">20th Century Fox </span>is owned by
Marvin Davis, Denver oil man, 19th richest American on Forbes' list.
Holdings include 
<ul>
  <li>63 acres by Century City;  </li>
  <li>40 acres of Studio City in
San Fernando Valley (with CBS).  </li>
  <li>Eleven acres in the Studio City holding
are vacant; 29 acres are "partly used." [L.A. Times, 2/17/82].</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles Hurwitz</span> of Houston.
McCulloch Oil Company, having prospered in chain saws, went into land
development, stumbled, and in 1978 was acquired by Hurwitz. He renamed
it <span style="font-weight: bold;">MCO Holdings Inc</span>. In 1986
he added Pacific Lumber Co. of northern California (where he has come
into well-publicized conflict with environmentalists for speedy
clear-cutting, allegedly to meet debt service on junk bonds). Now
Hurwitz is poised to acquire Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp of
Oakland. Kaiser, along with Aetna Insurance of Connecticut, at one time
held 120,000 acres called Rancho California (now Temecula), and still
retains much of it through <span style="font-weight: bold;">Kacor</span>,
a subsidiary. Federated Development
Company, Hurwitz' private development company, just opened the
Ritz-Carlton Rancho Mirage on 105 acres. It was able to donate 350
acres to the city to placate environmentalists [L.A. Times, 30 May 88].<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">ALCOA </span>of Pittsburgh was the
developer of Century City. ALCOA poured in hundreds of millions of its
"patient money" on what was then a marginal site. It absorbed early
operating losses, fully deductible from ordinary income, to build up an
asset later sold for a capital gain.<br>
<br>
<a name="Santa_Fe-Southern_Pacific_SFSP"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Santa Fe-Southern Pacific (SFSP)</span>,
headquartered in Chicago in its own building, was a near-merger of two
of California's largest landholders. SP alone was already the largest
before the attempted merger, and had been, from the age of railroad
"robber barons" (Stanford, Crocker, Huntington and Flood),
beneficiaries of vast federal land grants in California. The U.S.
Government even acquired a key right-of-way, the Mesilla Valley route,
from Mexico to give the SP (the "Gadsden Purchase," 1853). In 1988 SP,
(or some part of it, along with the name) was sold to Philip Anschutz,
Denver oil man, who is liquidating some lands.<br>
<br>
SFSP holdings now include: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rights-of-way</span>, including
the right to
preempt intersections on demand. These are key assets that might be
used for mass transit, but have long been withheld from such use. (In
January, 1991, SP did agree to sell 85 miles, including the Peninsula
commuter line, to Santa Clara, San Francisco and San Mateo Counties,
for $290 millions. Sante Fe, on the other hand, is holding out for over
$1 billion for some mileage in L.A. and Riverside Counties.) The
rights-of-way give their owners preferential access to our great ports,
built and improved at public expense. Growing Pacific Basin trade, and
evolving container-shipping techniques, keep the tracks busy night and
day.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Railyards</span>. Wherever there
are stations there are railyards,
usually just off the central business district. Riverside yards are
small; Bloomington and San Bernardino yards cover hundreds of acres.
Union Station in Los Angeles., with yards, covers about 70 acres east
of Sunset/Olvera, and is about to be redeveloped, and made the focus of
mass transit in Los Angeles. (LAT, 5/88) Just northeast of downtown,
this land has the potential of rising to downtown value levels. (See
Appendix 1, The Union Station Condemnation.) The L.A. Produce Market
Mission Bay Development, San Francisco, is 208 acres of old yards just
south of San Francisco's central business district, where land sells
for over $1,000 per square foot. 158,000 acres of farmland, west side
of San Joaquin Valley, watered by California Water Project under heavy
subsidy. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timberland</span>, 520,000
acres, largest timberland owner in Calif.
This land is as good as tax exempt under California's Timber Preserve
Zone Act, which SP itself lobbied through. <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>20 acres in the San Diego
central business district, near old Santa Fe depot Pacific Design
Center,    </li>
    <li>West Hollywood, 17 acres</li>
    <li>350 acres shoreline in the East Bay,
off Berkeley, Emeryville,    </li>
    <li>Alameda 716 acres,    </li>
    <li>Fremont 450 acres,    </li>
    <li>Chula
Vista, waterfront 85 acres,    </li>
    <li>San Jose, railyard near downtown Torrance,    </li>
    <li>Park del Amo 1 Market St., San Francisco,    </li>
    <li>old Southern Pacific
headquarters, 264,000 square foot building, prime site surrounded by
higher, newer buildings    </li>
    <li>San Jose, office complex, 440,000 square feet.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
By comparison the local holdings of SFSP seem petty, yet they are
locally important and even overwhelming. They include: 
<ul>
  <li>Perris, 88 acres
business park, plus  </li>
  <li>another 100 acres Corona, prime land for business,
range of $8 per square foot (recently sold)  </li>
  <li>Fontana, 400 acres  </li>
  <li>Ontario,
500 acres  </li>
  <li>Cucamonga, 280 acres  </li>
  <li>Redlands, 300 acres</li>
</ul>
On the improved urban lands, SPSF has 8 million square feet in building
floorspace, of which 4 million square feet are in California. These
buildings include: 
<ul>
  <li>1 Market Street, San Francisco, old SP headquarters:
264,000 square feet, 10 floors (low for the district);  </li>
  <li>Pacific Design
Center, West Hollywood;  </li>
  <li>San Jose, 440,000 square feet in an office
complex, plus  </li>
  <li>85 acres of railyard near downtown;  </li>
  <li>Chicago headquarters,
371,000 square feet, 17 floors.  </li>
  <li>Torrance, Park del Amo.</li>
</ul>
Some of the lands of SPSF are <span style="font-weight: bold;">oil-bearing</span>,
in several states. (TPE,
9/87; LAT 11/87)<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The value of SF &amp; SP lands is hard
for Wall St. to know because so
much of it is undeveloped or underdeveloped. Estimates range from $2
billion to $9 billion.</span> Tax assessments understate values for
several
reasons. Traditionally, SF &amp; SP devoted major legal effort to
holding down assessed values below market. Assessors tend anyway to
undervalue vacant acreage, perhaps because of such pressure. In 1988
SFSP was in courts all over California opposing reassessments which
county assessors claimed were triggered by the attempted merger of 1983.<br>
<br>
Local real estate people know local values, but Wall St. looks more at
current earnings -- except when corporate raiders go to work on "asset
plays." SP has long been noted for having latent values yielding no
current earnings. They have now bid up the stock to 30 times earnings.
For perhaps the first time in its history SFSP is now a "motivated
seller," to fend off the raid. In 1987 the "Henley Group" was a threat.
So was Olympia and York, a large developer specializing in urban real
estate, and in 1987 considered a major threat.<br>
<br>
SPSF recently sold off much of its Corona holdings. It took the
indirect route of a stock market raid to pry loose these surplus lands
-- an indication of market failure. It remains to be seen if the new
owners will put the land to good use, or continue to hold it simply as
an idle "store of value."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Overall, SFSP lands are estimated to
be 2.4 million acres in California, or 4.8% of the privately held land
area. Nationwide holdings are 5.2 million acres. &nbsp;28,500 acres of this
are developed C&amp;I land. </span>(Riverside Press-Enterprise, 9/87;
L.A.
Times, 11/87.)<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The California Commerce Center</span>,
1,350 acres east of Ontario Airport, is now augmented by purchase of
the 505-acre Hunt tract to the south. Joint holders are 
<ul>
  <li>Cadillac
Fairview, a Canadian real estate firm with vast holdings elsewhere in
Southern California;  </li>
  <li>John D. Lusk &amp; Son, Newport Beach (Lusk is the
375th richest American on Forbes' list);  </li>
  <li>Hillman Company of Pittsburgh
(Henry Hillman of Pittsburgh is the 18th richest American on Forbes'
list);  </li>
  <li>Shaw and Talbot Assocs. II; and  </li>
  <li>a Dutch pension fund.  </li>
</ul>
The CCC
has been accorded the valuable special privilege of being a "free trade
zone", meaning anyone buying or leasing land from CCC in the zone can
import foreign materials duty-free for process and reexport. This
benefit is shifted to landholders through higher rents, higher sale
prices, and earlier sales of land.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Hunt brothers</span> of Texas held
505 acres at Archibald and Mission Blvd (sold to CCC). In 1986 they
still held 1,000 acres for a resort near Carlsbad, on the north shore
of Batiquitos Lagoon. [Riverside Press-Enterprise, 9/86]. In 1988,
pursued by creditors, they sold this, according to their liquidating
trustees, for $72 million. Then they are alleged to have transferred
much of this to their children by overpaying them for raw land in Texas
and Arizona (Business Week, May 13 1991, p.42). Thus it is possible
that parts of this once-mighty empire will remain in the family.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Major oil companies</span> loom large
in California land. Their chains of gas stations on "hot" corners are
their essential means for dominating the retail market. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Exxon, Shell,
Mobil and Chevron</span> are the dominant sellers. Of these, only
Chevron is a
California Company, and that only means its headquarters are here.
Directors and major stockholders may live anywhere.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">All oil firms overbought retail
outlets in the gas station land rush of
the 1960s, but closed stations are now profitably converted to other
uses like mini-malls, drive-ins, etc. More important, these closed
sites are preempted from competing sellers of gasoline. </span>With
such
market power it has been possible for the majors to reduce the number
of stations and convert to the now-standard non-service "service"
station. For a look at what "service" really meant until about 1970,
see the service station episode in Back to the Future with Michael J.
Fox: it is of course exaggerated, but not as much as one might assume.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Acreages held or leased for oil and
gas exploration and drilling are in the millions of acres per company. </span>No
attempt is made here to list the California holdings, but in oil-prone
areas like Kern County some major holders are Texaco, Shell, Arco,
Chevron, and Tenneco. Often other valuable assets like <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">water and
farmland and townsites </span>are acquired as incidents. Thus Tenneco,
in
acquiring Kern County Land Company, also gained nearly total control of
the Kern River, including Isabella Dam and Reservoir, wholly financed
by U.S. taxpayers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Bass family</span> of Fort Worth
holds 25% of the Disney stock. (Roy Disney is the 103d richest American
on Forbes' list. The Basses, like many others of great wealth, are too
secretive for Forbes to get the facts to put them there.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Disney </span>of course holds the original
Disneyland in Anaheim, about 80 acres in use, plus 300-400 surrounding
acres either acquired or being acquired for planned expansion (L.A.
Times, 9 May 91). This land is worth about $1 million per acre.<br>
<br>
Disney also owns 
<ul>
  <li>the Disney filming lot in Burbank;  </li>
  <li>Walt Disney World
in Florida., 28,000 acres;  </li>
  <li>Euro Disneyland near Paris, 5,000 acres; and  </li>
  <li>is now bidding for the Wrather Corporation, operator of the Queen
Mary
and Spruce Goose in Long Beach, with 47 acres for retail and parking
nearby, and a valuable option to lease 236 acres of fillable land in
Long Beach Harbor.</li>
</ul>
Disney in Long Beach exemplifies the market power inherent in large
holdings. &#8220;In a not-too-subtle bid to gain regulatory concessions in
each location (Long Beach vs. Anaheim), company officials have said
their decision (where to expand) will depend, in part, on &#8216;governmental
approval and support ...&#8217;&#8221; This refers to such matters as city
financing of freeway offramps, street improvements, parking, etc. (L.A.
Times, 9 May 91).<br>
<br>
Update, 1993: Disney used the Long Beach option as leverage to win
concessions from the City of Anaheim, and finally chose to expand there
instead. That is one of the hidden benefits of holding excess land. It
is, obviously, offset by losses to those against whom the bargaining
power is used, and is not a net social benefit, but a mark of market
failure.<br>
<br>
The core Bass holdings are most of downtown Fort Worth: 15 full blocks
and parts of 8 more. They also hold 9.9% of Texaco, which acquired all
the Getty holdings in California; and much more around the world [L.A.
Times, 10/84]. This includes a 300,000-acre "station" in Australia.
Edward P. Bass is something of a patron of science but, like royal
patrons of old, he bends science according to his whims. His exhibits
and experiments, like "Biosphere 2" (planet-in-a-bottle), are also
designed to make money.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Walter Annenberg</span>, whose primary
residence is Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, maintains another residence in
Rancho Mirage that includes a private golf course [Riverside
Press-Enterprise, 12/85]. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Water </span>for
this course is subsidized by U.S.
taxpayers, and probably City of Los Angeles taxpayers, through a
water-swapping arrangement with Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California. Annenberg is the 84th richest American on Forbes' list. He
is famous for entertaining U.S. Presidents in Rancho Mirage, not just
socially but at official functions like the visit of Japanese Prime
Minister Kaifu in March, 1990. Just what advice the host gives the
guests on these occasions is not public.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Mobil Land Development Corporation</span>,
a subsidiary of Mobil Oil, holds 1765 acres north of Redlands, east of
Church St., straddling Baseline Road. The tract, known as East
Highlands Ranch, is held for slow buildout over many years [Riverside
Press-Enterprise, 1/85]. Buildout was made more profitable in the 1990s
when the California Highway Commission constructed a multi-million
dollar interchange off I-10, leading right to East Highlands.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Edward J. De Bartolo</span> of
Youngstown, Ohio, the 28th richest American on Forbes' list, held a
major interest in the proposed Canyon Springs shopping center of the
Edgemont annexation to Riverside. Riverside City Council endowed them
with a $3 million sewer trunk extension, plus free use of the City
sewage treatment plant, and priority in sewer hookups, which are
rationed to others. (See below for ownership of Ralph's grocery store
chain.)<br>
<br>
De Bartolo was in partnership there with the Riverside firm of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thompson and Self (T&amp;S)</span>, whose
extremely rapid recent growth suggests the effect of a major influx of
outside funds. De Bartolo and/or his son "Eddie" also own and finance
the San Francisco 49ers.<br>
<br>
T&amp;S-De Bartolo devoted major but unsuccessful effort to aborting
the proposed expansion of competing Tyler Mall, and the move there of
Nordstrom's, a valuable anchor. Now, De Bartolo seems to have been
replaced by the Rockefeller Brothers, and they by James <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rouse</span>. It would
appear that major financiers control speculative land indirectly by
financing local developers, using the latter's local political
connections. T&amp;S itself is not wealthy or liquid, narrowly avoiding
insolvency in 1989. In May, 1991, it is again threatened with
foreclosure for failing to meet payments on some $18 million owed one
of its several creditors.<br>
<br>
Tyler Mall, the main shopping center in Riverside, is owned by the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Cigna Corp</span>. of Connecticut, an
insurance and finance firm. Riverside is a species of domestic 3d World
battleground on which giant alien financial powers, working through
surrogates as fronts, wage their "mall wars."<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Von's</span> now holds 360 grocery
stores in California (after acquiring 172 Safeway stores). Such large
chain landholdings tend to lessen competition, it is widely feared
[L.A. Times, 28 May 88]. Congressmen who shop in Washington, D.C. know
this first-hand. Washington food prices are conspicuously high, where
Safeway is one of just two chains (the other is Giant).<br>
<br>
Some of the acquired stores are probably on leased sites, which would
help account for the low price of the Safeway acquisition, averaging
$2.4 million per store. Long-term leaseholds often acquire some value
of their own when the remaining years' payments are below the market;
but not as high as fee simple titles.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Update, 1993. Von's, Southern Cal's
biggest grocer, is gobbling up 53 leases released by Builders' Emporium
"in a shut-out strategy against competitors." Von's is doing this by
negotiating with Builders' Emporium itself, Irvine. The buildings are
40,000 sf to 90,000 sf, the right size for supermarkets, and are of
course complete with vast parking lots in the requisite 5/1 ratio.
Von's will convert 6-8 to markets, and "hold onto the others until
commercial rents rebound - then market them to non-rivals." (TPE 15 Oct
93 C7) Salamon Bros. analyst Jonathan Ziegler praises this as
"ingenious." "You're controlling who's in your market area." Ralphs had
been looking, is shut out. (This may be "ingenious" for Von's, but is a
zero-sum game with Ralph's, and a net loss for the market economy. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Land
is held idle simply to suppress competition: a clear case of market
failure.</span>)</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Update, 1994. Vons has about 19% of the
Southern California market; Lucky and Ralphs both have 14%. Vons, based
in Arcadia, has 331 stores in Southern California, including some
called Pavilions, Tianguis, and EXPO. Also, 15 in Las Vegas. (LAT 26
Apr 94 D1)<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alpha Beta</span>. Owner of Alpha Beta
(131 stores) is Yucaipa Company, which also owns the Boys (24 stores)
and Viva (15 stores) chains, and Food 4 Less warehouse stores. All
these are operated by Food 4 Less Supermarkets, La Habra. (Food 4 Less
has been the only chain willing to serve South Central LA, and other
communities with large minority populations.) Their value is estimated
at $1 billion.<br>
<br>
Former owner of Alpha Beta was, L.S. Skaggs, chairman of American
Stores, Salt Lake City. Alpha Beta lost market share by failing to
replace stores built in the 1960s. These became too small. It was
preoccupied with its stores elsewhere, and allowed Alpha Beta to lose
market share.<br>
<br>
In 1988, American Stores merged with Lucky Stores. It has 439 grocery
stores in California and Las Vegas, but only 222 in Southern
California. But in combination with Alpha Beta units, there would have
been 370 stores in southern California alone. Its Lucky unit is based
in Dublin, CA. It operates 1695 stores in 27 states, including the
Sav-on unit, based in Anaheim. After anti-trust suits, it kept the
Lucky stores in Northern California and put Lucky in charge of its new
Alpha Beta stores. However, in Southern California. FTC blocked the
purchase, so it sold 145 stores in southland to Yucaipa Co. (What
happened to the excess of 145 over 131? - 14 stores closed, or sold?)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Grocery stores in auto-oriented
Southern California require perhaps a 6/1 ratio of parking to floor
space, so these "stores" are mainly landholdings. 360 stores at 5 acres
each (estimated) would come to 1800 acres: a large figure when we
consider it is all good retail space.</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ralph's grocery</span>, 129 stores run
from Compton, California, is held by Federated Dept. Stores, a
Cincinnati-based chain, owned by De Bartolo plus other shareholders. It
was acquired by Robert Campeau of Toronto, who was taking offers in
1988. Bidding was around $1 billion, or $7.8 million per store, much
higher than the Safeway price.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Update, 9/94. George White, "Alpha Beta
and Ralph's Merger Expected Soon." LAT 12 Sept., p.1. Ralph's (167
stores) and Alpha Beta (131 stores) expected to announce merger soon.
Would then be larger than Von's. Von's has 19% of Southern California
market; new merger would have 27%. The name Alpha Beta would be
retired. Ralph's would be selling to Yucaipa. Payment would be $500
million, plus assuming debt of $1 billion. Thus, assets of new merger
would be $2.5 billion.</div>
<br>
From 10 to 30 of the Ralph's stores, and many of the Alpha Beta stores
would be converted to Food 4 Less warehouse stores. Some stores would
be closed, and people laid off.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">McCrory Stores</span>, headquartered
in York, Pennsylvania, controlled by Meshulam Riklis, is a chain with
1289 stores around the U.S.A., 140 of them in California. In Rialto it
has a 104-acre site at Cactus and Merrill. (TPE 9/87)<br>

<a name="3._CALIFORNIANS"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.
CALIFORNIANS</span><br>
<br>
Many of our largest landholders also live in California. This is partly
because the lands are here, but moreso because certain places in
California are good places to live. One of the advantages of receiving
property as opposed to labor income is it lets one choose his
residence. California ranks after New York in the number of rich
Americans (using Forbes' list) who reside here.<br>
<br>
Also included here are California-based corporations. A corporation's
"base" refers simply to the site of its headquarters: its shareholders
are scattered around the world, and the major shareholders, who
exercise control, are effectively screened behind layers of trusts and
financial institutions, so they are impossible to identify with
certainty.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Newhall Land Partnership</span>
holds 123,000 acres, mainly in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, from
Valencia and Magic Mountain west down the Santa Clara Valley of the
south toward Piru and Fillmore. The ancestral Newhall estate, occupied
by Scott Newhall, is in Piru. The holding was originally a Spanish
grant to the del Valle family. The Newhall family still controls the
public partnership, with 40% of the shares. [L.A. Times, 3/86, 8/87].
The Newhalls are developing the city of Valencia, but slowly.
Approximately 7,000 of its 10,000 acres remain undeveloped.<br>
<br>
The Newhalls were early, major financial backers of the political
campaigns for the Peripheral Canal bond issue to bring more northern
water south. The immediate purpose of this proposed project was to
valorize speculative landholdings like theirs on the fringe of the
southern megalopolis. They joined in this campaign with other large
development interests:<span style="font-weight: bold;"> the Irvine
Company, Southern California Edison, Security Pacific Bank, Rockwell,
Mission Viejo (the O'Neills), Bixby Ranch, and Union Oil</span> [L.A.
Times, 1/80]. Yeager Construction Company (highways and landholdings)
led the campaign in Riverside County.<br>
<br>
These same interests wield special influence on private and public
higher education, working behind the scenes. They stand in well with
the press: in fact, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chandler
family of the Times-Mirror Company</span> is one of them, owning the
vast Tejon Ranch. Scott Newhall was once editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle. (It is alleged by Stanley Sapiro that "the Newhall ranch was
assembled by the owners of the San Francisco Chronicle." ) They
dominate Chambers of Commerce. They generally dominate the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California (MWDSC)</span>, the regional water supply agency, which has
long overtaxed the City of Los Angeles to subsidize expansion to
outlying areas.<br>
<br>
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is run by a
Board of 50 Directors, representing 27 cities and districts that it
serves. Those from cities are elected on the basis of
"one-person-one-vote." Those from several outlying districts are
elected by "one-acre-one-vote." Representatives from landowner-run
districts remain the same from election to election, thus gaining
seniority to dominate the 50-person Board.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Thus a
handful of speculative landowners have as many votes as millions
of city residents.</span> Accordingly, MWDSC preaches water
conservation in
the cities while it keeps annexing new speculations at its fringes. It
is probably no accident that its current President represents the
Western Municipal Water District of Riverside County, an area dominated
by land speculators. Many economists have criticized its persistent
refusal to consider any kind of economically rational, cost-justified
rate structure.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Irvine Company</span>. In Orange
County the remaining developable land is in a very few "strong,
patient" hands. Smallholdings were sold and developed early. The
largest holder is the Irvine Company, which is now led by Donald Bren
of Newport Beach, the 30th richest American on Forbes' list. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
holding is variously listed at 68,000 acres to 80,000 acres, about 1/6
of all the land in Orange County.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
Most of it is still undeveloped.<br>
<br>
It was a Spanish land grant that got its Scotch name when James Irvine
married into the family. It was tied up for years by the trustees of
the Irvine Estate, according to various lawsuits and public statements
of heiress Joan Irvine Smith of Middleburg, Virginia. Control passed to
a Michigan group led by Henry Ford II and William Taubman and Max
Fisher of Michigan, and more recently to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Donald Bren</span> of Newport Beach.
Bren is a major contributor to Republican Party campaigns, as O'Neill
(of Mission Viejo) is to Democratic campaigns. (James Minor, recently
deceased potato baron of Riverside County, contributed to both, and
showed special interest in electing the County Sheriff.)<br>
<br>
All holders have devoted major efforts to contesting their property tax
assessments. Property taxes on undeveloped land drain cash from an
owner, getting his attention, and are for many owners their primary
motive to dispose of surplus land. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Until quite
recently the Irvine
policy was never to sell, only to lease land.</span> Confrontations
with
lessees over escalating ground rents have been highly visible, and
probably contributed to the recent Assessor's decision to upvalue the
assessment considerably in excess of Bren's 1983 purchase price [L.A.
Times, 1/29/84]. The Assessor has an unlikely ally also in Joan Irvine,
who claims her shares have been undervalued in various settlements.
Bren took the Assessor to court, but the resulting figure was nearer
the Assessor's than Bren's.<br>
<br>
Bren is not accelerating development and sales. In 1988 he cut the
staff by 20%. The policy is to skim the cream of the market, but very
slowly, by limiting development to highest quality. California's
Proposition 13 of 1978, capping property taxes at 1% of market value,
keeps the burden low and tolerable when prices are rising at 20% a year.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rancho Mission Viejo</span> is second
in size at 38,000 acres. It is held by Richard O'Neill and his sister,
Alice O'Neill Avery, 317th and 318th richest Americans on Forbes' list.
Richard O'Neill is prominent in California Democratic Party politics.
Irvine and O'Neill representatives are from time to time on various
citizens' advisory committees to the NAGS campus at UCR.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Mission Viejo Company</span>, with
9,100 acres, comes in third. It is held by Philip Reilly.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The U.S. Government holds 80,000 acres</span>
of National Forest and military land in Orange County [L.A. Times,
1/29/84]. Much of this is of low quality for development, but by no
means all. Surplus land is seldom divested by any government agency, at
any level. Once acquired it never appears in the budget, and is tax
free. Bureaucrats never need justify or account for it; but if sold the
proceeds would return to the general fund. They always find many "good"
reasons not to sell.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Chevron Land and Development Company</span>
holds the Ontario Center, the former Ontario Speedway, 673 acres. It
is still 90% vacant. Chevron, like Irvine, hews to a policy of slow
sales and development [Riverside Press-Enterprise]. The parent Socal
is, of course, an international major oil company, one of the "seven
sisters," one of four partners in Aramco. Its total U.S. holdings,
including oil leaseholds, are about 9 million acres [Hartzok;
Rothschild]. It recently acquired Gulf Oil Company in the largest
merger in history (turning 7 sisters into 6, like the Pleiades).<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Dominguez heirs</span> represent
an old Spanish grant of 75,000 acres, dating from 1784, courtesy of
King Carlos III. Unlike most, they have held on to much of it. They own
the Watson Land Company. One of its smaller projects is the Watson
Industrial Center, 750 acres in Carson [L.A. Times, 9-86]. Dominguez
lands are in the South Bay area on both sides of the San Diego Freeway.
Dominguez heirs -- there are many -- also hung onto mineral rights in
this oil-rich area. Water rights, too: the Dominguez Water Company
supplies Torrance. There are also the Carson Estate Company and the
Dominguez Properties, Inc. [Birmingham, America's Secret Aristocracy.]<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Camarillo family</span>. Camarillo,
Calif., is a town that sprang up around the ranch of the Camarillo
family. Dona Carmen Camarillo de Jones (!) is the family dowager, still
spurning offers for the remaining 5,000 acres of the original Rancho
Calleguas [Birmingham, p. 195].<br>
<br>
The Los Angeles central business district is moving south along
Figueroa, and as it moves, speculators anticipating it buy and hold
land in the van. In the process they often neglect current uses,
letting them go to blight. Among the large holders south along Figueroa
are <span style="font-weight: bold;">Transamerica, Occidental Life,
Pacific Lighting, and California Hospital Medical Center.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Agua Caliente band of Cajuilla
Indians</span> own much of Palm Springs, checkerboard fashion, through
an ancient treaty. This puts them among the richest Indians, and
richest Americans of any ethnicity.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaiser Steel</span> has 2,000 acres in
Fontana, originally acquired dirt cheap with federal aid to build a war
plant. Its coal reserves are estimated at $500 million (TPE, 5/83). It
has an oil rig division in Vallejo. It also seems to have established
de facto ownership of the Eagle Mountain open pit iron mine in eastern
Riverside County, on Federal land.<br>
<br>
Kaiser may be bankrupt as a steel producer, but the dirt is no longer
cheap, nor is it limited to the operating steel plant. Whether the
liquidation value of this huge block of developable land will go to
Kaiser creditors and bereft pensioners is unknown to me, but Kaiser may
have followed the lead of Penn Central, and other prominent bankrupts,
whose management first spun off valuable landholdings for the benefit
of others.<br>
<br>
In the 1980s, during the energy crisis, Kaiser aspired to become an
energy producer. To this end it sought to acquire exclusive rights to
combustible trash generated by various cities, including Riverside. The
idea seemed to be to acquire monopoly rights before going into
business. Nothing seems to have come of this directly, but it has
evolved into a landfill project, as discussed next.<br>
<br>
In the 1990s, Kaiser is trying to convert "its" empty open-pit iron
mine into a land-fill to serve all of southern California. This entails
violating the terms of its lease with BLM, which represents the U.S.
Government, the landowner. BLM management has been complaisant, but
some local political candidates are not, and this may be decided at the
ballot box.<br>
<br>
This also entails transporting trash over hundreds of miles, to do
which it must establish an effective easement to have trash carried
over the intervening rights-of-way. The matter is being vigorously
contested.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Kaiser Aluminum</span> has the same
name and provenance as Kaiser Steel, but is a separate corporate
entity, not sharing the woes of Kaiser Steel. It teamed with <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Aetna Insurance</span> of Connecticut to
acquire what is now <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rancho California,</span>
originally an old ranch of over
100,000 acres. State-financed freeways and the California aqueduct
brought urban value to this once remote and arid area. Kaiser-Aetna set
up "Kacor" to cash in, as they have been doing.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Ronald Preissman family</span> of
Los Angeles held 1700 acres in the Perris Valley for 25 years. In 1988
they sold 600 acres of it to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rancon
Corporation</span>, for $21,500 per
acre, also to hold for the rise. The acreage is between Ramona
Expressway and Nuevo Road. (TPE 9 April 88). Good timing by Preissman;
bad for Rancon. Rancon is a real estate agency associated with <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rancho
California</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CalMat Cement</span> holds $500
million worth of developable land in California. It has been "slow to
develop real estate no longer needed for its business." A raider
appeared in 1988: Ron Brierly of New Zealand. He bid $1 billion. (If
they were smart, they sold.) (LAT, 24 March 88.)<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rohr Industries</span> is
headquartered in Chula Vista, CA; its holdings are interstate. Its
Riverside plant on Arlington Avenue covers 80 acres (it also leases an
east-side warehouse with 15 acres, and 24 acres in Moreno Valley). In
1984 the City of Riverside expanded its "Airport Redevelopment Area" to
include Rohr, and help Rohr acquire more land. (TPE, Nov. 1986)<br>
<br>
Rohr has long been one of the largest users of power from Riverside's
municipally owned power system. It benefits hugely from quantity
discounts given by the utility, plus a special exemption from the City
utility tax given for consumption above a certain level. Only a very
few customers receive this benefit, but about 1/3 of all the power sold
by the utility is thus exempted from tax. The tax privilege was
withdrawn in 1991, but Rohr and other beneficiaries are working hard to
reinstate it. They still get the wholesale discounts. Their influence
at City Hall must be experienced to be appreciated.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Riverside Press-Enterprise</span>.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">In most cities, the dominant
local paper is the largest downtown
landowner.</span> The Riverside Press-Enterprise owns its site from
14th to
Prospect Streets, and Olivewood to Orange Grove, right next to a
Freeway interchange. Like Rohr Industries, it benefited before 1991 by
the exemption of most of its power from the city utility user tax, and
still enjoys quantity discounts. Just across the Freeway, using the
Cridge Street overpass, is its Vine Street garage, with land for its
fleet of 265 trucks, vans, and cars. (TPE, 19 June 86) The City
recently eased its fleet operations by stopping traffic from 14th
Street, giving the right-of-way to Kane Street, the stub connecting the
Press-Enterprise to the 91 Freeway on-ramp.<br>
<br>
The City has also loaned its power of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eminent
domain</span> to the
Press-Enterprise, helping it acquire the land along Olivewood by
condemning private homes. Newspaper support is valuable when one runs
for public office. About this same time, however, the Press-Enteprise
shifted the focus of its news coverage from the City that shelters it
to the whole suburban county. The families were evicted and the houses
razed several years ago, but, as of October, 1994, the land is still
vacant and derelict, not even used for parking. It is held for - what?
The possibility of future need? Did this warrant condemning homes?
Politicians are so loathe to use eminent domain to expand parks or
schools, but the possible future expansion of a newspaper, that's
different!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Yeager family</span> of Riverside
built up its construction company business by anticipating where new
highways were to go. They acquired gravel sources near at hand, which
gave them an edge. After yielding gravel, the sites were available for
other uses, like urban development. They have extensive holdings in the
Agua Mansa district along the Santa Anna River, including parts of
Riverside, Colton, and Rialto. They got this made into "The Agua Mansa
Enterprise Zone," meaning they receive special tax breaks. They lease
some land from Riverside County. (TPE, 2/86).<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Homestead Land Development Company</span>
is a subsidiary of Homestead Saving &amp; Loan, Burlingame. In 1988 it
held 70 acres in Riverside, at Barton and Van Buren; 972 acres in
Canyon Lake; a theatre in Moreno Valley; and 230 homes in Rancho
California (renamed Temecula).<br>
<br>
Homestead works with S.I.C. Corporation of Los Angeles (Allen Siegal?).
S.I.C. develops the land, sells the finished lots to Homestead. The
1500-acre Orangecrest development is being handled this way (TPE, 4/88).<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="4._INSTITUTIONS"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.
INSTITUTIONS</span><br>
<br>
Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends to
stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stanford University</span>. The
Stanford campus is known as "the farm." Its area equals one-third as
much as the entire City of San Francisco, water and all. The land has a
very high value for residential and commercial development. When and if
some of it is so developed, the land finally becomes taxable. There is
no effort, however, to collect back taxes on the century the land has
been held tax free - let alone interest on that amount, with
inflationary adjustments.<br>
<br>
Public Colleges, however democratic, follow the same practices. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Riverside Community College (RCC)</span>
acquired 120 acres at La Sierra and Freeway 91 about 1958, for
expansion. The site is by an interchange. RCC has not expanded there,
however, but acquired additional sites in Norco and Moreno Valley, the
last as a "gift" from a developer whose surrounding lands would be
greatly enhanced by the investment of millions of taxpayer dollars on
the gifted land. Only today is there any plan to use the land. In 1991,
Mayor Frizzel, supporting a neighborhood protest, vetoed a specific
plan that offended the neighbors. President Kane of RCC took it fairly
calmly, remarking to the press "we can wait." RCC has already been
waiting 33 years.<br>
<br>
The plan is not to use most of it for RCC purposes but to generate
income from ground leases. The commercial portions will be taxable, but
the speculative holding over 33 years was tax free, with no recapture
of back taxes. Neither is there to be any capital gains tax, nor would
there be even if they sold it outright.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">California School for the Deaf</span>
acquired a 75 acre campus in 1953. The 6 acres on Lincoln Avenue have
never been even grassed over and were declared surplus in 1986, after
33 years. [Riverside Press-Enterprise, 10/86]. Seven years later they
have not changed, a total so far of 40 years without any use.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sherman Indian School </span>covers
about 80 acres at Magnolia and Jackson, serving a very small number of
students.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Loma Linda University (LLU).</span>
The La Sierra Campus includes a dairy farm of 300 acres, valued at
about $30 millions as is. With the very survival of LLU in question
there is talk of selling, but so far it remains just that, talk.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">California Baptist College</span> on
Magnolia near Adams has lands beyond its needs along Magnolia, a prime
location for apartments. In dire straights it is finally marketing a
small portion thereof, but so far at a price so high the latest deal
collapsed in early 1990. Later it was cobbled back together, but to
date (May, 1991) there is no action.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">University of California, Riverside</span>
holds over 1,000 acres in Riverside, and another large tract in Moreno
Valley. The UC system overall holds 58,000 acres in 37 cties outright,
plus 4,765 acres in other states, plus 67,000 leased acres . It is
allegedly all used for "academic purposes" [Riverside Press-Enterprise,
4/78].<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Mormon Church</span> for years
held 1,514 acres in Woodcrest, until 1984 when they sold it to Beverly
Hills developer Allen Siegel. The core of the Church's holdings, of
course, is the central business district of Salt Lake City.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Los Angeles County</span> holds a good
deal of land in its own name. It leased out the ground for Marina del
Rey in the early 60s. It recently closed the Long Beach Hospital and
leased out the 26-acre site to the Long Beach Signal Hill Business
Center, for 66 years. The receipts go into the general fund and are
used to serve the public. Actually, that seems not a bad alternative to
taxation, provided politicians make no "sweetheart deals." Regrettably,
that cannot be assumed.<br>
