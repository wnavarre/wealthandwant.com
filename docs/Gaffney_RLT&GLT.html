<br>
<a name="I" id="I"></a><b>I. Shared
postulates</b>
<p>Those at this meeting mostly share certain postulates that draw us
together and, (unfortunately) differentiate us from followers of the
conventional wisdom. We are growing and they are shrinking, but they
retain the inertia of custom, the power of entrenchment, and the
discipline of obstinant faith; so we have a special need to pull
together and unify ourselves.</p>
<p>What are these distinguishing postulates we share?</p>
<p><b>A. There is a paramount public interest, at the least, in how
resources are owned and used; at most, many of us hold that The Earth
is common property that no owner has a right to abuse, misuse, or
withhold in excess.</b></p>
<p><b>B. We would assert the common interest mainly within the market
mechanism, whose positive merits we appreciate. </b>We would work by
improving the market, using green taxes. On the spending side, we
would root out all Perverse Subsidies that foster pollution, as
catalogued in the new book by Norman Myers of Oxford's Green
College.</p>
<p><b>C. Green taxes hew to the principle of untaxing goods to tax
bads. </b>They untax adding-value, and instead tax subtracting-
value. They enhance social efficiency by stopping waste while letting
work and saving keep their full earnings. In economese, they enhance
the incentives that best allocate scarce resources among competing
ends. They also conserve resources to sustain human life over
time.</p>
<p>Fiscally, to replace perverse subsidies with green taxes "turns
nega-bucks into mega-bucks," to the double advantage of the Treasury,
which may then abate taxes on doing good.</p>
<p><b>D. Green taxation reconciles Allocative Efficiency with
Distributive Justice.</b> It downtaxes work and saving, while
uptaxing unearned income and wealth - what Carver called "findings
and stealings."</p>
<p>After paying for public services, we would distribute any surplus
as a social dividend. Thus, green taxes are seen not as a necessary
evil, but a positive instrument for good, in the idealistic spirit of
Wm. Godwin and his rambunctious son-in-law, that Oxford expellee,
Percy Shelley.</p>
<p><b>E. We favor containing urban sprawl (and other kinds of
scattered settlement), reserving more land for ecological habitat and
environmental services.</b></p>
<p><b>In sum, we agree that land and resources are our common
heritage; we have a right and duty to manage them to prevent waste in
the common interest; and green taxation, used to modify the market,
is the best tool of management.</b></p>
<p>To assemble a congregation sharing those goals is unusual.
Rentiers own or fund and control most of the media, and a growing
part of the intellectual establishment, which therefore support
pundits and professors who take as dogma that rentier income and its
sources are sacred, central to our welfare, and taboo. They will do
their worst to belittle, subvert and divide us. Let us not make their
job any easier. We will always have to offset their opposition, it
goes with the territory. It will take our united strength to overcome
it, so let us anticipate and work out whatever residual differences
we have.</p>
<p><a name="II" id="II"></a><b>II. What is
waste, and what should we do about it?</b></p>
<p>We are all against wasting resources: wonderful - but what is
waste? In answering, I will deal with two cognate questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We agree, we should combat waste with a family of green taxes,
but what green taxes? When, and where, and why?</li>
  <li>We agree on containing sprawl, but should we stress repelling
people from designated green areas, or attracting them to designated
human habitats?</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="IIA" id="IIA"></a><b>A. What is waste?</b></p>
<p>The question has been faced before. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gifford
Pinchot</span> was a leader
with a magic name in the U.S.A. during the early conservation era. He
answered well for his times and, I submit, for ours too.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>"... natural resources must be developed and preserved
for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few. ...
the people shall get their fair share of the benefit which comes from
the development of the country which belongs to us all."</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He did not say just "preserved;" he said "developed and
preserved." Today I suspect he would say "REdevelop," to get away
from the negative baggage carried by "develop;" I certainly will.</p>
<p>Pinchot went on:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>"The first principle of conservation is development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes (he mentions water for power and
transportation) for all the exhaustible natural resources, ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ...
    <p>In the second place conservation stands for the prevention of
waste. ... "</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So Pinchot was against waste, like everyone, but he gives it a new
turn (or, rather, an old turn that many have forgotten). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To him,
WASTE MEANS FAILING TO USE RENEWABLE RESOURCES</span>. Urban land makes
a
good example. Urban land, economically speaking, is a lot like
falling water, strange as it seems. Economists (who are not all bad)
classify urban land as a "flow resource." They liken it to flowing
water because its services perish with time, whether used or not -
and we are trapped in the one-way flow of time. It is an even better
example of a "flow resource" than water itself, because unused water
may have other uses downstream. Even in wasting out through
California's Golden Gate, fresh water repels salinity. The unreaped
harvests of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the
Golden Gate of time like lost loves, and magic moments that passed us
by. The waste of NOT using flow resources is just as real as the
waste of misusing exhaustible resources. Indeed, when we tote up the
transportation costs of disintegrated urban settlement patterns, it
is clear that failure to use good urban land is a major cause of
wasting energy.</p>
<p><a name="IIB" id="IIB"></a><b>B. Two kinds of green
taxes</b></p>
<p>There are at least two kinds of green taxes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One kind says No!
Don't! Stop! I shall call them "<b>Red Light Taxes</b>." (They are
also called Pigovian taxes, effluent charges, etc.) <br>
  </li>
  <li>Another kind says
Yes! Do! Go! I shall call them "<b>Green Light Taxes</b>."</li>
</ul>
It is fair
to say that most people today who think of themselves as
"green-taxers" think mainly in terms of Red Light Taxes, a Decalogue
of Thou Shalt Not's, to constrain people from doing ill.
<p>That is a goal I fully support. Taken by itself, however, it is
unbalanced and incomplete. It seems to make light of people's need to
produce and consume goods, to earn a living, and find shelter. This
limits its allure, and makes green-taxers vulnerable to critics
tarring us as arrogant "elitists" and heartless misanthropes in white
lab coats.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> MY THESIS IS THAT "GREEN
LIGHT TAXES" DESERVE A PROMINENT
PLACE in our programme.</span> It is not enough to stop the waste of
using
what should not be used. The counterpart is using what should be
used; not to do so is also waste, in some ways the worst kind.</p>
<p><b>The prototype of Green Light Taxes is what our Conference
Proposal calls a Site-value Tax.</b> It is a tax based simply on
holding ownership of land, and excluding others therefrom during a
time slot. It is NOT based on using lands and resources, nor on
hiring workers and producing goods and services, nor on building and
dwelling in residences. As to quantity, it is gauged to the market
value of land, which in turn is based on the potential net income
from land, so the social charge is proportioned to the social loss
that would ensue from wasting the perishable services of each
individual parcel of land.</p>
<p><a name="IIC" id="IIC"></a><b>C. Two kinds of
containment policy</b></p>
<p>Likewise, there are at least two kinds of containment policies for
urban sprawl.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One says <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stop! Thou shalt not </span>settle
outside the designated growth boundary, neither shalt thou build, nor
manufacture, nor trade, nor store goods, nor park vehicles, nor disport
thyself in other than traditional country-squire-like amusements. I
shall call this a "negative containment policy."</li>
  <li>The other policy says Go!, or rather <b>Come! Come into my city
and rebuild it</b>. This is not "development" in the modern pejorative
sense of territorial expansion. Rather it is REdevelopment in the
manner of the phoenix - the mythical bird, that is, not the city
misnamed Phoenix, which is an awful example of mindless lateral
expansion without renewal.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Consider Philadelphia, once the City of Brotherly Love founded
by an idealistic English Quaker. Today, after 3 centuries of
development, Philadelphia has 15,800 vacant lots, but that only
begins the story. It has 27,000 empty houses (i.e. junkers on usable
lots that might as well be vacant); 1500 acres of vacant land and
brownfields; and 700 vacant commercial bldgs.</b> A local journalist
names it BlightTown, U.S.A. If he travelled a bit he'd find it is
only one of many.</p>
<p>The result of decay without renewal is to threaten the
countryside; settlers spill out, "like ghosts from an enchanter
fleeing." Yet, these are not ghosts, nor autumn leaves in the west
wind; these are live people. Destroy man's habitat here and he moves
it there, and takes habitat from other life forms. The solutions to
urban decay and disintegration are infilling and renewal. Here is
where the Green Light Tax is such a good management tool. It lets
cities rebuild themselves without tax penalties on new building, and
rise like the phoenix from their own ashes.</p>
<p>There is a reflex against growth and development we must learn to
overcome. "Growth" should not be an issue to divide us: it depends on
the kind of growth. Resentment of growth and development stems in
large part from associating them with territorial expansion.
Infilling and renewal and rehab, however, UNCOUPLE growth from
sprawl: they let cities grow (or at least stop shrinking) without
sprawling. Ascending to a satellite view, let's look at the whole
system of settlement: focusing people where they should be keeps them
away from where they shouldn't be.</p>
<p>Here is an aerial view of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a state
dominated by owners of million-acre ranches, and therefore with about
the lowest property tax rate in the U.S. Albuquerque sprawls out
about 30 miles east-west, and another 30 miles north-south, giving a
density of about 300-400 people per square mile for its 330,000
residents. Many of its homes are slums.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the aerial view of Sydney, Australia, a city
that raises a lot of its budget from "Green Light" taxes on site
value. Sydney and suburbs have nearly 3 million people, on less land
than Albuquerque, and with no slums.</p>
<p><b>There is plenty of land to go around.</b> The pleasant green
villages of Shorewood and Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin are upper-income
Milwaukee suburbs that feature detached homes on tree-lined streets,
with detached garages, laws against overnight curb parking, a number
of lakeshore mansions with parklike grounds, ample public parks, good
shopping, and a little industry. Their densities are 10,000 persons
per square mile. At this density, 250 million Americans would fit
nicely into less than half of Wisconsin, an average-sized one of 50
states. (They would occupy 0.7% of the United States.)</p>
<p>At the 10,000 density, Greater Milwaukee would fit inside
Milwaukee County, yet it now sprawls out over several counties. It
sprawls farther yet if one counts the rural residents who float in
and out of town for seasonal work. Shorewood and Whitefish Bay have
high density because they are the only Milwaukee suburbs with no
vacant land; the others, and the central city itself, are full of
holes. <b>Result: sprawl, invasion of wildlands, loss of farmland,
forced automobilization of former pedestrians, water pollution from
new grading - the whole litany of green laments. High density is not
their cause, but their cure.</b></p>
<p><a name="III" id="III"></a><b>III. Raising wage
rates</b></p>
<p>Classical political economists looked at what determines how
income is shared among land, labor and capital. They established that
when settlement moves out or up to poorer lands, wage rates fall and
land rents rise. They called it diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Malthus, Ricardo and Mill attributed this mainly to population
growth. Darwinism reinforced the idea. This expansion of human
settlement also invades wildernesses, and floodplains, and erosive
soils, and forests, and waters, and the air, etc. Thus, what was bad
for labor was also bad for green values.</p>
<p>In the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, parallel movements in
England and the U.S.A. modified ideas in a more optimistic and
problem-solving spirit. These were Radical-Liberalism in England, and
Progressivism in the U.S.A. These thinkers noted it is not just human
fecundity that makes population push on the means of subsistence, it
is also prodigal waste of the best lands that might be supporting a
much larger population. The Rad-Libs programme entailed "internal
colonization," a reaction to imperialism. Imperialists Halford
Mackinder and Leo Amery argued for internal development, because
external expansion was exhausted. Even Kipling wrote his contrite
"Recessional." In 1906 Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
said, "We wish to make the land less of a pleasure-ground for the
rich, and more of a treasure-house for the nation." Politics, after
three centuries, was catching up with the Utopia of Thomas More, and
the later visions of Oliver Goldsmith and Percy Shelley.</p>
<p>American Progressives had various names for it, including Civic
Revival, Reform Darwinism, the Social Gospel, and Conservation.
Gifford Pinchot, cited earlier, captured its spirit. Henry George was
a leading spokesman in both nations. The idea was, and is, to use
"Green Light" taxes to intensify the use and settlement of good
lands, thus to draw people back in from invading badlands and
wilderness lands. In one stroke, Green Light taxation helps both to
raise wage rates and save wilderness areas. It makes these goals
compatible and mutually supportive.</p>
<p>My main thesis is that Civic Revival and Internal Colonization,
which mean building urban infrastructure plus filling it in, go hand
in hand with saving wildlands, environment and ecology. The details
differed then from now, but the spirit is the same.</p>
<p><a name="IV" id="IV"></a><b>IV. The need for
user charges</b></p>
<p>My fellow Green-lighters have a lot to learn about Red Light Taxes
and charges, too. Much of what all of us need to learn has been
worked out by those often-awful but sometimes-useful economists,
under the name of "marginal-cost pricing." On private land, where the
owner controls access, there is little need for user charges (except
for externalities). The owner's self-interest takes care of finding
the optimal intensity of use. On public land, however, with
unrestricted access, it is another matter. Witness, for example, the
crowding of Oxford sidewalks relative to the undercrowding of private
and University lands abutting them.</p>
<p>On public lands, when a bridge is new, and oversized for its
traffic, no toll should be charged: circumstances call instead for a
Green Light Tax on the benefited lands, to hasten their settlement.
When traffic queues up, however, it is time to charge a toll (and/or
to widen the bridge).</p>
<p>Likewise, when demand for water exceeds supply, it is time to
price it and charge people for withdrawing it from Nature. The
history of irrigation in California is instructive. During the
Populist and Progressive eras Californians developed the legal
framework for what we call <b>Irrigation Districts</b>, to divert,
store and distribute water. They raised funds by taxing land; most of
them delivered water free of variable cost. Likewise, no one charged
them for taking our water from our rivers. There was ample water, so
it seemed, running to waste, or into swamps. The result, from
1900-30, was to convert California from pasture and wasteland to the
#1 farm state in America. It was a Georgist object lesson, and a
brilliant success story. Quoth Albert Henley, a prominent
attorney,</p>
<blockquote>"The discovery of the legal formula of these organizations
was of infinitely greater value to California than the discovery of
gold a generation before. They are an extraordinarily potent engine for
the creation of wealth."</blockquote>
<p>A worm in the apple was waste of water. The same policy that
promoted close economy and rapid conversion of land also tolerated
waste of water, and even subsidized it by basing the quantity of
rival water claims on histories of use - what economists now call
"rent-seeking." It was once a minor problem, but times change, and
"circumstances alter cases." Today we are stuck with much of our
water, a limiting natural resource, frozen in lower uses and withheld
from higher ones - exactly what Georgist policy is supposed to
prevent. The solution, clearly, is for the State to charge each
Irrigation District (and other diverters) per unit of water they
take, and reallocate the great surpluses they would immediately stop
taking.</p>
Traditional "Green Light" Georgists need to introspect deeply over
this case, and many like it, and master the theory and practice of
marginal-cost pricing as developed so ably by closet Georgist
economists like Harold Hotelling and <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/studies/Gaffney_on_Vickrey.html">William
Vickrey</a>. Marginal-cost
pricing is a flexible, adaptable theory that allows for both Green
Light and Red Light taxes, each in the its season. Using this basic,
simple tool of economic analysis, Red Light and Green Light champions
can compose their differences and move ahead in triumphant unity.<br>
