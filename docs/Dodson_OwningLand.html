  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Owning Land:
  Key to Wealth Building? </span></p>
  <p>by Edward J. Dodson    </p>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among activists involved in anti-poverty
initiatives, there is a deep commitment to expanding opportunities for
home ownership as a primary path to individual wealth building. The
statistics tell the tale: the amount of equity (i.e., the difference
between what one owes to mortgage lenders and market value) in a
residential property represents the majority of net worth enjoyed by
most households in the United States. While the percentage of
households who have reserves invested in corporate stocks, in corporate
and government debt, or in money market funds is relatively high, only
a very small percentage are able to live off the cash flows and
"capital gains" generated by such investments. The great majority of
people depend on wages to meet ongoing expenses and save far too little
to sustain a similar lifestyle during their retirement years. A growing
percentage of people will not be able to retire because of their
financial circumstances.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, households who are renters tend to have
the lowest net worth - even when they have incomes comparable to others
who are home owners. In the United States, far more people categorized
as members of a "minority group" are renters than the population of
citizens of European heritage. Conventional wisdom is that prejudice
and discrimination are the primary reasons why this situation exists.
While a continuing factor, a more important fact is that people who
have arrived in the United States with little or no financial resources
or marketable skills are trying to compete in a dysfunctional market
that (as Henry George observed) has a wedge driven between those
already in the game and those trying to get onto the playing field.
Although Americans of African heritage have lived here for generations,
institutional and cultural discrimination has imposed enormous
obstacles in their path as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">For a very long
time, many neighborhoods in the nation's large cities experienced rapid
conversions from being primarily owner-occupied to absentee ownership.</span>
The process began in the 1950s in conjunction with the construction of
our highway system, the movement of large employers to suburban
locations, and the conversion of farmland and open space into housing
subdivisions. Older homes in the cities began to suffer from deferred
maintenance, rapid turnover of ownership from one absentee owner to
another in pursuit of tax sheltered investments and the greatly reduced
purchasing power of lower income minorities concentrated in these older
neighborhoods. The long battle against urban blight resulted.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning in the late 1970s, many neighborhoods
characterized by unique or historic housing began to attract young,
"urban pioneers" who found suburban living not to their liking.
Gradually, higher income households returned to these city
neighborhoods. They were able to invest (or borrow) the large sums
required to renovate and return to single-family use properties that a
half century or more ago were acquired by absentee owners and divided
into numerous apartments. Lower income working families - first those
who were renters - were forced to relocate from these neighborhoods. An
increasing number of the poor have become even more marginalized. If
they are very fortunate, they are able to purchase new housing the
construction of which is heavily subsidized by government and
foundation grants. If they are less fortunate, they compete with other
marginalized families for access to available subsidized rental housing
or market rate rental housing. As the housing and community investment
professional views the situation, the appropriate public policy
response is to make home ownership a viable option for all but the
lowest income households.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most important lessons the planning
establishment has learned is that large-scale, high-density, high-rise
publicly-owned housing creates more problems than it solves. Decent,
affordable housing is an essential component of any initiative to help
people "pull themselves up out of poverty," but is only one of many.
The objective must be to create and strengthen the idea of community as
a place where people can live, work and play in relative safety and
with access to public and private amenities.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After many decades of disinterest on the part of the
nation's financial institutions (resulting in few investments), there
is a resurgence of new construction of housing and other types of
development in neighborhoods previously written off as unworthy of
investment. Much of this activity has come about because of
public/private/philanthropic partnerships and a remarkable process of
community-based organization. Despite these efforts, however, the
number of housing units lost to physical deterioration and abandonment
is far greater than the number being renovated or constructed. The
combined efforts of all the players, of all the subsidies, of all the
grant programs, of all the "sweat equity" initiatives, falls far short
of the need.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of households living in homes they own
(even though their equity in the home and underlying lot might be
minimal) is higher than ever before in the history of the United
States. Some 68 percent of U.S. households are in the game, are the
recipients of the wealth-building subsidies attached to the private
appropriation of location rent. Yet, the number of people who are
homeless and the number of people who have few or no options but to
live in squalor is also higher than ever before.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As <a href="http://www.progress.org/cg/gsrecent.htm">GroundSwell</a>
readers well know, <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is only one
way to move from programs of mitigation to a program of permanent
solution: communities must collect the values created by expenditures
for public goods and services and by aggregate private investment. This
is a message that needs to be communicated to the proponents of
programs and initiatives that seek to lift people into the rent-seeking
class rather than focusing on changing the rules of the game.</span><br
