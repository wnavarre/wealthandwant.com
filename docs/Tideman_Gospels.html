<center><b>The Political Economy of the Gospels</b>
<p>T. Nicolaus Tideman*</p>
</center>
<p>The message of the Gospels is that our sins are forgivable, that
death is not to be feared because our true lives are spiritual rather
than physical, and that participation in the kingdom of God -- a new
and better life in this world as well as the next -- is accessible to
all who orient themselves to God.</p>
<p>Drawing on the Old Testament, Jesus taught that our first
commandment is that we love God with all our heart, and all our soul,
and all our mind, and all our strength, and that our second
commandment is that we love our neighbor as
ourselves.<font size="-1"><b><i>1</i></b></font> When asked who our
neighbor is, he replied with the parable of the good Samaritan,
implying that anyone we encounter is our neighbor.
<font size="-1"><b><i>2</i></b></font> Jesus taught an ethic in which
there are no bounds on our obligations to others:
<font size="-1"><b><i>3</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Love your enemies,<br>
do good to them which hate you<br>
Bless them that curse you 
and pray for them<br>
which despitefully use you.<br>
And unto him
that smiteth thee on the one cheek<br>
offer also the other;<br>
and him that taketh away thy cloke
forbid not to take thy coat also.<br>
Give to every man that asketh of thee;<br>
and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked by Peter, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" Jesus replied, "I say not
unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."
<font size="-1"><b><i>4</i></b></font> In other words, we are to
forgive indefinitely.</p>
<p>This unbounded obligation to others is reconciled with the need to
survive through the introduction of the idea that it is not through
our own anxious efforts, but through God's provision for us that we
survive:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Therefore I say unto you,<br>
Take no thought for your life,
what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;<br>
nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on.<br>
Is not the life more than meat,
and the body than raiment?<br>
Behold the fowls of the air:<br>
for they sow not, neither do they reap,
nor gather into barns;<br>
yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.<br>
Are ye not much better than they?<br>
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?<br>
And why take ye thought for raiment?<br>
Consider the lilies of the field,
how they grow;<br>
they toil not, neither do they spin:<br>
And yet I say unto you,<br>
That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.<br>
Wherefore,
if God so clothe the grass of the field,<br>
which to day is,
and to morrow is cast into the oven,<br>
shall he not much more clothe you,<br>
O ye of little faith?<br>
Therefore take no thought,
saying,<br>
What shall we eat?<br>
or, What shall we drink?<br>
or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?<br>
...<br>
But seek ye first
the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;<br>
and all these things
shall be added unto you.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The message of the Gospels denies the validity of concern for
material scarcity. This is made particularly clear in the accounts of
the feeding of the multitudes with just a few loaves and
fishes.<font size="-1"><b><i>5</i></b></font></p>
<p>comprehending this counterintuitive idea, that material scarcity
is not to concern us, is brought out by the accounts of how even
Jesus' disciples did not understand the message:
<font size="-1"><b><i>6</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread,<br>
neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.<br>
And he charged them, saying,<br>
Take heed, beware<br>
of the leaven of the Pharisees,<br>
and of the leaven of Herod.<br>
And they reasoned among themselves, saying,<br>
It is because we have no bread.<br>
And Jesus knew it,
he saith unto them,<br>
Why reason ye, because ye have no bread?<br>
perceive ye not yet, neither understand?<br>
have ye your heart yet hardened?<br>
Having eyes, see ye not?<br>
and having ears, hear ye not?<br>
and do ye not remember?<br>
When I brake the five loaves 
among five thousand,<br>
how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?<br>
They say unto him, <br>
Twelve.<br>
And when the seven among four thousand,<br>
how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?<br>
And they said,<br>
Seven.<br>
And he said unto them,<br>
How is it that ye do not understand?</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Without a concept of material scarcity it is difficult to
construct an economic theory, as material scarcity is central to
economic theory. And yet, even without a concept of material scarcity
there is an allocation problem to be solved &#8212; the allocation of our
efforts.</p>
<p>In the parable of the talents we are told that we will be expected
to accomplish something with the resources that are put into our
hands. <font size="-1"><b><i>8</i></b></font> This parable is
followed in Matthew by a teaching that may be taken as an indication
of what constitutes accomplishment:
<font size="-1"><b><i>9</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand,<br>
Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you<br>
from the foundation of the world:<br>
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat:<br>
I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink:<br>
I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<br>
Naked, and ye clothed me:<br>
I was sick, and ye visited me:<br>
I was in prison, and ye came unto me.<br>
Then shall the righteous answer him,
saying,<br>
Lord, when saw we thee
an hungred, and fed thee?<br>
or thirsty, and gave thee drink?<br>
When saw we thee
a stranger, and took thee in?<br>
or naked, and clothed thee?<br>
Or when saw we thee
sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?<br>
And the King shall answer
and say unto them,<br>
Verily I say unto you,<br>
Inasmuch as ye have done it
unto one of the least of these my brethren,<br>
ye have done it unto me.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, every person is a manifestation of God, and
anything that we can do to help anyone is to our credit.</p>
<p>There is thus an unlimited task for each of us. No one of us will
ever be able to say, "I have done every last thing that might be
required of me. I have no further obligations." But neither are we to
be concerned that that which we have left undone might be held
against us. For if we refrain from judging others, we ourselves will
not be judged: <font size="-1"><b><i>10</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Judge not,
and ye shall not be judged:<br>
condemn not,
and ye shall not be condemned:<br>
forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:<br>
...<br>
Can the blind lead the blind?<br>
shall they not both fall into the ditch?<br>
...<br>
And why beholdest thou the mote
that is in thy brother's eye,<br>
but perceivest not the beam
that is in thine own eye?<br>
Either how canst thou say to thy brother,<br>
Brother, let me pull out the mote
that is in thine eye,<br>
when thou thyself
beholdest not the beam<br>
that is in thine own eye?</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We are called to a different form of leadership:
<font size="-1"><b><i>11</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Ye know
that they which are accounted
to rule over the Gentiles<br>
exercise lordship over them;<br>
and their great ones
exercise authority upon them.<br>
But so shall it not be among you:<br>
but whosoever will be great among you,
shall be your minister:<br>
And whosoever of you will be the chiefest,
shall be servant of all.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus reinforced this message during the last supper, when he took
on the dress of a slave and performed a slave's duties:
<font size="-1"><b><i>12</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>He riseth from supper,
and laid aside his garments;<br>
and took a towel and girded himself.<br>
After that
he poureth water into a basin,<br>
and began to wash the disciples' feet,
and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.<br>
...<br>
So after he had washed their feet,
and had taken his garments,<br>
and was set down again,
he said unto them,<br>
Know ye what I have done to you?<br>
Ye call me
Master and Lord:<br>
and ye say well;<br>
for so I am.<br>
If I then, your Lord and Master,
have washed your feet;<br>
ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, leadership consists of serving.</p>
<p>With this message of the Gospels in mind, turn now to the problem
of political economy, the problem of what principles ought to govern
the organization of the production of goods and their
distribution.</p>
<p>One might first ask whether the requirement that we abandon
concern for scarcity would preclude production. The answer is no, it
is not production that we are cautioned to avoid, but anxiety. There
are any number of reasons why we might allocate some of our time to
production, without being anxious about our own material
requirements. We feel called to undertake a particular kind of work,
so we do it, trusting that any material needs we may have will be
satisfied. If we want to undertake our productive activities in
conjunction with others, that's fine, too. Associating with others
provides us with opportunities to be useful to them.</p>
<p>Among those who are close to us there is no need for prices and
markets, because we can see easily enough how we can be of service to
them. But human discernment is limited, and prices and markets help
us to be aware of what is valued by people who are less close to
us.</p>
<p>This begins to sound like a standard, invisible-hand defense of
free markets. There is one important difference, however. The
standard account of free markets starts with a specification of the
endowments of individuals, behind which is a presumption of a police
system that will use whatever coercion is necessary to ensure that
the specified endowments are respected. Since individuals are
presumed to be basically selfish in the standard account of the
benefits of free markets, it is unimaginable, in this framework, that
any claims would be respected without the power of the police to
enforce them. In a political economy based on the Gospels on the
other hand, it is by the combination of the basic decency of people
and the providence of God that the rightful claims of individuals are
honored. There is no need, and there is no acceptable basis, for
applying coercion to enforce claims. The utter inconsistency of the
message of the Gospels with reliance on force is developed powerfully
by John Howard Yoder in "<span style="font-style: italic;">The Politics
of
Jesus</span>,"<font size="-1"><b><i>13</i></b></font> and again by
Stanley
Hauerwas in "<span style="font-style: italic;">The Peaceable Kingdom</span>."<font
 size="-1"><b><i>14
</i></b></font></p>
<p>With coercive enforcement absent, the public sector is necessarily
somewhat different in a political economy based on the Gospels. When
his opponents tried to trap Jesus by asking him whether it was lawful
for them to pay taxes to Caesar, he said that they should "Render ...
unto Caesar the things which are
Caesar's."<font size="-1"><b><i>15</i></b></font> Governments
undertake many activities that benefit us, and for this we should be
grateful and willingly pay our assigned shares of the costs. Even if
we do not benefit, the Gospels teach that we should give to whoever
asks, so of course we pay our taxes. But this should not be taken as
an endorsement of the coercive collection of taxes. To the extent
that we help to shape the institution of our political economies, the
message of the Gospels calls upon us to declare that it is not on our
behalf and with our approval that the tax collectors imprison those
who refuse to pay. We are called to rely upon the kind of mechanism
for financing public goods that is employed by churches and the
United Nations: voluntary contributions.</p>
<p>It must be through voluntary contributions as well that provision
is made for those who might otherwise lack. When we love our
neighbors as ourselves, we will want them and their children to have
the opportunities that we and our children have. We will want to
maintain our heritage from nature so that every generation can have
the opportunities that we have.</p>
<p>But we also need to refrain from judging others. With respect to
political economy this means most obviously that anyone who wishes
must have the opportunity to leave our political economy and join
another or found a new one. And for this we must love them no less.
If we are to love as ourselves those neighbors of ours who do not
wish to be part of our political economy, we must ensure that the
claim that we make of the providence of nature, the flow of land
value and natural resources that we claim for our political economy,
is no more per capita than is available to those who are not part of
our political economy.</p>
<p>Refraining from the use of force is a recurring theme in the
political economy of the Gospels. We are called to refrain from the
use of force in defense of property. We are called to refrain from
the use of force in financing public activities. We are called to
refrain from the use of force in providing for those who might
otherwise lack. And we show our love for those who do not wish to
participate in our political economy by leaving for them the same per
capita value of land and natural resources that we claim for
ourselves.</p>
<p>Consider now how this framework bears on some traditional
questions of economic ethics. Take first the problem of the just
price. This simply is not an issue. If two people have the
opportunity to trade--to cooperate--on terms that are mutually
agreeable to the two of them, it is not for us to say that they ought
to be trading on other terms. Between people who love one another,
the problem of settling on the terms of trade is no more difficult
than the problem when friends eat lunch together of deciding who will
pick up the tab, or how it will be split.</p>
<p>That those outside a relationship are not called upon to prescribe
its terms is supported by a passage from
Luke:<font size="-1"><b><i>16</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>And one of the company said unto him,<br>
Master,
speak to my brother,
that he divide the inheritance with me.<br>
And he said unto him,<br>
Man,
who made me a judge or a divider over you?<br>
And he said unto them,<br>
Take heed, and beware of covetousness:<br>
for a man's life consisteth not
in the abundance of the things
which he possesseth.</blockquote>
<p>Relations between employers and employees are a special case of
relations between traders. The Gospels call for this relationship, as
all relationships, to be founded on confidence and love. The
relationship cannot be healthy if either party looks upon the other
as someone to exploit. Neither should feelings of being exploited be
allowed to endure. If we feel exploited and we feel that the
relationship cannot be healed, then we should find something else to
do, secure in the knowledge that God does not abandon anyone to a
life of exploitation.</p>
<p>The problem of worker management is not a problem either. If an
employer finds that his employees want to participate in the
management of the enterprise, he can express his confidence in them
and his love for them by opening the management process to them. If
employees want to manage they should trust that it will be possible
for them to do so, somewhere, if not in the firms where they
presently work. If some employers or some employees want to have
nothing to do with worker management, they should trust that they
will be brought together with their counterparts in firms where the
functions are separated.</p>
<p>Corporate responsibility may be more of an issue for a
Gospel-based political economy. The corporate form of organization
permits us to participate in the establishment and management of
firms while knowing very little about the other people with whom we
are involved or the actions that are taken on our behalf. If this
leads us to support implicitly actions of managers in their concern
for the bottom line that we could not in good conscience take
ourselves, then there is something troubling about our participation
in corporations. We need to find ways of managing the resources under
our control that do not lead us to endorse implicitly and to profit
from actions that we would not endorse directly or take ourselves.
</p>
<p>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of whether
capitalism or socialism is the more appropriate form of political
economy, is another non-question from the perspective of the Gospels.
Everyone who wants to live under socialism should be free to live
under socialism, and everyone who wants to live under capitalism
should be free to live under capitalism. In whichever group we fall,
we will want to insure that those who want to organize their lives by
different principles of political economy have their share of land
and natural resources with which to do so.</p>
<p>A political economy based on the Gospels is a political economy
based on love. As the First Epistle of John says, "There is no fear
in love; but perfect love casteth out
fear."<font size="-1"><b><i>17</i></b></font> To construct a
political economy of the Gospels we must be free of fear: free of
fear that others may rob us; free of fear that others may not
contribute to the provision of public goods or to provision for those
who might otherwise lack; free of fear that our incomes will be too
low or the prices we face too high; free of fear that if we don't do
something, someone will be exploited. Only when love has replaced all
fear in our hearts will we be able to construct the political economy
of the Gospels.</p>
