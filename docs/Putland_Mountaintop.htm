<p align="center"><strong>Still on the mountaintop: Economically rational racism</strong></p>
<p align="center">By Gavin R. Putland | April 3, 2008</p>
<p>Forty years ago, as Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke of the Promised Land and
  prophesied &quot;<em>I may not get there with you</em>,&quot; a quiet revolution in
  economic theory was beginning, which would ensure that Dr. King's hearers,
  except perhaps the occasional Caleb or Joshua, wouldn't get there either. The
  architects of the revolution didn't plan it that way, but that's the way it
  turned out.</p>
<p>The revolution concerned the relationship between unemployment and inflation.
  A paper by Milton Friedman, published in the month before Dr. King spoke, and
  another by Edmund Phelps, published a few months later, gave reason to believe
  that in the long term, if unemployment falls below a certain rate, inflation
  speeds up, whereas if unemployment rises above that rate, inflation slows down.
  That magic unemployment number became known as the <strong>Non-Accelerating-Inflation
  Rate of Unemployment</strong>, usually abbreviated by the acronym <strong>NAIRU</strong>.</p>
<p>By about 1980, during the term of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, it
  was accepted that the aim of interest-rate policy was to create enough unemployment
  to exert enough downward pressure on wages to give stable (and low) inflation.
  That didn't mean that central bankers always aimed at a particular unemployment
  rate &#8212; the NAIRU &#8212; because they didn't always know what the magic
  rate was. But it did mean that the Fed concentrated on inflation and accepted
  whatever the unemployment outcome might be. And it did mean that the Fed would
  sometimes cite falling unemployment as a sign of rising inflationary pressure,
  which supposedly had to be checked by raising interest rates.</p>
<p>While central banks determined interest rates, governments still had a role
  in setting other policies so as to minimize the NAIRU. But eventually that
  role was limited to making life for the unemployed as unpleasant as possible,
  in order to maximize wage restraint for any given unemployment rate, and defining
  an unemployed person as narrowly as possible, so that official statistics understated
  the extent of unemployment. (Attacking workers' wages and conditions is also
  widely advocated, but harder to do in a democracy. That's one reason why some
  people prefer dictatorship.)</p>
<p>The NAIRU was more commonly called the <strong>natural rate of unemployment</strong>. Well,
  of course it's &quot;natural&quot; to define a problem out of existence when
  you have no intention of solving it. More recently, politicians and central
  bankers have started referring to the natural rate as <strong>full employment</strong>. Yes,
  folks: in Newspeak, &quot;full employment&quot; means enough unemployment to
  cause enough wage restraint to give stable inflation.</p>
<p>So we're living in a system of enforced failure. A percentage of people have
  to be unemployed, and therefore, at the boundaries of unemployment, another
  percentage of people have to be underemployed or intermittently employed or
  precariously employed. In other words, <strong>the economy is being run in
  such a way that a certain percentage of people have to be losers.</strong> And people know this
  is true, even if they don't know why. More than half the population are too
  young to remember a time of genuine full employment, and those who remember
  know that unemployment has been a continuous problem since the early '70s.</p>
<p>If a certain percentage of the population must be losers, two conclusions
  follow. </p>
<ul>
  <li>First, <strong>any attempt to equalize opportunity is a zero-sum game</strong>, in which
        no one can be rescued from the pool of losers except by throwing someone
      else in. </li>
  <li>Second, and here's the rub: <strong>if a certain racial or religious minority
        is
          large enough to contain all or most of the losers, the majority stands
    to gain by discriminating against that minority</strong>, because if the pool of losers
        contains
          more members of the minority, it will contain fewer members of the
    majority,
          so that persons born into the majority face a lower risk of being among
    the losers. Such discrimination, although immoral, is economically rational.
        So members of the majority will discriminate, encourage their peers to
    discriminate,
          and vote for politicians who make it easy to discriminate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every minority is a suitable target for economically rational discrimination.
  If a minority is very small, it can absorb only a small fraction of the losers,
  and in so doing will not greatly reduce the risk that a person born into the
  majority will be among the losers. That's why, from the majority's point of
  view, a minority needs to be at least a certain size before it's worth discriminating
  against. But there are other caveats. If a certain minority consists of recent
  immigrants and their descendants, they're the products of a favorable selection
  process. Immigrants come with big plans, on which they've already taken big
  actions. Immigrants are guaranteed to have some &quot;get up and go&quot;,
  because they actually got up and went. Their children and grandchildren inherit
  some of these advantages, if not genetically then at least by example. In America,
  that's part of the Asian story and, to some extent, the Hispanic story. Employers
  know this. More obviously, if a certain minority has a very strong religious
  or cultural commitment to education, and especially if it can supply the teachers
  from among its own ranks, its members will be attractive to employers, and
  will be hired whether the majority of workers like it or not. In America that's
  the Jewish story and the Catholic story, and perhaps another part of the Asian
  story.</p>
<p>But none of these stories is the Black American story. The Black American
  minority is large enough to supply as many losers as the economy might need.
  The first Black Americans were immigrants, but only because they were brought
  in against their will, and any &quot;get up and go&quot; that they had was
  ruthlessly suppressed. To get ahead in their new country, they needed a Western
  education to which they were denied access, and which they couldn't supply
  for themselves. And what they didn't have, they could hardly bequeath to future
  generations. Therefore, <strong>as unemployment became a permanent feature
  of the economic landscape, Black Americans became the perfect targets for economically
  rational
  discrimination</strong>, which helped to keep them in the wilderness for another 40
  years.</p>
<p>What then is to be done?</p>
<p>Clearly it's no use asking the majority not to engage in economically rational
  discrimination, because the majority rules, and because, in a zero-sum game,
  the majority can't help another group without harming itself.</p>
<p><strong>But what if this accursed &quot;natural rate&quot; of unemployment were somehow
  drastically reduced, without attacking wages and working conditions?</strong> As the
  unemployment rate fell, all ethnic and religious groups could share the benefit.
  That part of the game would not be zero-sum. And when the unemployment rate
  stabilized at the new low level, there would be so few losers, and members
  of the majority would face such a low risk of being among the losers, that
  offloading the risk onto some minority group would no longer be worth the trouble.
  <strong>The effort that is now spent on discrimination would then pay a bigger
  dividend if spent on self-improvement. </strong>Discrimination would no longer be economically
  rational.</p>
<p>So the key to the Promised Land is to reduce the natural rate of unemployment
  without creating a new class of working losers. To see how to do that, we must
  revisit some basic economic principles.</p>
<p>For a century and a half, capitalists and socialists argued about ownership
  of <strong>the means of production</strong> as if the assets that make up the &quot;means of
  production&quot; were all of the same kind. But they're not; they fall into
  two distinct categories. </p>
<ul>
  <li>In one category are the assets can be produced by
        private, competitive effort. For convenience I'll call these <strong>house-like
        assets</strong>,
        although they include not only houses but also other buildings, as well as
        movable plant and equipment. </li>
  <li>In the other category are those assets that
        cannot be produced by human effort, or at least cannot be produced by
    private, competitive
          effort. For convenience I'll call them <strong>land-like assets</strong>, although they
    include not only land but also other natural resources, building rights attached
        to land, and monopolies and privileges of all kinds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The returns on <em><strong>house-like</strong></em> assets include </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>interest</strong>, which is the price of time-preference,        </li>
  <li><strong>insurance</strong>, which is the reward for bearing (quantifiable) risk, and </li>
  <li><strong>economic
            profit</strong>, which is the reward for bearing (unquantifiable) uncertainty.      </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>Those returns are an incentive to produce house-like assets. Any tax
    on those returns,
                or on the assets themselves, reduces the incentive. </strong>Conservatives
        repeat this argument <em>ad nauseam</em> but never acknowledge that it's
        valid only for house-like assets.</p>
<p>The net returns on <em>land-like</em> assets are usually called <strong>economic
    rent</strong>. Some
  people prefer to call them <strong>usury</strong>. But whatever you call them, they can't be
  an incentive to produce anything, because no private person or corporation
  can produce land-like assets, while the rental values of those assets are produced
  not by the owners, but by the demand from prospective users. It follows that
  any fraction of the rental value of a land-like asset can be diverted into
  the public treasury without discouraging any productive activity, and therefore
  without raising prices. In other words, <strong>taxes on the values of land-like
  assets are not inflationary</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>But instead of taxing values of land-like assets, governments &#8212; including
  conservative governments &#8212; impose punitive taxes on everything that they
  pretend to encourage</strong>, such as work, employment, consumption (which creates
  demand), saving (which allows investment), and of course investment in house-like
  assets. Some of these taxes directly impede production. Some of them directly
  increase the cost of hiring a worker at a given standard of living. But one
  way or the other, <strong>all such taxes feed inflation</strong>. Because of this additional
  upward pressure on inflation, it takes more unemployment to supply the compensating
  downward pressure; in other words,<strong> inflationary taxes raise the natural
  rate of unemployment</strong>.</p>
<p>So the key to reducing the natural rate of unemployment &#8212; the key to
  the Promised Land &#8212; is to reduce or eliminate income tax, payroll tax,
  sales tax, property taxes on values of buildings, and death taxes on house-like
  assets, and to replace the revenue, as far as that's necessary, with taxes
  on values of land-like assets. Those taxes can take the form of capital gains
  taxes, or property taxes on land values only (not including values of buildings),
  or holding taxes of so many tenths of a percent per year on values of other
  land-like assets. These <strong>land-value taxes</strong> and other holding taxes can have <strong>tax-free
  thresholds</strong>, so that only the portion of the value above the threshold is taxable.
  For taxpayers who are asset-rich but income-poor, the holding taxes can be
  deferred until the assets are sold or bequeathed, in which case the taxes may
  superficially resemble estate taxes on<em> land-like assets</em> only. It's even possible
  to set the thresholds on a case-by-case basis so that individual taxpayers
  are no worse off under the new system than under the old.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the question of political feasibility: Does the Promised
  Land have to come at the expense of the landowners? Paradoxically, the answer
  is &quot;<em>No</em>,&quot; and not only because the increase in taxes on land-like
  assets would be offset by reductions in other taxes. Paradoxically, landowners
  as a class actually stand to gain by shifting the present tax burden off desirable
  activities and onto land values. To see why, we must revisit another old piece
  of economic theory.</p>
<p>The overall supply of land is fixed. From the viewpoint of the taxpayer, the
  supply of land legally usable for any particular purpose is also fixed, as
  is the supply of land within acceptable distance of any particular services,
  infrastructure, or markets. Yet access to suitably located land is essential
  to life and livelihood. Therefore <strong>land rents and land prices are bid
  upward until they absorb the economy's capacity to pay</strong>. All taxes are deductions from
  the capacity to pay for land. <strong>If a tax is only a deduction from that
  capacity, it will take as much from landowners as it delivers to the Treasury.
  But most
  taxes do more than that</strong>; most taxes (more precisely, all taxes except those
  on values of land-like assets) target productive transactions, causing otherwise
  viable transactions and enterprises to become unviable, thus reducing the capacity
  to pay for land even before the tax is taken out. This is called the <strong>deadweight</strong>  effect. So under most taxes, the returns on land-like assets fall by more than
  the tax paid: the landowners are overcharged! But <strong>direct taxation of
  land values avoids the overcharge</strong> because there's no deadweight: the tax doesn't deter
  any productive transactions. Even if someone sells land to avoid the tax, the
  incentive to use the land is not reduced, but is merely transferred to the
  buyer.</p>
<p>The same logic applies even to landowners who are about to sell. Anticipated
  liability for land-value tax reduces buyers' capacity to pay and therefore
  reduces sale prices. But so does anticipated liability for any other tax &#8212; with
  the usual overcharge.</p>
<p><strong>So, while land-value taxation takes only as much from landowners as it delivers
  to the Treasury, almost every other tax takes more from landowners than it
  delivers to the Treasury. Therefore, under land-value taxation, landowners
  as a class would be better off.</strong></p>
<p>Does that mean everybody else would be worse off? No, because <strong>the
    landowners' gain would be funded by overall economic growth, not by anyone
    else's loss</strong>.
  Furthermore, not all of the benefit of that growth would go to landowners.
  (In other words, not all of the deadweight of existing taxes is converted into
  an overcharge on landowners.) A holding tax on land induces the landowner to
  cover the tax liability by attracting rent-paying tenants, or avoid the tax
  by selling the land. Thus it strengthens the bargaining positions of renters
  and prospective buyers. A capital gains tax on land increases the attractiveness
  of rental income relative to capital gains, giving more bargaining power to
  renters, and discourages speculative hoarding of land, giving more bargaining
  power to prospective buyers. In short, both kinds of tax ensure that <strong>non-landowners
  get a slice of the growth</strong>.</p>
<p>By the way, the idea that all taxes fall on landowners is indeed very old.
  In 1691, one of the great philosophers of freedom wrote, in part: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>It
        is in vain in a country whose great fund is land to hope to lay the publick
        charge of the Government on anything else; there at last it will terminate.
        The merchant (do what you can) will not bear it, the labourer cannot, and therefore
        the landholder must: and whether he were best to do it by laying it directly
        where it will at last settle, or by letting it come to him by the sinking of
        his rents,... let him consider.</em></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>That was John Locke. And in 1787, one
          of America's founding fathers wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our Legislators are all Landholders;
            and they are not yet persuaded that all Taxes are finally paid by the Land...</em></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>That
              was Benjamin Franklin, writing to Alexander Small eleven days after
              the signing of the Constitution.</p>
<p>So far, in explaining the advantages of moving the tax burden onto land values,
  I've only considered what happens when the taxes are collected &#8212; not
  what happens when they're spent. A core spending responsibility is infrastructure,
  including <strong>network infrastructure</strong> such as transport, waste disposal, water,
  sewerage, and drainage, and <strong>community infrastructure</strong> such a schools, libraries,
  and emergency services.</p>
<p><strong>The benefit of an infrastructure project (net of user charges such
    as fares and tolls) is location-specific, and therefore is reflected as an
    uplift in
  land values in the serviced locations</strong> &#8212; not an uplift in <em>building</em> values,
  because the value of a building is limited by construction costs, but an uplift
  in <em>land</em> values, because land has location, and therefore locational value,
  even if no buildings yet stand on it.</p>
<p><strong>So, if the tax system claws back X% of every uplift in land value,
    any public infrastructure project with a cost/benefit ratio of X% is self-funding,
    and
  any public infrastructure project with a lower cost/benefit ratio is better
  than self-funding, yielding a revenue surplus that can be used for other purposes.
  If you wish, those other purposes can include tax cuts. That should please
  conservatives. </strong>Moreover, the untaxed portion of the uplift &#8212; the other
  (100-X)% &#8212; is a net windfall for the landowners, who therefore should
  enthusiastically support the tax because it would finance projects that would
  not otherwise proceed, yielding windfalls that the owners would not otherwise
  get. That should please conservatives even more.</p>
<p>Financing infrastructure out of income tax, sales tax, property taxes on buildings,
  or death taxes on house-like assets, is socialism for landowners &#8212; <strong>welfare
  for landowners</strong>. Financing infrastructure out of uplifts in land values is <strong>self-help
  for landowners</strong>. Which is more conservative?</p>
<p>I should note, for the sake of precision, that costs and benefits may have
  capitalized and annualized components, while uplifts in land values may be
  expressed in terms of (capitalized) sale prices or (annualized) rents. So for
  the purpose of the foregoing argument, all terms must be converted to the same
  basis: either capitalized or annualized. I should also note that an annual
  tax on the capitalized value of land, with or without a threshold, automatically
  takes less than 100% of the benefit of an infrastructure project, leaving a
  net windfall for the landowner, because your tax bill doesn't go up unless
  your land value does, and your land value doesn't go up unless, in the judgment
  of the market, you are better off in spite of the tax implication. And conservatives
  respect the judgment of the market, don't they?</p>
<p>Better infrastructure, especially better public education, has been a touchstone
  of progressive politics. Unfortunately it's also been a point of vulnerability,
  because it invites the question &quot;<strong><em>Where's the money going to come
  from?</em></strong>&quot; which
  conservatives have answered by accusing progressives of being <strong>taxaholics</strong>. But
  financing infrastructure out of uplifts in land values does not mean raising
  taxes in order to pay for infrastructure. It means redesigning the tax system
  so that future expenditure on infrastructure automatically pays for itself
  by expanding the tax base without any increase in tax <em>rates</em>. In other words,
  it means financing infrastructure out of the <strong>growth dividend</strong> &#8212; not the
  mythical growth dividend that supposedly comes from cutting taxes on the rich,
  although the tax cuts aren't conditional on the growth or on any behavior that
  contributes to it, but the real growth dividend that follows when the revenue
  of a government is conditional on spending decisions that add value to land.
  Mark my words: <strong>Progressives will never shake off the &quot;taxaholic&quot; label
  until they move some of the present tax burden off productive activities and
  onto land values</strong>, so that a subsequent increase in infrastructure investment
  doesn't require an increase in tax rates.</p>
<p>Now what about those crumbling <strong>public schools</strong> left over from the segregation
  era? Empirical studies have found that a satisfactory public school adds value
  to land within walking distance of the school, while a highly desirable public
  school adds value to land within its entire catchment area. (The effect of
  a merely &quot;satisfactory&quot; public school on land values within driving
  distance, as opposed to walking distance, would be hard to determine empirically
  because the presence of the school would be correlated with numerous other
  influences.) So a public school, like any other piece of infrastructure, raises
  land values in the serviced area. This implies that <strong>so-called &quot;free&quot; schools
  aren't free at all; the admission charge is hidden in prices and rents of land</strong>  in locations serviced by the schools, and is payable to the incumbent landowners.
  The argument that property taxes shouldn't pay for schools, because schools
  aren't services to property, is baloney; <strong>public schools are services
  to property because they add value to property</strong>, and the property owners get the benefit
  whether they send their kids to those schools or not.</p>
<p>So land-value taxation is good for landowners, as well as the rest of us,
  because it induces investment in infrastructure that adds value to land, and
  because landowners don't pay back any part of their windfall unless and until
  they actually get it. Logically, landowners ought to support this policy. But
  I know from experience that logic isn't their strong suit. Some of them reject
  the argument not because they find any fault with it, but because they simply
  refuse to engage with it &#8212; they just don't want to know. Others point
  to infrastructure projects that allegedly didn't raise land values. Well, if
  a project didn't raise land values by at least the cost of the project, it
  failed the cost-benefit test and therefore shouldn't have gone ahead. If a
  funding method isn't capable of funding projects that shouldn't go ahead, that's
  not an argument against the method; that's an argument in its favor.</p>
<p>How then shall we overcome the non-thinkers and the land-windfall deniers?
  Dr. King gave an unintentional hint when he encouraged the Black community
  in Memphis to impose what amounted to human-rights-related trade sanctions.
  These involved not only boycotts of businesses that mistreated Blacks, but
  also what he called a &quot;<em>bank-in</em>&quot; (keeping your money in Black financial
  institutions) and an &quot;<em>insurance-in</em>&quot; (dealing with Black insurance
  companies). That was then. Perhaps what we need now is a sort of &quot;<em>infrastructure-in</em>&quot;.
  Although Black Americans are a minority in the country as a whole, there are
  many cities and counties with Black majorities, including Detroit, New Orleans,
  Baltimore, Atlanta, Washington DC, and of course Memphis. So, if we can't have
  land-value taxation in all American cities and counties because it's good for
  all Americans, then maybe we can have it in Black American cities and counties
  because it's good for Black Americans. Of course I shouldn't have to say that.
  But if the only way to get some action on infrastructure is to turn it into
  a Black Pride issue, let's turn it into a Black Pride issue, because action
  is needed. Then the other cities and counties can try to catch up.</p>
<p>If America is sliding into <strong>recession</strong>, as seems to be the case, then the necessity
  of moving to land-value taxation is amplified by, yes, <strong>&quot;the fierce urgency
  of Now</strong>.&quot; As Dr. King said at the Lincoln Memorial, &quot;<strong><em>This
  is no time ... to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism</em></strong>.&quot; <em>Now
  is the time</em> to
  cut payroll taxes that discourage hiring. <em>Now is the time</em> to cut sales taxes
  that reduce demand. <em>Now is the time</em> to exempt the values of buildings from
  property taxes, so that construction is no longer discouraged. <em>Now is the
  time</em>  to create wealth and jobs by investing in infrastructure. <em><strong>Now
  is the time</strong></em><strong> to
  move the tax burden onto land values so that great infrastructure projects
  can be financed without increasing already alarming budget deficits</strong>. And those
  who hope that the present crisis can be overcome by yet another stimulus package
  or taxpayer-funded bailout &quot;<em>will have a rude awakening if the nation
  returns to business as usual</em>,&quot; because the tax system that gave us this recession
  and the one before and the one before that, if left essentially intact, will
  give us the next recession and the one after and the one after that.</p>
<p><strong>The present recession, like the recessions of the early '90s, early
    '80s, and mid '70s, was preceded by a crash in the land market. </strong>The recession of
  2001 may seem different because it was preceded by crash in the <em>share</em> market.
  But shares are land-like in so far as the underlying assets are land-like.
  Shares are even more land-like <em>in the short term</em> because they can be bought
  and sold much faster than they can be issued. Now the crucial point is this:
  <strong>Markets for land-like assets are susceptible to crashes under the present tax
  system, but would not be if the tax burden were moved onto values of land-like
  assets.</strong></p>
<p>As economic growth adds to the demand for land-like assets while private agents
  can't add to the supply, prices of land-like assets rise in the long term.
  When people see prices rising, they try to buy into the market, thereby reinforcing
  the price rise, inducing more people to buy in, and so on, so that prices become
  decoupled from rents and are supported solely by the circular argument that
  prices will continue to rise. This is a speculative <strong>bubble</strong>. But eventually
  the illusion becomes unsustainable and prices stop rising, taking away the
  alleged justification for current prices, and so on: the bubble &quot;<strong>bursts</strong>&quot;.
  Those who have invested heavily in the collapsed market must reduce their expenditure.
  If they've invested with borrowed money, they may be bankrupt. As one agent's
  expenditure is another's income, and as one agent's debt is another's asset,
  a chain reaction begins. If the initial burst is big enough, the chain reaction
  leads to recession, which is made worse if the reduction in funds available
  for investment causes bursts in other asset markets.</p>
<p>Irresponsible lending inflates the bubble further, causing a bigger burst,
  hence a deeper recession. The recent practice of selling and reselling mortgage
  loans, packaging them into securities and selling them again, and so forth,
  makes it hard to know who is credit-worthy and who isn't, causing a broader
  chain reaction, hence a deeper recession. But these are secondary issues peculiar
  to the current recession. The basic problem, common to all recessions, is that
  <strong>the present tax system encourages speculative bubbles by making capital
  gains more attractive than earned income</strong>. However, a sufficiently heavy tax on values
  of land-like assets can prevent recessions by preventing bubbles. If it's a
  capital gains tax, it directly reduces the speculative motive that inflates
  bubbles. If it's a holding tax, it provides corrective feedback: when prices
  rise, the tax also rises, making the assets less attractive and opposing the
  price rise, whereas when prices fall, the tax also falls, making the assets
  more attractive and opposing the price fall. Thus a holding tax stabilizes
  prices around the long-term trend. That's how to prevent the next recession.</p>
<p><strong>In the Promised Land of the Old Testament, there was no land speculation
    and no possibility of speculative bubbles</strong>, because you couldn't sell land in perpetuity.
  According to the 25th chapter of Leviticus, every 50th year was to be a Jubilee,
  and you could only sell a lease on the land up to the next Jubilee. As the
  time remaining on the lease was always getting shorter, the lease was always
  falling in value, so you couldn't make a capital gain on it. Nowadays, if we
  somehow don't consider ourselves bound by the commandment that &#8220;<strong>The
  land shall not be sold for ever&#8221; (Leviticus 25:23)</strong>, we need another method
  of preventing speculation. <strong>Land-value taxation not only discourages speculation,
  but also reduces inflationary pressure, allowing a reduction in the natural
  rate of unemployment, so that members of the dominant ethnic group face little
  risk of unemployment and have little to gain by trying to offload that risk
  onto some minority.</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, America can retain the present inflationary taxes, and the
  Fed can fight the inflationary pressure by creating unemployment, the burden
  of which will continue to fall disproportionately on Blacks. Meanwhile the
  opportunity to make capital gains on land, together with the lack of pressure
  to earn income from it, will maintain a permanent artificial demand for land,
  exacerbated by periodic speculative bubbles. The artificial demand will inflate
  rents and prices of residential land, which is a necessity of life, and for
  which workers will have to pay out of wages that have been depressed by the
  competition for scarce jobs, eroded by income tax, and devalued by indirect
  taxes. This is the <strong>Ownership Society</strong>, the caricature of the Promised Land offered
  by those who call themselves conservatives.</p>
<p>But let's conclude on a more conciliatory note. In the present recession,
  which has been triggered by a collapse in land prices, land-value taxation
  would reverse the collapse &#8212; not by re-inflating a temporary speculative
  bubble, but by inducing investment in infrastructure that permanently enhances
  the utility of the land. So maybe it takes a recession to induce a conservative
  appreciation of land-value taxation as a substitute for existing taxes. Maybe
  that's one way in which &quot;<em><strong>only when it is dark enough can you see the
  stars</strong></em>.&quot;</p>
