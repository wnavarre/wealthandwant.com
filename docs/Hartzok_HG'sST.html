<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
the History of Thought: Henry George's "Single Tax"<br>
</span>By <a href="../auth/Hartzok.html">Alanna Hartzok</a> <br>
Co-Director, Earth Rights Institute</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, while riding horseback in the Oakland
hills, merchant seaman and journalist Henry George had <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a startling epiphany. He realized that
speculation and private profiteering in the gifts of nature were the
root causes of the unjust distribution of wealth.</span> The insights
presented in <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>,
George's masterwork, launched him to fame. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">His policy
approach was known at that time as the "single tax" &#8212; meaning that
taxation should be shifted off of labor and onto the socially created
surplus value of land and other natural resources.</span> His message
reached as far as the great Russian Leo Tolstoy, who was so taken with
the idea that he frequently referred to George and "Georgism" in his
novel <em>Resurrection</em>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the last 20 years of the 19th century George
built an impressive populist movement bent on solving the problem of
the wealth gap, and he died in 1897 while campaigning to be New York's
mayor. The "Georgists" were determined to free labor and all productive
effort from the burden of taxation. Land and natural resources were
gifts of nature to be fairly shared by all. The role of government
would be to secure democratic rights to the earth for all people via
the collection of resource rents, the surplus value accruing to natural
wealth, which would be distributed in social goods, services or by
direct citizen dividends.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">But just as this
solution to the rich/poor gap was gaining momentum, the Georgist
movement was stopped in its tracks. Wealthy individuals poured their
money into leading schools of economics to encourage the writing of
treatises against George and the movements he had spawned. </span>The
ethical perspective that land is a common heritage and the policy
approach of land value taxation were subsequently eliminated from the
field of economics. The newly dominant theory focused on only two
primary factors &#8212; labor and capital &#8212; with capital having the upper
hand as "employing labor." "Labor," of course, is quite capable of
self-employment given access to land. This is what the elites and the
plutocrats feared most &#8212; that labor would gain full power to directly
produce capital given conditions of equal rights to the resources of
the earth.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the elites' success in mangling the science
of political economy, the Georgist paradigm has had some influence over
the years. The 1887 Wright Act in California enabled bonds raised by
local irrigation districts to be paid from the increase in land values,
resulting in a powerful and beneficial land reform, though this
equitable and successful public finance approach was eventually
undermined by private banking institutions. Now taxpayers nationwide
subsidize the irrigation needs of agribusiness. Alaska's state
constitution vests the ownership of oil and other natural resources in
the people as a whole and the state's Permanent Fund distributes
substantial oil revenue as citizen dividends to state residents. With
no state income or sales taxes, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Alaska
</span>has been the only state where the wealth gap has decreased
during the past decade. This is essentially a Georgist paradigm
approach, and surface land values and electromagnetic spectrum rent
could be similar sources for citizen dividends.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Georgist economics is again making steady
progress. In Pennsylvania, eighteen municipalities, including
Harrisburg and Allentown, have been revitalizing their local economies
via property tax reform which shifts taxes off of homes and the built
environment and onto the value of land sites. Movements for land value
taxation are growing now in Scotland, UK, Ireland, South Korea and
elsewhere, while Venezuela, Russia and other countries are pushing for
greater resource rents from oil and mineral resources. Georgist
economics is increasingly recognized as a key to economic democracy
based on equal rights to the earth for all.<br>
