<p><a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Tideman/global_economic_justice.htm#VII.%20Conclusion"><font
 size="-2"><b></b></font></a>Humanity is emerging from eons of development during which
survival has been promoted both by the ability to grab resources from
others and by the ability of groups to cooperate and share natural
resources within communities that occupied territorial homelands. In
recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that taking from
the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social order that
prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out how to do
it.</p>
<p>Some people think of preventing grabbing in terms of preserving
the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that were
acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status quo
commits us to defending the indefensible.</li>
  <li>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before which
unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and after
which they are reversed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A practice of allowing an appropriation to be treated as just if
it has survived long enough gives aggressors an incentive to see if
they can grab and hold on long enough. The result is actions like
Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Only
if we have a standard of justice that is independent of history can
we expect to end such actions.</p>
<p>Henry George's theory of economic justice--that every person has a
right to his or her productive powers, and that all persons have
equal rights to all natural opportunities--provides a simple formula
around which opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can
coalesce.</p>
<p>This may seem hopelessly optimistic. But no other theory that I
have seen has anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this
theory.</p>
<p><a name="I. The Functions of a Theory o"></a><b> I. The Functions
of a Theory of Justice</b></p>
<p>What is the use of a theory of justice? A theory is an
abstraction. By itself, it can't make anything happen. But when a
theory of justice takes root in us, it modulates our emotional
responses to distributive outcomes. If you should come to realize
that the theory of justice to which you subscribe says that something
you thought you wanted to do is unjust, you will find that course of
action no longer so appealing. If you come to a new realization that
justice is on your side, you are likely to feel emboldened and ready
to persist despite obstructions.</p>
<p>If you should come to the realization that justice requires of you
a course of action that you had not planned on, you will feel a pull
in that direction, and if you do not follow through, you are likely
to feel guilty. If your theory of justice informs you that another
person is treated unjustly, even a stranger, you are likely to feel
compassion for that person, and you may also feel a chivalrous
impulse to take up that person's cause and seek redress of the
injustice. It was because of feelings of injustice that slavery was
abolished and women were granted the right to vote.</p>
<p>As the world shrinks, nations impinge upon one another in more and
more ways, providing applications for a theory of justice among
nations. The fishing that one nation does leaves fewer fish in the
oceans for others. When a river flows from one nation into another,
the removal of water by the upstream nation leaves less water for the
downstream nation. Near the borders of nations, the use of a
frequency by one nation for radio or TV broadcasting precludes its
use by the other. Geo-synchronous parking spaces for communications
satellites are scarce. Air-borne and water-borne pollutants cross
international borders and cause harm. The burning of fossil fuel
produces global warming at rates and with consequences that are not
yet understood. Chlorofluorocarbons emitted in the Northern
Hemisphere enlarge the Antarctic ozone hole and cause skin cancer in
Australia.</p>
<p>In most of these areas, the awareness of our global
interdependence has led to some agreements among nations. But
agreement is not always reached. Negotiations are intricate and
time-consuming. Sometimes key participants refuse to accept what is
agreeable to others. A shared theory of justice among nations would
point the way to agreement and shame those who refused to accept the
result. I will argue that a theory of justice inspired by Henry
George provides a simple and far-reaching framework for specifying
the requirements of justice among nations and within nations.&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<a name="II. Henry George's Principles"></a><b> II. Henry
George's
Principles of Justice</b>
<p>Henry George was one of the most famous reformers of the late 19th
century. Ever since the 1879 publication of his book, <a
 style="font-style: italic;" href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and
Poverty</a>, his ideas have inspired people working for economic and
social reform all around the world. He is most famous for proposing
the abolition of all taxes except for a tax on the value of land. But
I will argue that the single tax on land was not George's most
important contribution, and that the power of his thinking can be
best appreciated by focusing on the theory of social justice that he
used to explain why a single tax on land is just.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of Book VI of <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span>, George
analyzes six different proposed remedies for persistent poverty and
explains why they are inadequate. In the second chapter, which
consists of just three pages, he asserts that the only effective
remedy for the relief of poverty and the unacceptable distribution of
wealth is to "make land common property."</p>
<p>George's choice of words here may have been unnecessarily
inflammatory. When people see this phrase, they generally presume
that George was proposing public ownership of land. In fact he
rejected public ownership of land. What he actually meant was that we
must recognize that land is everyone's common heritage, and we must
develop institutions that reflect this. In any case, he recognized
that his assertion would sound outrageous to many of his readers, and
he promised to defend it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>The laws of the universe are harmonious. And if the
remedy to which we have been led is the true one, it must be consistent
with justice; it must be practical of application; it must accord with
the tendencies of social development and must harmonize with other
reforms.
    <p>All this I propose to show.<font size="-2"><b>1</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, Book VII is concerned with the justice of making land
common property, Book VIII deals with the method and practicality of
making land common property--not by public ownership of land, but by
abolishing other taxes and financing government by public collection
of the rent of land, and Book IX explores economic consequences of
this remedy.</p>
<p>The first chapter of Book VII thus plays the crucial role of
overcoming the reader's inclination toward knee-jerk rejection of
George's startling idea. And George is prepared with a theory of
justice in powerful language:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>What constitutes the rightful basis of property? What is
it that enables a man justly to say of a thing, "It is mine!" From what
springs the sentiment which acknowledges his exclusive right against
all the world? Is it not, primarily, the right of a man to himself, to
the use of his own powers, to the enjoyment of the fruits of his own
exertions? Is it not this individual right, which springs from and is
testified to by the natural facts of individual organization--the fact
that each particular pair of hands obey a particular brain and are
related to a particular stomach; the fact that each man is a definite,
coherent, independent whole--which alone justifies individual
ownership? As a man belongs to himself, so his labor when put in
concrete form belongs to him.<font size="-2"><b>2</b></font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>George then argues that if ownership is derived from labor, then
no one can own land, since no one produced it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes
the possibility of any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully
entitled to the produce of his own labor, then no one can be rightfully
entitled to the ownership of anything which is not the produce of his
labor, or the labor of someone else from whom the right has passed to
him. If production give to the producer the right to exclusive
possession and enjoyment, there can rightfully be no exclusive
possession and enjoyment of anything not the production of labor, and
the recognition of private property in land is a wrong. . . .
    <p>If we are all here by the equal permission of the creator, we
are all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of his bounty--with
an equal right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers.
This is a right which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which
vests in every human being as he enters the world, and which during his
continuance in the world can be limited only by the equal rights of
others. There is in nature no such thing as a fee simple in land. There
is on earth no power which can rightfully make a grant of exclusive
ownership in land. If all existing men were to unite to grant away
their equal rights, they could not grant away the right of those who
follow them.<font size="-2"><b>3</b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarize George's rights-based theory of justice: Each person
has an exclusive right to his or her productive powers. We understand
this intuitively, and on this basis accept the idea that people own
what they produce. But if this is what ownership means, then no one
can claim to own land, since no one produced it. People do have
rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers, which are
here for our use, but the rights of each person are limited by the
equal rights of all other persons.</p>
<p>A careful analyst might object that there are some logical gaps in
George's theory of justice. Logically, a right of ownership of things
based on the right of each person to his or her productive powers
does not preclude a right of ownership of natural opportunities on
some other basis. We could mean by ownership only those rights that
are derived from the right of each person to his or her productive
powers, but we could also mean something broader and more
complex.</p>
<p>The easiest way to repair this gap in George's theory is to
specify that rather than having just one axiom, that each person has
a right to his or her productive powers, he actually has two, the
second one being that all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities.</p>
<p>A second logical gap occurs when George asserts that because
people have rights to their productive powers, they own what they
produce. This would follow only if they also had rights to the
natural opportunities that they appropriate in the process of
production. It is possible that the natural resources component of
what a person produces is more than his share, considering the equal
rights of everyone to all that nature offers. This caveat can be
conceded without jeopardizing the two axioms, that</p>
<ul>
  <li>each person has an
exclusive right to his or her productive powers, and  </li>
  <li>all persons have
equal rights to the productive opportunities that nature offers.</li>
</ul>
This pair of axioms is the logical starting point of George's
ideas. His proposal for the abolition of all taxes except a tax on
land is a consequence that follows from them. Coercive taxes on the
act of producing or on income from productive effort are unjust
because people have rights to their productive powers. On the other
hand, taxes on the rental value that land would have if it were not
improved are not unjust, since this value is not produced by human
effort. Support of government spending from this source is a
convenient way of giving expression to the equal rights of all to
natural opportunities.<br>
<br>
<a name="III. Applying the Theory of Ju"></a><b> III. Applying the
Theory of Justice to Land Rights Among Nations</b>
<p>In connecting his proposals for reform to his theory of justice,
George made the implicit assumption that all of the people to whom
the theory applies are citizens of the same nation. But it is
interesting to ask, as George did not, what his theory of justice
implies for relations among sovereign nations.</p>
<p>To rearrange and condense George's axiom about natural
opportunities:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>The equal right of every human being to the use of all
that nature offers is natural, inalienable and limited only by the
equal rights of others.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>How would acceptance of this axiom affect relations among
nations?</p>
<p>To see the matter clearly, suppose first that the world consists
of just two agricultural island nations, with equal populations but
different amounts of land of a uniform quality, and no rent
differentials arising from differences in location. Suppose further
that each island is initially governed by an oligarchy that collects
all of the rent of land and provides no public services, but leaves
the population otherwise free to produce what they choose. If the
people of this world come to an understanding that the equal right of
every human being to the use of all that nature offers is natural,
inalienable and limited only by the equal rights of others, they will
see that justice requires them to share the rent of land equally
rather than have it collected by the oligarchies.</p>
<p>Would they then divide the rent of each island nation among the
people of that nation? No, they would not. From the clear meaning of
the words, the people of the nation with more land would understand
that they, as a nation, were appropriating more than their share of a
common heritage to which the people of the other nation had as much
right as they did, and that they were therefore required to
compensate the people of the other nation.</p>
<p>Consider some forms that such compensation might take. One
possibility is that everyone with exclusive use of land would divide
the rental value of his land equally among all persons. This would be
equitable, but it would have a very high transactions cost. The
conceptually simplest way to compensate for unequal appropriations of
the common heritage is to have everyone send to a clearing house the
full rental value of the land to which he has exclusive access. The
clearinghouse would then divide the proceeds equally among all
persons in both nations.</p>
<p>While this is conceptually simplest, it entails transferring more
money than necessary. It would suffice for each person with more than
his share to send the difference between the rental value of his land
and the global average rental value per capita. This would provide a
fund that would exactly suffice to compensate every person with less
than the global average per capita amount, for the difference between
the average and his holding.</p>
<p>With people organized into two nations, it would probably be
convenient to have the excess rent sent not to a global
clearinghouse, but to a national clearinghouse. The clearinghouse of
the larger nation would then send the clearinghouse of the smaller
nation an amount of money equal to the rental value of the amount of
land by which nation's area exceeded half of total land. Both
clearinghouses would then have just enough money to compensate their
citizens who had less than the global average per capita access to
land.</p>
<p>The assumptions of just two nations, equal populations and land of
uniform quality simplify the identification of what one nation owes
the other. It is easy to dispense with these assumptions. When there
are many countries, land quality varies, and population sizes differ,
a nation is fully entitled to what it is using, taking account of the
equal entitlements of the citizen of other nations to all that nature
offers, if its average rent per capita is no greater than the global
average rent per capita. If the nation's rent per capita is greater
than this, it owes compensation equal to the excess of its aggregate
rent above the product of its population and the global average rent
per capita.</p>
<p>Note that an equal sharing of natural opportunities does not imply
either that people derive equal satisfaction from their shares of
natural opportunities or that what constituted one person's share
will remain constant over time. If you are the only person who likes
mountain top land, you may be able to obtain a great deal of it as
your share of what nature offers, and be much more satisfied than
those who like land in valleys and have to compete with many others
who want valley land. If mountain top land becomes more popular, the
amount that constitutes your share will decline.</p>
<p>Now suppose that nations are not entirely agricultural, but have
cities as well as agricultural areas. Cities have streets, water
systems, sewer systems, and a variety of other public services that
raise the rental value of land. How does this additional source of
rent affect the compensation process? Recall the principle:</p>
<blockquote>The equal right of every human being to the use of all that
nature offers is natural, inalienable and limited only by the equal
rights of others.</blockquote>
<p>Streets, water systems, sewer systems, and other public services
are not offered by nature. The additions to the rental value of land
that these services provide are the product of the human effort that
goes into creating and sustaining them. Thus the increases in the
rental value of land that arise from them are not part of what must,
by the application of our axiom, be shared among nations.</p>
<p>This distinction between rent to which all persons have equal
rights and rent that is properly the income of a particular community
creates a problem of assessment. To fulfill their obligations to
people in rest of the world, the people of a city must know what the
rental value of the land they occupy would be if the city were not
there. How can they know this?</p>
<p>This assessment problem is formidable, but not a reason to abandon
the effort to achieve equal rights to natural opportunities. In
principle, the pre-development value of the land beneath a city is
the difference between the rental value of the land when developed
optimally and the annual cost of that development. One might call
upon city planners or the developers of new towns to make such
estimates. Even if we could not achieve complete precision in such
estimates, we might achieve substantial agreement. It would be a
great step in the direction of equal rights to natural opportunities
if each nation were to make a declaration of the form, "This is what
we believe to be the pre-development value of our land, and of the
land in the rest of the world, and this is the basis for our
belief."</p>
<p>What has been established so far is that adherence to a principle
of equal rights to natural opportunities requires payments among
nations to offset inequalities in the value of natural opportunities
per capita, that natural opportunities are exemplified by the
pre-development rental value of land, that significant difficulties
can be expected in identifying these pre-development rental values,
and that such difficulties are not a sufficient reason to abandon all
efforts to identify the pre-development rental value of land.<br>
</p>
<a name="IV. Applying the Theory of Jus"></a><b> IV. Applying
the
Theory of Justice to Other Connections among Nations</b>
<p>The pre-development rental value of land is only the beginning of
the natural opportunities to which all persons have equal rights.
Consider fishing in the oceans. If there were so many fish in the
oceans that the removal of some by the fishermen of one nation had no
detectable impact on the opportunities available to the fishermen of
other nations, then there would be no economic scarcity of fish in
the oceans as a natural opportunity, and the value of fish would
represent returns on the labor and capital of the fishermen, along
with some luck. But when fishing by one nation leaves noticeably
fewer fish for the others, the reduction in the value of fish stocks
caused by fishing represents an appropriation by that nation of the
common heritage of all, which needs to be accounted for in
establishing what compensation is needed to achieve an equal division
of natural opportunities. The pie to be divided now consists of the
sum of the pre-development rental value of all land plus the
depletion cost of the fishing that all nations do. A nation is fully
entitled to the proportion of this total represented by the
proportion of its population in total population.</p>
<p>The same logic that applies to fishing applies also to the rent
component of the value of all things--the iron and other metals in
products of all kinds, the gold and other resources in jewelry, the
component of land rent in lumber, etc. Each nation's use of such
resources must be included in the pie to be divided.</p>
<p>Sometimes rivers flow from one nation into another. If the
withdrawal of water by the upstream nation reduces the value of the
natural opportunities that are left to the downstream nation, then
this reduction in the value of the downstream opportunities is part
of what the upstream nation appropriates from the common heritage of
all nations. The total value of the available natural opportunities
is maximized while also achieving justice, if all withdrawals of
water by both nations are charged at a price that equates supply and
demand, the money so collected is counted as part of the pie to be
divided, and land is valued according to the rental value it would
have if unimproved,considering the price of water.</p>
<p>If nations are close enough together that effective use of parts
of the frequency spectrum by one requires that others refrain from
using those parts, and if bandwidth on the spectrum is scarce, then
any recognition that one nation will have exclusive use of a portion
of the frequency spectrum should be accompanied by a payment into the
fund to be divided, equal to what others give up by not using it.</p>
<p>If geo-synchronous parking spaces for satellites are scarce, then
each nation that has the use of such parking spaces should include a
payment for their market value in the pie to be divided.</p>
<p>When a nation generates air and water pollution that reduces the
value of land in neighboring countries, these reductions in the
rental value of land become components of what the polluting nation
must include in its calculation of the value of natural opportunities
that it appropriates, while the recipients of pollution may make
corresponding reductions in the reported totals of the natural
opportunities they appropriate.</p>
<p>If scientists reach a consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases
are harmful, then each nation should include its emissions of such
gases among the natural opportunities it appropriates, valuing each
emission according to the harm that additional emissions do.</p>
<p>When we become aware of a global problem like the ozone hole
increasing as a result of atmospheric emissions of particular gases,
if any of the harmful activities are continued, the nations that
permit such continuations of harmful activities should include the
value of the resulting harm as additional components of the natural
opportunities that they appropriate.</p>
&lt;&gt;In sum, all of the things that a nation does that limit the
ability of other nations to use natural opportunities or that reduce
the productivity of other nations are charges on that nation's
account. This includes claiming land, claiming exclusive
extra-territorial use of portions of the frequency spectrum, claiming
geo-synchronous orbits, appropriating water in international rivers,
appropriating fish in the oceans, appropriating rent in the form of
the use of resources that are incorporated into goods, and any form
of pollution with international consequences. The axiom that all
persons have equal rights to natural opportunities implies that each
nation has a right to a share of the total of all such appropriations
equal to its share in world population. Any nation that appropriates
more than its share has an obligation to compensate those who have
less than average per capita shares.<br>
&nbsp;
<p><a name="V. Differences in Ability and"></a><b> V. Differences in
Ability and in Wealth</b></p>
<p>Suppose that a nation appropriates only its share of natural
opportunities but is richer than other nations because its citizens
are on average harder working or more highly talented than the
citizens of other nations are. Does justice require the richer nation
to compensate the others? By this theory of social justice,
definitely not! Each person has an exclusive right to his or her
productive powers. Therefore the nation as a whole has a right to the
product of its citizens' talents, no matter how greatly this product
exceeds that of the citizens of other nations. The citizens of a rich
nation may feel compassion for those who are poorer than themselves,
and therefore contribute to poor nations as a matter of charity, but
justice does not compel them to do so.</p>
<p>What about greater incomes that arise from greater wealth? These
require more elaborate analysis. When greater wealth is the result of
greater saving from the product of talent or from the product of a
nation's share of natural opportunities, then a nation with greater
wealth is fully entitled to the greater income that comes from it.
However, when greater wealth is the result of a history of theft or
of unjustifiably large appropriations from the natural opportunities
that are everyone's common heritage, then the nation that possesses
that wealth cannot rightly claim either the income from the wealth or
the wealth itself. To achieve justice, the wrongful appropriations
must be rectified. The unjustly acquired wealth must be restored from
those from whom it was taken, or if that is not possible, shared
among all nations. To the extent that persons who are still alive
received past income from this wealth, that income must be
disgorged.</p>
<p>When George addressed this issue in <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress
and Poverty</a>, he
suggested that all such past misappropriations be forgiven, that the
generation that he addressed be content to receive their shares of
future rent. But the desirability of such a policy is a matter that
the dispossessed of any era must decide for themselves. Justice does
not require them to forego such rectification.</p>
Suppose that differences in incomes lead to differences in the
rental value of land. To make the example simple, go back to the case
of two island nations, and this time suppose that they have equal
amounts of land of the same quality as well as equal populations. But
the people on one island have a stronger taste for work, or they have
accumulated more capital, and as a result of this the rental value of
land on their island is greater. Are they obliged to make payments to
the people on the other island? No, they are not. They are
appropriating only their share of natural opportunities, so they have
no debt to the people of the other island.&nbsp;
<p><a name="VI. Resources that Fluctuate ov"></a><b>VI. Resources
that Fluctuate over Time</b></p>
<p>The natural opportunities that have been considered to this point
are ones that, to a first approximation, yield constant returns over
time. A new set of issues arises when this theory of social justice
is applied to resources that yield returns that necessarily vary over
time. Now the issue of intergenerational justice arises along with
that of international justice.</p>
<p>Consider first the issue of intergenerational justice without the
complication of international concerns. The efficient use of
depletable natural opportunities requires that they be allocated over
time in such a way as to maximize the present value of net revenue
from sales. As economists have long known, this requires that prices
charged for resources that are being depleted rise at the rate of
interest. But this is just efficiency. It says nothing about who
should get the money.</p>
<p>The axiom that all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities suggests that when we deplete a resource such as oil,
there are two steps that must be taken to achieve intergenerational
equity. In the first step, when oil is sold we must share the
proceeds over generations in such a way that every person in every
generation can receive a payment of the same real value every year.
To satisfy this obligation when the number of people alive in
different years is not proportional to the amount of oil used in
those years, we need to invest the proceeds of oil sales in a fund
that would make annual payments to all persons of a size that could
be maintained for all generations.</p>
<p>This first step provides intergenerational equity with respect to
oil revenue, but it does nothing about the fact that, if oil is
allocated efficiently over time, later generations will face a higher
price of oil than early generations. To provide equity with respect
to the changing price of access to natural opportunities, there must
be a second step that redistributes money among generations to offset
the changing price.</p>
<p>This second step implicitly assumes a world with no change in
technology. If an early generation provides later generations with
improved technology, then the later generations are treated justly if
the combination of prices of commodities, technology and money
received from the earlier generation permits them to attain the same
overall level of satisfaction as the earlier generation. This
specification of justice presumes that everyone has the same tastes.
When tastes differ, an improvement in technology that more than
compensates some persons for a greater scarcity of some natural
resources will provide inadequate compensation for others. Such
inequality cannot be avoided. All that can be expected is that those
who use exhaustible resources will, by limiting their use and
providing endowments for future generations, make it possible for the
typical member of every future generation to attain the same level of
well-being as the typical members of the earlier generations of
resource users. Success in such an effort cannot be guaranteed. We
don't know the tastes of future generations. We don't know the rate
at which technology will advance. We don't know the rate at which new
resources will be discovered. Estimates of all these things must be
made to determine the proper rate of resource use and the proper
endowments of future generations. The most that can be asked for is a
good-faith effort to achieve the standard required by justice.</p>
<p>Now consider the international dimension of intergenerational
equity. What one nation owes to others with respect to
intergenerational equity is compensation for making it more difficult
for the other nations to provide adequately for their future
generations. If all nations are using the same amount of oil per
capita, then no nation can complain about what the others are doing.
But if one nation is using more oil per capita than the others, then
it owes compensation to the others for making it harder for the
others to provide all of their future generations with equal rights
to natural opportunities. If oil is being allocated efficiently and
equitably among generations, the amount of compensation that an
excessively consuming nation owes will be the market value of its
excess oil consumption, valued in terms of the price of oil in the
ground. The same result is obtained if all nations include the
resource value of all oil that they consume, and all other depletable
resources, in the calculation of what they appropriate for themselves
from everyone's common heritage.</p>
<p>One of the ways that a nation can compensate other nations for
disproportionate use of natural opportunities is by creating
technology that other nations can use to compensate their future
generations for scarcer natural resources. If gasoline costs twice as
much but cars are twice as efficient, people are not, on net,
disadvantaged by the higher price of gasoline. This line of reasoning
requires contestable judgements about the value of new technology and
how long it would have taken before someone else would have made the
same discovery. Nevertheless, technological improvements are a valid
form of compensation for resource scarcity.</p>
<p>One issue that arises when technological improvements are used as
compensation is that not all nations place the same value on
technology. If some island nation wishes to maintain a way of life
that does not involve cars, then that nation is not compensated for
an increased scarcity of fish by increased efficiency of car engines.
What compensates a particular nation must reflect the typical
preferences of that nation.</p>
Another troublesome issue with respect to natural opportunities
is
that people have different ideas about which creatures are properly
treated simply as resources and which deserve a higher level of
respect. When creatures are non-migratory, the right to control them
can simply go with the land they occupy, and bids for the land will
reflect values with respect to the creatures that occupy the land.
However, with migratory creatures such as whales and songbirds, a
different mechanism must be created to deal with desires to protect.
If nations representing 80% of the world's population want to protect
whales, then they should be able to protect 80% of whales. How such a
rule would be implemented in practice is a problem that I leave for
others to wrestle with.&nbsp;
<p><a name="VII. Justice and the Demograph"></a><b> VII. Justice and
the Demographic Equation</b></p>
<p>If the population of one nation grows faster than the populations
of other nations, then in the future the citizens of the more rapidly
growing nation will be able to say to the other nations, "We
constitute a greater percentage of the world's population than our
forebears. We deserve a correspondingly larger proportion of the
value of using the world's scarce natural opportunities." It would
not be just for the rest of the world to reply, "It's not our fault
that your parents had so many children. You only get as a nation the
same fraction that your parents got. You must each do with less."
This would not be just because the equal right of every person to
natural opportunities is not contingent on having had parents who
were not excessively prolific. The equal right is an equal right of
persons. But this means that at the earlier time when the population
was growing, the citizens of the less rapidly growing nation could
say to those of the more rapidly growing nation, "Your decision to
have a population that grows more rapidly than the world population
requires us to set aside a greater quantity of resources for future
generations, as their shares of depletable resources, and as
compensation for greater scarcity of land in the future. This cost
that you are imposing on us must be counted in the calculation of
your share of natural opportunities." Thus the costs of differences
in population growth rates are counted in the calculation of
compensation for unequal appropriations of natural opportunities.
Similarly, those nations whose populations grow more slowly than
average can claim a credit for their slower growth.</p>
&lt;&gt;The analysis above takes no account of the possible benefits of
a
greater population. With a greater population, there will be
additional economies of scale that will lower the prices of some
goods and make it feasible to bring to market other goods that would
be unavailable if population did not grow. A nation with a population
that grows at an above-average rate had a right to credit from this
source of benefits to others. Such a nation might also expect to find
that it has a greater number of highly talented people who produce
innovations, permitting the nation to claim credit for the value of
those innovations to future generations.&nbsp;
<p><a name="VII. Conclusion"></a><b> VIII. Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Humanity needs a system for deciding what belongs to which nation
and for managing the unintended impacts that nations have on one
another. It can be expected that any workable system will be based on
principles of justice. This paper has outlined such a system, based
on two axioms, namely that people have rights to themselves and that
all persons have equal rights to natural opportunities. A companion
paper in the next volume of this journal will explore the implication
of this system for justice within nations and the processes that
might be used to gain recognition for such a system.&nbsp;

Global Economic Justice</b>
<p>Nicolaus Tideman</p>
<p>Published in Geophilos Spring 2001</p>
</center>
<p>If humanity achieves substantial consensus on the meaning of
economic justice with respect to relationships among nations, how
might we turn that developing consensus into practical politics?</p>
<p>In <a
 href="file:///C:/George/by%20author/Tideman/global_economic_justice.htm">Part
1</a> of this essay
in the previous issue of Geophilos, Nicolaus Tideman argued that it
is reasonable to develop an understanding of the meaning of global
economic justice on the basis of two axioms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every person has a right to himself or herself.</li>
  <li>All persons have equal rights to natural opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>These axioms imply that whenever a nation appropriates natural
opportunities for itself to the possible detriment of other nations,
it has an obligation to attend to the rights of those nations. If it
appropriates more than its share of natural opportunities, it has an
obligation to compensate those who thereby have less than their
shares. A nation's share of natural opportunities is a collection of
natural opportunities with a market value that is equal to the
product of the nation's population and the value of resource use that
could feasibly be used by all persons in all generations.</p>
<p>The natural opportunities include the pre-development rental value
of land, the depletion cost of fishing, mineral extractions, and
water appropriations, the harm from cross-border pollution, the
scarcity value of the electro-magnetic spectrum and geo-synchronous
orbits. If an increase in the population of one nation reduces the
value of the opportunities of other nations once the new citizens are
granted equal rights to natural opportunities, then this cost should
be counted as well. The value to other nations of innovations would
provide the innovating nation with credits to offset its
appropriations of scarce natural opportunities.</p>
<p>In Part II, the author addresses two questions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. What would the acceptance of this framework for justice
  imply for the justice of social arrangements within a nation?  </p>
  <p>2. What devices might be used to extend the acceptance of such a
    system of justice once the preponderance of nations had accepted it?</p>
</blockquote>
SUPPOSE THAT a nation accepted the principles that every person
has a right to himself or herself, and that all persons have equal
rights to natural opportunities. What would be implied for economic
arrangements and the rights of citizens within that country?
<p>As an acknowledgement of the right of every person to himself or
herself, such a nation would allow any citizen who wished to emigrate
to do so. Whenever someone exercised this right, the claim of his
former fellow citizens on natural opportunities would be reduced, and
the claim of his new fellow citizens would be increased. This fact
would tend to make nations more welcoming toward immigrants.</p>
<p>The freedom of individuals to move, and the fact that those who
moved would carry with them their claims to equal rights to natural
opportunities, would tend to permit a political majority in a nation
to justify its adoption of policies that were opposed by minorities,
not by a claim that because they were a majority they were right-a
nonsensical claim-but rather with the explanation that they were
simply seeking to express, with their shares of everyone's common
heritage, their conception of what a nation ought to be.</p>
<p>This would not be a completely satisfactory explanation, because
if a majority changed a long-established tradition, they would
require the minority who opposed the change to either accept a change
that they did not desire, or bear the costs of breaking their ties to
their traditional homes. But the only way to completely avoid the
costs of such dislocations would be to prohibit all change, and that
is not sensible. One can reasonably expect sensitive accommodation
on the part of both majorities and minorities-majorities not to
disregard the feelings of minorities just because they are a
majority, and minorities not to expect perpetual extension of the
status quo ante.</p>
<p>If a very sharp and deeply felt division of opinion about the
proper role of the state developed, then it would be sensible to
allow the minority to secede. There is nothing sacred or inevitable
about any particular number of nations or their borders. If a
majority allows a disgruntled minority, who are a majority in a
particular region, to leave and take territory with them, then the
remaining majority will avoid a potential problem of underpopulation
and excessive claims to natural opportunity that would occur if the
minority were to simply emigrate.</p>
<p>The dissatisfied minority can make a claim for an opportunity to
secede on the following basis: The prior claim to territory is based
on the rights of the minority as well as the majority to equal shares
of natural opportunities. The minority have rights to themselves. They
should not be obliged to live in a type of nation they do not
want. They may find all other nations unacceptable, or other nations
may find the dissatisfied minority unacceptable. Justice requires
that there be some way in which the dissatisfied minority can receive
their rightful share of natural opportunities, free of obligations
that entangle them with others, so it is proper for them to expect to
be able to sever their share from the territorial rights that belong
jointly to the majority and the minority.</p>
<p>The majority could justly require the minority to take their share
of rights in whatever territory the majority wished to cede, provided
that the ratio of the value of the territory so ceded to the value of
the territory retained was roughly equal to the ratio of the minority
to the majority, with any discrepancy settled by periodic cash
payments. The majority might also reasonably require the minority to
pay any costs of the separation.</p>
<p>When the people of a nation ensure that they do not claim more
than their shares of natural opportunities, when they permit any
citizen who desires to leave to do so, and they stand ready to allow
any substantial majority within a reasonably compact subarea to
succeed, then the people of that nation can justly say, "The laws we
choose to live under represent our conception of what a nation ought
to be. If you don't like it, create your own nation somewhere else. We
claim for ourselves no more than our share of what nature
provides." Thus a wide variety of arrangements within nations are
consistent with justice.</p>
<p>Economic theory can say something about the types of nations that
can be expected to emerge in such a world. As mentioned previously,
one would expect fewer barriers to immigration, since immigrants
would arrive with claims to their shares of natural opportunities.
Also, nations could expect to have greater difficulty retaining
citizens when they had either low wages, low returns to saving, or
laws that people found oppressive.</p>
Nations would acquire more of the characteristics of
competitive
firms. To attract or retain citizens, they would need to offer
citizens wages and rates of return on their capital that were close
to what they could get elsewhere. Taxes on wages and on the return
to capital would tend to be precluded by the need to attract people
and capital. What would be left as sources of public revenue would
be charges for exclusive access to natural opportunities-land,
natural resources, water rights, fishing rights, the frequency
spectrum, etc., plus charges for activities that imposed costs on
others (emitting pollutants, using crowded highways). We would see a
world that approximated the one that Henry George advocated, not as
something that was imposed on everyone, but rather as a competitive
equilibrium among nations.&nbsp;
<p>WOULD THERE be enough revenue for the public sector? To address
this question, one should consider different types of public
activities separately. The type of public activity that can most
readily be financed by charges for exclusive access to natural
opportunities is local public services. When these are desired by
voters and provided efficiently, they tend to raise the rental value
of land by enough to pay for themselves, since a local public service
provides a benefit in a limited region, and people will bid up the
rental value of that land by the value of access to the
service.<font size="-2"><i>2 </i></font> Thus local services can be
financed without even beginning to draw on the value of opportunities
provided by nature.</p>
<p>Another broad area of public spending is national defense. While
defense increases the value of land in a dangerous world, one might
reasonably hope that the need for defense spending would be greatly
reduced in a world that had adopted a general norm of acknowledging
the equal rights of all persons to natural opportunities.</p>
<p>To the extent that defense costs are raised when a nation becomes
a more attractive target-- because of increases in its stock of
capital or in the productivity of its citizens--it would be efficient
and not unreasonable to have an annual charge on capital and on
talent (an asset protection fee) to defray these costs. Such a fee
could be collected by a self-assessed tax. For capital, the tax
could be enforced by an obligation to sell the capital at the
self-assessed price. For talent, the tax could be enforced by a rule
that if a person was injured in an accident and wished to sue for
loss of earning power, the self-assessed value of the person's talent
would be the upper limit on the damages that could be claimed. It is
likely that a tax rate of two or three tenths of one percent per year
would suffice to fund the current level of U.S. defense spending. But I
would hope and expect that defense spending would fall
substantially. Between the reduced need for defense spending and an
efficient asset protection fee for the extra defense costs generated
by increases in capital and talent, it should be possible to finance
defense without exhausting the rental value of exclusive access to
natural opportunities.</p>
<p>The next major area of government spending to consider is social
welfare programs-welfare, social security, unemployment compensation,
health insurance, etc. These would tend to raise the rental value of
land to some extent, but they would generally not raise land rents by
enough to pay for themselves, because their perceived value to
individuals tends to be highly disparate, so that those who value
access to such programs generally do not need to offer the full value
of such programs in rent premiums in order to get access to them. Thus
one cannot count on financing such programs by increases in
rent. The disparate value of public education to families makes this
public service subject to the same analysis.</p>
<p>Social welfare programs often have an insurance component,
requiring payments by potential beneficiaries. If a program is so
close to a true insurance program that virtually everyone receives an
expected benefit that is as great as his or her assigned
contribution, then it can be financed by the assigned contributions,
and few will find the program objectionable. But social welfare
programs rarely approximate true insurance programs.</p>
<p>The difficulty with financing social welfare programs with rent
arises because those who design such programs usually seek to require
some people to pay more than the expected value of their benefits. In a
world that recognizes the equal rights of all persons to natural
opportunities and the right of any person to emigrate, social welfare
programs of this sort will be possible only to the extent that they
reflect shared community values. If such a program draws on shared
feelings of community responsibility, then people will be happy to
contribute part of their shares of the value of natural
opportunities, or even part of their earnings to such programs. If
an attempt is made to implement social insurance that exceeds what
people are prepared to pay for out of a sense of community, people
will tend to emigrate or secede. Thus in a world that operates on
principles of global economic justice, people will not be required to
pay for social insurance that they object to. If people have
potential needs that exceed what their fellow citizens are willing to
provide, they will have to buy their own insurance before the need
arises or rely on friends and family. If those who are never able to
provide for themselves are to be provided for in a just world of
limited generosity, parents will need to buy insurance against having
children with special needs before they conceive those children. But
I believe that feelings of community are sufficiently extensive that
those who need help would receive it. Unlike the present situation,
in a just world every person would have a share of the value of
exclusive access to natural opportunities, which would provide a
guaranteed income that would provide for many contingencies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">What to Do When Some Nations Fail to
Fulfill Their Obligations</p>
<p>THE THEORY that has been developed incorporates all of the ways
that nations impinge upon one another by their appropriations of
natural opportunities-through their claims to land, natural
resources, the frequency spectrum, and geosynchronous orbits, through
their appropriations of fish in the ocean, through their use of
natural resources that are embedded in goods, through their emissions
of pollutants that cross international borders, including the ones
that produce global warming and ozone depletion, through their
decisions to have population growth rates that differ from the world
average, and in any other way that nations appropriate scarce natural
opportunities. The theory describes what nations must do to fulfill
their obligations to other nations. But how will unwilling nations
be compelled to fulfill their obligations if they do not wish to do
so?</p>
<p>The theory is not designed to coerce recalcitrant nations. The
theory is designed to describe what must be done by those who wish to
fulfill their obligations. But universal acceptance is not needed
for the theory to work. In the first place, under the theory that
has been presented only some nations have obligations. The others
have claims. Until a careful analysis is done, it is not possible to
specify which nations have the obligations and which have the claims.
But only the nations with obligations need to be persuaded to
fulfill their obligations under the theory, and these are likely to
be predominantly rich nations. Because the magnitudes of transfers
to recipient nations depend on what those nations do, they receive
incentives to economize on their appropriations of natural
opportunities, even if they do not agree with the theory.</p>
<p>But suppose that only some of the nations with net obligations are
willing to honor those obligations. How should these nations respond
to the lack of cooperation by others? </p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">First, they should compute their
obligations as if the resources and populations of the non-cooperating
nations did not exist.</span> All persons have equal rights to all
natural opportunities. If some natural opportunities have been
improperly grabbed by people who refuse to acknowledge their obligation
to share, then those who do recognize their obligation should
understand that they must all claim less.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, the cooperating nations
should do what can reasonably be done to deny acceptability of
excessive claims to natural opportunities. If some nation appropriates
the oil, diamonds or other resources under the ground that it occupies
without regard to the rights of people in other nations, then the
people in the other nations should decline to purchase those resources,
or products made with them. </span>To do so would be to purchase
stolen property. If they have a dire need for the resources, they
should recognize the claims of all persons to the resources by
including the value of the resources in their own calculations of what
they appropriate from everyone's common heritage. In this way, economic
pressure would be put on all resource users to acknowledge the equal
rights of all persons to natural opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>What if a nation refuses to share the value of natural
opportunities among its citizens? A reasonable test of whether a
nation can properly be treated as the agent of its citizens and the
appropriate recipient of its citizens' shares of the value of natural
opportunities is whether the nation allows its citizens to leave. If
a nation does not allow its citizens to leave, then it is not proper
to treat the nation as the agent of its citizens. The citizens are
effectively imprisoned. We have no way of honoring our obligations
to them. We might put their shares in trust, but if they are not
allowed to leave, then we should not trust their government to use
their shares of the value of natural opportunities as they would
wish. On the other hand, if the citizens could leave and decline to
do so, and if there are some other nations that would accept them,
then we are justified in regarding their continued citizenship as
evidence of their implied consent to the decisions of their
government about how their shares of natural opportunities will be
used. This rule may induce governments that would otherwise keep
their citizens captive within their borders to instead allow them
liberty.</p>
<p>Thus the proper application of a principle of equal rights of all
persons to natural opportunities will generate incentives for
increased compliance and increased liberty for all. It is not
necessary to have a world government that has the power to coerce all
nations to abide by a single authority's determination of what they
owe. Every nation can make its own determination of what, if
anything, they owe to others. Within broad limits people can accept
differing interpretations of obligations. If some nation exceeds the
limits of tolerance, other nations can reasonably respond by
declining to regard that nation or its citizens as the true owners of
the things they seek to trade. What is created is a diverse,
tolerant, and responsible international community.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to achieve universal acceptance of this theory
for it to be effective. What is necessary is acceptance by the major
economic powers, plus a willingness to condition economic relations
on an assurance that traded goods are not unjustly appropriated from
nature, and are not made with the labor of persons who are deprived
of their liberty to migrate if they choose.</p>
