and the Law</span><br>

<br>
President Bush's announcement of his vision for an "ownership society"
met with thunderous cheers at the Republican Convention, and much
eye-rolling elsewhere. The Bush Administration would like to start by
encouraging private ownership of our retirement funds and our
health-care decisions. They want to get the heavy hand of government
out of such things and unleash the tremendous efficiency of millions
upon millions of Self-Interested Individual Actors, the husky,
brawling, broad-shouldered capitalism that made this country great.
Prosperity depends on the security of private property and the potency
of individual initiative! This is the self-evident truth that has been
obscured by Hollywood Socialists, Democratic Girlie-men and purveyors
of the Homosexual Agenda.<br>
<br>
We should realize, however, that this is hardly a new initiative. It is
really just the latest wave of an argument that has raged throughout
the history of the United States, about just what &#8212; if anything &#8212; and
on what basis &#8212; if any &#8212; the government can require us to surrender
what we possess. There are some people out there &#8212; and actually a fair
number, after all &#8212; who don't view the Bush Administration's
privatization proposals as extremist at all &#8212; but, rather, too soft.<br>
<br>
If we think for a while about some of the ramifications of "ownership"
&#8212; as we ultimately must, in a complex modern society &#8212; we find very
little clarity on what we really mean by it. We find that we're
actually not at all clear on the &#8220;rights, privileges and immunities&#8221; to
which "ownership" entitles us. It's such a muddle that the most common
strategy is to throw up one's hands, accept that ownership is whatever
the law says it is at a given time, and move on.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, though, the law is not at all clear. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thomas Jefferson</span>
fudged the topic in the United States Declaration of Independence,
inserting "the pursuit of happiness" where people expected the more
loaded term "property". <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Bill of
Rights</span>, however, is strong on
property rights. It provides for security of "persons, houses, papers,
and effects," that "private property shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation" and that rights not specifically prohibited
are reserved to the states or to the people. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In fact, the US
Constitution was so bullish on property that it provided for private
property in human beings, a principle made explicit in Dred Scott vs.
Sandford and many other cases.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Slavery was made unconstitutional by
means of the 13th Amendment in
1865. </span>This, however, left much to be resolved, and the Congress
had a
very difficult job &#8212; perhaps, in strictly logical terms, an impossible
job &#8212; in drafting Amendment number fourteen. Indeed, the 14th
amendment has always been controversial; there is a longstanding
argument that it was never properly ratified (owing to doubts about the
legitimacy of various reconstruction-era state governments). And to
this day, there exists a sizable contingent who argue that the 14th
Amendment created a new class of citizen (no longer spelled with a
capital C, as the Constitution had previously done), but a person
"subject to" the "jurisdiction of" the United States, because,
essentially, he or she chooses to be. By renouncing one's "14th
Amendment citizenship," argue these so-called "modern Patriots," one
can remove many of the heavy burdens that modern government lays on
citizens, including the obligation to pay the Federal income tax.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The 14th amendment reaffirms the
rights of life, liberty and property,
and binds the states to the same due process and equal protection
restrictions as the federal government. However, it places the
Constitution's first limit on the right of property, stating that the
United States or any state shall not pay "any claim for the loss or
emancipation of any slave." This could be seen as somewhat fishy in
terms of the Fifth Amendment. After all the 13th amendment had taken
the slaveholders' property three years before. Had not the Supreme
Court ruled that slaves were property and had to be returned to their
owners, even if they escaped to non-slaveholding states?</span><br>
<br>
Although it would have been impracticable (to say the least) to enforce
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Takings Clause</span> to the tune
of the market value of some four million
human beings, that was what the Constitution required the government to
do. The nation had fallen into a trap that the Framers set when they
originally failed to define property. Of course, the Framers had
foreseen that changing times would demand new interpretations of basic
principles. However, the right to own property is supposedly one of
those basic principles. If property is a fundamental right, it cannot
change over time. Yet, because property was never defined, the Framers
obligated future legislators to take up the question.<br>
<br>
Thus, a three-year argument raged over compensation, forcing the
government to decide the matter. It's no surprise that ratifying the
14th Amendment turned out to be a struggle.<br>
<br>
Let&#8217;s return to the 14th Amendment's detractors for a moment. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is
the essential difference between a &#8220;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Sovereign Citizen</span>&#8221; and a &#8220;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">14th
Amendment citizen</span>&#8221;? </span>Why, 14th Amendment citizens are
&#8220;subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States&#8221; -- which includes its power to seize
private property without compensation! Folks in the &#8220;Patriot&#8221; movement
assert that the 14th Amendment is invalid; some even hold that all the
subsequent amendments are invalid, that only the original Constitution
and Bill of Rights qualifies as the Supreme Law of the Land. On this
basis, they assert their "Sovereign rights as Citizens", claim their
right to drive cars without bothering to comply with "optional,
14th-Amendment-citizen" rules such as licensing and registration, and
refuse to pay federal taxes. That amounts, perhaps, to the ultimate in
privatization.<br>
<br>
The next amendment to the Constitution following the Reconstruction
Amendments was another milestone in the debate over property rights.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913,
allows Congress to &#8220;lay and
collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived&#8221; &#8212; contravening
the restriction of this practice that had been laid out in Article I.
</span>The &#8220;from whatever source derived&#8221; part has been making people
scream
bloody murder ever since. On its face, the 16th Amendment flew in the
face of the Framers&#8217; understanding of the right to property as an
extension of the right of a free individual to exercise creative powers
and to benefit therefrom. The power to levy a tax on income &#8220;from
whatever source derived&#8221; effects a fundamental change in the
Constitution&#8217;s definition of property rights. Ah, but since the
Constitution never did define property (except for banning the fee
simple ownership of human beings), that leaves us pretty much in the
soup, doesn&#8217;t it?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The original advocates of the income
tax (many of them Single Taxers)
sought to tax accumulation, not industry and initiative. They saw that
the massive concentration of wealth among a privileged few was harmful
to the nation, and they persuaded the states to accept a progressive
tax that would compel robber barons to pay for public goods while
letting entrepreneurs gain from their contributions to overall
prosperity.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">And
yet, over the years, a tax on income &#8220;from whatever
source derived&#8221; came, one loophole at a time, to be a tax on exactly
those productive, hardworking, middle-class people that it was designed
to help.</span> I mean, if I go out and make a better mousetrap, and
the world
beats a path to my door, do I not have the right to the proceeds? If
the government confiscates my mousetraps, or the profits therefrom, for
public use, is that not a &#8220;taking&#8221;? Basically, after the 16th
Amendment, the Constitution prohibits the taking of private property
without just compensation -- unless it is taken by the IRS. No wonder
the &#8220;Patriots&#8221; are arming themselves, burning their drivers&#8217; licenses
and heading for the woods.<br>
<br>
Imagine their dismay when they get there and find that Green-Commie
regulations to protect the habitat of little spotted bugs and corrupt
governmental building-permit rules deprive them of their right to use
and enjoy their private property! <span style="font-weight: bold;">Up
springs another arm of the
"Patriot" movement: the Property Rights advocates, who want your grubby
little hands off of Their Land.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In most people's minds, after all,
land is the most solid and important
kind of property; in fact, the word "property" in general conversation
most often means "land".</span> However, it has long been recognized
that
sometimes privately-held land must be taken for public purposes. The
principle of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eminent domain</span> is
not (particularly) controversial. If the
state wants to put a highway through your house, it must pay you the
fair market value of your property. This principle was a sensible check
against the tyrannical power to seize private property at will,
displayed by the likes of King George III. Property rights are
protected, according to the Supreme Court, to keep government from
"forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all
fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole."
(Armstrong v. United States, 1960) In recent years, this principle has
been extended beyond the physical seizure of real estate to regulations
which take its value. The landmark case in this vein was Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, 1992, in which the imposition of a state law
restricting new construction on a stretch of beach removed the market
value of a piece of land. Although the land itself was not taken, the
law removed the property's value, and the US Supreme Court ruled that
the landowner was owed compensation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">This decision was important because it
extended the Takings doctrine
beyond physical seizure to the taking of value -- but it was also
relatively uncontroversial in that the state legislature had removed
all of the parcel's market value. </span>Such cases are fairly rare.
Much more
common -- and much more problematic -- are cases in this regulations
remove some land value. After all, if private property cannot be taken
for public use without compensation, the amount of property taken
should not matter. And there is precedent: the Court has long held that
physical invasion of property constitutes a taking, even if only a
small portion of the property is seized. (For example, in Loretto v.
Teleprompter Manhattan, 1982, a regulation requiring building owners to
allow a cable company to install cable facilities on their buildings
was ruled a Taking, even though the facilities only took up 1.5 cubic
feet of space.) So, a partial physical invasion is a Taking under the
5th Amendment, but a partial diminution of value due to regulation is
not. Where's the principle?<br>
<br>
In fact, there is none: jurisprudence on the regulatory takings issue
is a "crazy quilt pattern", according to one commentator. The courts
have sought for some guiding principles, but they are hard to come by:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The economic impact
of the regulation on the
claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has
interfered with reasonable investment-backed expectations are...
relevant considerations. So too, is the character of the governmental
action. A 'taking' may more readily be found when the interference with
property can be characterized as a physical invasion by government than
when interference arises from some public program adjusting the
benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.
(Justices Rehnquist and Stevens, in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New
York City, 1978)</div>
<br>
The reason for this confusion is not hard to see. There are zillions of
government actions that affect land values. The point of absurdity
isn't hard to reach. Suppose, for instance, the local government lowers
property tax rates, which raises land values in the short term. But
then suppose that because of the revenue shortfall that results, the
community scrimps on the police budget, and crime increases, thus
lowering land values. Is that a Taking? Or, suppose the Fed (which is
not, strictly speaking, part of government, but whose actions
nevertheless have great impact on public policy) raises interest rates
to fight inflation. This has the effect of lowering land prices! Do the
landowners deserve compensation?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If government were to be held liable
for every single action that took
away a portion of real estate value, it could scarcely do anything at
all.</span> That might be how some of the most strident militia-folk
would
like it. However, it would certainly not suit real estate owners in
general &#8212; who, while they might not enjoy paying for government, do
benefit from the things that government does.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What the property-rights folks are
forgetting (or disregarding) is that
if a piece of land has a market value, that means that the net benefits
conferred upon it by the community (which includes the government) are
greater than the net costs. </span>Location value is far and away the
most
important component of land value &#8212; and location value is almost
entirely the result of services and infrastructure that the government
provides.<br>
<br>
How did this matter get so confused? Here's a telling paragraph, from a
report issued by the "Defenders of Property Rights":<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The protection of
private property receives such
strong emphasis in the federal constitution because the right to own
and use property was historically understood to be critical to the
maintenance of a free society. To understand this concept, one must
understand that property is more than just land. Property is buildings,
machines, retirement funds, savings accounts, and even ideas. In short,
property is the fruit of one's labor and the ability to use, enjoy and
exclusively possess the fruits of one's labor is the basis for a
society in which individuals are free from oppression....</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">That sounds good at first glance; it
sounds like something John Locke
would agree with. But wait a moment: "property is more than just land"?
If property is the fruit of our labor, how can land be placed in that
category? </span>And if we remember this clue as we look back at the
whole
Takings debate, it become clear that land is the sticking point. As far
as I can tell, there has never been much controversy over the propriety
of compensation when physical property, one's buildings, cars,
furniture, etc., is confiscated or destroyed. It's the land that makes
the question difficult. Remember, in the most important
regulatory-takings precedent, the Lucas case, there was nothing there
but land &#8212; the owner had yet to make any improvements. What had been
"taken" was land value &#8212; land value that had indeed been "given" by
the surrounding community and its protection of, among other things,
private property rights. (It is worth noting that although Mr. Lucas
paid $975,000 for the land in question in 1986, the compensation he
sued for, and ultimately received, was $1.2 million &#8212; which indicates
that regulatory takings can extend even into unrealized gains in land
value. Seeing as his land apparently rose in value by $225,000 in two
years' time, would Lucas have been likely to build on the land in 1988
&#8212; when the "Taking" occurred &#8212; or years down the road?)<br>
<br>
It's no accident that the issue of "regulatory takings" is such a stew
of contradictions. Indeed, the terms of the argument deny the
possibility of coherence (in much the same way as they did in 1868).
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Land is
not the fruit of human labor, and its value is not the result
of any actions taken by its owner. Therefore, private property in land
is an entirely different sort of phenomenon than private property in
the products of labor &#8212; and as long as the law fails to recognize this
fact, it cannot hope to make sense of the issue of "regulatory takings".</span><br>
<br>
Once again, the Framers dodged the tough question, leaving it to us to
resolve. Thomas Jefferson recognized the problem &#8212; which is clearly
one reason for his vagueness in the Declaration of Independence:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A right of property
in moveable things is admitted
before the establishment of government. A separate property in lands,
not till after that establishment. The right to movables is
acknowledged by all the hordes of Indians surrounding us. Yet by no one
of them has a separate property in lands been yielded to individuals.
He who plants a field keeps possession till he has gathered the
produce, after which one has as good a right as another to occupy it.
Government must be established and laws provided, before lands can be
separately appropriated, and their owner protected in his possession.
Till then, the property is in the body of the nation, and they, or
their chief as trustee, must grant them to individuals, and determine
the conditions of the grant. (Batture at New Orleans, 1812)<br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It could be suggested that "the
conditions of the grant" could, without
doing any violence to the secure right of private property, require the
payment to the community of the land's rental value, to cover the cost
of the community's expenses which, in turn, provide the land's value in
the first place. </span>That would, of course, require a clearer
definition of
the moral basis of property that the United States has ever been able
to come to. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Yet &#8212; think of
it for a moment &#8212; what would have happened
if the original Bill of Rights had articulated the individual's
absolute right to property only in the products of labor &#8212; and the
community's right to the community-created value of the land?</span><br>
<br>
It would have saved us an awful lot of trouble. True, the "slavery"
states would have balked at joining the union under those rules. But
under them, the nation would have been so prosperous that they would
quite soon have seen the advantage of joining. We would have avoided
the Civil War, and probably even World War I &#8212; it is dazzling to think
about how different &#8212; and vastly better &#8212; our history would have
been, had the Framers taken the brave step of setting forth the moral
basis of property along these lines.<br>
<br>
It's interesting that we use the word "own" to mean two different
things: the sense of possession, and the sense of personal
acknowledgment, as in "owning up" to one's responsibilities. The
relationship between the two was once closer than it now seems to be;
the word "ought" is an archaic past participle of "owe". As we consider
how to arrange our "ownership society", we'd do well to remember what
we "ought" &#8212; and bring the two senses of the word back together.<br>
