            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">A personal note: Over Labor
              Day weekend,
              2001, I attended a
              conference — my first since childhood — on Georgist ideas,
              in
              Pittsburgh. As my husband, son and I&nbsp;drove to the
              conference, I
              read to them this paper, written by my late grandfather,
              to give them
              some idea of why I was interested in these ideas. As I
              read, I found
              my grandfather's paper somewhat dated. Well, it was
              written in 1982,
              and nuclear war and inflation were big topics then. I
              wondered how
              he would have updated the paper to meet current issues.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Then came September 11, and
              not long
              after that, the collapse of Argentina's currency,
              and suddenly Weld's <span style="font-style: italic;
                font-weight: bold;">Clarion Call </span>seemed
              quite timely once again.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I do not have the background
              in economics
              that my grandfather had,
              and some of the connections he makes didn't make obvious
              intuitive
              sense to me at first. But I have come around, slowly and
              cautiously, to his belief that the reform he
              describes is necessary — and possibly even sufficient — if
              we hope
              to
              cure
              the
              problems our current system inflicts on the vast majority
              of our
              citizens and countrymen.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Is inflation really <i>that</i>
              important? I find myself answering
              "no, it isn't very important — as long as we don't have
              it."</p>

              <b>A Clarion Call to Sanity, to Honesty, to
                Justice</b>
              <p>by Weld S. Carter</p>
            </center>
            <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
            <p>This world of ours is currently threatened with disaster
              of
              awesome magnitude on two fronts. The first is the danger
              of nuclear
              warfare, most likely occurring between the United States
              and the
              Soviet Union; the second disaster, of even greater
              likelihood, is
              that the currencies of all the major countries of the
              world may soon
              be rendered worthless by inflation. Because the
              possibility of
              nuclear war may be lessened dramatically by the
              elimination of
              inflation, this article will address this second horror
              which
              currently engulfs us all.</p>
            <p>This paper is predicated on the fact that there is one
              reform
              basic to the extent that no other reform, in its very
              nature, can
              possibly avail until this basic reform is fully adopted
              and
              instituted. The whole tenet of this paper is to
              demonstrate the
              verity of this statement.</p>
            <p>The above appeal is based on the obvious fact that our
              entire
              socio-economic order has become riddled with lies,
              corruption and
              injustice. These claims, too, will be widely verified.</p>
            <p>There must come a yearning for sanity, for honesty, for
              justice
              – and now – else we shall surely perish from the earth.</p>
            <p>In March of 1879, a hitherto unknown author appeared on
              the
              American scene. His name was Henry George. He was
              described by John
              Dewey with the comment, "It would require less than the
              fingers of
              two hands to enumerate those who, from Plato down, ranked
              with Henry
              George among the world's great social philosophers." His
              first book,
              entitled "<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>" was
              described on its
              title page by the author as "<b><i>an inquiry into the
                  cause of
                  industrial depressions and of the increase of want
                  with the increase
                  of wealth; The Remedy</i></b>."</p>
            <p>Following a remarkably accurate and persuasive
              description of the
              past and current economic situation, George states that
              remedy in a
              single italicized paragraph at the end of page 238
              containing just
              six words:</p>
            <blockquote>"We must make land common property."</blockquote>
            <p>This remedy remains as true today as in his era, and
              vastly more
              important.</p>
            The failure of our societies to incorporate this principle
            as the
            foundation of their tax and legal policies lies at the root
            of the
            present monstrous inflation. In turn, it is the failure of
            those of
            us who know and understand George's teachings and his remedy
            to press
            successfully for such incorporation to discharge that
            special
            responsibility that accompanies such knowledge and
            understanding,
            that forms the main thrust of this paper.<br>
            <p><b>Thesis</b></p>
            <p>Our problem today, as yesterday, and the days before,
              back to the
              earliest recorded times, is POVERTY.</p>
            <p>There are times when this problem is lesser. We call
              these
              "booms." There are also times when the problem is greatly
              exacerbated. These are called "busts." But, as the Bible
              says, "the
              poor have ye always with ye."</p>
            <p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the core of the
              problem.
              It is not the position that there is only one single error
              afoot in
              our social organizations. There may be several, there may
              be only a
              few things to remedy. The position is, as stated earlier,
              that there
              is one basic cause of the problem. Therefore, the removal
              of this one
              basic error is the first, the primary step, for the simple
              reason
              that, until this basic social evil is eradicated, no other
              reform
              will avail. We will simply continue the boom and bust
              cycles until
              the economies of the whole world are wrecked by inflation
              or by a
              nuclear war triggered by the ongoing economic disaster.</p>
            <p>Let us begin this study of the likely causes of our
              troubles by
              asking two questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Are we over-populated? </li>
              <li>Are the earth's
                resources inadequate for this population? </li>
            </ul>
            Our stage, of course, for
            making this study will be this world of ours, for it is upon
            this
            world that the drama of human living is played out, with all
            its joys
            and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all
            its
            failures, with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.
            <p>Regardless of its size relative to other planets, with
              its
              circumference of about twenty-five thousand miles, to any
              mere mortal
              who must walk to the station and back each day, it is
              huge. Roughly
              ninety-six million miles separate the sun from the earth
              on the
              latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this
              distance, the
              earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and
              it spins
              on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's
              rays are
              distributed far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage
              and
              maximizing their benefits.</p>
            <p>Consider the complementarity of nature in the case of the
              two
              forms of life we call vegetable and animal, in their
              respective uses
              of the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, the waste
              product of
              each serving as the life-giving force of the other. Any
              increase in
              the one will encourage a like response in the other.</p>
            <p>Marvel at the manner in which nature, with no help from
              man or
              beast, delivers pure water to the highest lands,
              increasing it as to
              their elevation, thus affording us a free ride downstream
              and free
              power as we desire it. Look with awe at the variety and
              quantity of
              minerals with which this world is blessed, and finally at
              the
              fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both
              animal and
              vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels
              from a single
              stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of
              this year's
              crop; then think of the vastly greater yields from a
              single cherry
              pit or the seeds of a single apple, or grape or
              watermelon; or,
              turning to the animal world, consider the hen who averages
              almost an
              egg a day and the spawning fish as examples of the
              prolificacy that
              is evident throughout the whole of the animal world,
              including
              mankind.</p>
            <p>If this marvelous earth is as rich in resources as
              portrayed in
              the foregoing paragraph, then the problem must be one of
              distribution:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>how is the land distributed among the earth's
                inhabitants, and </li>
              <li>how are its products in turn distributed?</li>
            </ul>
            Land is universally treated as either public property or
            private
            property. Wars are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated
            as common
            property.
            <p>George has described this world as a "well-provisioned
              ship" and
              when one considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals
              of such
              provisions as coal and petroleum as have occurred say over
              the past
              one hundred years, one must but agree with this writer.
              But this is
              only a static view. Consider the suggestion of some ten
              years ago
              that it would require the conversion of less than 20% the
              of the
              current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the
              motors
              then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The
              dynamic picture
              of the future is indeed awesome, and there is every
              indication that
              that characteristic has the potential of endless
              expansion. <b>So how
                is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this
                world of
                ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on
                earth for vast
                numbers of people?</b></p>
            <p>The answers are simple: we have permitted, nay we have
              even more
              than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of
              resources and a
              viciously wicked distribution of wealth, and we choose to
              be governed
              by those whom we, in our ignorance, have elected. As the
              principal
              focus of this paper is on inflation, let us give this
              process its
              full name which is fiat money inflation and let us define
              this as the
              process by which a government continues the issuance of
              irredeemable
              paper money until the quantity so issued finally renders
              it
              worthless.</p>
            <p>Since the founding of our country, there have only been
              two
              first-class countries guilty of this process. The first of
              these
              occurred in France in the late 1700's; the second was in
              Germany in
              1923. In both, the results were devastating, and not
              limited to the
              offending parties: World War II, for example, resulting
              directly from
              the German inflation of 1923, and the rise to power of the
              madman
              Hitler. When one recalls the horrors of both of these, one
              should be
              dumbfounded at the insanity currently rampant throughout
              every single
              so-called first class country in the world today.</p>
            <p>The effects of inflation could be accounted for in the
              words of
              Edwin Kemmerer, who introduced his first lecture on the
              German
              inflation of the early 1920's with the statement that,
              whereas money
              must not be confused with wealth, it does serve three
              extremely
              important functions: as a measure of wealth, as a medium
              for the
              exchange of wealth, and as a storehouse of wealth. This
              was at the
              start of a series of six lectures presented in the mid
              1930's (for
              $5.00) at the New School for Social Research in New York.
              The
              disaster of inflation might best be described by a
              contemplation of
              the destruction of this storehouse. Money in the bank
              today has a
              specific worth; a year from now, it may be worth
              significantly
              less.</p>
            <p>A great American economist in the field of money and
              banking, a
              past president of the American Economics Association,
              Kemmerer taught
              primarily at Princeton University. He emphasized the fact
              that
              everyone in German suffered terribly, although mentioning
              the fact
              that the landowners suffered the least. Before it ended in
              1923, over
              475 quintillion marks had been printed, and people were
              taking
              wheelbarrows of them to market.</p>
            <p><b>We tend to think that the awful inflations that
                affected
                Germany and France in the past century couldn't happen
                here, that
                "they" wouldn't let it. However, under the current
                paradigm of
                economics, "they" have no control. </b>Politicians in
              power praise
              the skills and the impact of the efforts of proponents
              first of
              fiscal and then of monetarist policies, as if these two
              approaches
              constituted the only two available solutions.</p>
            <p>They don't know any answer. We're on a roller coaster
              which we
              cannot stop and from which we cannot escape. The
              inevitability of the
              terrible future that apparently lies ahead is so awesome
              that people
              tend to bury their heads in the sand, taking the attitude
              that they
              might as well enjoy the present because the future is so
              far out of
              their control. Economists generally have not provided much
              reason to
              do otherwise, and no one, including the general run of
              economists,
              has come up with any hope of salvation, of rescue.</p>
            <p><b>Suffice it to say that history has shown inflation to
                produce
                an outcome that an intelligently run economy should
                avoid at
                virtually any cost. </b>The ultimate outcome of the
              inflationary
              course we are now pursuing is the repudiation of the
              current money
              system.</p>
            <p>While the nuclear issue has been widely and emotionally
              discussed,
              been the subject of a widely-viewed TV movie, and is
              generally
              acknowledged to be a major threat to this world's future,
              the fact
              that <b>the decision-making process for nuclear war could
                be reduced
                to a single individual who can launch weapons that can
                themselves
                produce or directly lead to our mutual and complete
                destruction</b>

              other hand
              <b>the economic situation, despite the fact that nearly
                everyone
                would agree that inflation is a bad thing, is not given
                the primacy
                in popular opinion that the issue deserves</b>. This may
              be due to a
              lack of understanding of the interrelationships between
              various
              causes and effects.</p>
            <p>In our economy, land is a ready object of speculation,
              and its
              value is constantly reflecting this evil. What happens in
              a rising
              market, the up side of a business cycle, is that investors
              see rising
              prices in land as indicative of a boom. Thereupon, they
              try to
              increase their holdings in such land, only to discover
              that their
              present returns will not pay for the present costs of
              land; the
              current price of land is not based on what the yield of
              that land is
              today, but on what it is projected to be two or three
              years from now.
              The difference tends to increase until a point is reached
              where the
              imarginal buyer of land suddenly finds himself unable to
              meet the
              rising costs to which he has subjected himself. With
              bankruptcy
              threatening him or having already been forced upon him,
              the land
              passes from his hands, and the market temporarily becomes
              overpriced.
              The bankruptcies increase, and ultimately land values are
              brought
              back to levels which represent current productivity, at
              which point
              the new boom will have started.</p>
            <p><a name="Monroe"></a>In 1933, the University of Chicago
              published a book by Homer Hoyt
              entitled <b><i>One Hundred Years of Land Values in
                  Chicago</i></b>.
              This monumental study consists in 7 chapters, of which
              each of the
              first five describes one of the five major business cycles
              of the
              period in great detail.</p>
            <p>What was so outstanding about Hoyt's book was its
              compelling
              confirmation of George's analysis, some thirty-five years
              after
              George's death in 1897! What is even more significant is
              Hoyt's
              handling of his data in chapters six and seven, the
              balance of the
              study. In these two chapters, he selects some sixteen
              events which
              not only are present in each cycle, but which occur in the
              same order
              in each cycle.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hoyt concluded with the usual caveat: that the mere
              fact that
              this sequence is observed this many times does not
              guarantee that it
              will ever happen again; which is to say that we can never
              prove
              truth, we can only fail to disprove it.</p>

                moz-do-not-send="true">graphic
                rendition</a> of one such cycle appearing below was
              devised by John Monroe, the Director of the Commerce and
              Industry
              Division of the Chicago Henry George School of Social
              Science. For
              classroom use, Mr. Monroe had set up a large magnetized
              blackboard
              with a large inverted "U"; the sixteen items of the figure
              were
              described on sixteen magnetized chips, which were shuffled
              and
              distributed along the participants. The author once had a
              class of five company presidents; after defining the task,
              he never
              spoke during the exercise. The individual members had sole
              control as
              to the place on the curve where each chip belonged. It was
              thrilling
              to see and hear the discussion and the ultimate
              positioning of the
              individual chips. At completion, they matched precisely
              the
              historically-based results of Hoyt. Five converts, one of
              whom had
              been the President both of Chicago's Real Estate Board and
              of its
              Building Managers Association, as well as a trustee of the
              University
              of Chicago, walked out of that session.<br>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">There are banks which have
              gone under
              supporting rising land
              prices, loaning money on land at speculative price levels.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The answer
                is not to rescue those banks; it is to rid ourselves of
                the
                fundamental process of speculation in land values.</span></p>
            <p>The wringing out of land speculation from the dynamics of
              economics will remove that unacknowledged offence which
              has so
              labored the economic profession and the public at large.
              As Henry
              George discovered and as Homer Hoyt so brilliantly
              depicted
              speculative land prices as the cause of this bitter cycle,
              so will
              its removal rid society of this hitherto hidden defect. It
              will put
              the land market on a current value basis and eliminate the
              terrible
              risks to which that market has always been subject in the
              past.</p>
            <p>The reason for such speculation under the present
              practices is
              obvious. All products of labor are subject to increases or
              decreases
              depending on supply and demand. When an oversupply of any
              commodity
              begins to rear its ugly head, prices tend downward and
              production is
              thereby lessened until there is a contrary swing upward.
              Land, on the
              other hand, is of fixed supply. Nothing man does can
              increase or
              decrease the amount of land, and therefore that brake that
              operates
              in the field of production does not apply to land values
              and
              prices.</p>
            <p>Just think of the social benefits that would accrue to a
              society
              that could, at a stroke, rid itself of the potential
              hazards to which
              all prior societies have been so subject. Production will
              then occur
              on a steadily rising level, demand increases as the
              well-being of
              society improves, new techniques develop, new inventions
              are made,
              and all these will be benefits to the community as a
              whole, and not
              just to the land-owners as in the past.</p>
            <p>Back in the early days of this century, Winston Churchill
              saw and
              recorded an example of this. There had been a ferry fare
              over the
              river Thames for the common laborers who lived on the
              wrong side of
              the river to pay in order to get to work. A spirit of
              nobility
              prompted the absorption of this fare by the City, and
              almost
              immediately rents in the working class area were increased
              by the
              same amount as the fare had been. When this thing was
              done, the guys
              who got the benefit were not the poor working class
              people, but the
              owners of the homes in which they lived, or, more
              accurately and more
              critically, the owners of the land on which those homes
              stood. The
              laborers were thus charged a higher rent, and that rent
              diverted the
              benefit from the seemingly intended beneficiary (i.e., the
              public) to
              landowners in the affected area.</p>
            <p>This occurs every day in this country. A new road is
              built, or a
              superhighway is constructed, which makes access to a
              particular site
              much easier. We tell ourselves that we justify this as an
              expenditure of public funds by the benefits that accrue to
              the
              traveling public; but the benefits go, in the form of
              higher land
              prices and rents, to the owners of the sites that are
              served by this
              new road. If you doubt this, consider the jockeying for
              the insider
              information or for influence over the selection.</p>
            <p>Robert Caro, in his biography of Robert Moses, recalls
              the time in
              the early 1920s that Moses suggested to the authorities
              the building
              of a causeway from the Long Island mainland over to Jones
              Island.
              This proposal was rejected outright by the Long Island
              Park
              Commission. Some months later, Moses presented them with a
              drawing
              showing precisely where this causeway would run, and,
              after a
              suitable period of during which these public employees
              could buy up
              the land along the proposed highway, he resubmitted his
              proposal.
              This time, they officially approved the suggested
              construction.</p>
            <p>In the town of Antioch, Illinois, there were two
              developments
              underway almost simultaneously. In the one, roads were
              provided,
              together with water and sewer lines, but no sidewalks; in
              the other,
              just across a main road from the first, the mayor of the
              city had
              storm sewers, curbs and sidewalks installed at public
              expense, for
              which of course, any prospective buyer or tenant would
              gladly pay for
              use of that land the higher price these added benefits
              provided. Any
              reader will recognize this chain of events and set of
              economic
              relationships as being the course of everyday life and
              business at
              the local, state and national level. <b>The cynic would
                say that a
                primary motivation for entering local or even national
                politics would
                be the opportunity for personal gain offered daily by
                publicly
                financed improvements.</b></p>
            <p>Another example relates to a piece of farmland in central
              Pennsylvania. In the early 1940's, an 18-acre farm
              complete with a
              two-story house with five bedrooms, a large barn that
              would among
              other things hang 3½ acres of tobacco and store hay, straw
              and
              corn on the upper level, with stalls for 6 milking cows
              and a half
              dozen steers, housing for 100 laying hens and for
              fattening a few
              hogs plus a shed for equipment – all in all, not a large
              farm by
              local standards at the time – sold for $7,500. Twenty
              years
              later, with about $12,000 in residential improvements,
              that land and
              its buildings were sold for approximately $20,000. In
              those twenty
              years, the neighborhood and the general economy in the
              county had not
              changed a great deal. Within the next year, a decision was
              pending on
              the exact location and routing of a new superhighway. The
              decision,
              which was announced some time later, carried the route of
              the highway
              via a bridge across the local road on which that farm was
              situated
              and a cloverleaf access was built nearby. Soon, the value
              of that
              piece of land jumped to $10,000 per acre, which, ignoring
              the value
              of any improvements to the original piece of land, was an
              increase of
              800%. That increase, from $20,000 to $180,000, benefitted
              the most
              recent purchaser of the land. However, the increase
              resulted from the
              effects of public (i.e., taxpayers') spending, and, in a
              more just
              society, would have been returned to the taxpayers, rather
              than
              accruing to the private benefit of an individual who
              either made a
              good guess, had some private information, or even perhaps
              lobbied for
              that particular routing of that publicly financed highway.</p>
            <p><b>Thus, the benefits of a tax-supported public work
                accrued once
                more not to the benefit of the public at large, but to
                that of a very
                limited and narrowly defined class, those who were rich
                enough to own
                land in that location.</b></p>
            <p>There are undoubtedly many other problems to be resolved
              before
              the ills of our society are cured; but what many do not
              recognize and
              understand is the primacy of the adoption of land value
              taxation over
              all these other corrections. The reason for that can be
              very simply
              stated: <b>If any of these other measures already adopted
                have no
                merit and have only added to the burden of our problems,
                then they
                are disqualified at the outset. On the other hand, if
                they are of
                themselves beneficial, any benefit from them will be
                immediately
                capitalized into land values and will therefore
                exacerbate the very
                problems which otherwise might be helped toward a cure.</b>
              Thus it
              is that our first step toward any possible remedy for the
              awesome
              plight into which we have been led increasingly over the
              recent years
              must be the adoption of land value taxation.</p>
            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>Suppose a great fire was sweeping across an area of the
              country,
              and the people in its path found themselves endangered.
              What would
              you recommend that they do? Would you suggest they write
              to their
              congressman? Would you recommend that they send in $5.00
              as their
              contribution to a campaign to end the fire? If they can't
              get away
              from it, then they must fight it or it will kill them.
              Digging a hole
              in which to bury one's head is not the solution.</p>
            <p>I recognize the difficulty of achieving what I hope for.
              I also
              recognize the immediacy of the problems confronting
              populations over
              the entire face of the globe. To reform this society will
              require a
              drastic change of attitude toward the relationship of man
              to this
              earth on which and from which he makes his living. Nothing
              short of a
              world-wide movement, a real appeal for a tidal wave of
              opposition to
              these existing institutions, is going to rid us of the
              evils
              confronting us.</p>
            <p>This paper is entitled "<b><i>A Clarion Call to Sanity,
                  to
                  Honesty, to Justice</i></b>." It is insanity to pursue
              a course which
              is leading inevitably and rapidly to the destruction of
              life on this
              planet. The enemy is the two-headed snake of inflation and
              nuclear
              war. The good news is that neither of these need be
              inevitable. The
              bad news is that unless we change course soon, we shall
              most
              assuredly end up where we are now headed.</p>
            <p>In his autobiography, "Justice", Illinois Senator ____
              said "The
              most unjust thing you can possibly do is so to order
              society as to
              ensure the continuation of poverty among huge masses of
              the human
