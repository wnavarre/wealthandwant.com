<div align="center"><strong>On the Futility of a Tax Cap</strong><br />
  H. William Batt, Ph.D. <br />
  Center for the Study of Economics, Albany and Philadelphia
</div>
<p>Any effort to cap taxes on real property is ultimately a fruitless and futile
  endeavor. To understand why, one must first see that it is really two separate
  taxes: one on land value and one on improvements, each with very different
  dynamics. </p>
<p>The tax component levied on improvements necessarily reduces the supply of
  office space, home construction, or other buildings, just as does the cost
  of materials, labor, and money. Taxes on improvements depress the market by
  what is termed deadweight loss, in opportunities forgone. Although difficult
  to measure, research suggests that the economic drag or productivity forgone
  from these taxes is about 10 percent of GDP. Secondly, any tax on improvements
  can be shifted, partly forward to consumers as higher prices, backwards to
  the suppliers of labor and capital goods. </p>
<p>A third consideration relates to the proportion of real estate value that
  improvements generally represent. Where good data exist, indications are that
  the combined value of improvements in most tax jurisdictions is about half,
  the other element of course is land value. But improvements depreciate, gradually
  becoming lower proportions of total price. A building might represent 2/3 of
  the total parcel value when new but may decline to 1/3 of the value after three
  decades. So the building proportion of property parcels affected by tax shifting
  declines over time while the land value increases. Still, taxing buildings
  is a disincentive to maintaining them in peak condition.</p>
<p>The property tax proportion on the improvement component therefore varies
  depending on its age and condition, to say nothing of the other negative impacts
  it has on the community's or region's total inventory. When all is said and
  done, therefore, not much good can be said for taxing improvements; it discourages
  the highest and best use of sites, distorts economic decisions, creates deadweight
  loss, reduces the inventory of office space and industrial plant, is shifted
  to tenants that are mainly poor people, and is administratively hard. Therefore,
  while one can't say that a cap on improvements is destructive by itself, the
  tax design itself is perverse. </p>
<p>A land value tax is the perfect tax: it conforms to all the textbook principles
  of sound tax theory: neutral to decision making, economically efficient, administratively
  easy, understandable and simple, progressive in distributional impact, and
  stable in revenue yield. And taxing land doesn't, and can't, reduce the supply
  of land. With all those virtues, why is a tax cap on the land component of
  property futile? </p>
<p>The value of land sites does not derive from the &quot;quality of the earth&quot; or
  anything done on particular locations alone. Rather site values come from the
  economic rent that flows through them. Rent is a collective product, a function
  of the economic health of whole neighborhoods and regions, not the result of
  any one site's activity. A titleholder can be idle, and even absent, and his
  parcel might still escalate radically in price on account of others. Because
  rent flows through locations reflecting enterprise activity, it cannot be halted,
  or reduced, or in any way eliminated except by stopping the economy of those
  sites. It should be considered for tax purposes as a constant. Economic regions
  that are in the doldrums have low site rent flowing through them. Regions that
  are bustling with market activity have high site rent. </p>
<p>Because site rent is a flow through parcel locations, and because its volume
  cannot in any way be altered without affecting the economy, that flow can either
  be recaptured in the form of taxes, diverted and skimmed by a practice known
  as &quot;rent-seeking,&quot; or left there to be capitalized in a site's market
  value. Left in place it can actually &quot;gum up the works.&quot; Taxing it
  away increases efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>When the property tax is not collected, or else is capped, limited by a circuitbreaker,
  partially exempted, or altered by any other device, the land rent then goes
  to the market value of sites, and property becomes more expensive. Relieving
  titleholders of their property tax burden simply alters the balance of rent
  flow: less is returned to society, more is capitalized in market price. One
  way or another rent continues to flow as long as markets flourish. One can
  no more stem the flow of rental value than one can stop gravity. There is,
  however, a solution: land value taxation.</p>
