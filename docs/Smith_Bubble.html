<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
To Do About the Real Estate Bubble</span><br>
After the Housing Bubble Bursts, Fix It!<br>
by Jeffery Johnson Smith<br>
President of the Geonomy Society</div>
<br>
What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?<br>
<br>
Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real estate has
gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
however, must soon do something else.<br>
<br>
Recently, a growing number of commentators have predicted that housing
bubble is about to burst. Of course, that is what bubbles do, but when?
As with the rest of the economy and with cyclic systems in general,
when depends on the last time building values peaked then collapsed.<br>
<br>
Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the stratosphere.
Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting more valuable
is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on it or not.
Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not, especially
locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None of that
would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in the
air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bubbles benefit anyone?</span><br>
<br>
Yet owners can cash in only if they take on a second mortgage or sell
out and move on, breaking up the old neighborhood. Plus, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sellers live and work in the same economy
as buyers, who are not so very happy campers. What&#8217;s seemingly good for
landowners is not necessarily good for the economy. As people spend
more on land, something nobody produced, they spend less on output,
things people do produce. As producers get less money spent on their
products, eventually they take the hint and produce less. "Produce
less" is another way of spelling recession.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Plus, more expensive land means
heavier borrowing to buy it. More debt means more inflation and less
stability. When producers cut back, borrowers have a much harder time
paying back their debts. As people go bankrupt, they drag others down
with them. A collapsing house of cards is another way of spelling
depression.</span><br>
<br>
No matter how hard lenders try to stave off the day of reckoning &#8211;
lowering lending rates, easing up on credit requirements, buying more
federal bonds with new money that never existed before, overstocking
banks with cash &#8211; no bubble has ever lasted forever. The only thing all
that superfluous money has ever done has been to pump up that bubble
ever fatter and thinner. Regardless of central banks, land prices have
averaged an 18-year cycle, rising then crashing. And the bubbly part of
that cycle are the final few years.<br>
<br>
After the fall, where is terra firma? Well, the higher they rise, the
steeper they fall. Sometimes the value of locations lose 25% of their
inflated value. Sometimes half. Japan, after it peaked in 1989 when the
grounds of the Royal Palace in Tokyo was worth more than the entire
state of California, has seen three quarters of all that froth blow
away.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get inflated, of
course they would not have to get deflated.</span> While in rhythmic
systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
them. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
deprivation from part of our common natural heritage.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value, government
could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.</span>
To share the recovered land rents, government could replace subsidies
with a dividend paid to citizens, a la Alaska&#8217;s dividend from oil
royalties. Replacing taxes with land dues and replacing subsidies with
rent dividends is geonomics. Once implemented, geonomics changes the
dynamics of the land-price cycle and the whole economy.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To pay the land dues, owners use their
land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Better still, as government recovers
land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much. </span>And when
governments pay dividends instead of subsidize services (especially
corporations who do so little to be served so lavishly), then they need
not borrow so much (corporate welfare is roughly twice the federal
deficit). Banks could not so much flood the economy with cash. What
would speculators use to blow up the price of land? Nothing. They
couldn&#8217;t.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Land would still rise in value. With
every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets.</span>
Rising land values would no longer wrack the nerves but delight the
spirit. With the extra income, one could finally add on that deck or
shrink the workweek &#8211; or both. Alas, some day.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rarely chartered waters</span><br>
<br>
Back in 1989 (when Japan peaked), Bush&#8217;s Economic Advisor, Greg Mankiw
(then merely a Harvard prof), predicted housing prices would implode in
2007 &#8211; a period of 18 years. Herman Kahn, famous for thinking the
unthinkable &#8211; waging a nuclear war &#8211; and for founding Future Studies,
warned investors of the 2000 stock price collapse &#8211; 18 years before it
happened. Another prognasticator using the 18-year land price cycle had
pegged the market&#8217;s debacle a year earlier in 1999, but Samuel Benner
made his guess in1875.<br>
<br>
If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate still has
a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
burst, and 2008 is just as likely.<br>
<br>
Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was steep,
the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we
did.</span><br>
