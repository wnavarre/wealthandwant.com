  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wrong
  Diagnosis Underlies Post's Pessimism on Smart Growth</span>  <br>
  By Walter Rybeck, Sierra Club<br>
  This article ran in <em>The Sentinel</em>, October 15, 2004</p>
  <p align="left"> We would be amused if Martian observers, seeing people with crutches,
    concluded that crutches had crippled these folks. Analysts cited in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington
    Post&#8217;s</span> recent
    series on sprawl are not from Mars, but many confused the crutches
    localities fall back upon as the cause of our region&#8217;s crippling growth
    pattern.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Post </span>writer Peter Whoriskey
    blamed Montgomery and other counties around the District of Columbia
    for pushing residential growth to the Eastern Shore and West Virginia
    by inviting job growth while curtailing home construction. Those
    policies do accelerate sprawl. But they are crutches. Counties use
    these crutches to defend against the severe fiscal burdens of upgrading
    infrastructure to people fleeing the region&#8217;s core. Residents support
    these crutches to keep their housing and tax costs in check.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Post</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> paints a seemingly hopeless picture
    because it fails to recognize the real engines of sprawl &#8212; high land
    values, land speculation, and subsidies for development on greenfield
    sites</span>. Wasteful scattershot development will outsmart Smart
    Growth until officials and voters confront these matters.<br>
    <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">High Land Values.</span> High land
    values stem from </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) regional population growth, <br>
2) public works like roads and schools and <br>
3) special natural features like waterfronts. <br>
</div>
For example, a 1980 Congressional study found that Metro, still
unfinished, had already generated $2 billion in new land values, &#8220;the
biggest share of these new values&#8230;going to people lucky enough to own
land within easy access of Metro stations.&#8221; Neither Metro nor the
taxpayers who financed it recoup the values they generated.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Speculation</span>. Sprawl starts at
the center of the metropolis and radiates outward. Smith owns a vacant
downtown site. If he builds offices or housing, he invites risks and
sizeable property tax increases. He keeps his parcel in minimal use
like a parking lot. Brown, seeing its potential, offers to buy it. Yet
Smith who enjoys rising land values without effort asks a price so high
that Brown&#8217;s venture can&#8217;t fly. Brown approaches owners of other
first-class parcels, meets the same hurdle, and finally buys a cheaper
second-class site. More &#8220;Browns&#8221; do the same.<br>
<br>
Soon Jones and other enterprisers find owners of second- and
third-class sites boosting their asking prices. Owners get away with
this because land hoarding in the core creates an artificial scarcity
of affordable sites. &#8220;Joneses&#8221; are driven farther into the hinterland.
Developers, denied entry by inflated land prices to close-in sites best
suited for their ventures, invade open space. This race to beat
speculators to cheap land fosters<span style="font-weight: bold;">
leapfrog growth</span>.<br>
<br>
How many infill sites in D.C. are withheld by speculation? Some 11,000
vacant lots and 7,000 boarded-up housing units were counted several
years ago.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Subsidized Sprawl.</span> Federal and
state spending on misplaced highways, utilities, schools and the like
subsidize premature urbanization of outlying areas. Tax abatements for
malls lay waste to cornfields and forests and sap the vitality of older
communities.<br>
<br>
Sprawl defenders incorrectly equate the mini-ranch with the American
dream. If affordable, many families prefer compact walkable
neighborhoods with charm, amenities and mixed uses. People pay premiums
to live in the places like Capital Hill, Old Town, Ellicott City and
Georgetown. The popular New Community Design and New Urbanism are not
new; they copy the virtues of old American cities. A 2001 nationwide
survey by the National Association of Realtors found that 
<ul>
  <li>60 percent favored smaller lots,  </li>
  <li>77 percent wanted neighborhoods close to town squares,  </li>
  <li>86 percent wanted trails and bike paths.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Given the barrage of pro-sprawl propaganda, these are remarkable
  findings.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reality Pursues Sprawl.</span> As
  inflated land costs drive middle income families far from choice
  central neighborhoods, their new localities duplicate the police, water
  systems and schools left behind, plus roads to get them back to work.
  High taxes to construct over-extended public facilities spur new home
  seekers to go even farther a field.<br>
  <br>
  The real culprits &#8212; upside-down property tax incentives and
  inappropriate infrastructure investments &#8212; make it profitable for land
  speculators to keep their prime locations in cold storage, to board up
  rental housing, and to block the path of normal growth in appropriate
  city and town centers.<br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sprawl Can Be Halted. </span>The
  challenge is to take the profit out of sprawl so the massive inventory
  of skipped-over prime locations can be put to optimal use.
  Jurisdictions can deflate high land and housing costs by altering
  current taxes that favor land holding rather than land using. Then the
  counties&#8217; crutches, short-term palliatives at best, can be discarded.
  Only then can Smart Growth rather than sprawl become the dominant
  pattern in our region.<br>
