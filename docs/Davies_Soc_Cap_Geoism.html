<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Socialism,
  Capitalism, and Geoism</span></p>
by Lindy Davies</div>
<br>
The word "Socialism" is much used and misused. It was coined around
1830 to indicate any doctrine that tries to rationally organize
economic and social life. The American Heritage Dictionary offers two
definitions: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) "A social system in which the
producers posess both
political power and the means of producing and distributing goods." and
<br>
2) "In Marxist-Leninist theory, the building, under the dictatorship of
the proletariat, of the material base for communism." <br>
</div>
In its most
frequently used sense, socialism is a system of social or governmental
ownership and control of the means of production. Marxist theory
teaches the coming of socialism through class struggle and revolution,
in preparation for the final historical stage of "communism", in which
all private property and other vestiges of capitalist production are
abolished.<br>
<br>
Socialism is usually discussed in opposition to "Capitalism". Normally
that is taken to mean a system in which the factors are privately owned
and economic decisions are made by a market that is free of government
intervention.<br>
<br>
In the hysterical political climate that characterized the cold war,
the meanings of these terms tended to become squashed under the
excessive ideological weight that they carried. Each "ism" became
identified with the diabolical plot of an enemy. Meanwhile, their use
to describe economic policies was by no means clear, as "free-market"
economies developed more and more "socialistic" government programs --
and "socialist" economies granted more "market freedom" to producers.
Eventually the terms came to have about as much descriptive clarity as
the names "Red Sox" and "White Sox".<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But the term "socialism" does mean
something, and it is often
identified with the quest for economic justice. The basic assumption
underlying it is that the market place, under conditions of pure
laissez-faire competition, is incapable of securing to society an
equitable distribution of wealth.</span> Socialists assert that if the
market
is left alone to decide who is to get how much of the world's goods,
the result is a division of society into classes and the emergence of a
struggle between the exploiting class and the enslaved working class.
Competition becomes "cutthroat competition", fostering trusts, cartels
and monopolies. Instead of making earnings proportional to service
rendered, the market place gives the highest rewards to the most
unscrupulous exploiters.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">However, many are proud to rally
behind the banner of "capitalism".
They contend that free competition makes the fullest possible use of
the gifts of nature and human ingenuity. When the admirable equilibrium
of the market is upset by do-gooders trying to secure their idea of
fairness, the result is unemployment, stagnation and corruption.</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Capitalists and socialists may appear
to disagree about everything --
but on one crucial point of political economy their views are uncannily
similar.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Both tend to
lump land and capital under the single heading of
"capital," and many even include money as capital. </span>This
confusion
prevents socialists from seeing the possibility of a beneficial free
market without the element of monopoly. And it prevents capitalists
from seeing the fundamental role of the public sector in a just and
prosperous market economy.<br>
<br>
It may seem odd that both "capitalists" and "socialists" speak of the
justice of their system and the vile in-justice of their opponents'.
(Of course, the emotion behind such discussions is often heightened by
a kind of home-team fervor.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there any
universal standard of justice
upon which economic policy can be based?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The answer lies in clarifying the
question of the rightful basis (if
there is one) of public vs. private ownership. For the thorough-going
free-market capitalist, "public ownership" of anything is anathema: the
community's interests are best served by the unhindered interactions of
self-interested producers and traders.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the poverty, suffering and
environmental destruction that come under such a "private property"
regime cannot be denied. </span>Because of this, the great bulk of
social-policy debate revolves around how much of the efficiency of free
enterprise must be traded for public interference, imposed in the name
of equity. The question of the rightful balance between public and
private control becomes one of expediency and political fashion,
lacking any guiding principle. Indeed, modern "neoclassical economics"
denies that any such principle exists.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For Henry George, however, the
principle was clear. The value of
natural opportunities belongs entirely to the community, and the
production of wealth by labor, using capital, should be entirely
unhindered by the penalty of taxation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For George, the most important
question was not the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">amount </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should be taken by
the
community, but the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">kind </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should rightfully
go to the
community, because it is a value that the community has created.</span></span><br>
<br>
In recent years, this understanding of the distinctive character of
natural opportunity (land) as a factor of production has led to the
coining of a new term: Geoism, indicating a philosophy based on the
rightful understanding of the place of the Earth (Geo-) in economic
life.<br>
<br>
-- Lindy Davies, May 1999<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
Folks Have Been Saying<br>
</span></div>
Brilliant analysis. I'm not surprised folks have little to add! You
might have pointed out that while <span style="font-weight: bold;">Marx</span>'s
first step for creating communism was to confiscate land's rental
value, this was also considered, by they who coined the term, the
primary necessity for establishing "laissez-faire."<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Even Adam Smith, the so-called
"father of capitalism" recommended the land tax.</span> <br>
<br>
These sorts of facts are so numerous, most of both Left and
Right-Wingers have either been shielded from the information or are
intentionally misleading folks.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
Education and media companies, the very institutions one would normally
consider responsible for informing the public of such a scandalous
affair, are owned by land speculators.</span> No wonder the public
believes politics and economics are about labor vs. capital. <br>
<br>
The degree to which control of "the news" determines public perception
is apparent in Serbia right now. This is why so many people there think
their leader is an OK guy. How different is it in the US? Not much, as
the obvious need for such rants as these so thoroughly demonstrates..<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Thanks a bunch, Adam! Your point
about Adam Smith and Karl Marx is fascinating. I'd heard both of those
facts, along the way, but I had never put them together the way you
just did! So perhaps I could say, to our readers here in WebLand, that
there is much more (insight) where that came from, in <a

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">The problem arises with the term
fairness. The individuals point of view is determined by what he or she
deems fair. This is why the conflict between various ideologies can

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Do you think so, Charles? That's
a provocative position. It deserves to be hashed out, I'd say. Why not
stop by at the Economic Justice Discussion Room and post thiese
thoughts? You'll find plenty of thought-provoking viewpoints.<br>
Lindy Davies<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Very good. Similar to my own
views, that<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) there is a distinct ideology based
on land, as opposed to capital vs. labor, and <br>
(2) that ideology includes the concepts of proper land stewardship,
distribution, and cultivation, as a prerequisite for both economic
freedom and social justice, and <br>
(3) special privileges for none, and <br>
(4) community is more than government, and won't function properly if
land is not included.<br>

- Friday, June 04, 1999 at 00:55:04 (EDT)
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">The creation of value for land
(as a natural opportunity) is subjective. Ecomonic constraints like,
proximity to pockets of civilisation (villages/cities) often force most
people to setup shop "where everybody else" stay, and that brings about
a disparity in determining the value of land. Land closer to the city,
though not very fertile, is tilled. And even if we were to use all the
arable land, its not possible to distribute it equally amongst the
society. (By virtue of that fact that all land is not equally fertile).
Questions like, "What about our forest cover?", "What about water
reserviours?" need to be answered. Its agreed that proper utilisation
of land is a key to solving most of our economic problems, but, its
definitely not a panacea. -Regards, Durvesh.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">The views expressed are very
balanced, but how does one go about implementing this policy of Geoism
without causing any upheaval in the current status quo?<br>
Terrence Parris &lt;terryparris@hotmail.com&gt;<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">My goodness, I would think that
"a key to solving most of our economic problems" nearly qualifies as a
panacea, doesn't it? Seriously, though: no Geoist claims that solving
the land problem is the only thing that needs to be done -- but rather
that no other essential reform will have lasting benefit until the land
problem is solved. It bears on every other economic and political
question.<br>
<br>
Terrence -- that's a big question! Henry George said yes, it could
indeed be implemented without disruption, simply by using the existing
tax and assessment system. See here for quite a bit more detail on
George's remedy. One wonders, though, whether today's "democratic"
system is actually up to the task of responding to the people's will.
In any case, the first step os to make people aware that a potential
solution exists!<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Hi Lindy, Your "Third Way" is on
the whole a very good piece. Let me make some suggestions for a
possible future revision (at http://www.henrygeorge.org/rant.htm) . In
order to avoid alienating potential Geo-Libertarians I think that you
might mention: <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) In the rare cases where the
Producers own their
own "natural means of production," that the classically defined systems
of Capitalism and Socialism are one and the same, that they intersect
at a nexus of unusual and infrequent, but eminently possible
conditions. <br>
<br>
2) *Please* point out that under all but the most
unusual condition I identified in 1) above, that what most Capitalist
proponents advertize as "laissez-faire" market conditions really are
*not* completely "laissez-faire" market conditions. Unless the very
unusual case of 1) above is in effect, most so-called Capitalist
systems have a partially hidden entitlement which is imposed by
Government statute, fiscal/tax advantages and police enforcement. This
entitlement allows private transfer subsidies from producers who do not
own their own natural means of production to those who have gained
governement mandated entitlements to the natural means of production.
This type of entitlement is really a form of hidden Fascism by which a
politically favored but technically private elite benefits from
government sanctioned revenue flows from producers to entitled holders
of natural "means of production." <br>
<br>
3) The partially hidden entitlement is the legally brokered system of
unlimited, unconditional land entitlement. This entitlement only
results in legally enforceable transfer subsidies when a de facto
condition of Land Monopoly occurs. The unusual, infrequent condition of
1) identified above is the condition where Land Monopoly does not exist
in the local market. This condition occurs when there is an unsettled
frontier nearby and Land is more plentiful than the Demand for it. This
condition existed in various parts of North America as the Frontier
advanced from the Eastern Seaboard Westward and inward. <br>
<br>
4) Geoism is the nexus of classically defined Capitalism and Socialism;
it is the very unusual subset of possible economic conditions where
Capitalism and Socialism are the same. It is the market which is truly
free of government enforced entitlements, where each and every
individual in a community has the equal right and opportunity to
access, use and hold an equal percapita value of the natural means of
production for independent self support and self shelter. Geoism is the
nexus subset of Capitalism where each and every individual has not only
the right *to be,* but the right to be *somewhere,* meaning the equal
right to independently use the naturally available wealth in a
territory to shelter himself and to produce his own livelihood. This
same Geoism is the nexus subset condition of Socialism where government
does not top-down command and control markets, but is very careful to
avoid granting politically enforced entitlements. Such restraining
vigilance results in "maintaining" a level playing field where the
market is not forcibly tilted in anyones one's favor. Such Socialism
results in a market where no one has a government enforced entitlement
to more than percapita shares of natural means of production. Such
market "maintenance" results in a condition where all producers have
equal rights to use and access naturally available market values
(natural means of production) while enjoying the voluntaryist freedom
of choice in a genuine, unrigged "laissez faire" market. Geoism
provides both the advantages of Capitalism and Socialism without
either's possible negative conditions. <br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Hi Lindy, I forgot to include
this at the end of my previous comment. Where Land Monopoly is not part
of a Laissez Faire market, the Socialist ideal of "Producers owning the
natural means of production" is achieved and conserved. When this
condition holds, the Capitalists supposed goal of private ownership
instead of Government ownership is conserved also. What is eliminated
from this market condition is entitlements and entrenchments enforced
by Political Power. Geoism provides both the advantages of Capitalism
and Socialism without either's possible negative conditions. Chris T.<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">Dear Lindy Davies: Chris Toto
sent
me a copy of his email to you and I just visited this site to read your
piece. I discoverd a few years ago that the best description of my
political outlook and philosophy was Geolibertarianism. This was the
missing link in the debate between socialism and capitalism. The
ownership of land and natural resources is the key. No elite group
shoud have government enforced entitlment to land ownership. Yet every
individual has a right to be and work somewhere in order to enjoy the
fruits of their labor, therefor the only legitimate role for government
acting in behalf of the entire community is to guarantee each
individual the right of access to the natural means of production. Then
and only then can you have a truly free market of labor produced goods.
As you pointed out "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For Henry
George, however, the principle was clear. The value of natural
opportunities belongs entirely to the community, and the production of
wealth by labor, using capital, should be entirely unhindered by the
penalty of taxation. For George, the most important question was not
the amount of wealth that should be taken by the community, but the
kind of wealth that should rightfully go to the community, because it
is a value that the community has created.</span>" Warren<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">"But the poverty, suffering and
environmental destruction that come under such a 'private property'
regime cannot be denied." Certainly it can. One can argue that all of
the poverty and enviromental destruction, at least, are products of the
holding of public property, rather than the reverse, since no truly
free market has ever held sway. Suffering, of course, is quite
subjective, and some who are certainly poor do not percieve themselves
to be "suffering", as some would claim.<br>

Melbourne, FL US - Tuesday, June 29, 1999 at 01:23:16 (EDT)
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">That's very special, Randall. So,
are you actually saying that poverty is a liberal myth?<br>
<br>
A truly free market requires that a proper distinction be made between
private and common property. When private individuals hold fee simple
title to natural opportunities, what happens is market failure.
Libertarians are against monopolies, are they not?<br>

Tacoma, WA USA - Tuesday, June 29, 1999 at 13:50:21 (EDT)
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">"Special"? ;) No, poverty is very
real, but entirely relative. One is poor not because of a particular
lack, but because others have far more. This is not, however, a feature
of capitalism, but of "public" or "common" property. A truly free
market will have no "common" property, except that which no one cares
enough to claim. In any case, the value of opportunity is quite small
compared to the created value which is manufactured from opportunistic
capital and human capital. AFAIK, most libertarians dislike monopolies
because they are an indication of State interference in the
marketplace, not because they are bad in and of themselves.<br>
