<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geoism,
Recession and Control of Monopolies</span><br>
<br>
by Mason Gaffney<br>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">
<div style="text-align: center;">[Ed: This is a fairly
old snippet from the Land-Theory discussion list - <br>
it&#8217;s an Oldie, but a
Goldie]</div>

<br>
Recessions (and depressions) may occur when there are massive shocks to
the system (e.g., the OPEC producers withholding supplies and doubling
and tripling prices of a commodity that could not be readily
substituted for). Recessions may also be prolonged and accelerated by
unwise public policy choices made by people who have no idea of the
consequences of their actions or inactions. Now, in the activist area
where I am working, there is still a strong cry for a Constitutional
amendment to balance the U.S. Federal budget. Some of the economists in
and out of government are saying this would be a disaster, using the
same sort of "if GDP is growing, don't worry be happy" pronouncement
you refer to above. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When GDP is
adjusted for the dollars spent on the criminal justice system and
clean-up costs for preventable environmental disasters, then I might
have some faith in this as a bellwether of wellbeing. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
As for the coming "boom," I simply repeat my observation that there is
no U.S. economy; there are only regional economies competing with one
another as well as with other nations. We have the beginnings of
speculative booms in some places, stability in others, and continuing
recessions in others. People who cannot sell their houses because they
owe more on them than they are worth cannot take their services
elsewhere to seek employment. So much for the mobility of the labour
force. This is one of the unfortunate sides of the American dream of
home ownership; when a lease expires, one simply does not renew.<br>
<br>
Only around 25-30% of households own their own homes. By good fortune,
I just read something that helps resolve the difficulty. It seems that
a great deal of anti-trust legislation from the Progressive Era had
been aimed at monopoly in the flicks, which had started with Thomas A.
Edison, who was as much a patent-litigation bully as he was a pure
inventor. Much of this legislation became unravelled under President -
guess who? - Ronald Reagan, spawn of the "entertainment" industry, and
political voice for same. Vertical integration and media mergers and
monopolization then ran wild. Disney under Eisner, of course, has
played a role in this. Disney as real estate developer throws its heavy
weight around brutally.<br>
<br>
This question arose in connection with Georgist taxation, and what it
would do about Mr. Eisner, and overpaid CEOs like him. The answer, I
think, is that "Georgism" involves more than taxation. It also involves
promoting competitive markets and smiting or breaking up mergers,
monopolies, and restraints of trade, by various means. It was, after
all, part of first the Populist, and later the Progressive Movements. <br>
<br>
"Georgism" may be construed narrowly as a limited fiscal reform. Some
of its votaries present it that way. As such, it is rightly suspected
of being a bit cranky, and too limited. I see it as a broad front
program to limit centralized monopoly control of industry, and promote
free entry and free competition with proper regard for both consumers
and workers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Some free market purists may look askance at anti-trust actions.
Consider, however, that we are dealing with people who hold patents,
which are inherently anticompetitive, especially when used as clubs in
the Edison manner. Consider also we are dealing with corporations,
which are inherently combinations of capital made possible by the
device of limited liability. When government gives an anticompetitive
privilege, it seems fitting that government should limit the resulting
abuses of power.<br>
