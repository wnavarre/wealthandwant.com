<p><a name="I. Revenue alters patterns"></a><b> I. Revenue alters
patterns</b></p>
<p>Taxes -- an aspect of politics, not markets -- motivate misuse of
land.</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The tax on buildings discourages
maintenance and breeds slums</span> (Lynn 1973). After the neighborhood
really goes down hill and the owner has milked every last penny out of
the structure, he just walks away. Thus urban cores decay (Pickard
1966), an entropy that seems inevitable yet is policy-induced<font
 size="-1"><b><i>(1).</i></b></font> </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">In growing areas, custom design
creates more valuable homes, hence more tax liability.</span> To avoid
the penalty, developers can under-build or sacrifice esthetics.
Cookie-cutter developments all in a row reduce built value and property
taxes<font size="-1"><b><i>(2)</i></b></font>. </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing sales raises the cost of
living while taxing income lowers the ability to afford to live.</span>
Like a vise, regressive taxes squeeze out the discretionary income of
the poor who cannot afford the city they may like. Necessity crams them
into the structures that cut corners. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>While taxes are creatures of legislatures, ground rent is a
phenomenon of markets.</b> What's political is what we do with it.
Most of us forget it's there, letting it reward speculation and
sprawl<font size="-1"><b><i>(3)</i></b></font>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="II. Revenue reform"></a> II.
Revenue reform</p>
<p>Residents need not let rent and taxes shoot holes in metro
settlement patterns and price out the building of more pleasing
houses and shops. A jurisdiction could adopt geonomics: replace
taxation with the collection and disbursement of rents. Since we do
not collectively build homes and businesses -- homeowners and
business owners do that --we ought not tax them. We do generate the
value of land, higher where density is higher. Nobody by himself made
density; we all do that. Via our agent, a local government, we could
collect public rent for public betterment.</p>
<p>Planners have a litany of great ideas for rebuilding cities<font
 size="-1"><b><i>(4)</i></b></font> -- set-backs, landscaping,
pedestrian bridges, bridges, etc -- but have no idea of how to pay
for them. One way is to let them pay for themselves. Improving a city
raises its land's value. A tax or fee can collect this ground rent
that can then be used to pay off the earlier investment in
ecologizing the city<font size="-1"><b><i>(5)</i></b></font>.
Indeed, the expected change in land value can be a perfect measure of
some proposed improvement's worthiness. If it can pay its way, throw
it up. If it can't, then back to the drawing board.</p>
<p><a name="III. Develop well"></a><b> III. Develop well</b></p>
<p>No longer inhibited by the property tax (Oates &amp; Schwab 1997)
yet spurred by annual land dues (tax or fee), owners and developers
get busy (Brueckner 1986, Pollack &amp; Shoup 1977). Some Australian
towns that tax land alone average 50 percent more built value per
acre than those that don't (Kenneth Lusht)<font size="-1"><b><i>
(6)</i></b></font>. Since a mix of apartments, stores, offices,
schools, theaters, etc. maximizes site value and the return to
builders, they could find themselves pulling on the same end of the
rope with planners.</p>
<p>Where planners, armed with the sternest growth control measures,
have failed, geonomics can succeed. By making speculation too
expensive, it unplugs the "metro tub", letting the flow of
development return to its natural course, filling in the vacant lots
and abandoned buildings (Bourassa 1990, DiMasi 1987, Neuner et al
1974, Thrall 1987, Vickrey in Wenzer 1999). Clever local governments,
no longer able to tax willy-nilly and thus more dependent upon site
rent, would squeeze streets, now overly wide for traffic, replacing
parking lanes with space for sidewalk cafes beneath rows of shady
trees, alongside lanes for bikes, and thereby drive up site values
<font size="-1"><b><i>(7)</i></b></font>.</p>
<p><a name="IV. Settle well"></a><b> IV. Settle well</b></p>
<p>Might collecting rent work too well? Might it spur edge-to-edge
development, leaving no lot unbuilt? Not if the profit-motive is
still in force. In New York, the city council keeps Manhattan's
Central Park unbuilt not because Greens rule the Big Apple, but
because property values overall are higher with the park than with
luxury condos on the site.</p>
<p>Past a certain point, in-fill, covering the city with
border-to-border buildings, would lower overall site value. Land
value is at its maximum when land use is at its optimum, when mixed
use includes non-use. Some sites raise surrounding values not by
being built upon but by being left pristine: the center for a plaza,
a pari-central site for an open-air market, a ridge for a park,
riparian areas for paths, etc. Owners of such sites would pay more
land dues than they could collect from tenants or buyers. As owners
look to sell, the locality would look to buy
<font size="-1"><b><i>(8)</i></b></font>. Planners could convert the
core into a new commons as popular as a watering hole in the
Serengheti.</p>
<p>To pay their high land dues, owners of large lots that cover
fragile marshes or steep hillsides might want to develop, until they
figure out how much higher would be their surcharges. Requiring an
Ecology Security Deposit and Restoration Insurance from owners would
steer them away from the riskier sites: cliffs and river banks. These
owners might then want to exchange their property margins for local
bonds. The locality could then link the margins up into wildlife
corridors and hiking trails.</p>
<p><a name="V. Align interests"></a><b> V. Align
interests</b></p>
<p>Presently, owners can profit only from developing. Yet not all
sites can be developed. Leaving some parcels blank, optimizing not
maximizing land use, would raise over site values. Were residents to
receive a share of collected ground rent (a la <a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/Alaska.html">Alaska's oil
dividend</a>), then everyone would gain more when site values are
highest. Receiving a dividend partially compensates owners for
non-use of their land.</p>
<p>Since the land dues would eat up the gratis profit in land
speculation, there'd be less wrangling over land use. The biggest US
geonomic city, Pittsburgh, PA, taxes land six times more than
buildings. The city converted its most valuable location, the Golden
Triangle where the three rivers meet, into a park without developer
resistance or an agonizing grassroots effort. Pittsburgh also renewed
itself without federal subsidy and enjoys the lowest housing costs
and crime rate of any major US city.</p>
<p>If a dispute over the use of some site arises, it could be
resolved. Since land dues lower land prices, sites for parks and open
space become affordable. The Nature Conservancy sets aside as much as
it can, but after prices fall, even a local ecology club could raise
enough money to buy land for a preserve. Assigning the land for
non-use, their bond and insurance would be zero.</p>
<p><a name="VI. Design well"></a><b> VI. Design well</b></p>
<p>Architecture, too, could blossom. Frank Lloyd Wright, who'd design
around a tree rather than ax it, advocated de-taxing structures while
re-taxing sites. As cities grow compact and integrated, people can
cure themselves of the car habit. As car use wanes, so might those
garage-prominent, "keep-out-snout" houses, banned by the planners of
Portland (OR).</p>
<p>Were all the acres held in private speculation and in public
procrastination put on the market, the augmented supply would drop
the price. Saving money, buyers and builders could invest more in
esthetics and efficiency. As in land-taxing Pittsburgh, more
residents could afford to own their own homes. As owner-occupants,
people have more motivation to plug heat leaks and conserve energy,
put in south side windows and sun decks, convert a garage to a granny
flat, etc.</p>
<p> <a name="VII. Convert quickly"></a><b>VII. Convert
quickly</b></p>
<p>How long would it take to ecologize cities after shifting its
property tax? While Johannesburg (South African) levied a rate of
only 3 percent on site value, it enjoyed the fastest site-recycling
rate in the world, a little over 20 years. Within a couple decades,
we could have those cities we'd love.</p>
<p>As cities grow more livable and lovable, their site values rise.
The resultant increase in land dues would push owners to continually
convert to highest and best use automatically. In this positive
feedback loop, cities would constantly renew.</p>
<p>While generals and anarchists might not easily find common cause,
planners and markets can, when planners paddle with, not against, the
mighty current of rent. Correcting the market, so that taxes and
rents no longer interfere with the choices of owners and developers,
would attain highest and best use of sites automatically.</p>
