<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Property
Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</span><br>
Herbert J. G. Bab<br>
(1905-1988)<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">[A paper presented to the staff of the
Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, Santa Barbara,
California; excerpted from a manuscript with the title<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> Three Million
Jobs</span>; undated, but probably written during 1964]</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Dr.
Herbert Bab was born in Vienna and received his Ph.D. in Political
Economy at the University of Vienna in 1936. A specialist in interest
theory, he was granted a Research Fellowship to King's College,
Cambridge by the famous economist, J. M. Keynes. At Cambridge began his
special interest in the problems of housing. He came to the U.S. in
1938 and settled in California. He is the author of a number of papers
on various aspects of housing, property taxation and interest theory.</span></div>
<br>
Some time ago Soviet Premier Nikita Krushchev prophesied that Communist
Russia will bury the capitalist system. Yet, it is likely that
historians will come to the opposite conclusion, namely, that the cold
war has saved the American economy from another Great Depression, if
not from collapse.<br>
<br>
We have lived in a defense economy for almost 20 years and most of us
take it for granted that it will continue indefinitely. Yet it is
becoming more and more obvious that it will not last forever. Moreover,
even the tremendous defense outlays have not secured full employment
and have not allowed our economy to grow fast enough. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Under the impact of spectacular advances in
technology the actual level of employment and production falls short of
the full use of our manpower and industrial capacity.</span><br>
<br>
And this gap is widening. According to Leo Keyserling it rose from $1.5
billions in 1953 to a seasonally adjusted figure of $76 billions in the
3rd quarter of 1963.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In view of this it would be difficult
to contend that we have solved the twin problems of full employment and
economic growth. The truth is that we have lived all these postwar
years on borrowed time.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">What have these
considerations to do with property taxation? The purpose of my talk is
to show that the relation of property taxation to unemployment and lack
of economic growth is that of cause to effect.</span> I shall try to
explain why I believe that property taxation is one of the two chief
villains in the drama we are witnessing today in these United States.
The other villain is the monetary policy pursued by the government,
which has increased the cost of borrowing to a point where it stifles
the growth of the economy. In this context however I shall be concerned
only with property taxation.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<div style="text-align: right;"><big style="font-style: italic;">"Supported
by a defense outlay of between $45 to 50 billions the U.S.
economy has been fairly prosperous in these last years. Anybody who
would have advocated a public works program of that size for peaceful
purposes would have been branded as fiscally irresponsible. And bankers
and businessmen alike would have warned us that such a program must
necessarily lead to a disastrous inflation and would undermine the
stability of the dollar."</big><br>
</div>
</div>
Two schools of thought have emerged as to the merits or defects of
property taxation: 
<ul>
  <li>one school condemns the American system of property taxation in
every conceivable way.  </li>
  <li>The other school underscores the advantages of taxing land and
untaxing improvements.</li>
</ul>
Professor Harold Groves in his book <span style="font-style: italic;">Financing
Government</span> stated that "it has been said that the general
property tax has only two faults: first it is wrong in theory and
second it does not work in practice. Others have said, that the
administrative defects of the tax somewhat compensate for its
conceptual shortcomings."<br>
<br>
Professor Seligman stated "that the general property taxes as actually
administered are beyond doubt one of the worst taxes in the civilized
world." John Maynard Keynes in a letter written to me in 1941 said
"that in this country we may have to consider seriously after the war
the whole question of the part played by local rates and local
taxation. No one defends the existing system, but it is not easy to
find an alternative."<br>
<br>
The other school of thought emphasizes the justification for and the
great advantages of taxing land.<br>
<br>
Ricardo believed that ground rents and the value of land have a
tendency to rise continuously and that this benefits solely the
landowners. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The progress of
industrialization and urbanization in the
second half of the 19th century resulted in a rapid increase in the
value of urban land and the owners of such land reaped tremendous
profits. This led John Stuart Mill to observe, that "Only the
landowners grow richer, as it were in their sleep without working,
risking and economizing". He called for the taxation of land in order
to recapture the unearned increment accruing to the land owners.</span><br>
<br>
The apostle of land taxation is Henry George. In his famous book <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span></a> he develops
his single tax theory. He tries to show that poverty and unemployment
and other evils are caused by the land monopolists. Henry George's
theory is similar to that developed by John Stuart Mill. Land values
are based on ground rents which are created by the community and not by
the land owners. Therefore the community is justified in recapturing
these rents by a single tax on land.<br>
<br>
Land taxation has found widespread acceptance in many countries
especially in France, Germany, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand and in
certain parts of Canada. It has made no headway in the U.S. except in
Pennsylvania, where the cities of Pittsburgh and Scranton introduced in
1913 a graded tax plan and in Hawaii where a similar tax plan was
adopted in 1963.<br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If John Stuart Mill or Henry
George would be alive today, they would be disappointed that the
taxation of the unearned increment in land values has not made more
progress.</span> They would be surprised that the rise in urban land
values has not been as steep as they had expected. Yet the universal
use of automobiles has in an unforeseeable way multiplied the land
available for residential use. It has made possible the exodus of a
large part of the middle class out of our towns into suburban areas.
Thus the invention of the automobile has upset the dire predictions and
expectations of the economists who advocated the taxation of land.<br>
<br>
However, there is increasing evidence that the advantages which we have
gained by the universal use of the automobile are coming to an end.
Suburban areas within the range of the automobile are rapidly being
built up. <span style="font-weight: bold;">There is a definite limit
to the distance a person is willing to travel or the time he is willing
to spend to reach the place of his work. Moreover, the use of the
automobile is more and more hampered by traffic congestion and parking
problems. Thus the further expansion of suburban areas is likely to
slow down and the upward pressure on land values in the central areas
of our cities is likely to increase.</span><br>
<br>
Three criteria are generally used to judge the merits of a tax. 
<ul>
  <li>First, it must be satisfactory as a revenue producer,  </li>
  <li>second it must be equitable and  </li>
  <li>third its economic effects should not collide with the public
interest.  </li>
</ul>
<p>For instance if full employment and economic growth are regarded as
  desirable, the question to be examined is what effects will this tax
  have on achieving these objectives?<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">The shortcomings of property taxes as
  revenue producers have been obvious for a long time and are widely known</span>.
  The main difficulty is that revenues from property taxation do not keep
  pace with the ever-increasing requirements of local governments. Every
  county, every city official and every school administrator will
  testify, that there are not enough funds available to meet the
  requirements of local governments.<br>
  <br>
  The inability of local government to raise enough revenues from
  property taxation has forced them to borrow at an ever-increasing rate.
  The debts of local governments have increased from about $16 billions
  in 1947 to over $61 billions in 1963, an increase of about 382%. During
  the same period private debt increased by 279% and federal debt by only
  26%.<br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">To satisfy the second criterion, a tax
  must be equitable. </span>It must be either based on the ability to
  pay principle or on the benefit principle. The Federal income tax for
  instance is based on the ability to pay principle. Gasoline taxes used
  exclusively for the construction of roads are benefit taxes. The
  property tax cannot be justified by either of these principles. The
  ownership of property is not a yardstick of ability to pay, though this
  was probably true before the industrial revolution. In that age land
  was the main, if not the only, form of wealth and intangible forms of
  wealth did not exist. As to the benefit principle most of the services
  rendered by local governments benefit the community as a whole rather
  than property owners. This is especially true of schools, police
  protection, welfare expenses and many others.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFF66">
  <tr>
    <td>But it is fair to point out that property owners benefit from each of
      these because they can charge their tenants a higher rent as a result of
      the quality of these services, and can ask a higher price from a buyer
      when they go to sell. Asking the tenant to pay for these services through
      other taxes and simultaneously to pay land rent to the landlord seems more
      than a bit unjust.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">An analysis of the social and economic
    effects of a particular tax system would indicate the third criterion.</span><br>
    <br>
    When analysing property taxes we shall distinguish between that part of
    the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
    assessed on land.    <br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: right;"><big><span
 style="font-style: italic;">"A
survey made by the editors of Fortune found that during the 1950's the
population in metropolitan areas increased by about 400,000 persons
annually. About 250,000 housing units were built yearly in these areas,
but almost the same number were lost by demolition, condemnation or
conversion into industrial use. Thus the housing shortage increased by
about 400,000 persons each year. The editors of Fortune concluded that
the battle against slums will be decided by the simple arithmetic of
new buildings versus immigration to the cities." </span></big><br>
</div>
<br>
That part of the tax that is assessed on buildings penalizes everybody
who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
residential, commercial or industrial property. The most serious
incidence of property taxes is on new housing. When rental property or
houses are newly constructed these taxes add 15 to 20% to the annual
cost depending on assessment practices and tax rates.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"In 1962 property taxes on new F.H.A.
insured houses averaged $14.30
per month, or $171.60 per year, excluding that part of the tax that was
assessed on the land. Assuming that a family spends 20% of its income
on housing, the income of a family must increase by $858 per year in
order to afford the purchase of a home. In this way many families in
the lower income group are priced, or taxed, out of the market. And
residential construction, a mainstay of our economy, is discouraged."</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"In 1963 HOUSING STARTS reached a level
of 1.6 million units,
representing a value of about $20 billions. Yet very few houses were
built in the central areas of our cities and a large part of these
houses were built for families in the middle or upper income group. Of
these single-family homes, only 15% were sold for less than $12,500.
Another 15% sold for between $12,500 and $15,000. Thus 70% of these
homes cost $15,000 or more. This is so because under our income tax
laws property taxes and interest charges are deductible items. A person
in the 75% bracket pays only 25% of these costs and a person in the 50%
bracket pays only half the property taxes and half the interest
charges."</div>
<br>
The steep increase in the level of rentals represents a true and
accurate yardstick of our housing shortage. During the period 1950 to
1961
<ul>
  <li>the average rental rose from $71.13 per month to $186.79 or by
160%.  </li>
  <li>During the same period median urban family income rose from
$3,497 to $5,924 or by only 69%.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Construction costs per square foot rose
from $8.68 in 1950 to $11.32 in 1961 or by only 30.4%.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The ever widening gap between
the level of rentals and the urban family income constitutes a rental
squeeze, which has brought untold misery and hardship to families in
the lower income group, especially to those belonging to minority
groups. The rental squeeze has also aggravated overcrowding and slum
conditions.</span><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">In the
press, on the radio and on television we are often warned about the
threat of inflation. Hardly ever are we told, that the increase in the
cost of living is to a large extent due to the increase in housing
costs brought about by the housing shortage.</span> The inflationary
effects of property taxation are reinforced by the fact that property
taxes themselves are included in the cost of living index and that
property tax rates have the tendency to rise.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To the
extent that property taxes discourage residential construction and the
improvement and modernization of homes they create unemployment.</span>
The housing construction industry employed about 2,200,000 people in
1962, that is about 1.4 persons per housing unit. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Any change in the direction of
home building employment is multiplied 2.57 times. </span>Thus an
increase in housing starts by 50% would give employment to 2.8 million
persons. An increase by about 66.6% or by 2/3 would create about 3.6
million jobs. These figures do not take into consideration the
investment in public utilities, streets, schools etc., that would be
required to service these additional housing units.<br>
<br>
Under our property tax system wealthy communities with expensive homes
or with heavy concentration of industry will have a large tax basis and
low tax rates. Schools will be good and public services will be
adequate. Yet in a poor community the tax base will be much smaller,
tax rates will be much higher and still it will be found impossible to
provide for good schools and adequate public services.<br>
<br>
In a pamphlet entitled <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Paying for better
schools</span> the Committee for Economic Development came to the
conclusion that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"where a
child happens to live is likely to be important in determining the
quality of his education. In some areas children are taught by meagerly
qualified teachers in substandard schools with inadequate equipment.
The school session is shorter and the school leaving age is lower than
the national average."</span><br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A defect
of our property tax system that is seldom mentioned is that it puts a
premium on obsolescence and penalizes new housing. </span>This is so
because property taxes are <span style="font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>
taxes. Every piece of real estate except land is subject to
depreciation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Thus the owners
of old and obsolete real estate will pay little in taxes, while newly
constructed buildings will bear the brunt of the tax.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
This characteristic of the property tax is obscured by the rising
trends of land values, which in many cases offset the loss in value of
the improvement. Increases in tax rates and differences in assessment
procedures and practices further hide the fact that ad valorem taxes
favor obsolete real property.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Let us now turn to that part of the
tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
land values.</span><br>
<br>
Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
value of the land by the same percentage.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px; font-style: italic; text-align: right;">
  <p><big>"Sir
  Winston
  Churchill has been most of his life <br>
  an advocate of land taxation. <br>
  </big><big>He
    stated on one occasion that <br>
    'Land monopoly is not the only monopoly,
    but ... <br>
    it is the mother of all other forms of monopoly' ". </big></p>
  </div>
<big></big>For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
its proper use.</span><br>
<br>
A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it unprofitable to
hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
are the only genuine incentive taxes.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Inflated land values must necessarily
increase the cost of new homes, the cost of home-ownership and rentals.</span>
It discourages residential construction, prices many families out of
the housing market and aggravates the housing shortage.<br>
<br>
The average price of the site of F.H.A. insured newly built one family
homes increased from $1,035 in 1950 to $2,715 in 1962. The site-value
to building value ratio increased from 12% to 17-1/2% during the same
period.<br>
<br>
Homeowners who bought their homes some time in the past can reap large
profits when selling them. Old homes should sell at a lower price,
because of the depreciation of the building, but in most cases the
depreciation of the building is more than offset by the increased value
of the lot. This increased value forces buyers to increase their down
payments or to increase their loan are higher, many families are priced
out of the market.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><big style="font-style: italic;">"The
tremendous rise in the expenditures of local governments confirms the
excessive cost of the exodus into the suburbs. Expenditures of local
governments increased from $9.1 billions in 1946 to $30.6 billions in
1957 or by 21.5 billions. A considerable part of this increase -- maybe
one-third or more -- could have been avoided by a t</big><big
 style="font-style: italic;">ax system that would insure, not only a
more rational use of land, but also sound economy in our urban
affairs." <br>
</big></div>
<br>
We have discussed the sharp increase in the level of rents that has
taken place during these last years. These increases reflect the steep
rise in land values that have taken place in almost all sections of our
cities. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
tax assessed on the improvements has discouraged the construction of
more and better housing. At the same time, the tax assessed on land has
been too low to induce owners to sell, improve, or replace their rental
properties.</span><br>
<br>
Property taxes shape the pattern of our cities. 
<ul>
  <li>If taxes on improvements are low or non-existing and taxes on
land are high, the cities are bound to grow vertically and at a fast
rate.  </li>
  <li>If taxes on improvements are high and taxes on land are low, our
cities will spread over larger and larger areas. They will become
metropolitan areas and they will grow at a much slower rate.</li>
</ul>
Relatively low taxes on land and high taxes on improvements will
discourage the owners of vacant lots or underdeveloped land, such as
that used for parking lots, gas stations, hamburger stands, etc., from
improving their land. It will encourage them to keep the land out of
use and to sell later at a profit. This will create an artificial
shortage of land, which in turn will lead to urban blight and
irregular, leapfrog city growth.<br>
<br>
This urban sprawl makes our cities look ugly, but it has many
disadvantages besides: 
<ul>
  <li>It gobbles up a tremendous amount of farm land;  </li>
  <li>the farmers have to give up their land before it is really
needed;  </li>
  <li>the building developer has to go far out to find available land;  </li>
  <li>the prospective home-owner has to travel farther;  </li>
  <li>traffic on congested roads will increase and  </li>
  <li>new roads and schools will have to be built.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It is generally believed that zoning
laws are a very effective tool to control the growth of our cities.
Zoning laws determine the best possible use of urban land. Yet nobody
can be forced to improve his land and to build unless there is an
incentive. This can be achieved by taxing land at a rate that will make
it unprofitable to hold it without improving it.</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The city planner needs land taxation just as he needs zoning laws. With
both these tools the orderly growth of our cities will be assured, but
-- as experience has shown -- without land taxation rational and
efficient land usage becomes impossible.<br>
<br>
Professor Galbraith and others have expressed concern about the poverty
of the public sector of our economy as compared to the affluence of the
private sector. The appearance of our cities, the inadequate financial
support we give our schools and poor public services seem to support
this view. Yet, I can not agree with Professor Galbraith's conclusion
that we need more public revenues to meet these needs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It seems to me that the spreading out of
our cities over wider and wider metropolitan areas has immeasurably
increased the financial burden of local governments. In other words,
wasteful use of land caused by our property tax system is the real
reason of the poverty of the public sector.</span><br>
<br>
It stands to reason that the spreading out of our cities into wider and
wider metropolitan areas is a very costly venture. For instance it was
found that in the New York region suburbs have to make capital outlays
of $68 per capita for new housing, while only $44 was required for new
housing in the central cities and only $38 in the non-metropolitan
area. Another survey found that it costs $80 per household to provide
water in the outlying suburbs against $30 in the city.<br>
<br>
The administration of the property tax leaves very much to be desired.
Assessment procedures and practices are in many cases erroneous,
arbitrary and widely variant. So is the ratio of assessed value to full
market or cash value. In many states no public records are available
indicating assessed values and the taxpayer has no of knowing what his
tax bill will be.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The most serious defect in the
administration of property taxation is the continuous, widespread and
enormous underassessment of land. A survey made recently found that in
9 California counties, vacant lots and acreage were assessed at only
5.3% of the cash value, while residential property was assessed at
19.3% of its value. The illegal underassessment of land deprives local
governments of millions of dollars of revenues. Moreover, it further
aggravates the serious defects of property taxation.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">We have analyzed the effects of
property taxation on improvements as distinguished from those caused by
the incidence of these taxes on land. </span><ul>
  <li>We have found that a high and burdensome tax rate on improvements
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents.  </li>
  <li>Yet a low tax rate on land will have similar if not identical
effects: it will lead to a rise in urban land values, which in turn
will discourage residential construction, create unemployment, penalize
home-ownership, aggravate the housing shortage and force up rents.  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The paradox of property taxation
consists in the fact that lower rates on improvements produce the same
results as higher rates on land and conversely higher rates on
improvements produce the same results as lower rates on land.</span><br>
<br>
The reform of our property tax system must be regarded as one of the
most urgent and important task we face today. It cannot be any further
postponed without risking grave consequences. Yet this reform will
prove to be a formidable task. There is very little understanding of
the problems by the public. Moreover, there exists a great number of
local governments levying property taxes and it is almost impossible to
coordinate and direct the policy of over 80,000 local governments
towards the same goals or objectives -- except by action of State or
Federal government. The States will have to find the permanent long
term solution of the problems of property taxation while the Federal
government will have to come forward with measures that will provide
immediate relief.<br>
<br>
There can be little doubt that the shifting of the tax burden from
improvements to the land is the appropriate remedy. I shall try to
outline a few ground rules for the procedure which should be followed:
<ul>
  <li>The shifting of the tax burden should be achieved gradually over
a period of years.</li>
  <li>A predetermined yearly reduction in property tax rates on
improvements should be enacted by each State and should be imposed on
all local governments without exception. At the same time the tax rate
on urban land should be increased to make up for the loss in revenues.</li>
  <li>A State agency or State Tax commission should, be set up to
supervise and administer the shifting of the tax burden with the
following functions:</li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>To break up the property tax into its constituent parts: taxes on
urban improvements, urban land, farm land and property other than real
estate.</li>
  <li>To enforce the yearly reduction in tax rates on urban
improvements and to see to it that taxes on urban land are raised to
make up for the loss in revenues.</li>
  <li>To supervise assessment procedures and practices and enforce the
equal assessment of all classes of property.</li>
  <li>To enforce the pooling of revenue derived from school taxes and
to equalize school standards on a state-wide basis.</li>
  <li>To examine the merits and effects of the taxes assessed on
tangible and intangible property other than real estate and to
recommend the retention or discontinuation of these taxes.</li>
  <li>To consider the merits of granting immediate tax relief on the
first $3,000 of all newly constructed housing in order to stimulate the
improvements and modernization of homes.</li>
</ul>
This long-range program which I have outlined will have to be
supplemented by a Federal program. The States will require many years
to develop and enact a program of property tax reform, yet immediate
relief is badly needed to encourage residential construction, create
employment, lessen the housing shortage and arrest a further rise in
rents. This relief can only come from the Federal Government.<br>
<br>
As has been mentioned before, <span style="font-style: italic;">ad
valorem</span> taxes by their very nature put a premium on
obsolescence. It is in the power of the Federal Government to convert
the ad valorem tax into an incentive tax, a tax on obsolescence.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instead of taxing
improvements at cost when they are new and at cost less depreciation
when they are old, the Federal Government could change the tax so that
new buildings are not taxed and old buildings are more heavily taxed
than at present. This can be done by establishing age brackets and by
taxing all improvements according to their age.</span><ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The first step would be to
exempt all new residential construction from property taxation for a
period of 10 years. </span>This would represent the first bracket of
the graduated tax. It could be administered in a very simple way. Our
income tax laws allow property taxes as a deductible item. Property tax
relief would be made effective by allowing property tax payments to be
deductible from a taxpayer's tax liability and recognize them as a part
of income tax payments. </li>
  <li>A second bracket could be established for housing when it becomes
10 years old and until it reaches 20 years by granting a tax exemption
of 50% in the manner described before. </li>
  <li>The third tax bracket would consist of all housing over 20 years
old. No property tax relief would be granted to this age group. </li>
  <li>Finally a fourth bracket could be established for obsolete rental
property. When a building becomes older, it becomes more and more
difficult to correlate age and obsolescence. Thus this tax should only
be assessed on buildings declared substandard by the F.H.A. Moreover,
instead of relying on assessed values, this tax should be based on
rentals.</li>
</ul>
A precondition for establishing this fourth bracket is a high and
increasing vacancy factor. As long as the vacancy factor is low, there
is a danger that some landlords may try to increase rents and to shift
the tax to the tenants. Yet, when vacancies are increasing, the
landlord will have to absorb this tax. It will encourage the landlord
to sell his property or to pull it down and construct a new building.<br>
<br>
I have tried to show the relation between property taxation and
residential construction, the housing shortage, the steady increase in
rents, the inequality in school standards, inflated land values, urban
blight and sprawl and finally the financial burden of local
governments. I can not help but agree with the findings of a committee
of the California State Legislature stating "that the problem of
financing local government is the major domestic problem facing our
country today."<br>
