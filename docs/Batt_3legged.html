<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Fallacy of the "Three-Legged Stool" Metaphor</span><br>
H. William Batt, Ph.D., Central Research Group, Inc., Albany, NY<br>
September, 2004</div>
<br>
Tax experts, especially at the state level, ply
their trade by invoking one metaphor above all others: the three-legged
stool.<small style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><font size="-1">1</font></span></small>&nbsp; It rests on the
claim that a sound and successful tax regime for any government needs
to rely on a three tax bases: income, property and sales.&nbsp; This is
repeated so often that it passes today without much examination.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">1 There is no difficulty
      in
citing such references, in textbooks or online.&nbsp; A quick search of
the web turns up the following as illustrations:&nbsp; "Fiscal Crisis
in State Budgets: Are Taxes in Western States 'Wobbly?'", WRDC Public
Policy Information Brief, No. 2, July, 2003; "Theory and Reality:
Arizona's Tax Structure," by Marshall J. Vest, Eller College of
Business, University of Arizona, n.d.; "Ranking Maine's Business
Climate," by Charles Lawton and Frank O'Hara, Maine Center for Economic
Policy, July, 2004; "Report" of the (Ohio) Committee to Study State and
Local Taxes, March, 2003; "Comments from the Utah Education Association
on State Tax Policy, n.d.; "[State of] Washington has the most unfair
tax system" by Polly Keary, in Real Change, 4/29/04; and "Look behind
the rhetoric of tax reform," by Andy Brack, [South Carolina] Statehouse
Report, Dec. 7, 2003</font></small><br>
</div>
There seem to be three arguments for this:
<ol>
  <li>that taxes should be drawn from as wide an array of sources as
possible so as not to overburden any one base or sector.</li>
  <li>that the spread of tax burdens over a number of bases will ensure
greater stability and reliability.</li>
  <li>that reliance upon a wider number of revenue streams minimizes
the downside consequences which all taxes impose on the economy. </li>
</ol>
It is even claimed that revenue streams should rely
on each such base in roughly equal proportions, lest structural
imbalances will otherwise eventuate that jeopardize public support of
government.&nbsp; There are of course exceptions.&nbsp; States that
have rich mineral wealth have the luxury of imposing taxes that relieve
them of the need to rely equally on the "big three."&nbsp; So also for
states that have a rich tourist industry or that can rely heavily on
gambling revenue.&nbsp; But a state is open to the charge that its
revenue structure is unbalanced, unfair, or worse unless such special
circumstances warrant.<br>
<br>
Such wisdom is found most frequently in
the literature of various tax study commissions periodically
constituted over the past thirty years.&nbsp; Many of the staff
directors of these bodies have circulated from state to state as
traveling emissaries, and it is not surprising therefore that their
official reports often bear a striking resemblance to one another.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">2&nbsp;</font></span></small>
Typically they address matters such as the extent to which various
taxes conform to the venerable principles of sound tax theory
(discussed further below), their competitiveness with other political
jurisdictions, and the balance of revenue streams.&nbsp; <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">2 There are several studies
      of
the work and value of tax study commissions, easily available
online.&nbsp; One such is by Therese McGuire, "Toward State Tax Reform:
Lessons from State Tax Studies," Prepared for the Finance Project,
November, 1995, at www.financeproject.org/toward.html.&nbsp; Some
states that have enlisted such projects are enumerated in that paper,
but far from all of them.&nbsp; </font></small></div>
<br>
The Montana Committee study<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">3</font></span></small>,
chosen here simply as a typical illustration, makes special effort to
argue that "elements of a high quality revenue system are complementary
rather than contradictory.&nbsp; Taxes should complement each other so
they provide a way to have all economic activity and wealth contribute
proportionally to supporting government services.&nbsp; Taxes should
not be just a number of different methods to generate revenue from the
same economic activity or wealth; thus taxing some segments of society
very heavily and others sparsely."<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">3 "Universal Guiding Principles
of Taxation," Prepared for the Tax Reform Committee, Created by HB461,
2003 Legislative Session, Report issued August, 2003, and available at
www.discoveringmontana.com/revenue/content/5foryourreference/studycommittees/taxreform/guiding
principlesoftaxation.doc. </font></small></div>
<br>
It goes on to argue that "a high quality state
revenue system reflects the limitations and financial responsibilities
that state government places upon local governments.&nbsp; State policy
makers should be explicitly aware of the costs that state mandates
impose on local governments, and local governments should have the
authority to raise sufficient revenues to meet these obligations.&nbsp;
If local governments lack the revenue bases necessary to provide
services mandated by state government, state policy makers should
consider statewide solutions to avoid extreme inequities.&nbsp; As an
example, in some instances, state government could consider subsidizing
local governments to reduce local tax burdens or increase service
levels for governments that lack enough taxing capacity to meet some
state standard of services.&nbsp; This approach however, should be
weighed against the principle of local autonomy. In which local voters
decide which services they want to receive and raise the money to pay
for them."<br>
<br>
The Montana study reflects the conventional wisdom
that "a high quality revenue system relies on a diverse and broad based
range of sources.&nbsp; One of the goals of a quality revenue system is
economic neutrality to prevent the distortion of individual and
business behavior.&nbsp; If reliance is divided among numerous sources
and their bases are broad, rates can be made low in order to minimize
the impact on behavior.&nbsp; A broad base itself helps meet the goal
of diversification since it spreads the burden of the tax among more
players than a narrow base does.&nbsp; And the low rates that broad
bases make possible can improve a state's competitive position relative
to other states.&nbsp; When possible, we should try to balance our tax
systems through reliance on the three-legged stool of income, sales,
and property taxes in roughly equal proportions, with excise, business,
gaming, and severance taxes, and user charges playing an important
supplementary role.&nbsp; In any instance, every attempt should be made
to avoid excessive reliance on any single revenue source."<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The power with
which the three-legged stool analogy has underpinned tax policy is in
fact rather disconcerting, because a close examination of its premises
shows that they are very questionable.&nbsp;</span> These benchmark
measures of a tax regime are scrutinized here in order to cast doubt on
the claims so often made on their behalf.<br>
<br>
Taking first the argument that spreading the tax
burden over as wide a base of sources as possible, it is best to begin
by noting that revenue streams can be drawn from only three elements of
the economy:&nbsp;<ul>
  <li>Land,  </li>
  <li>Labor, and/or  </li>
  <li>Capital.&nbsp;  </li>
</ul>
Standard textbooks for Economics 101 typically start with recognition
of these factors, even if they usually give insufficient attention to
Land as a component.&nbsp; Classical economics, culminating
particularly in the tradition of <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/About_HG.html">Henry
George</a>, includes in the idea of
Land any and all components of value not created by human hands or
minds.&nbsp; It therefore means not just locational sites on the
earth's surface that might be bought and sold as real estate, but other
elements of so-called "natural capital" as well:&nbsp;<ul>
  <li>the electromagnetic spectrum,  </li>
  <li>air,  </li>
  <li>water,  </li>
  <li>fish in the ocean,  </li>
  <li>mineral wealth,  </li>
  <li>airport time slots, and so on.&nbsp;  </li>
</ul>
Those elements have a market price, and can be &#8212; indeed are &#8212; often
subject to taxation.&nbsp; It is important to note, however, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">taxes on such Land are capitalized in the
market value of their worth; they cannot be passed forward or backward
because their supply is essentially inelastic.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This
is
important, as will be noted below, because imposing such taxes incurs
no excess burden on their use or upon the general economy.</span>&nbsp;
Taxing such bases is totally neutral and completely efficient.&nbsp;
Indeed, <span style="font-weight: bold;">it is the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">failure </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">to tax Land as stated that leads to
economic distortions and causes an economy to function at a sub-optimal
level.</span>&nbsp; Land, whatever its form, has a market value only to
the extent that a human presence exists to make use of it, and it
acquires that value due to the accretion of economic rent, the return
that comes to rest on such factors. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxes on
Labor and Capital, in contrast, are always shifted.&nbsp;</span>
Studies of so-called tax incidence seldom trace the flow of tax burdens
beyond the first or second step of the shift.&nbsp; Textbooks and
research studies will note that particular burdens &#8212; for instance, a
tax on the sale of goods &#8212; will be partly borne by the vendor and
partly also by the consumer.&nbsp; The vendor in turn sees that tax
incorporated into the price he pays for the product at the wholesale
level; the consumer sees his burden reflected in the relative cost of
living of his tax jurisdiction &#8212; which in turn affects the price of
his home and his wages.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
shift in taxes, as economic theory makes clear, are ultimately
converted to rent, and that rent, as capitalized in land prices, is its
final resting place.&nbsp;</span> It is a truism of classical economics
as carried through in the present day tradition of Georgist economics
that <span style="font-weight: bold;">all taxes come out of rent &#8212; an
adage that has come to be abbreviated as <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/themes/ATCOR.html">ATCOR</a>.<small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic;"><font size="-1">4</font> </span></small></small></span><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">4 See Mason Gaffney, "The
Philosophy of Public Finance," especially, pp. 188-192, in Fred
Harrison (ed.), The Losses of Nations: Deadweight Politics versus
Public Rent Dividends. London: Othila Press, 1988.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What this insight
means is that all taxes not first imposed on Land and collected from
the rent that rests thereon are instead passed through the economy from
one party to another until they ultimately come to rest on Land, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">thereby
increasing the price of real estate</span></span>.&nbsp; The passing
along of tax burdens not only creates distortions in economic
transactions; it also constitutes an excess burden and an inefficiency
that handicaps economic performance.&nbsp;<ul>
  <li>Taxing any form of Capital makes it more expensive and leads to
less saving and investment;  </li>
  <li>taxing Labor, in the same way, depresses wages and discourages
enterprise.&nbsp;  </li>
</ul>
Contemporary economists and conventional tax theorists well recognize
that taxing Labor and Capital is detrimental to economic vitality &#8212; politicians
thrive on repeating this <span style="font-style: italic;">ad
nauseam</span>.&nbsp; Currently the Republican party candidates seem
best able to exploit resentment about the negative impact of
taxes.&nbsp; But they are not alone in failing to appreciate the nature
of tax shifting.&nbsp; What all fail to realize is that there are
notable exceptions to the rule that taxes are oppressive: any tax
imposed on an inelastic base &#8212; that is, any form of Land &#8212; constitutes
no distortion or excess burden whatsoever.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Far from
spreading the burden of distribution over a wide array of&nbsp; tax
bases, the ideal tax, then, should be imposed solely on those factors
of production that form an inelastic base, i.e., that constitute forms
of Land &#8212; whether they be locational sites, natural resources, the
spectrum, time slots, or others as they may arise in the future.&nbsp;</span>
Land, in any of its forms, is totally inelastic.&nbsp; Will Rogers in
his pithy way said it well, "Buy land.&nbsp; They ain't making any more
of the stuff."&nbsp; Mark Twain said it too.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A second claim
among advocates of spreading tax burdens over the "big three" bases
(and sometimes more if possible) is that it insures greater reliability
and stability of the revenue streams supportive of government
services.&nbsp;</span> To be sure not all government services require
stable budgets &#8212; motor vehicle licensure varies with the state of the
economy as do the needs of social welfare programs and some offices
related to capital investment.&nbsp; But most programs do need to rely
on predictable and stable financial support, particularly education,
health, and public safety.&nbsp; With revenue streams based on formulas
that vacillate from year to year, it becomes difficult to provide for
public needs, and the continual political struggle over fiscal designs
is frequently costly.<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Economic cycles are
accepted as a given in both government and business circles.&nbsp; But
there is compelling evidence that such cycles have their roots in the
tendency for elements of the financial community to speculate in real
estate, fostering bubbles in their market prices that ultimately must
be reconciled with the real demand.<small style="font-style: italic;"><font size="-1">5</font></small>&nbsp;</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Because the market price of Land
is in good part a function of the settling of rent, the recapture of
that rent in the form of taxation can both stabilize those markets and
remove the cause of those periodic cycles.</span>&nbsp; By collecting
only a miniscule element of Land rent, and instead collecting revenue
from Labor and Capital, economic cycles are amplified and exacerbated,
to say nothing of their effect on productivity.&nbsp; Evidence of the
stabilizing effect of taxes on Land in the form of economic rent
collection is shown best by the fact that those nations and states that
rely most heavily on Land taxation are least subject to cyclical
tendencies and intermittent recessions.<small><span

Encyclopedia by Microsoft, 1993</span>; "Principles of Taxation, in
Light of Modern Developments," Washington: Federal Tax Policy Memo, The
Tax Foundation; "Principles of a High Quality Revenue System,"&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Tax Notes,</span> March 21, 1988; David G.
Davies, <span style="font-style: italic;">United States Taxes and Tax
Policy, </span>(New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986), pp.17-19;
and David Brunori, <span style="font-style: italic;">State Tax Policy:
A Political Perspective.</span>&nbsp; Washington: Urban Institute
Press, 2001, Ch. 2. State studies cited above also typically list any
or all of these criteria.&nbsp; I have seen accountability, balance,
certainty, competitiveness, and complementary included as well.&nbsp; </small></font></div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The third claim,
that reliance upon a wider number of revenue streams minimizes the
downside consequences that all taxes impose</span>, requires an
extensive examination of the various options available.&nbsp; What,
first of all, are those aspects that must be avoided? <strong>What are the
standards against which various taxes can and should be measured?</strong>&nbsp;
These are typically listed as anywhere from four to seven depending
upon their description.&nbsp; Most common are 
<ul>
  <li>neutrality,  </li>
  <li>efficiency,  </li>
  <li>equity,  </li>
  <li>administrability,  </li>
  <li>simplicity,  </li>
  <li>stability,  </li>
  <li>sufficiency.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">8</font></span></small>  </li>
</ul>
Tax theorists typically measure revenue structures according to any or
all of these criteria: <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax neutrality</span>
refers to the influence (or absence of such) that any particular design
has on economic behavior. Typically taxes are perceived as a damp on
economic activity:
<ul>
  <li>taxing income reduces the incentive to work,  </li>
  <li>taxing sales discourages retail transactions, and  </li>
  <li>taxing savings reduces the propensity to save.  </li>
</ul>
The more a tax is perceived to be neutral the less the identifiable
distortions it imposes on the economy. The common assumption of most
tax theorists is that all taxes impose distortions; it's simply a
matter of which ones are least burdensome to economic health. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">A tax which imposes no distortions is
ideally best. </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax efficiency</span>
is much like tax neutrality, and is the measure of how much shifting of
behavior it imposes, resulting in what is called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"excess burden," or "deadweight loss" on
the economy</span>. Tax economists usually hold that <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the best taxes are those that are
shifted little if at all</span>. Because the elasticities (a technical
word for the slope of supply and demand curves) of each are very
different, <span style="font-weight: bold;">a tax on land values and a
tax on improvement values have very contrastive effects on economic
choices</span>. Using a tax base that has little or zero elasticity is
the best way of assuring that taxes are not shifted.&nbsp; Zero
elasticity is another way of saying fixed supply.<br>
<br>
The principle of <span style="font-weight: bold;">equity
</span>is central to any discussion of tax design.&nbsp; Tax design
requires concern with both what is fair and the extent to which it must
sometimes be compromised to satisfy the other principal criteria.
Fairness can be evaluated according to what is termed "horizontal
equity" &#8212; the extent to which those in similar circumstances will pay
similar tax burdens, and "vertical equity" &#8212; how well those in
different classes bear different burdens in the tax structure. It is
this latter perspective that leads to the use of terms like
"proportional," "progressive," and "regressive" in referring to tax
structures. A tax is progressive with respect to income if the ratio of
tax revenue to income rises when moving up the income scale,
proportional if the ratio is constant, and regressive if the ratio
declines. There is an ancillary question of whether taxing to reach
greater equity should employ measures of income or of wealth, difficult
as this is to measure. Such questions of equity are a matter
particularly central when discussing the property tax.&nbsp; This will
be discussed further below. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Administrability </span>refers
to the ease with which a tax can be administered and collected. Taxes
which distort the economy are inefficient but so are taxes that cost
lots to administer. This is measured not only in the direct costs of
tax avoidance and accounting expenses, but in the level of evasion and
cheating, and by the cost of government auditing and policing. When the
taxpaying public perceives that a tax is easily evaded, cumbersome, and
unfair, it loses its legitimacy and calls government itself into
question.<br>
<br>
This is why the principle of <span style="font-weight: bold;">simplicity
</span>is important: the more
complex the tax design, the more lawyers and accountants will find
loopholes, encourage the appearance of unfairness, and drive up the
cost of its administration. People know that with simple taxes other
parties are also paying their fair share, and all this enhances the
legitimacy and therefore the compliance of the tax system. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stability </span>refers
to the ability of a tax to produce revenue in the face of changing
economic circumstances. Income and sales taxes, for example, vary
greatly according to phases in the economic cycle; the property tax, in
contrast, is highly stable regardless of the state of the economy. This
is one reason why school administrators have typically been supportive
of using the property tax base rather than some other tax to support
school services.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">certainty </span>of
a tax's collection ensures that the number and types of tax changes be
kept to a minimum.&nbsp; Frequent changes in tax rates and bases
interfere with business decisions and the ability to make long-term
financial plans.&nbsp; This concept reinforces the need for stability
because an unstable revenue system is more likely to require continual
adjustments.<br>
<br>
In assessing the value of a tax it is also
important, of course, to understand its potential to bring in revenue
for the purposes of government, usually deemed <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">revenue sufficiency</span>. Income, sales
and property taxes, along with corporation taxes to a lesser extent,
have come to be regarded as the workhorses of the American revenue
structure. But, as anti-tax politicians are quick to note, the higher
these taxes are, the more they impose a drag on the economy. This is
why one should ponder whether to consider raising taxes which have
demonstrable distorting effects. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To be sure, the
"big three" taxes all have negative consequences.&nbsp; This is because
all three are imposed largely on Capital and Labor; only a minor
component of taxes on property constitutes collection of economic
rent.&nbsp; </span>Yet students of the real property tax readily
acknowledge that it has two components: that imposed on land values and
that imposed on improvements.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">When
improvements are taxed at a lower rate or when that levy is totally
removed, it becomes a tax on economic rent.&nbsp; Because that land is
part of an inelastic tax base, it is totally neutral, completely
efficient, simple to understand and to collect, a stable tax base, and
easily administrable.&nbsp;</span> This last is particularly
important:&nbsp; in recent years it has become possible in principle to
assess land value by computer algorithms (called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">computer-assisted mass appraisal, or CAMA</span>),
completely obviating the need for conventional "eyeball" assessors.
Isobars can be drawn on maps showing land values similar to the way
elevations in land topography are shown on geographic maps.&nbsp; The
traditional criticism of conventional property taxation, that
assessment was often arbitrary and subjective, no longer need be a
compelling criticism.<br>
<br>
The one criticism often levied against the
conventional property tax is its <span style="font-weight: bold;">regressivity</span>.&nbsp;
This is somewhat belied by the facts.&nbsp; Only two empirical studies
have ever been done on the subject, but both concluded that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the real property tax is mildly progressive</span>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">9</font></span></small><font size="-1">&nbsp;</font>
When the two elements of the property tax are taken separately, it
becomes even clearer why this is so: the tax on the land component of
real property, being inelastic, cannot be shifted to tenants, and is
borne solely by the titleholder to the property.&nbsp; Only the
improvement part of the real property tax is in any way now shifted to
tenants, and its elimination means the most oppressive component is
gone.&nbsp; When it comes to incidence of payment, the roughly 35
percent of all American households who rent and do not own (largely
poor people) bear none of that tax burden whatsoever.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Even among the homeowning element of the
American population, studies have shown that a shift of the tax to land
values typically lowers the burden on about two thirds of all
households.&nbsp;</span> This is because <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">tax districts where homes are
situated are typically not in highest land value neighborhoods, and it
is business and commercial sites &#8212; particularly the underused land
parcels in those neighborhoods &#8212; that typically bear a larger burden.<small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">10</font> </span></small></small></span>So
in fact a tax on land values is really a profound shift in the
direction of progressivity.<br>

<br>
If one realizes that houses, just like cars,
refrigerators, computers and other manufactured items, depreciate in
value and that only Land increases in market value due to the factors
of inflation and rent accretion, it will become clear that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the remedy for onerous real estate taxes is
downtaxing buildings and uptaxing Land</span>.&nbsp; The result of
doing so will stabilize tax burdens for those who otherwise resent
their payment.&nbsp; In the unusual cases, especially during
transitions, when titleholders of limited income cannot manage such
obligations, taxes can easily be deferred until owners "cash out" by
selling or dying when such debts can be settled.&nbsp; Sales of
appreciated land typically provide estates with adequate wherewithal to
both pay any back taxes and give a capital gain too.&nbsp; And because
business tenants continue to pay the going market rate for office
space, they too are in no way burdened by any tax shifts.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The upshot is that
a tax on Land value alone &#8212; totally neutral, efficient, certain,
progressive, stable, and administrable &#8212; measures up so well that it
looks like the perfect tax!&nbsp;</span> It is even argued that a land
tax is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"better than
neutral," in that it actually fosters the kind of economic activity
that fosters vibrant communities.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">11</font></span></small>&nbsp;
There are also very positive environmental effects inasmuch as it
removes, and even reverses, the centrifugal forces of sprawl
development and stimulates and facilitates investment in urban cores.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">12</font></span></small>&nbsp;
Evidence on this matter supports the claim that taxing land alone is a
more appropriate solution to both tax issues and spatial configuration
issues than any other public remedy, particularly those that rely upon
so-called "command-and-control" approaches such as zoning and urban
growth boundaries that foster rent-seeking and further economic
distortion.&nbsp; The failure of the latter has been amply
demonstrated, and constituted a major conclusion of the Douglas
Commission Report in the aftermath of the riots in major American
cities.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><font size="-1">13</font></span></small><br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the final analysis, studies show that
    very few states measure up to the one-third &#8212; one third &#8212; one-third
    standard in any case.</span>&nbsp; Political and other factors aside, there are good
    reasons for a state's not abiding by such rules.&nbsp; It is only due to
    misunderstandings that faith in the big three taxes constituting the three-legged
    stool have come to prevail.&nbsp;&nbsp; When these taxes are measured by
    their conformity with the conventionally accepted principles of sound tax
    theory, they appear wanting.&nbsp; By shifting to the collection of economic
    rent, manifest mainly in the form of land value taxation, governments will
    better succeed not only in overcoming the prevailing resentment against current
    taxation policies but provide better financial support for those services
which are the rightful province of public obligation.</p>
