<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</span><br>
What would you do if you could work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended&#8221;.<br>
<br>
What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home? What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society.<br>
<br>
Unless humanity needs militarism, corporate welfare, and debt service,
it&#8217;s fair to say most public revenue gets wasted. Demanding a dividend
&#8211; similar to Alaska paying residents a share from oil royalties &#8211;
forces a new dialog on spending priorities. Beyond arguing &#8220;bread not
bombs,&#8221; a dividend replaces expenditures by politicians (necessarily
influenced by donors) with spending by citizens, the people who
generate the
surplus in the first place. With a dividend, citizens get to see
themselves as direct beneficiaries from reigning in the wild spending
spree on imperial aggression, disloyal
multinationals, and on &#8220;borrowing&#8221; money that never existed until
&#8220;lent&#8221; by the Federal Reserve.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a
 name="WHAT_THE_LEFT_MUST_NOT_DO"></a>WHAT THE LEFT MUST
NOT DO<br>
<br>
</span>Famed for his role in the Karen Silkwood case, union leader Tony
Mazzochi also pushes for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">shorter
workweek</span>. So does <span style="font-style: italic;">In These
Times</span> reporter John Judis. Their
cause needs help. While the worsening time-famine stresses many, most
do not yet call for a social salary. They clamour for jobs.<br>
<br>
The Left requests and the Right promises jobs &#8211; the Left for the
income, the Right in order to keep people in their place. Workers want
to be paid for going along with the program. Bosses want to accommodate
them, albeit not fully; maintaining some unemployment spooks workers
and keeps wages down. Since jobs are the knee-jerk cure
of everyone, they can not be the signature issue of the Left. Nor can
they lift our sights. The call for jobs does not come from a place of
respect but from a willingness to accept the status quo, with
prevailing hierarchy left intact.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To deliver a bigger pie, the Right
touts efficiency and growth; to better distribute the pie, the Left
urges equity and jobs. Yet jobs are less for distributing, more for
producing &#8211; if that. As automation and globalisation expand the pie,
they contract the workforce. Even </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">when, or especially when, people take time
off to go to war, output increases, proving we&#8217;re well over
over-capacity. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Juliet Schor in
her </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Overworked
American</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"> notes this </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">rise in
productivity does not bless us with leisure but curses us with
unemployment.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
However, even when employment is high, jobs still do a lousy job of
distribution. They capture less than a fair return to labor while
swallowing up our free time. Full employment with a liveable wage may
mean jobs with justice for some, but not for those unable to work, and
it reduces humans to workers, not players or creators. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Demanding jobs rather than a fair
share of society&#8217;s surplus implies that there is no commonwealth or
that expropriating it by a few is OK. Neither is true. </span>Rents
are real, and they are ours. There is a free lunch (just ask the
privileged), as those downing it do get money for nothing. And since
society, not lone owners, generates these values, that flow of funds
belongs to everyone.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a
 name="RENT" id="RENT"></a>RENT &#8211; THE STUFF
OF FORTUNES &#8211; ROCKS AND RULES<br>
<br>
</span>The value of a parcel of land is initially based on the natural
endowments of the location (&#8220;location, location, location&#8221;), created
not by an owner but by
whatever created all of us. Next, <span style="font-weight: bold;">land
value rises with the presence of society, and grows with the population
of society. It&#8217;s highest where society is densest, in the city centers,
typically 2000 times more </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">valuable
than sites in the boondocks.</span> Land values as economic values
disappear whenever society quits respecting one&#8217;s claim, as in a war
zone; there, real estate offices nimbly shut down. And while land
titles may be the holy grail of wannabe homeowners, they&#8217;re also the
ticket to pocket unearned rent by absentee landlords, such as Donald
Trump.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Making land public does not guarantee
that the public end up with the rent. The public&#8217;s steward, the state,
often lets public resources at &#8220;fire-sale&#8221; prices, unduly enriching
Chevron, Arco, Kerr-McGee, Weyerhauser, etc.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The state gifts enormously
valuable licenses for TV, radio, and cell phones to GE, Disney, Time
Warner, and Clear Channel. </span>The metaphor, &#8220;field of knowledge&#8221;,
lets us see patents and copyrights as flags; by excluding innovative
outsiders, they not only skew techno-progress (thus addicting
civilization to oil) but also enrich those few who can afford to corral
them: GM, DuPont, and Microsoft. Similarly, a utility franchise lets
AT&amp;T pay investors, and Enron insiders, handsomely. <br>
<br>
Buying a land title &#8211; the granddaddy of all privileges &#8211; typically
requires a mortgage, which disguises rent as &#8220;interest&#8221;. Pierre Joseph
Proudhon (1809-1865), French journalist/anarchist, noted: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">"As long as land monopoly is maintained,
the few can take possession of what Nature free of charge has granted
to everyone, and usury will penetrate the whole society, and we will
have banks, which instead of being servants for the exchange of goods
will become powerful extorters."</span> He called this one; today&#8217;s
banks do bleed the economy.<br>
<br>
What does the central bank, the private consortium dubbed the Federal
Reserve, lend to the US? Nothing. Given the power to create money by
Congress (which the Constitution had given to Congress), from no
savings at all but merely from legal
standing, it manufactures credit, which the US borrows, at interest.
The US exempts this interest from its income tax; people who hold US
bonds &#8211; mainly the wealthy &#8211; keep this income tax-free. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The much
and justifiably criticized corporation is in essence its corporate
charter, given value <span style="font-style: italic;">by limiting the
liability of managers, directors, and investors</span>.</span> It&#8217;s
worth at least the cost of the insurance payments not made by the
corporation, which would equal the costs imposed upon worker, customer,
and nature. As the &#8220;need&#8221; arises, legislatures extend limited liability
even further: Congress legally lowered the greater risk of nuclear
power to benefit Westinghouse, of the Valdez oil transport
spill for Exxon, and the Y2K software design bug for Microsoft. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Politicians
define legally &#8220;safe&#8221; amounts of polluted air and water for GM and
Monsanto, keeping safe the wealth of those responsible.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Not to be outdone by any legislature,
the Supreme Court has ruled in favour of compensating landowners for
environmental &#8220;takings&#8221;, but has remained silent about landowners
compensating the public for any &#8220;givings&#8221;</span>, as when site values
skyrocket near a new light rail stop. Molly Ivins wrote, <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Henry George must be in his grave
spinning' like a cyclotron. We, the people at large, make the land more
desirable; and then the landowners want us to pay them because we won't
allow them to poison the air or to pollute the rivers." (1995 March)<br>
</div>
That&#8217;s how great fortunes are made: by sloughing off private costs
(which become &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;) while soaking up public
benefits (some &#8220;positive externalities&#8221;). Land titles, corporate
charters, and other privileges &#8211; mere pieces of paper &#8211; are worth
trillions each year. The corporations &#8211; from the Federal Reserve to
Exxon (both founded by the &#8220;oiligarchy&#8221;) &#8211; that receive these
privileges make their owners rich or richer. Their wealth is not
compensation for the exertions of either labor or capital, not profit
in the market from output, but rent from present lobbying of
legislatures or past conquest of others&#8217; lands. Thus laws (&#8220;privilege&#8221;
means &#8220;private law&#8221;) funnel multi-trillions of dollars each year from
the many to the few. <br>
<br>
Rentiers become the elite or rise higher up among the upper echelon,
the puppeteers of our puppet state. Their ranks grow with every
techno-advance that spurs a new monopoly and pushes up locational
values.<br>
<br>
<a name="HOW_TO_RECOVER_RENTS"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">HOW TO RECOVER
RENTS<br>
<br>
</span>Trillions are enough money that the present beneficiaries spend
fortunes on <span style="font-weight: bold;">electing their water boys</span>
to Congress and state legislatures. Why do public servants agree to let
public assets go for peanuts? Partly out of habit, partly because the
recipients contribute mightily to their political campaigns, but also. <br>
<br>
Well, not exactly &#8220;always&#8221;. Once there was a powerful movement to shift
taxes off wages, onto rents. It was not Marxism, eventho&#8217; one of the
first demands in the Communist Manifesto was to tax land (acknowledging
the history of the enclosures
of farmland which forced surplus labor to work cheap in the then new
factories in
cities). It was the movement of the Single Tax on land, spearheaded by
Henry George.<br>
<br>
George, author of the classic, <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>
(1879, in its day more popular than <span style="font-style: italic;">Das
Kapital</span>), was Labor&#8217;s candidate
for the mayoralty of New York in 1886, an election he won but a victory
he was denied by the machinations of Tammany Hall. Samuel Gompers
(1850-1924), union organizer who campaigned for George, said, <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"I
believe in the Single Tax. I count it a great privilege to have been a
friend of Henry George and to have been one of those who helped to make
him understood in New York and elsewhere."</span><br>
</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a
 name="TAX_SHIFT_WORKS"></a>TAX SHIFT WORKS<br>
<br>
</span>Whenever George&#8217;s followers convinced society to shift taxes off
earnings, onto rents, that opened up opportunity. As collecting land
rent knocks down land price, and as speculators turn into developers,
and as formerly procrastinating governments become leasers, then the
use of land rises. Using land requires labor, raising the demand for
workers. More employment means higher wages.
<ul>
  <li>During the 1920s, New York City taxed land but not new buildings
put on it. Construction more than tripled while in other big cities it
barely doubled. There were more jobs and higher wages for construction
workers, and more business for merchants who sold goods to the employed
workers. There were more buildings for new businesses that hired help.
(&#8220;How New York Solved Its Housing Crisis&#8221;, Charles Johnson Post, 1934?)</li>
  <li>In 1957 the Danish Parliament raised the land tax rate.
Investors switched from real estate to real enterprise. One year later,
inflation had gone from 5% to under 1%; bank interest dropped from
6.25% to 5%. By 1960, 100,000 unemployed in a country of just five
million had found jobs; workers received the largest one-time jump in
wages in Danish history. (Third Way for the Third World, Knud
Tholstrup, Danish MP, 1986)</li>
  <li>In New Zealand, where 90% of the towns taxed land
    only, not improvements, employment averaged 99% from 1966 until 1975. When
    the
oil shock hit, making their export goods too expensive since they had
to be shipped so far by oil-burning freighters, employment dropped to a
true (not fudged) 94% (our &#8220;94%&#8221; does not include people who&#8217;ve
quit
looking for work). (Local Government Statistics, 1982)</li>
  <li> In the 1980s when Ling
  Temco Voight, Inc. closed steel mills in
  the
  region, Pittsburgh lost its factory. In nearby Aliquippa, which still
  taxes land 16 times higher than buildings, former employees bought one
  mill at a price discounted by the underlying land&#8217;s tax liability and
  re-opened it. Other investors built a new mill there, keeping the local
  economy alive. </li>
  <li>In the 1990s around the outskirts of Ethiopia&#8217;s
capital, Addis Ababa, shantytowns sprang up on land that had been used
to feed the city. That pushed out farmers onto land that had lain
fallow for centuries. The longer trek to central markets raised the
price of food there. So the Regional Government, against the advice of
the IMF, adopted a tax on land values and parcel size and drastically
reduced the tax on structures inside city limits. The Economics Section
of the Ethiopian Embassy in Washington, DC reports greater occupancy
and refurbishing of older structures in the city. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><a
 name="TAXING" id="TAXING"></a>TAXING EARNINGS
DOESN&#8217;T WORK<br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">As taxing land spurs
employment, taxing labor and capital does just the opposite.</span>
Taxing salaries makes it more expensive to hire people. Taxing earned
profits makes it more expensive to invest in firms that hire people. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you want jobs, don&#8217;t tax them. </span>Demanding
jobs while taxing wages is irrational. When we tax (or in other ways
reduce) one&#8217;s efforts, most people naturally produce less.&nbsp; Less
output not only shrinks private assets but also the formation of public
assets downstream.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike taxing earned incomes, which
shrinks the pie, collecting rent grows the pie. </span>While taxes on
effort lessen the motivation to produce, charging people rent for
what&#8217;s already been provided, by definition, does not diminish the
motive to produce. Instead, recovering rent removes the private profit
from speculating in land and
resources. And once we redirect revenue from sweetheart deals (e.g.,
Pentagon contracts), tax breaks (e.g., depletion allowances), and
subsidies (e.g., agri-business
support) into a general dividend, then why bother currying favours from
the state? Finding rent-seeking from both nature and the legislature
less profitable, investors would turn to improving production: new
technology and worker re-training, providing society more from less. <br>
<br>
In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Nation</span>, Robert Fitch
('90 Oct 29), author of <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Assassination of New York</span> (1993), stated, <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"A
tax levied on land used for commercial purposes is the ideal tax. It
would fall on the richest families and institutions, it can't be
shifted to consumers and owners can't move their property to another
state. Almost invariably, if you tax something the capitalists will
produce less of it and charge you more for it. But land is
different.&nbsp; Most of it was produced once and for all by God."</span><br>
</div>
<br>
Increasing taxes, fees, or dues upon land, resources, and privileges
won&#8217;t force firms to raise prices; the ones who try to will lose
customers to those who don&#8217;t; in the end, all will have to settle for
smaller profits. On the other hand, de-taxing
labor and capital, by lowering overhead, lets firms lower the price of
their products, while competition drives them to. The resultant lower
cost of living &#8211; coupled with higher wages and the social salary &#8211; lets
those with enough stuff work less, so those without enough stuff can
work more.<br>
<br>
Given the collateral damage by most taxes, the Left must make clear
that the extra income is to come not from taxes upon people&#8217;s
legitimate earnings but from rent, making it a social salary from
society&#8217;s surplus.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> While opponents
will cry &#8220;redistribution&#8221;, the Left can point out that sharing the
commonwealth is actually &#8220;predistribution.&#8221; Acting like a REIT (Real
Estate Investment Trust) for the public</span>, government would merely
recover and disburse rents before the elite or their friendly
politicians have a chance to misspend society&#8217;s surplus.<br>
<br>
<a name="DEMOCRACY_BENEFITS"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">DEMOCRACY BENEFITS<br>
<br>
</span>As Goldschmidt showed in his classic 1940s study of two towns in
California&#8217;s Central Valley &#8211; Arven and Dinuba (one town of owner
occupants, the other a one-company town) &#8211; where people have a stake,
they vote, attend hearings, and use parks and libraries. Government
responds, filling potholes, funding schools, etc. Improving people&#8217;s
lot in life increases their participation in civic affairs.<br>
<br>
The reform of collecting ground rent in lieu of taxing buildings lowers
the cost of housing, which raises the rate of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">owner occupancy</span>. When Pittsburgh PA
taxed land six times their rate on buildings, their affordable housing,
stable neighbourhoods, and low crime rate won the once strong union
town the title of &#8220;America&#8217;s Most Liveable
City&#8221; twice in the mid 1980s. Succumbing to pressure applied by
speculators, in 2000 the Steel City returned to the conventional
property tax. Construction starts in 2001 in the rest of Pennsylvania
fell 1.5%; in Pittsburgh, 38.1%. For 2001 and 2002, compared to 1999
and 2000, building permits declined 21.3% while nationwide they rose
6.7% (Incentive Taxation, 2003 June, Henry George Fdn).<br>
<br>
Eventho&#8217; its advocates must overcome the visceral dislike of the more
familiar tax on both land and buildings, the proposal to collect ground
rents has enjoyed popular support. In the mid 1990s, the people of
Allentown Pennsylvania (whose sorry state inspired pop singer Billy
Joel) voted twice to shift their property tax off buildings, onto
locations. They had to vote twice because after expressing their
preference the first time, the real estate lobby put the question on
the ballot again, where it passed by an even larger margin. Since
shifting its tax base, the town revitalized its center and
neighborhoods, drawing praise from Richard Florida in his <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Rise of the Creative Class</span> (2002).
Allentown is one of 20 jurisdictions in Pennsylvania that levy land
more highly than improvements.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br>
<a name="WORKERS_BENEFIT"></a>WORKERS BENEFIT</span><br>
<br>
A surfeit of jobs, the consequence of recovering rents, goes nicely
with the flagship goal of a life of leisure, the consequence of sharing
rents. Further, when jobs seek people instead of vice versa, not only
can workers hold out for higher wages &#8211; as in the tech industries in
the 1990s &#8211; but they also gain the leverage to metamorphose
corporations into <span style="font-weight: bold;">co-ops</span>, long
an ideal of the Left.&nbsp; Having to pay government for limiting
its liability or to operate under full liability, corporations would
want to share risk, giving
labor leverage to negotiate not just higher wages, but also co-manage,
and eventually erase the distinction between management and worker,
which is a co-op.<br>
<br>
An entry point for proposing an extra income for everyone is the
income
gap, highlighted by outrageous CEO pay. With society soaking up rents,
leaving little excess in corporate coffers, and with a more
participatory management and directorship &#8211; one including employees and
stockholders &#8211; directors would no longer have either the means or the
motive to lavish pay and benefits on CEOs, that breed of salesman with
excellent old-boy connections and superbly apt at schmoozing. The new
managers and directors, acting on behalf of the greater good, would
redirect profit from CEO aggrandizement to dividends paid to the
growing class of shareholders, which would include workers, moving
society closer to Louis Kelso&#8217;s ideal of universal stock ownership.<br>
<br>
Campaigning for a Citizens Dividend dislodges the Left from the issues
of the bygone Industrial Era and orients the Left toward the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">solutions of the future</span>. Getting
back onto the cutting edge positions the Left <span
 style="font-style: italic;">for </span>a solution instead of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">against </span>a problem, which
progressives, by definition (&#8220;pro&#8221; meaning &#8220;for&#8221;), should be. Demanding
the fundamental reform of a dividend sets the agenda, drawing down the
strength of the Right, while winning the spotlight, new adherents, and
building up the Left.<br>

In <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">An Intelligent
Woman&#8217;s Guide to </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Socialism and
Capitalism </span>(1928), <span style="font-weight: bold;">George
Bernard Shaw</span> told how he began his political career as a
Georgist but left to found the Fabians in order to promote a social
salary. HG Wells likewise faulted
George for not faulting the state&#8217;s misspending and focusing squarely
on taxation. While more famous for his tax shift, Henry George did
endorse the idea of a dividend. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Martin
Luther King</span> in his own "<span style="font-style: italic;">Where
Do We Go From Here?</span>" cited
George then proposed an extra income that would be dynamic, that would
&#8220;automatically increase as the total social income grows.&#8221; This is
precisely what a Citizens Dividend does; as progress pushes up site
values, one&#8217;s share of the resultant Rent rises, too. The stratospheric
land costs in Silicon Valley, Silicon Forest, and silicon anywhere
exemplify how the advances in machines show up in the costs of
locations.<br>
<br>
Former United Auto Workers President Douglas Frazier said, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;one day, we are going to ask ourselves,
did anyone make the oil and minerals and then put them in the ground?
We will then realize that they belong to all of us."</span> (before the
National Conference on Alternate State and Local Policies in 1979, July
3-5) That day is dawning. <br>
<br>
Already, Alaskans own oil and share royalties. Among environmentalists,
top economists Herman Daly and James Robertson both endorse sharing
rents in lieu of taxing earned income. Daly, ex of the World Bank and
grandfather of ecological economics, back in the 1970s noted the
savings from folding many social programs into a social salary.
Robertson, ex-advisor to the British Cabinet and Bank of England and
co-founder of The Other Economic Summit and Schumacher College, in many
of his writings urges the tax shift and a Citizens Dividend.&nbsp; The
Corporation for Economic Development and Americans for Equitable
Climate Solutions also promote a rent dividend.<br>
<br>
Groups with like goals might help win a social dividend. Altho&#8217; they
don&#8217;t yet care where the money comes from, the venerable Technocracy
and the upstart Basic Income Network promote an income supplement; some
minority groups demand reparations. Others advocate a shorter workweek:
the woman&#8217;s group, 9 to 5, and an academic group, Society to Reduce
Human Labor. In Europe, scholars debate an extra income apart from
one&#8217;s labor or capital. All these movements beyond the mainstream might
be ready to rally around sharing society&#8217;s commonwealth. <br>
<br>
The time famine, made a more bitter pill to swallow by the yawning
income gulf, could slide the rest of society toward a social salary,
too. Across the aisle, many Rightists argue for replacing subsidies
with vouchers, as for education, a cousin of an extra income. A
rational Rightist (if that&#8217;s not an oxymoron) might just go along with
this more fundamental reform, the Citizens Dividend. <br>

<br>
Petitioning for jobs &#8211; crumbs for being good peons &#8211; is only settling.
Legislating an income outright will exert every sinew of the Left. To
win distributive justice, activists could lobby each breadth of
government, including the global. Since recovering rent spurs
development (see our prize-winning &#8220;Bootstrap Development&#8221;), the Left
could raise this banner besides merely opposing globalisation. At the
other end of the political arena,
the ones to disburse the revenue need not be federal authorities; local
ones could do the job. They could pay residents a Housing Voucher from
collected site rent, which is way highest in commercial areas, often
owned by outsiders. In the state arena, activists can advance the
Alaska model, as international activists do for sharing the oil wealth
among the peoples of Iraq and Nigeria.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, ignoring our common assets guarantees that we continue to
pay rent rather than begin to receive rent. Conversely, insisting upon
a fair share could <span style="font-weight: bold;">win us the world
we want</span>. While it breaks an old habit to leave jobs behind in
favour of fair distribution, just recognizing surplus empowers people.
It reaffirms the very existence of our commonwealth and challenges the
narrow view of property as exclusively private. While the Left gets
excoriated for wanting to be big spenders, demanding a dividend in lieu
of waste and a shift of taxes from individual effort to social surplus
helps refurbish the Left&#8217;s image.<br>
<br>
The call to share the commonwealth enjoys an unshakable moral base and
gets high marks for real world success, unlike taxes upon true
earnings. Once implemented, sharing rent will grant us leisure &#8211; time
enough to evolve and reconnect with friends, family, and neighbours &#8211;
and drain away fortunes rather than let the fortunate continue to soak
society. Hence support for shifting taxes and paying dividends to the
citizenry grows already, without the Left&#8217;s leadership. It&#8217;s time to
run with the banner of an extra income for everyone, in the halls and
capitols of governments everywhere. To liberate humans from exploitive
labor, let us advance the sharing of society&#8217;s surplus.<br>
<br>
To prove I'm not tilting marx-ward, I fear I may one day soon have to
write "What the Right must do (or quit doing)," too.<br>
