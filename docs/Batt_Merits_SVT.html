<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Merits of Site Value Taxation</span><br>
H. William Batt, Ph.D., Central Research Group, Inc.<br>
August, 1999</div>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Using the Instruments of Government
Effectively<br>
<br>
</span>Three arguments for the application of site value taxation are
normally offered in contemporary political discussion. It addresses the
problems of <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">1) the burdensome structure of current
taxes, whether on homeowners or on business and industrial
organizations; <br>
2) the destruction and expense of current land development patterns,
typically known as sprawl; and <br>
3) the deterioration of infrastructure, particularly transportation and
school facilities, which policy makers widely acknowledge cannot be
allowed to proceed. <br>
</div>
All of these concerns been addressed by public policy measures of
varying and imaginative quality over the course of the past half
century, but success is at best mixed. It is difficult, however, to
talk about the implementation of site value taxation without also
taking into account how such a policy would fit with application of
other instruments.<br>
<br>
One must begin a discussion by recognizing that governments,
constitutionally speaking, have two means by which to effectuate public
policy, conventionally known as tax powers and police powers.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1 </span></small>The
primary purpose of taxing power historically has been to raise the
necessary revenue to support government functions as defined by the
electorate through its chosen representatives. Many students of
government argue that this should be its only purpose. President
Reagan, for example, reflected this view of taxation when he stated in
1981 that "the taxing power of the government must be used to provide
for legitimate government purposes. It must not be used to regulate the
economy or bring about social change."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> This
view has within it the implicit view that there is a way to tax that is
totally neutral in its influence on economic behavior, something which
has not always been understood or agreed to. Taxes have always been
used to facilitate socioeconomic policies, and in recent years have
become a conscious tool of policy makers even more. One recent study
notes that in the state of Washington, for example, 222 of the 378
identifiable tax breaks for special purposes have been enacted since
1970; the state of Oregon, similarly, has witnessed 288.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> But
whether using taxing powers to facilitate other purposes is a wise and
efficient approach needs to be more carefully considered, and there has
been too little discussion of this issue in contemporary scholarship or
political life. Furthermore, only recently has it been possible to
understand the possibility of tax neutrality.<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">1The national government could
effect measures to alter socio-economic behavior under the provisions
of its war powers, an instrument which has been insufficiently studied
in public policy discourse. This is because enacting such measures
would likely take a formal declaration of war, </font></small><font size="-1"><small>something
that has happened only five times in U.S. history, the last in response
to Pearl Harbor. There is therefore little use of the war powers
provision.</small><br>

the Economy, Improve the Environment, and Get the Tax Man Off Our
Backs. Seattle: Northwest Environment Watch, April, 1998, p. 26.</small></font></div>
<br>
Debate about the influence of various tax designs on social and
economic behavior is nowhere clearer than in attempts to describe and
define the concept of tax expenditures.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> Tax
expenditures are special provisions in the tax code, any tax code, that
forgo the collection of certain revenues with the intent that their
retention by taxpayers will foster public purposes better than through
programs financed directly through the budgetary process. Implicit in
this notion is the idea that there is some absolute and pure tax base
and revenue system which is compromised by various deductions,
exemptions, credits, and other allowances that alter its otherwise
ideal design. Whether that tax structure can ever be identified, let
alone realized in practice, is worth pondering. Yet to abandon all
attempts at adherence to the principles of tax theory that have evolved
over the course of centuries is equally foolish. Taxes have generally
come to be regarded as a necessary evil, but not all taxes are equally
evil.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5</span></small>
Some taxes are more evil than others, and Milton <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Friedman</a> once said
that a tax on land value is the "least worst" tax.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6</span></small> <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">4The term "tax expenditure" was
coined by the late Professor
Stanley S. Surrey during the nineteen sixties. For further detail, see

</div>
<br>
To the extent that taxing powers of government are used to implement
social policies beyond the collection of revenue, they take on a
complexity and a political tenor that involve a number of
counterproductive elements. The acceptance of tax expenditures as a
means of effectuating public policy in the tax code has led
increasingly legislators' vulnerability to the crude blandishments of a
host of special pleaders. Such considerations deserve attention and
should be kept in mind when the designs of tax structures are
discussed. Most often they are ignored. If, on the other hand, tax
policy is confined solely to the function of raising of revenue, in the
most neutral and efficient manner possible, then other functions of
government can be employed to implement what programs policy makers
choose to undertake. This encourages greater accountability in the
performance of government functions by ensuring that policy makers
themselves are in charge of the budgetary process and the performance
of public functions. Most functions of government are constitutionally
authorized under what are regarded as the police powers of government.
Using the tax powers solely for taxation and the police powers for
regulation and ensuring public welfare is a matter worthy of further
discussion than it receives.<br>
<br>
Not all revenue collection on the part of government is grounded in the
constitutional authority of its tax powers. Taxes in the strictest
sense of the term are revenues involuntarily paid to general funds for
the general purposes of government. But there are many other revenues
paid to government that would never be construed as taxes: lottery
revenues, fines, interest payments, environmental (green) fees, payment
for information, and user fees being the most common examples. Fines,
green fees, and user fees are instruments of police power precisely
because their primary purpose is to correct behavior, and only
secondarily to raise revenue. User fees, along with environmental fees
particularly, are employed to recover the costs of use, wear or damage
to environmental or government-provided "services." (Only in recent
years has it been fashionable to regard use or degradation of the
natural environment as a "service," necessitating "correction," as was
originally explicated by Pigou earlier this century.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small>)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">7Arthur Cecil Pigou, The
Economics of Welfare (several editions) London: MacMillan, orig. 1920.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<br>
Fiscal measures such as those noted above can be employed under police
powers to correct, or at least compensate for, otherwise egregious
social behavior, and public policy makers must concern themselves with
the question whether such measures are more or less appropriate or
effective. These provide an attractive alternative to what have come to
be known as "command and control" approaches. Just as are so many
fiscal measures, command-and-control approaches to regulating and
controlling social and economic behavior is also grounded in the police
powers of government. Administrative theory has grown in appreciation
for fiscal approaches and away from command-and-control approaches in
recent years.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">8</span></small>
This is because they are often far less expensive and more efficient to
implement, easier to understand, have a greater degree of compliance,
and has the added virtue, lastly, of raising revenue for the support of
governmental responsibilities. This interest in "tax shifting" has
inspired the slogan, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tax
Bads, Not Goods</span>."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">9<br>
</span></small>

versus pricing approaches, the

<small>9Durning and Bauman, op.cit.</small></font>
</div>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></small>Many so-called <strong>command-and-control approaches</strong> have been
instituted to restore the damage that has come about because of the
distortion wrought by the tax structure itself. To take a particularly
clear example, the policy of zoning, now almost ubiquitous in our urban
areas, has been a consequence of the choices people have made in the
wake of a property tax system that encourages development with little
rational basis and is economically and socially inefficient. To take a
still more poignant instance, the restriction upon development in
certain areas in order to retain and restore green space is also a
direct consequence of property tax policies that have engendered
centrifugal pressures for their development, pressures that would not
exist with the right tax structure. And to take a final example,
compliance with legal provisions imposed on industries that pollute the
natural environment --difficult and expensive to enforce for
government, and often confusing, economically inefficient, and
expensive to perpetrators as well -- can more easily be brought about
through fiscal instruments that serve as "carrots" rather than "sticks."<br>
<br>
<small></small>At the national level, deregulation has been
accomplished in a number of realms of the economy; at the state and
local levels, except in the area of electric power, it is essentially
unaddressed. Discussion of means by which fiscal measures can replace
command-and-control measures continues to be a prime focus of policy
discussion in the current government milieu, even though they appear
both administratively and politically difficult challenges.<br>
<br>
Because command-and-control approaches entail greater scope, weight and
domain for government than comparable alternative fiscal approaches,
these latter have become highly attractive in a political environment
where the public sector, and the taxes to support it, have come to be
resented by a large element of the electorate. The more deft and
nuanced manner by which fiscal instruments can foster policy goals has
led to their greater attraction and more considered use. Command and
control approaches, requiring as they do the persistent and assiduous
hand of bureaucracy and political oversight, are therefore vulnerable
to not just mutation and neglect but even corruption. Well-conceived
fiscal measures have the advantages of fostering voluntary compliance
and with much less continuous scrutiny. Although many industries have
seized upon the anti-regulation sentiment to press for the elimination
of any strictures upon their behavior at all, however irresponsible and
socially harmful, there is growing appreciation of the power which
well-crafted measures hold. While more attention may be required
initially to ensure that their design is correct, they ensure, long
term, that the economic burden which society bears is far lower.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance Evaluation of Government
Policies</span><br>
<br>
Just as there are two constitutional approaches which governments can
use to implement the public will, there are essentially two approaches
to their performance evaluation. They can for convenience be regarded
as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">inductive </span>and the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">deductive </span>approaches. They have
their counterparts in the historical development of other disciplines,
particularly in the natural sciences. Biology and geology were
characterized in their earlier years by the collection and taxonomic
classification of information of all sorts. More recently they have
developed bodies of theory to aid in their evolving facility at
generalization and further explanation. The policy sciences have
experienced some of the same growth and evolution. Today evolving
theories allow students of administration to consider the efficacy and
utility of certain patterns of social organization with a view to their
comparison and improvement. It becomes less necessary to carry out
detailed, labor intensive, and expensive empirical studies to ascertain
the merits of various programs and designs.<br>
<br>
In the history of taxation, extending as it does to the beginning of
civilization, several lessons have been learned that offer instructive
guidelines to their heirs.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10</span></small> In
ancient Israel, taxing trees resulted in barren landscapes. In early
England taxing the windows of houses resulted in windowless buildings.
So also with experiments taxing frontages, roof lines, and chimneys.
For the most part, taxing an item results in a drop in the level of its
use, and in its evasion. Taxing wages discourages work and leads to an
underground labor force; taxing
sales leads to black markets; and taxing savings leads to offshore
banking. Any reader is likely to be able to offer comparable examples.
These anecdotal and sometimes even apocryphal stories have over the
course of centuries led nonetheless to a body of wisdom about what
constitutes sound tax policy and what is not. Students of tax design
and administration are an identifiable profession inasmuch as they
accept and rely upon a recognized body of knowledge about taxation.
This body of "theory" offers opportunities to evaluate various policy
practices in ways that transcend particularistic and anecdotal
information. The evolution of policy discourse now allows various
practices to be evaluated against a set of principles, enumerated in
standard graduate texts and are typically set forth in the beginning of
official reports.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11</span></small><small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">10Two particularly good general
discussions of taxation practices have been written in recent years:
Carolyn Webber and Aaron Wildavsky, A History of Taxation and
Expenditure in the Western World, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1986;
and Charles Adams, For Good and Evil, op cit.</font></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>11Most recently the Kemp
Commission has invoked these measures in its proposals for reform. See Unleashing
America&#8217;s Potential: a Pro-growth, Pro-family Tax System for
the 21st Century, Washington: Report of the National Commission on
Economic Growth and Tax Reform, 1996. See also Parthasarathi Shome
(ed.), Tax Policy Handbook, Washington: Fiscal Affairs Department,
International Monetary Fund, 1995.</small></font></div>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
Particularistic empirical studies are still required for many purposes,
however. Many of the recent studies of the effectiveness of fiscal
measures, those employed with the intention of bringing about precise
goals, have been of this nature. Studies of business locational
decisions, for example, have been few, precisely because any collection
of experiences is necessarily so expensive. When actual empirical
studies have been impossible to perform, the next best has been to
secure the collective opinion of experts, those at least not vested
with particular interests in the success of certain approaches. At the
more localized level, where decision strategies have been adopted to
revitalize identified areas for development and/or renewal, the studies
are again limited by their expense and varied purposes. They are more
likely to be inductive, based on limited aggregate data or experience
or grounded in general consensus opinion, more than they are evaluated
against the more abstract principles and theory that has come to
characterize fiscal policy discourse.<br>
<br>
With respect to the efficacy of various schemes and programs devised to
carry out economic development and urban revitalization, those limited
studies available show that their impact is decidedly mixed. Studies of
various government programs intended to foster job creation or to
engender the critical mass of economic vitality to sustain an area on
an upward course show that they are generally not effective.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">12</span></small> What
tends to happen instead is the development of bidding wars between the
several states and localities, driven by the felt pressures
of political leaders to produce results even when more resources are
spent in attracting the enterprise than are likely to be returned in
subsequent benefit. These zero-sum games between competitive political
jurisdictions benefit the industries that are being wooed with little
net gain to the general public. At the micro level, incentive programs
offered to depressed localities and to revitalize demarcated areas show
equally mixed results, a matter to be discussed further below.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Principles of Sound Tax Theory</span><br>
<br>
There is greater advantage in assessing the merit of various tax
strategies against principles that have their beginnings with the
writing of Adam Smith more than two centuries ago. These principles,
typically noted as four, five, six, or seven, form the guideposts for
assessment of what is a sound tax and what is not. It is worth
describing in brief form what constitutes the core of tax experience,
offering as it does a shorthand for further assessment of fiscal
practices. Then, it will be possible, having looked at the measures of
tax design and administration as lessons have been learned, to
investigate the effectiveness and congruity of those policies which
have been employed in Minnesota. It will also be evident how certain
tax practices have in fact engendered the very problems the State of
Minnesota faces with respect to resentment of taxes, inefficient land
use, urban inactivity, transportation dislocation, and environmental
despoliation.<br>
<br>
The place to start is taking advantage of what economists and tax
theorists have learned over the course of the past three hundred years
about a government's role in the economy. Far from assuming that the
economy works best by a total "hands-off" policy as Adam Smith was
falsely believed to have advocated by his invocation of an "invisible
hand," policy leaders need to recognize that certain values we hold
dear are outside the economy, and are threatened by our failure to
price them properly. That we treat certain goods and "services" in
nature as "free" means that we overuse them and our environment is
degraded. Clean water and air, for example, aren't given any value in
our economic system, and when they are degraded by agricultural runoff,
industrial pollutants, or auto-emissions, those who are "using up"
these resources go untaxed. The notion that the economy is a
self-regulating system, operating according to defined laws and in
ongoing equilibrium, is no longer entertained by serious students of
economic and fiscal policy. The debate rather is over which government
interventions are constructive and which ones are dysfunctional. The
best place to start correcting property tax inequities and
environmental degradation is by the right kind of taxes.<br>
<br>
Tax theorists evaluate revenue structures according to the criteria of
economic neutrality, efficiency, equity, administrability, simplicity,
stability, and sufficiency.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">13<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">13Adam Smith's Wealth
      of Nations
(1776) remains even today a
starting point for students of tax design, for he captured, even at
that early time, not just the sum of learning to that date but his own
acute insights. See, for example, "Principles of Taxation, in Light of
Modern Developments," Federal Tax Policy Memo, The Tax Foundation,
Washington, DC. For further discussion of what students of tax policy
regard as the principles which should guide their design, see, for
example, Richard and Peggy Musgrave, Public Finance: Theory and
Practice, Fifth Edition. New York: McGraw Hill, 1989, "Part Four:
Principles of Taxation," pp. 210-314; George Break, "Taxation," Encarta
Encyclopedia by Microsoft, 1993; "Principles of a High Quality Revenue
System," Tax Notes, March 21, 1988; David G. Davies, United States
Taxes and Tax Policy. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1986, pp.
17-19; and Unleashing America&#8217;s Potential: a Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Tax
System for the 21st Century. Washington: Report of the National
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform (Kemp Commission), 1996.</font></small></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Tax neutrality</span> refers to the influence (or absence of such) that
any particular design has on economic behavior. Typically taxes are
perceived as a damp on economic activity -- taxing income reduces the
incentive to work, taxing sales discourages retail transactions, and
taxing savings reduces the propensity to save. The more neutral the
tax, the less identifiable the distortions it imposes on the economy.
The common assumption of most tax theorists is that all taxes impose
distortions; it's simply a matter of which ones are least burdensome to
economic health. A tax which imposes no distortions is theoretically
best.<small><br>
</small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tax efficiency</span> is much like tax
neutrality, and measures how much shifting of behavior it imposes,
resulting in what is called "excess burden," or "deadweight loss" on
the economy. Tax economists usually hold that the best taxes are those
that are shifted little if at all. Because the elasticities (a
technical word for the slope of supply and demand curves) of each
differ, a tax on items that have little or zero elasticity is the best
way of assuring that taxes are not shifted. Zero elasticity is another
way of saying fixed supply, such as, for example, land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1"><small>14 Hence Will Rogers advised
people to "Buy land, because they ain't makin' any more of it."</small></font></div>
<br>
The principle of <span style="font-weight: bold;">equity </span>is
central to any discussion of tax design. Tax design must consider both
what is fair in the context of the other principal considerations.
Fairness can be evaluated according to what is termed "horizontal
equity" -- the extent to which those in similar circumstances will pay
similar tax burdens, and "vertical equity" -- how well those in
different classes bear different burdens in the tax structure in terms
of what is called "ability to pay."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span></small> It is
this latter perspective that leads to the use of terms like
"proportional," "progressive," and "regressive" in referring to tax
structures. A tax is progressive with respect to income if the ratio of
tax revenue to income rises when moving up the income scale,
proportional if the ratio is constant, and regressive if the ratio
declines. There is an ancillary question of whether taxing to reach
greater equity should employ measures of income or of wealth, difficult
as this is to measure.<br>
<small></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">15User fees, however, employ
another notion of fairness: benefit received, costs incurred or wear
imposed.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Administrability </span>refers to the ease with which a tax can be
administered and collected. Taxes which distort the economy are
inefficient as are taxes that cost lots to administer. This is measured
not only in the direct costs of tax avoidance and accounting expenses,
but in the level of evasion and cheating, and by the cost of government
auditing and policing.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small> When
the taxpaying public perceives that a tax is easily evaded, cumbersome,
and unfair, it loses its legitimacy and calls government itself into
question.<br>

<br>
This is why the principle of <span style="font-weight: bold;">simplicity
</span>is important: the more complex the tax design, the more lawyers
and accountants will find loopholes, encourage the appearance of
unfairness, and drive up the cost of its administration. With simple
taxes other parties cannot avoid paying their fair share, thereby
enhancing the legitimacy and hence the compliance of the tax system.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stability </span>refers to the
ability of a tax to produce revenue in the face of changing economic
circumstances. Income and sales taxes, for example, vary according to
phases in the economic cycle; the property tax, in contrast, is highly
stable regardless of the state of the economy.<br>
<br>
In assessing the value of a tax it is also important, of course, to
understand its potential to bring in revenue for the purposes of
government, usually deemed <span style="font-weight: bold;">revenue
sufficiency</span>. Income, sales and property taxes, along with
corporation taxes to a lesser extent, have come to be regarded as the
workhorses of the American revenue structure. But, as anti-tax
politicians are quick to note, the higher these taxes are, the more
they impose a drag on the economy. One recent study calculates that the
deadweight loss due to taxes in the American economy is equal to $1
trillion every year, about a sixth of the total GDP.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small> This
is why one should ponder whether to consider raising taxes which have
demonstrable distorting effects.<br>

<br>
Much of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">environmental
damage</span> we have witnessed in the 20th century can be laid
directly at the doorstep of faulty government policy, particularly
fiscal policy. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suburban
sprawl</span>, to take the instance of greatest
concern to us all now, results from two misapplications of fiscal
policy applied under police powers. 
<ul>
  <li>The first is the pricing motor
vehicle transportation service at only about a tenth of what it really
costs to drive.  </li>
  <li>The second is the design of our conventional property
tax which encourages the destructive practice of land speculation and
the centrifugal forces of sprawl.  </li>
</ul>
The argument needs to be developed in
two parts. Pricing transportation services properly are equally as
important as location pricing, as the two are, to a large extent,
reciprocals. In this report only the matter of property taxation is
addressed.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Land Tax is the Perfect Tax<br>
<br>
</span>It may therefore come as a surprise to many that the perfect tax
to students of tax theory is one imposed on land value alone.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Unlike the conventional property tax which
uses both land value and improvement value as its base, a tax on
landsites satisfies all the criteria of sound tax theory. </span>It is
highly stable, regardless of the state of the economy. It can always be
set to raise sufficient revenue, without undue burden. Because land
supply is inelastic, it cannot impose any economic distortions and it
is therefore totally neutral with respect to all economic choices.
Whatever tax is borne is capitalized in the value of the site parcel,
without in any way affecting its sale price, which of course is
determined by the market. Most importantly of all, studies have now
recognized that a tax levied on land according to its value is quite
progressive, contrary to much conventional wisdom.<small><span

<br>
To a land economist, the land value and any building value must be
regarded separately: each has its own economic dynamic. As to the land
component, one must understand that the value of that site is due not
to how the owner uses it but rather due to the activity of the whole
neighborhood or even the region. Any value which a land parcel accrues
above the cost of its creation is due to the accretion of what
economists call economic rent. The word rent has a very different
meaning than that used in everyday discourse. Since the community is
responsible for the rise or fall in the value of a land site, or rather
of all those in the neighborhood, any increase in the value of that
location can be reclaimed by that community more than by the
titleholder alone. Were it not for the accretion of land rent on a
parcel,<br>
all land would have the same market value.<br>
<br>
When one looks at the value of land in any broad way, its value will be
highest at the center and falls as one looks out to the frontier. The
highest value land, that with the greatest accrued rent, is at the very
center of the city -- usually where the commercial parcels are located.<strong>In the spring of 1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed)
of less than an acre and split in two pieces in New York City's <a
 name="Times_Square_"></a>Times
Square was sold by Prudential Life to Disney for an estimated $240
million,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small> more
than the value of all the land and buildings together in the lands north of the
Mohawk River/Erie Canal in New York State.</strong> The highest
value land is
typically surrounded by a belt of residential areas, and with farmlands
starting at the fringe. The more valuable parcels are taxed, the more
their titleholders will find ways to recover their carrying costs. And
it cannot affect the behavior of tenants as any change in burden is not
passed through. In this sense,
land value taxation fosters clustered development and reverses the
egregious patterns of sprawl. Jessica Matthews, now with the Council on
Foreign Relations, recently wrote a syndicated piece observing that, <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
In a now familiar sequence, developers reach for the cheapest land, out
in the cow pastures. Government is left to fill in behind with
brand-new infrastructure -- roads, sewerage systems and schools -- paid
for in part by those whose existing roads and schools are left to
decline. Property values rise in a ring that marches steadily outward
from the city and fall in older suburbs inside the moving edge.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
Because residential development can't meet the public bills, local
governments compete for commercial investment with tax discounts that
deplete their revenues still further. Property taxes then rise,
providing an incentive for new development.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
Years of such leapfrogging construction devours land at an astonishing
pace.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small></div>

Taxing high value land parcels encourages their efficient use. The
highest value parcels will then be settled at sufficient density that
public transportation services become economically viable -- experts
recognize that it typically takes at least 10-12 households per acre
for this to happen.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small> This
both relieves dependency upon motor vehicle transportation and enhances
the livability of communities. Taxing land alone also removes the
penalty for titleholders who want to improve their properties. Under
current property tax structures, one is penalized if one adds a garage,
an extra wing of rooms, or in any way makes an upgrade. This is
perverse: when people maintain and improve their homes and other
buildings it is a social and economic benefit.<br>

<br>
Taxing land by its value has many economic advantages. The first is
that it is equitable: those who have title to the most land value will
pay the most taxes; those who have no land pay no taxes. Because a tax
on land alone cannot be passed on to tenants, this means that all those
households that do not own their own home will pay no taxes. Nationally
only 65 percent of households are homeowners; in New York State, it's
only 52 percent.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small><br>
<small></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">22http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/homeown/tab1.html</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<br>
And since we know that it is typically the wealthier element of the
society that owns there is a certain fairness in this. Of those parcels
that currently pay taxes on their real property, about half are
homeowners, and the remainder are commercial, industrial, and
agricultural titleholders. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Agricultural
parcels </span>typically have very little market value because their
location is so remote; they would have little if any tax burden. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Commercial
parcels</span>, in contrast, are usually sited in very high value
locations, and therefore would pay the most. A shift of taxes away from
buildings and onto land alone typically relieves homeowners, and adds
to the burden of high value parcels (usually in commercial cores) that
are underused relative to their value -- fully depreciated structures,
parking lots, drive-in banks, gas stations, fast food services, and so
on.<br>
<br>
Equity for people whose incomes have suddenly changed is easily
maintained with site value taxation, such as the elderly.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic;">23 </span></small>Building, like cars or
any other manufactured items, typically depreciate over time, but land,
conversely, usually appreciates. More than twenty states have
instituted a system where people facing difficulty paying their
property tax can defer it. Such policies allow people to live in their
homes after they retire or if their incomes have fallen, and it opens
up housing markets for young families who might otherwise not yet have
means to purchase their first home. Then when they finally "cash out"
to move or go to retirement homes, the sale of their asset can be used
to pay the tax liability in full. This works much like a reverse
mortgage. It removes any special privilege for any given class of
taxpayers. <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">23See further discussion of this
below.</font></small></div>
<small><br>
</small>In addition, a land tax provides few loopholes and is hard to
evade. There is increasing evidence that many people are able to hide
their wealth and income from the tax collector by moving it offshore to
places like Monaco or the Cayman Islands. One can't move one's land to
another place. It is no accident that eight Nobel prizewinning
economists have endorse the idea of taxing site value.<small><span

<br>
Until recently there was concern that it was impossible to accurately
evaluate the market value of land parcels in the absence of sufficient
comparable sales data or when the site had improvements. This is no
longer a concern, largely due to the advances in computer databases
used for comparison and to the availability of computer programs such
as GIS (geographical information systems). In fact it is now easier to
assess the value of land than it is the value of buildings.<small><span

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Conventional Instruments of Fiscal Policy: An Assessment<br>
<br>
</span>Apart from strategies which rely upon police powers of
government to foster land use patterns consistent with the public good,
three instruments have been relied upon in recent years that are fiscal
in nature. The first is public purchase of land parcels so that they
will be held off the open market for development or else exempting them
from taxation so long as they are retained as farmland or open space. A
second is tax increment financing, and the third is impact fees. One
needs to ask in each case whether these measures are complementary or
antithetical to site value taxation's effects. Examination of the
administrative and economic dynamics of each, taken in conjunction with
the earlier discussion of site value taxation, will make clearer just
how compatible they are.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Open Space Preservation<br>
<br>
</span>These programs usually involve either direct purchase through
public money or provide for preferential and deferred assessment of
qualifying agricultural, forest or other open lands. When the land no
longer qualifies for the deferment or is sold, a tax is often due equal
to the amount by which the preferential valuation has reduced the
property tax for the previous several years. Farmland is eligible if it
is primarily devoted to agricultural use and meets certain farm income,
production and ownership requirements. Owners must file an application
for the deferment with the local assessor to receive the benefit. The
intention of the program is to relieve the pressure on titleholders to
sell their lands to developers for reason that the tax burdens are too
heavy for them to maintain.<br>
<br>
How it happens that land value has increased so much that its tax
burden is onerous to its owners is a frequently asked question. The
answer of course lies in the fact that site values are a function
largely of their geographic location, and when locations are such that
their value has greater potential use for use other than as
agricultural or open space, there is imminent pressure to develop them.
This is usually the consequence of development elsewhere, either
private or public, and of the fact that parcels in a new region
generally reflect increased value as well. The greatest single factor
in altering the locational value of a particular land site is the
provision of improved access. The development of a new highway, an
added interchange, a new shopping center, or other public facility will
immediately raise the value of all the sites in close proximity.
Farmland or open space exposed to the economic impact of these larger
forces will be subject to the pressures of development, even when the
gain is short term, the land use configurations wasteful and
irrational, and the added externalities argue against such use.
Policies can be instituted to discourage such pressures beforehand, and
taking such action is far more sound than trying to recover open space
later when it is later threatened with loss.<br>
<br>
Measures that have been adopted throughout the nation to address the
concern about wasteful and haphazard land development have been
expensive and questionably effective. The most expensive method of all
is for the public to buy up such parcels, typically at market price,
and protect them against development by ownership of title. Most often
the market price identified reflects the development in adjacent areas
and gain in value which titleholders have counted on as a speculative
investment. Buying open land seems to be the approach being taken in
New Jersey at the present time,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">26</span></small> and
is reflected in the "smart growth" program recently announced by Vice
President Al Gore.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27 </span></small>A
further variation on this is to place such parcels in a land trust,
such that their use is thereafter limited. This device is usually by
people who are looking to shelter otherwise taxable income gains. But,
whenever the parcels are purchased by either the public or various
conservation organizations, the practice is likely to reward the very
practices they are intended to resolve: they reward the titleholders
who in many instances have purchased the land years earlier and have
seen their values escalate. Now, at a time when concern has built over
the consequences of speculative land development, these very same
people are rewarded for their apparent foresight. This ignores the
underlying problem that prompted the behavior in the first place.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">26http://www.state.nj.us/sos99/tree.html</font></small><font size="-1"><br>
    <small>27http://smartgrowth.sustainable.org/library/gore_intro.html</small></font>
</div>
<br>
The core problem is that economic forces have been put in place that
drive development to the periphery of developed areas, fostering
further peripheral development. Whether attempts to address it by urban
growth boundaries, conservation trusts, public purchases, tax deferrals
and exemptions, or other devices, all purport to answer the problem in
the face of its continuing, and even growing, pressure. Changing the
economic dynamics which bring about such behavior are what needs
exploration. The study of land economics shows that the answer lies in
the recovery of land rent in areas of greatest appreciating gain,
thereby making urban high-value parcels more economically competitive
with the outlying areas, and reversing the centrifugal forces that are
currently at work. This entails a greater understanding by the public
of how land values influence land use configurations, as well as how
cross subsidies due to tax policy designs, transportation services and
externalized public costs engender sprawl development and threaten open
space. Graphical maps are able to show how differential land values
make development more feasible in outlying areas, particularly when the
public foots the bill for the infrastructure services.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Tax Increment Financing</span><br>
<br>
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is a typically a state-enacted&nbsp;<small></small>statutory
procedure available to cities and counties to encourage the
redevelopment of blighted, conservation or economic development areas.
The TIF statute authorizes the governing body of a city or county to
adopt a redevelopment plan providing for the redevelopment of a
designated area and to use tax increment financing to fund the costs of
redevelopment projects in the same designated area. The method of
financing involves the issuance of bonds or other obligations which are
secured by a pledge of all or part of funds deposited in a special
allocation, or earmarked, fund. The special allocation fund is funded
with payments, in lieu of taxes, attributable to the increase in
assessed valuation of taxable real property within a designated area
resulting from redevelopment improvements.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">28Eric Kassoff, "Tax Increment
Financing Development Districts," Land Use Law and Zoning Digest, January, 1991,

Increment Financing, Report #389, Chicago: Planners Press, American
Planning Association, 1985.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<br>
The theory of TIF is that by encouraging redevelopment projects the
assessed valuation of real property in a redevelopment area will
increase. When a TIF plan is adopted, the assessed valuation of real
property in the redevelopment area is frozen for tax purposes at the
current base level prior to construction of improvements. The owner of
the property continues to pay property taxes at this base level. As the
property is improved, the assessed value of real property in the
demarcated redevelopment area increases above the base level. By
applying the tax rate of all taxing districts having power within the
redevelopment area to the increase in assessed valuation of the
improved property over the base level, a "tax increment" is produced.
The tax increments, often referred to as "payments in lieu of taxes"
(or pilots), are transferred by the collecting agency to the treasurer
of the city or county and deposited in a special allocation fund.
Revenues in the fund are used to directly pay for project costs or to
retire bonds or other obligations issued to pay project costs.<br>
<br>
Few states, it appears, have made greater use of tax increment
financing than Minnesota.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small> But
after more than twenty years of experience, there is little
demonstrable evidence that such programs have been effective in
bringing about their professed purposes. A considerable amount of study
has been undertaken with the expectation of refining established
practices. Concern is frequently expressed that the provisions are
employed in areas where development would not otherwise have taken
place, or where it might have evolved in any case. There is frequent
mention of the fact that such projects are undertaken in response to
special interest pressures, favoring well-situated parties that would
be equipped to undertake enterprises anyway. The
programs that exist, now established in 44 states, take rational
initiative out of the hands of economic players and place it in the
hands of political leaders who may or may not be responsive to general
public interest concerns. To be sure, a large number of consulting
firms have established themselves to profit by guiding the various
players through the intricacies of various TIF programs. But there is
little evidence to show, apart from the professions of parties
intimately tied to the success of such ventures, that they would be
successful were they left to their own initiative.<br>

<br>
Without getting into the details of the programs in Minnesota per se,
two more general discussions are suggestive of the current views of
disinterested students of tax increment financing. Penelope Lemov, the
highly regarded public finance reporter for Governing Magazine, knows
the sentiments of local and state officials throughout the nation. In
her last review of the subject in 1994, she concluded that these were
"tough times for TIFs," and that credit agencies were increasingly
looking askance at their value.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">30 </span></small>Particular
attention was paid in this article to the difficulties that Minnesota
has experienced. The view was expressed, reflective of many of her
contacts throughout the nation, that TIFs were not typically able to
recover the costs of their investment, particularly inasmuch as revenue
that would have been allotted to other taxing authorities was diverted
to the earmarked TIFs, and in consequence depressing the economic
activity of the neighboring areas. A more recent study released by the
Public Policy Institute of California casts strong doubt on TIF
successes.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">31</span></small>
The conclusion stated that <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Redevelopment projects do not increase
property values by enough to account for the tax increment revenues
they receive. Overall, the agencies stimulated enough growth to cover
just about half of those tax revenues.<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The rest resulted from local trends and
would have gone to other jurisdictions in the absence of redevelopment.

Another study done on the efficacy of TIFs in Pittsburgh was undertaken
by a team of reporters for the Pittsburgh Tribune Review in 1998.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">32</span></small> In a
series of three long articles, the conclusion was drawn that projects
there had a mixed success at best and were so fraught with political
intrigue that it was impossible to ascertain whether they would have
been compelling in the
absence of such interventions. Much of the uncertainty about the
security of TIF approaches depends upon leveraging land sites as an
asset in securing greater financing. But land values are very much
subject to fluctuations and forces beyond the immediate environment.
They are, rather, a consequence of the vitality of local and regional
economics, and may take unpredictable turns after initial arrangements
have been made.<br>
<small></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">32By Rich Lord, September 20-24,

<br>
One could certainly argue that, if a TIF is likely to be effective in
redeveloping one area of a locality, why should it not be employed in
other areas as well, or universally. Picking favored enterprises
through administrative or political intervention, and without the
general input of elements of the public that stand to pay the costs,
removes decisions from the hand of the free market, precisely in whose
name such projects are often undertaken. If the proverbial "level
playing field" is to be the framework in which enterprises are to be
judged, every effort needs first to be made to foster that leveling.
TIFs work in exactly the opposite manner, with mixed results. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Impact Fees</span><br>
<br>
Impact fees are fees assessed by municipalities to developers for costs
associated with off-site improvements necessitated as a result of the
proposed development.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">33</span></small>
Typically the improvements are transportation infrastructure, but they
can be used for the recovery of benefits associated with investments in
water and sewer, telecommunications utilities, or other cost recovery
which can be delineated by a specific area and administered by a levy
on property. Unlike TIFs, however, impact fees involve guarantees of
income return and can be added on rather than substituted for other
revenue sources. Furthermore, they mostly apply to recovering costs
associated with capital improvements only, and allow recovery of
administrative and related expenses, but not maintenance expenses. They
are seldom, if ever, used to correct existing deficiencies or fiscal
problems in infrastructure development. Rather, they apply only to new
and enhanced development. Impact fees are usually collected from users
of infrastructure improvements according to their estimated
proportional use at the time the facilities are authorized for
construction or occupancy.<br>

Association, 1991; Patricia E. Salkin (ed.), Impact Fees for New York
Municipalities: Time for Legislative Action?. Government Law Center,
Albany Law School, April, 1991.</font></small></div>
<br>
In this way, the increased burden on parcel titleholders in the defined
benefit area is reflective of the added value that stems from the
infrastructure service. The greater the infrastructure investment, the
greater also is the benefit in the area serviced. Although the
administration of an impact fee structure typically involves forecasts
of both investment costs and revenue requirements, it is a foregone
conclusion that they will be in rough balance or else the project will
not be undertaken. Although the design of an impact fee is frequently
related to an existing tax on real property, imposed in the same way a
surtax would be, this is not necessarily so. For example, the recovery
of benefit for a project may also be secured through data on trip
generation of commercial facilities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">34</span></small> It
may be based on a proxy indicator such as the consumption of water.
Impact fees may even be linked to special benefit districts programs
such as police patrols or fire prevention services. On the other hand,
when services are each earmarked to specifically defined funds, the
efficiency of their administration is typically reduced. The
relationship between costs incurred and benefits received is
necessarily approximate, and, as the revenue principles noted above
suggest, whatever may be gained in attempts to achieve equity is likely
to be lost in the administration of greater complexity.<br>

Fees of this nature are evaluated somewhat differently than are taxes
more generically defined. Tax equity is typically measured according to
ability-to-pay criteria; user and benefit fee equity, on the other
hand, has no relationship to one's ability to pay, and may even
conflict with it. User fees, in contrast, are usually evaluated
according to the criteria of costs or damage incurred or benefits
received.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">35</span></small>

Coupling Conventional Instruments with Site Value Taxation</span><br>
<br>
Land values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend
also to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey
map. In the city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to
a mountain peak. As one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes have been provided in the
proximate areas.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small> Thus,
staying with the topographical comparison, a typical metropolitan area
would show hills at neighborhood centers, with land sloping away to
areas of lower value, with ridges and ripples of various elevations
extending away from cities marking the transportation corridors where
contiguous land areas are more attractive to use. Continuing out, a
topographical model shows less and less height, symbolizing lower and
lower value, ultimately to reach the hypothetical point where no
potential buyers exist at all.<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">37This is discussed in detail in

<br>
Of course many public policies have distorted the market values of land
areas, and maps can show patterns reflecting divergences from what
logic and economic theory would suggest. The influence of land
speculation, choosing consciously to hold certain attractive and
valuable parcels off the market with the hope of securing high sale
prices, has had a profound effect on the configuration of our urban
areas and accounting for the now ubiquitous problem of sprawl.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span></small> This
makes more complex any portrayal of land values in a region, even
though it remains true that locations tend to rise or fall
relationally. The combined effect of not adequately recovering land
rent in taxes, a tax which penalizes improvements, and underpricing
motor vehicle transportation has changed the gradient in land values in
urban areas profoundly. The result is that there typically exists in
most regions a patchwork of differential land values that sprawl over
the landscape in ways that defy both efficient performance and use
configurations as well as logic.<br>

<br>
In a land use configuration with no property taxes to distort uses, no
subsidies to transportation services, and no constraints on use of
certain parcels or areas, one would likely find that the slope of land
values from core to peripheral regions would be both gradual and
uninterrupted. Remote areas typically used for agriculture or forest
will have the lowest values, but closer to the central areas site
values would rise sharply. Today instead one more often finds parcels
used ostensibly for agriculture but which are really being held for
speculative gain. Whether the visions for their use are residential
suburbs or commercial shopping facilities, this patchwork is likely to
be determined by the existence of other developments, the presence of
transportation, communication, and water and sewer infrastructure, as
well as more indeterminate factors such as zoning.<br>
<br>
The result is that there is no simple way a priori by which to
determine whether or not (or where) there will be disjunctures in the
land value and/or tax burdens between current levy systems and site
value taxation. Current configurations are random even if the latter
have a logic. The only answer is a piecemeal test of each prospective
application, even where other refinements have been proposed and tried.
The greatest disparities are likely to be in what parcels are
identified as open space "green acres," because their current tax
burden is determined largely by their use, whereas under a site value
system their market value (and hence assessed value) is determined far
more by their location. Centrally and strategically located parcels
identified as green acres in densely developed areas would likely be
taxed more heavily under a site value regime. Absent measures to insure
their remaining open, they are likely to be improved. On the other
hand, holding those sites vacant frequently enhances the market value
of adjacent parcels so much that there is no necessary loss of revenue
to the public where the former are preserved as natural. The enhanced
value of developed areas overlooking untaxed parkland often more than
makes up for whatever loss of revenue those vacant sites might have
provided.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">39</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">39An illustration of this
      has
just unfolded in New York City in
the spring of 1999, where Mayor Giuliani proposed that the publicly
owned vacant parcels being used by neighborhoods as "community gardens" be sold
and developed as private properties to add to the tax roll. The neighborhoods
arose in vehement resistance, and won to retain their
gardens. They were able to show that those vacant parcels more than
contributed to the added tax base of the city as well as fostering
neighborhood solidarity and safety by their existence.</font></small></div>
<br>
With respect to the existence of TIFs in certain demarcated localities,
it is not just that their tax revenue is often sequestered and
earmarked to honor the retirement of bonding. What also happens is that
the revenue base, and hence the parcel values, is distorted as well.
The combination of economic and legal factors interfering with the
natural market pricing of parcels means that there is again no a priori
way to ascertain how revenue structures will be affected. The legal
contracts governing such revenue streams are binding, and are likely to
prevail over any attempts to apply site value taxation in an equitable
fashion.<br>
<br>
This should not be taken, however, as an argument against the
implementation of site value taxation, far from it. The distortions in
tax equity and in land use configuration wrought by the current
policies are likely to continue and further exacerbate the imbalances
evident at the present time. There is no consolation or advantage to
continuing policies that are misguided if indeed those policies are
likely to create increased and more insurmountable difficulties at a
later time. Speaking conceptually, democracy finds it hard to direct a
society to specific goals because it is engaged in "process" politics
as opposed to "systems" politics: <br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">As the name implies, process politics
    emphasizes the adequacy and fairness of the rules governing the process
    of politics. If the process is fair, then, as in a trial conducted
    according to due process, the outcome is assumed to be just -- or at
    least the best the system can achieve. By contrast, systems politics is
    concerned primarily with desired outcomes; means are subordinated to
    predetermined ends.<small><span

<br>
If the criteria of fairness changes, as happens with the application of
site value taxation, the challenge is even more formidable, and
leadership, education, and luck are needed more than ever.<br>
<br>
It is likely that impact fees are the easiest provision to align with
site value taxation of the three instruments just discussed. One could
argue that impact fees are simply a variant of site value taxation for
a delimited spatial area. Because site values are a function of their
proximity to other features that have a mutually reinforcing value,
they reflect the presence of infrastructure attributes just as they do
other attractions. Indeed the replacement of impact fees with site
value taxation is likely to more accurately reflect actual benefits
received, as frequently the boundaries of an impact fee benefit
district either are arbitrarily drawn or have changed over time. Hence
it is that those people who reap the benefit of a service facility may
not always be those who bear their proper share of its burden.
Eliminating the boundary of an impact fee district rectifies this
potential disparity and restores the equity implicit in an impact fee's
design.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Phasing In Site Value Taxation</span><br>
<br>
In most instances, the technical implementation of site value taxation
involves little more than a ten-minute computer adjustment such that a
tax rate is applied solely to the land value component of a parcel's
assessment rather than to the total (land and improvement) value taken
as a whole. This assumes, of course that assessments are tolerably
accurate and reliable, but, if they are not, the same objection would
obtain with reference to the conventional property tax design. Indeed
if an assessment is performed well, the land value component is more
likely to be accurate than the improvement component.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">41 </span><br
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">41The value of land parcels
      are
separately determined, but this is not
always so. If assessment of property are properly done, land should not
be treated as the "residual" value remaining after whatever calculation
is arrived at on the improvement. This is often regarded as a critical
mistake made by assessors, and accounts for the often undervaluing land
in conventional practice. Knowledgeable assessors realize full well,
however, that land values must be arrived at separately.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<small></small><br>
Addressing issues of politics and equity involved in the transition are
more difficult. Because the conventional property tax would be
gradually replaced by a tax on site value alone, it is important to
recognize how various elements of the population typically fare under
such a change. The shift toward site value taxation involves gradually
raising the proportion of revenue yield from the land value base while
lowering the revenue yield from improvements in revenue neutral
fashion. Several generalizations can be drawn from experiences and
simulations performed elsewhere. When aggregate improvement values are
calculated as a ratio to aggregate land values, one derives a figure (a
ratio typically between 2:1 and 3:1 improvements to land) which can
serve as a quick index determining which parcel holders will pay higher
taxes and which will pay less. Those parcels with a higher-than-average
ratio of improvement values to land values will find themselves with
lower taxes; conversely, those with a lower-than-average ratio will pay
more in taxes.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Generally speaking
residential parcel owners end up receiving a lower tax bill, sometimes
substantially lower. This is because residential parcels are typically
situated not in the highest value locations but rather midway between
the center and the rural sections of a municipality.</span> Moreover,
residential parcels have a relatively small footprint: they are
essentially a house, a curtilage, and perhaps a small garden. The
highest value parcels are typically business locations, chosen
precisely for their strategic access. It is this which makes them
valuable. Under site value taxation these business parcels typically
pay higher taxes. But, as will be shown in the more elaborate
explanation below, this constitutes no penalty to their success.
Households that do not own their own homes, apartment tenants, will
have no property tax burden shifted to them at all. This is because, as
earlier explained, the inelastic character of land means that any
increased tax burdens placed upon it is simply capitalized in the
market value of the parcel. Agricultural and woodland parcels in the
more remote locations typically see negligible tax burdens, because the
land value gradient falls so far -- from central business districts, to
residential neighborhoods, to rural areas -- that the effect frequently
is to unburden these parcel titleholders almost entirely.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Alleviating Special-Case Hardships</span><br>
<br>
Because any transition to site value taxation necessarily catches some
titleholders in the position of having to abide by a changed set of
rules, ones which they would not have bought into had they been in
place when their original locational choice was made, there is justice
in phasing in any tax on site values in incremental steps. If, for
example, 35 percent of all the property tax base in a municipality
represented the land component under the existing property tax, this
could be shifted gradually so that initially 50 percent of the revenue
was drawn from land and improvements each. This would entail two rates:
one rate imposed on the land value component and one on the improvement
value component. A year or two thereafter, the percentage yield from
the land might be increased once more, to 65 percent, and gradually
higher until such time that improvements were exempt from the burden of
taxation entirely.<br>
<br>
In the overwhelming number of instances, parcel holders' tax burdens
shift only a few points or dollars. The "tails" of the distribution see
great changes in their tax bills. Those that have a very high ratio of
building to land value will experience large reductions in their tax
burden. Those, on the other hand that have a low ratio of building to
land, or alternatively have title to vacant parcels with high site
value, will experience large increases in their tax burdens.<br>
<br>
Even though only a small proportion of the sites will experience
changes, there is merit, perhaps also justice, in adding special
provisions to address cases of <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">undue hardship</span>. One does
not want, for example, to have so sudden and grave a shift in the tax
burden that certain titleholders are unable to pay their bills.
Furthermore, it is counterproductive to a municipality to shift its
rate so quickly that real estate markets are disrupted. To address
special circumstances, it has often been proposed that any parcel
experiencing an increase in burden over 3 percent in a given year will
be held to that limit. That guarantee would affect only a miniscule
number of parcels and can serve to relieve any resentment and anxiety
that otherwise might eventuate.<br>
<br>
Another difficulty is often expressed with respect to <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">elderly or indigent homeowners</span>
that are threatened with eviction from their homes for lack of ability
to pay. While this circumstance in no way relates only to situations
for site value taxation -- it can arise even under the current
conventional property tax structure --the fairest and economically most
efficient solution is what is known as tax deferral. Property tax
deferral programs offer a far more equitable alternative than
provisions such as the more commonly known homestead exemption,
especially if it is agreed that senior citizens should be relieved of a
portion of their tax burden while they continue to live in their homes.
These operate much as reverse mortgages and relieve homeowners of the
burden of heavy taxation when their incomes can ill afford it. Such
programs are designed for elderly homeowners who are equity-rich but
cash-poor. Taxes are owed to a locality until the equity in the
property is liquidated, and then paid off in full, usually with
interest. Deferral programs are available to elderly homeowners in
twenty-one states.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">42</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">42In five of these states
      the
programs are offered at the option of
local governments. Fifteen of these states require qualifying
homeowners to meet income eligibility guidelines, and six make the
programs available to elderly homeowners of all income levels. State
Tax Policy &amp; Senior Citizens, Second Edition. Washington: National
Conference of State Legislatures, December, 1994, pp. 52 ff.</font></small><font size="-1"></font></div>
<small><br>
</small>Because senior homeowners typically capitalize their lifetime
incomes into their property during their working years, most in
retirement are "house rich" even if they are "income poor." Although as
yet there has been little discussion in this vein, analogies might be
made to retirement pensions, wherein assets are accumulated during
one's most productive years, exempt from taxation, to be "spent down"
during one's retirement years and taxed. If concern is only to avoid
forcing retirees to relinquish their homes, many more equitable ways of
doing so are possible. Retirement homeownership can be thought of as
the same kind of "spend down" when employed with reverse mortgages and
property tax deferral programs.<br>
<small></small><br>
If one examines the financial resources of households relative to their
age, one is likely to find that senior citizens are the wealthiest
segment of the population, even if their income as such is less.
Households with growing families usually have comparatively less
wealth, even if they have greater income. Yet as a matter of policy,
legislatures have typically elected not to tax wealth except in the
form of estate taxes. And much of a home's value, reflected in the
appreciation of the land value, is the consequence of the public not
recovering the economic rent. The increased value that typically
accrues to homeowners is solely in the land component (the building
depreciates in value), likely making it their greatest asset. But,
following the theory upon which the concept of economic rent is
grounded, it is an asset which is a result of community enterprise, not
something earned by the individual parcel holder. Taxing that rent
means both that there would be less appreciation and that tax burdens
reflecting the property value would not inflate over time.<br>
<br>
Senior citizens have shown a marked reluctance to relinquish these
windfall nest eggs they accumulate over the course of a lifetime --
preferring to hold them either as private safety nets or to pass onto
heirs. In fact they often come to regard this as their rightful due.
Yet whenever certain elements of the population are favored as to
housing privileges, others necessarily are not. In view of the large
number of households that cannot afford home ownership at all,
fostering this level of "overhousing" for favored groups is
economically inefficient and arguably unfair. Public policy issues are
implicit in such decisions that warrant discussion, and programs should
be implemented that encourage rational behavior, even if certain people
may sometimes choose to behave irrationally. Deferral programs deal
with all these problems effectively by diffusing the issue of
intergenerational equity. Offering deferral programs to senior
homeowners alleviates any appearance of injustice about property tax
burdens, and makes any discontent less credible. <br>
<br>
If deferral programs are to be available for senior citizens 65 and
over, there is no reason in principle why they should not be available
to others as well -- people who are temporarily unemployed, for
example. There are many instances where the circumstances of homeowners
change precipitously, and simple equity calls for the application of
such programs without discrimination as to age. But other programs
intended to relieve hardship often incur just as many inequities as
they are intended to resolve. The widely known "circuit breaker" offers
a case in point. The circuit breaker is intended to relieve the tax
burden for people whose payment exceeds a specified percentage of
household income.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small>
Because residential sites, and the costs of living, vary so much from
place to place,<small style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">4</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> the
parameters are frequently set so widely that, as described earlier,
those eligible can be "house rich" even if they are "income poor." Just
as deferral offers a suitable solution for other instances where the
burdens are disproportionate, they are an efficient alternative to
homestead or circuit breaker programs.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">43Household income is defined in
a variety of ways from state to state, sometimes including social
security payments and sometimes not.</font></small><font size="-1"><br>
<small>44In many states the difference in median residential home
values varies as much as six or seven times from metropolitan to rural areas, accounted for not by the cost
of the building but rather by that of the land. State statutes
addressing concerns over equity usually establish thresholds so high
that they provide windfalls to residents in low land-value areas as
they concern themselves with the burdens of others in more expensive
areas.</small><br>
<small>45However, the circuitbreaker provision does nothing to remove
the distortion in land use wrought by the tax structure.</small></font></div>
<br>
Still other ways of alleviating the burden of land taxes, just as for
the conventional property tax, involve the timing of tax payments.
Discounts can be offered for early payment, for example, the opposite
of surcharge penalties added for late payment. Payments can be spaced
monthly or quarterly rather than paid on an annual basis. This is
especially attractive where bankers hold no mortgage and do not
maintain escrow accounts for all maintenance payments such as
insurance, utilities, etc. If zoning changes are instituted that in any
way alter the use or value of a site, revaluation might be guaranteed
and paid for by the taxing authority. Partial exemptions may be
provided for uses of sites consistent with expressly public purposes.
Lastly, partial rebates can be provided for those whose circumstances
change, or where structures have been damaged or demolished. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Equity of Site Value Taxation</span><br>
It is important to address the matter forthrightly of who "wins" and
who "loses" with site value taxation. The greatest proportion of
winners are those who own no real property at all: tenant households.
In the conventional property tax system, the tax component that rests
on the improvement portion of a property parcel is passed on to the
tenant in increased rent. Tenants, one should note, are in most
instances financially the least well off elements of the society, and
for them the added rent reflected in the tax passed forward can be
considerable. The tax on the land component, reflecting the
inelasticity of land supply, cannot be passed forward, and its
incidence is borne solely by the owner of the land. Relieving this
component of the population of any property tax burden makes this tax
substantially more progressive than it is for the conventional property
tax. Nationally, approximately 65 percent of all households own their
own home. <br>
<br>
As to the burden added to business parcels that occupy high value
locations and which typically would receive an increase in their
payment, capitalization of their taxes in the value of their parcels
exerts a downward pressure on market values. However, there is a
countervailing pressure that also operates: the incentive to all
parcels in a neighborhood to improve to the full extent that the added
carrying costs warrant (particularly the least efficiently used parcels
relative to their value) tends to make the aggregate value of all the
land in a neighborhood increase in collective fashion. Site value
taxation often tends in fact to exert an upward market pressure on land
value that is higher than the downward pressures explained by the tax
burden. The total tax effect then tends to be neutralized, with a
result that all the parcels in a neighborhood tend to be better used
and maintained. Studies show the power of land value taxation to induce
economic development. One by Oates and Schwab shows by comparative
counts of building permits issued in Pennsylvania cities that do and do
not employ site value taxation. Those cities with SVT had profoundly
higher number of building permits issued in comparable periods of time.<small><span

<br>
A final point to note is that most businesses in commercial districts
do not own their own buildings; they rent. This means that the actual
tenants, whether they are commercial, light industrial, office service
or even residential, will typically see little if any change in their
tax burdens on account of the shift to SVT. With respect to the owners
of those sites, the rates for the rental of floor space that they set
is determined not by the amount of the tax burden but rather by the
rental price per square foot over a wider region. All that can possibly
eventuate is that the differential between the income received from the
payment of tenants and the carrying costs of building maintenance and
debt service may be reduced.&nbsp; Should that happen it will be at
most a gradual adjustment over a lengthy period. The destructive
inclination to speculate in land, however, is strongly reduced,
consequently improving urban ambience by attention to vacant land
parcels of high value.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span><br>
<br>
Americans all appear to be losers to the property tax in at least one
sense of the term. There is an incalculable dead weight loss associated
with the appeal system, the burdensome administration, the resentment
and alienation alone that naturally accompanies such a design. This
needs to be pointed out, in addition to the further distortions in land
use configurations wrought by such a design.<br>
<br>
Typically residential parcels represent somewhere in the vicinity of
half of all real property taxes paid. And homeowners, being
particularly sensitive to and aware of their property tax burdens,
understandably are aroused. Data is only now being assembled to show
this distribution on a state and national basis, but it is quite clear
that, although the proportions vary widely, that represented by Olmsted
County would rest at the highest end of the spectrum. The result of
such a profile is not only to burden the households with taxes they
both feel the weight of, it also feeds resentment of government,
encourages "Nimbyism" ("not in my back yard"), and fosters land use
configurations that force people to spend more of their after-tax
income in ways to accommodate the dislocations which the tax structure
has created.<br>
<br>
Secondly, those households that do not own their own homes are burdened
with taxes that are passed to them as tenants, and these are people
typically the least able to sustain such tax burdens of any in the
locality. They suffer not only the weight of the tax burden but also
the fact that government resources are constrained to serve them
through adequate public services. Urban cores, far from having the
highest tax bases from which to draw revenue are instead hamstrung in
their development by the Alphonse/Gaston games played between
governments and urban land holders.<br>
<br>
Non-residential titleholders also face uncertain fortunes that
discourage their willingness to make commitments to their holdings,
fearful that the level of risk involved is so high that they are better
rewarded to follow trends in the making elsewhere. And those other
trends are likely at the periphery of urban areas where ever expanding
rings of growth away from the center offer a more assured level of
financial return. Lastly farmers, caught between the pressures to sell
their holdings lucrative gain and the uncertainties imposed on them by
international agricultural markets, are tempted to sell while they can,
not knowing whether the future will be better or worse. Quality of life
takes a back seat to immediate returns and the promises of financial
security. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There are few real
"winners" in a poorly designed property tax system. The costs imposed
on society by the ill considered but once-established templates
scratched into the land are permanent, and in many cases irreversible. </span><br>
<br>
The feasibility of site value taxation in the current context, however,
is hardly better than the choice of considering the patterns that are
now in place. Urban areas that developed their configurations prior to
the advent of the automobile have shown an ability to employ SVT
effectively and with skill. And in circumstances where patterns of land
use are not yet established, site value taxation is demonstrably
effective, defining a sense of place that quickly establish their
identities. In regions that have developed premised first of all on
motor vehicle transportation, the challenge is far more difficult. The
metaphor of changing horses in mid-stream is very apt. Going back is
impossible, but going forward is equally daunting. Leadership and
planning are premium qualities facing societies with such challenges.<br>
<br>
More than any time during the past century, tax policy has come to
dominate the political agenda in American society, and the public seems
particularly unaware, even more than for other realms of public policy,
of the framework by which to think about it. One student of tax policy,
Michael J. Graetz, has written a book entitled <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Decline (and Fall?) of the Income Tax</span>,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">47</span></small> and
will issue a second shortly entitled [the] <span
 style="font-style: italic;">U.S. Income Tax: What it is, How it Got
that Way, and Where we Go from Here.<small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">48</span></small></span> But although the
income tax and its various forms dominate the national agenda, it is
the property tax that has become the focus of the state and local
government discourse.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It is
not simply a matter of what mode of taxation should be considered, just
as important is the level of government that should be responsible for
services to be provided.</span> This necessarily entails a discussion
of the finance of such services. For the first time perhaps in half a
century, Americans are being forced to consider their framework of
government, and the role that government should play. With it, of
course, is an examination of the scope, weight and domain of
government, something which is as much a matter of economic discussion
as it is one of politics.<br>
