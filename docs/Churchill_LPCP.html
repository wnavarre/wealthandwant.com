<p><b>Land Price as a Cause of Poverty</b> </p>
<p>Winston Churchill's Speech in the House
    of Commons, 4 May 1909,<br>
    in response to Mr A.J. Balfour, Leader of the Opposition
</p>
</center>
<p>The immemorial custom of nearly every modern State, the mature
conclusions of many of the greatest thinkers, have placed the tenure,
transfer, and obligations of land in a wholly different category from
other classes of property. The mere obvious physical distinction
between land, which is a vital necessity of every human being and
which at the same time is strictly limited in extent, and other
property is in itself sufficient to justify a clear differentiation
in its treatment, and in the view taken by the State of the
conditions which should govern the tenure of land from that which
should regulate traffic in other forms of property.</p>
<p><a name="Unearned Increment"></a><b>Unearned Increment</b></p>
<p>When the Leader of the Opposition seeks by comparisons to show
that the same reasoning which has been applied to land ought also in
logic and by every argument of symmetry to be applied to the unearned
increment derived from other processes which are at work in our
modern civilisation, he only shows by each example he takes how
different are the conditions which attach to the possession of land
and speculation in the value of land from those which attach to other
forms of business speculation.</p>
<p>"If," he inquires, "you tax the unearned increment on land, why
don't you tax the unearned increment from a large block of stock? I
buy a piece of land; the value rises. I buy stocks; their value
rises." But the operations are entirely dissimilar. In the first
speculation the unearned increment derived from land arises from a
wholly sterile process, from the mere withholding of a commodity
which is needed by the community. In the second case, the investor in
a block of shares does not withhold from the community what the
community needs. The one operation is in restraint of trade and in
conflict with the general interest, and the other is part of a
natural and healthy process, by which the economic plant of the world
is nourished and from year to year successfully and notably
increased.</p>
<p><a name="Landowner and Railway Co."></a><b>Landowner and Railway
Co.</b></p>
<p>Then the right hon. gentleman instanced the case of a new railway
and a country district enriched by that railway. The railway, he
explained, is built to open up a new district; and the farmers and
landowners in that district are endowed with unearned increment in
consequence of the building of the railway. But if after a while
their business aptitude and industry create a large carrying trade,
then the railway, he contends, gets its unearned increment in its
turn.</p>
<p>But the right hon. gentleman cannot call the increment unearned
which the railway acquires through the regular service of carrying
goods, rendering a service on each occasion in proportion to the
tonnage of goods it carries, making a profit by an active extension
of the scale of its useful business - he cannot surely compare that
process with the process of getting rich merely by sitting still? It
is clear that the analogy is not true.</p>
<p><a name="The Glasgow Example"></a><b>The Glasgow Example</b></p>
<p>I do not think the Leader of the Opposition could have chosen a
more unfortunate example than Glasgow. He said that the demand of
that great community for land was for not more than forty acres a
year. Is that the only demand of the people of Glasgow for land? Does
that really represent the complete economic and natural demand for
the amount of land a population of that size requires to live on? I
will admit that at present prices it may be all that they can afford
to purchase in the course of a year. But there are one hundred and
twenty thousand persons in Glasgow who are living in one-room
tenements; and we are told that the utmost land those people can
absorb economically and naturally is forty acres a year.</p>
<p>What is the explanation? Because the population is congested in
the city the price of land is high upon the suburbs, and because the
price of land is high upon the suburbs the population must remain
congested within the city. That is the position which we are
complacently assured is in accordance with the principles which have
hitherto dominated civilised society.</p>
<p><a name="The &quot;Poor Widow&quot; Bogey"></a><b>The "Poor Widow"
Bogey</b></p>
<p>But when we seek to rectify this system, to break down this
unnatural and vicious circle, to interrupt this sequence of
unsatisfactory reactions, what happens? We are not confronted with
any great argument on behalf of the owner. Something else is put
forward, and it is always put forward in these cases to shield the
actual landowner or the actual capitalist from the logic of the
argument or from the force of a Parliamentary movement.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">the widow</span>.
But that personality has been used to
exhaustion. It would be sweating in the cruellest sense of the word,
overtime of the grossest description, to bring the widow out again so
soon. She must have a rest for a bit; so instead of the widow we have
<span style="font-weight: bold;">the market-gardener</span> -- the
market-gardener liable to be disturbed on
the outskirts of great cities, if the population of those cities
expands, if the area which they require for their health and daily
life should become larger than it is at present.</p>
<p>What is the position disclosed by the argument? On the one hand,
we have one hundred and twenty thousand persons in Glasgow occupying
one-room tenements; on the other, the land of Scotland. Between the
two stands the market-gardener, and we are solemnly invited, for the
sake of the market-gardener, to keep that great population congested
within limits that are unnatural and restricted to an annual supply
of land which can bear no relation whatever to their physical,
social, and economic needs -- and all for the sake of the
market-gardener, who can perfectly well move farther out as the city
spreads and who would not really be in the least injured.<br>
