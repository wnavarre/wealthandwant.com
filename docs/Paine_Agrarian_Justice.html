        <p>Author's Inscription:</p>
        <p><em>To the Legislature and the Executive Directory of the French              Republic</em></p>
        <p>The plan contained in this work is not adapted for any particular              country alone: the principle on which it is based is general. But as              the rights of man are a new study in this world, and one needing              protection from priestly imposture, and the insolence of oppressions              too long established, I have thought it right to place this little              work under your safeguard. When we reflect on the long and dense night in this which France              and all Europe have remained plunged by their governments and their              priests, we must feel less surprise than grief at the bewilderment              caused by the first burst of light that dispels the darkness. The              eye accustomed to darkness can hardly bear at first the broad              daylight. It is by usage the eye learns to see, and it is the same              in<strong> </strong>passing from any situation to its opposite.</p>
        <p>As we have not at one instant renounced all our errors, we cannot              at one stroke acquire knowledge of all our rights. France has had              the honor of adding to the word <em>Liberty</em> that of <em>Equality</em>; and this              word signifies essentially a principle that admits of no gradation              in the things to which it applies. But equality is often              misunderstood, often misapplied, and often violated.</p>
        <p><em>Liberty</em> and <em>Property</em> are words expressing all those of our              possessions which are not of an intellectual nature. There are two              kinds of property. Firstly, natural property, or that which comes to              us from the Creator of the universe &#8212; such as the earth, air,              water. Secondly, artificial or acquired property &#8212; the invention or              men. In  the latter, equality is impossible; for to distribute it              equally it would be necessary that all should have contributed in               the same proportion, which can never be the case; and this              being the case, every individual would hold on to his own property,              as his right share. Equality of natural property is the subject of              this little essay. Every individual in  the world is born              therein with legitimate claims on a certain kind of property, or its              equivalent. </p>
        <p>The right of voting for persons charged with the execution of the              laws that govern society is inherent in  the word liberty, and              constitutes the equality of personal rights. But even if that right              (of voting) were inherent in  property, which I deny, the right              of suffrage would still belong to all equally, because, as I have              said, all individuals have legitimate birthrights in a certain              species of property.</p>
        <p>I have always considered the present Constitution of the French              Republic the <em>best organized system</em> the human mind has yet produced.              But I hope my former colleagues will not be offended if I warn them              of an error which has slipped into its principle. Equality of the              right of suffrage is not maintained. This right is in it connected              with a condition on which it ought not to depend; that is, with a              proportion of a certain tax called "direct." The dignity of suffrage is thus lowered; and, in placing it in the              scale with an inferior thing, the enthusiasm that right is capable              of inspiring is diminished. It is impossible to find any equivalent              counterpoise for the right of suffrage, because it is alone worthy              to be its own basis, and cannot thrive as a graft, or an appendage. </p>
        <p>Since the Constitution was established we have seen two              conspiracies stranded &#8212; that of Babeuf, and that of some              obscure personages who decorate themselves with the despicable name              of "royalists." The defect in principle of the              Constitution was the origin of Babeuf's conspiracy. He availed himself of the resentment caused by this flaw, and              instead of seeking a remedy by legitimate and constitutional means,              or proposing some measure useful to society, the conspirators did              their best to renew disorder and confusion, and constituted              themselves personally into a Directory, which is formally              destructive of election and representation. They were, in fine,              extravagant enough to suppose that society, occupied with its               domestic affairs, would blindly yield to them a dictatorship usurped              by violence. </p>
        <p>The conspiracy of Babeuf was followed in a few months by that of              the royalists, who foolishly flattered themselves with the notion of              doing great things by feeble or foul means. They counted on all the              discontented, from whatever cause, and tried to rouse, in their              turn, the class of people who had been following the others. But              these new chiefs acted as if they thought society had nothing more              at heart than to maintain courtiers, pensioners, and all their              train, under the contemptible title of royalty. My little essay will              disabuse them, by showing that society is aiming at a very different              end &#8212; maintaining itself.</p>
        <p>We all know or should know, that the time during which a              revolution is proceeding is not the time when its resulting              advantages can be enjoyed. But had Babeuf and his accomplices taken              into consideration the condition of France under this Constitution,              and compared it with what it was under the tragical revolutionary              government, and during the execrable Reign of Terror, the rapidity              of the alteration must have appeared to them very striking and              astonishing. Famine has been replaced by abundance, and by the              well-founded hope of a near and increasing prosperity. </p>
        <p>As for the defect in the Constitution. I am fully convinced that              it will be rectified constitutionally, and that this step is              indispensable; for so long as it continues it will inspire the hopes              and furnish the means of conspirators; and for the rest, it is              regrettable that a Constitution so wisely organized should err so              much in its principle. This fault exposes it to other dangers which              will make themselves felt. Intriguing candidates will go about among those who have not the              means to pay the direct tax and pay it for them, on condition of              receiving their votes. Let us maintain inviolably equality in the              sacred right of suffrage: public security can never have a basis              more solid. <em>Salut et Fraternite</em>. Your former colleague, Thomas              Paine. </p>

          <h3><em>Author's English Preface</em></h3>
        </center>
        <p>The following little piece was written in the winter of 1795 and              1796; and, as I had not determined whether to publish it during the              present war, or to wait till the commencement of a peace, it has lain              by me, without alteration or addition, from the time it was written. </p>
        <p>What has determined me to publish it now is a sermon preached by              Watson, <em>Bishop of Llandaff</em>. Some of my readers will recollect, that              this Bishop wrote a book entitled <em>An Apology for the Bible</em>,              in answer to my <em>Second Part of The Age of Reason</em>, I              procured a copy of his book, and he may depend upon hearing from me              on that subject. </p>
        <p>At the end of the Bishop's book is a list of the works he has              written. Among which is the sermon alluded to; it is entitled: "The              Wisdom and Goodness of God, in having made both Rich and Poor; with              an Appendix containing Reflections on the Present State of England              and France." </p>
        <p>The error contained in this sermon determined me to publish my "Agrarian              Justice." It is wrong to say God made <em>rich</em> and <em>poor</em>; He made              only <em>male</em> and <em>female</em>; and He gave them the earth for their              inheritance. </p>
        <p>Instead of preaching to encourage one part of mankind in insolence<span class="style1">1</span>              ... it would be better that priests employed their time to render              the general condition of man less miserable than it is. Practical              religion consists in doing good: and the only way of serving God is              that of endeavoring to make His creation happy. All preaching that              has not this for its object is nonsense and hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To preserve the benefits of what is called civilized life, and to remedy  at the same time the evil which it has produced, ought to [be] considered as  one of the first objects of reformed legislation. <br>
          <br>
          Whether that state that is proudly, perhaps erroneously, called civilization,  has most promoted or most injured the general happiness of man, is a question  that may be strongly contested. On one side, the spectator is dazzled by  splendid appearances; on the other, he is shocked by extremes of wretchedness;  both of which it has erected. The most affluent and the most miserable of  the human race are to be found in the countries that are called civilized. <br>
          <br>
          To understand what the state of society ought to be, it is necessary to  have some idea of the natural and primitive state of man; such as it is at this day among the Indians of North America. There is not, in  that state, any of those spectacles of human misery which poverty and want  present to our eyes in all the towns and streets in Europe. 
          Poverty, therefore, is a thing created by that which is called civilized  life. It exists not in the natural state. On the other hand, the natural  state is without those advantages which flow from agriculture, arts, science  and manufactures. <br>
          <br>
          The life of an Indian is a continual holiday, compared with the poor of  Europe; and, on the other hand it appears to be abject when compared to  the rich.
          Civilization, therefore, or that which is so-called, has operated two ways:  to make one part of society more affluent, and the other more wretched,  than would have been the lot of either in a natural state. <br>
          <br>
          It is always possible to go from the natural to the civilized state, but  it is never possible to go from the civilized to the natural state. The  reason is that man in a natural state, subsisting by hunting, requires ten  times the quantity of land to range over to procure himself sustenance,  than would support him in a civilized state, where the earth is cultivated. 
          When, therefore, a country becomes populous by the additional aids of cultivation,  art and science, there is a necessity of preserving things in that state;  because without it there cannot be sustenance for more, perhaps, than a  tenth part of its inhabitants. The thing, therefore, now to be done is to  remedy the evils and preserve the benefits that have arisen to society by  passing from the natural to that which is called the civilized state. <br>
          <br>
          In taking the matter upon this ground, the first principle of civilization  ought to have been, and ought still to be, that the condition of every person  born into the world, after a state of civilization commences, ought not  to be worse than if he had been born before that period. 
          But the fact is that the condition of millions, in every country in Europe,  is far worse than if they had been born before civilization begin, had been  born among the Indians of North America at the present. I will show how  this fact has happened.<br>
          <br>
          It is a position not to be controverted that the earth, in its natural,  uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, <em>the common  property of the human race</em><strong>. </strong>In that state every man  would have been born to property. He would have been a joint life proprietor  with the rest in the property of the soil, and in all its natural productions,  vegetable and animal. <br>
          <br>
          But the earth in its natural state, as before said, is capable of supporting  but a small number of inhabitants compared with what it is capable of doing  in a cultivated state. And as it is impossible to separate  the improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which that  improvement is made, the idea of landed property arose  from that inseparable connection; but it is nevertheless true, that it is the  value of the improvement, only, and not the earth itself, that is individual  property. 
          Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated lands, owes to the community <em>ground-rent (</em>for I know of no better term to express the  idea) for the land which he holds; and it is from this ground-rent that  the fund proposed in this plan is to issue. <br>
          <br>
          It is deducible, as well from the nature of the thing as from all the stories  transmitted to us, that the idea of landed property commenced with cultivation,  and that there was no such thing as landed property before that time. It  could not exist in the first state of man, that of hunters. It did not exist  in the second state, that of shepherds: neither Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, nor Job, so far as the history of the Bible may credited in probable  things, were owners of land. 
          Their property consisted, as is always enumerated, in flocks  and herds, and they traveled with them from place to place. The frequent  contentions at that time about the use of a well in the dry country of Arabia,  where those people lived, also show that there was no landed property. It  was not admitted that land could be claimed as property. <br>
          <br>
          There could be no such thing as landed property originally. Man did not  make the earth, and, though he had a natural right to <em>occupy </em>it,  he had no right to <em>locate as his property </em>in perpetuity  any part of it; neither did the Creator of the earth open a land-office,  from whence the first title-deeds should issue. Whence then, arose the idea  of landed property? I answer as before, that when cultivation began the  idea of landed property began with it, from the impossibility of separating  the improvement made by cultivation from the earth itself, upon which that  improvement was made.
          The value of the improvement so far exceeded the value of the natural earth,  at that time, as to absorb it; till, in the end, the common right of all  became confounded into the cultivated right of the individual. But there  are, nevertheless, distinct species of rights, and will continue to be,  so long as the earth endures. <br>
          <br>
          It is only by tracing things to their origin that we can gain rightful ideas  of them, and it is by gaining such ideas that we discover the boundary  that divides right from wrong, and teaches every man to know his own. I  have entitled this tract "Agrarian Justice" to distinguish it  from "Agrarian Law."
          Nothing could be more unjust than agrarian law in a country improved by  cultivation; for though every man, as an inhabitant of the earth, is a joint  proprietor of it in its natural state, it does not follow that he is a joint  proprietor of cultivated earth. The additional value made by cultivation,  after the system was admitted, became the property of those who did it,  or who inherited it from them, or who purchased it. It had originally no  owner. While, therefore, I advocate the right, and interest myself in the  hard case of all those who have been thrown out of their natural inheritance  by the introduction of the system of landed property, I equally defend the  right of the possessor to the part which is his. <br>
          <br>
          Cultivation is at least one of the greatest natural improvements ever made  by human invention. It has given to created earth a tenfold value. But the  landed monopoly that began with it has produced the greatest evil. It has  dispossessed more than half the inhabitants of every nation of their natural  inheritance, without providing for them, as ought to have been done, an  indemnification for that loss, and has thereby created a species of poverty  and wretchedness that did not exist before. <br>
          <br>
          In advocating the case of the persons thus dispossessed, it is a right,  and not a charity, that I am pleading for.  But it is that kind of right  which, being neglected at first, could not be brought forward afterwards  till heaven had opened the way by a revolution in the system of government.  Let us then do honor to revolutions by justice, and give currency to their  principles by blessings. <br>
          <br>
          Having thus, in a few words, opened the merits of the case, I shall now proceed  to the plan I have to propose, which is, <br>
          <br>
          To create a National Fund, out of which there shall be paid to every person,  when arrived at the age of twenty-one years, the sum of fifteen pounds sterling,  as a compensation in part, for the loss of his or her natural inheritance,  by the introduction of the system of landed property: <br>
          <br>
          And also, the sum of ten pounds per annum, during life, to every person  now living, of the age of fifty years, and to all others as they shall arrive  at that age. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>MEANS BY WHICH THE FUND IS TO BE CREATED</strong><br>
          <br>
          I have already established the principle, namely, that the earth, in its  natural uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the <em>common property of the human race; </em>that in that state, every person  would have been born to property; and that the system of landed property,  by its inseparable connection with cultivation, and with what is called  civilized life, has absorbed the property of all those whom it dispossessed,  without providing, as ought to have been done, an indemnification for that  loss. <br>
          <br>
          The fault, however, is not in the present possessors. No complaint is tended,  or ought to be alleged against them, unless they adopt the crime by opposing  justice. The fault is in the system, and it has stolen  perceptibly upon  the world, aided afterwards by the agrarian law of the sword. But the fault  can be made to reform itself by successive generations; and without diminishing  or deranging the property of any of present possessors, the operation of  the fund can yet commence, and  in full activity, the first year of its establishment,  or soon after, as I shall show. <br>
          <br>
          It is proposed that the payments, as already stated, be made to every person,  rich or poor. It is best to make it so, to prevent invidious distinctions.  It is also right it should be so, because it is in lieu of the natural inheritance,  which, as a right, belongs to every man, over and above  property he may  have created, or inherited from those who did. Such persons as do not choose  to receive it can throw it into the common fund. <br>
          <br>
          Taking it then for granted that no person ought to be in a worse condition  when born under what is called a state of civilization, than he would have  been had he been born in a state of nature, and that civilization ought  to have made, and ought still to make, provision for that purpose, it can  only be done by subtracting from property a portion equal in value to the  natural inheritance it has absorbed. <br>
          <br>
          Various methods may be proposed for this purpose, but that which appears  to be the best (not only because it will operate without deranging any present  possessors, or without interfering with the collection of taxes or <em>emprunts </em>necessary for the purposes of government and the Revolution, but because  it will be th<strong>e </strong>least troublesome and the most effectual,  and also because the subtraction will be made at a time that best admits  it) is at the moment that property is passing by the death of one person  to the possession of another. In this case, the bequeather gives nothing:  the receiver pays nothing. The only matter to him is that the monopoly of  natural inheritance, to which there never was a right, begins to cease in  his person. A generous man would not wish it to continue, and a just man  will rejoice to see it abolished. <br>
          <br>
          My state of health prevents my making sufficient inquiries with respect  to the doctrine of probabilities, whereon to found calculations with such  degrees of certainty as they are capable of. What, therefore, I offer on  this head is more the result of observation and reflection than of received  information; but I believe it will be found to agree sufficiently with fact.  </p>
        <p>In the first place, taking twenty-one years as the epoch of maturity, all  the property of a nation, real and personal, is always in the possession  of persons above that age. It is then necessary to know, as a datum of calculation,  the average of years which persons above that age will live. I take this  average to be about thirty years, for though many persons will live forty,  fifty, or sixty years, after the age of twenty-one years, others will die  much sooner, and some in every year of that time. <br>
          <br>
          Taking, then, thirty years as the average of time, it will give, without  any material variation one way or other, the average of time in which the  whole property or capital of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will have  passed through one entire revolution in descent, that is, will have gone  by deaths to new possessors; for though, in many instances, some parts of  this capital will remain forty, fifty, or sixty years in the possession  of one person, other parts will have revolved two or three times before  those thirty years expire, which will bring it to that average; for were  one-half the capital of a nation to revolve twice in thirty years, it would  produce the same fund as if the whole revolved once. <br>
          <br>
          Taking, then, thirty years as the average of time in which the whole capital  of a nation, or a sum equal thereto, will revolve once, the thirtieth part  thereof will be the sum that will revolve every year, that is, will go by  deaths to new possessors; and this last sum being thus known, and the ratio  per cent to be subtracted from it determined, it will give the annual amount  or income of the proposed fund, to be applied as already mentioned. <br>
          <br>
          In looking over the discourse of the English Minister, Pitt, in his opening  of what is called in England the budget (the scheme of finance for the year  1796), I find an estimate of the national capital of that country. As this  estimate of a national capital is prepared ready to my hand, I take it as  a datum to act upon. When a calculation is made upon the known capital of  any nation, combined with its population, it will serve as a scale for any  other nation, in proportion as its capital and population be more or less.
          I am the more disposed to take this estimate of Mr. Pitt, for the purpose  of showing to that minister, upon his own calculation, how much better money  may be employed than in wasting it, as he has done, on the wild project  of setting up Bourbon kings. What, in the name of heaven, are Bourbon kings  to the people of England? It is better that the people have bread. <br>
          <br>
          Mr. Pitt states the national capital of England, real and personal, to be one  thousand three hundred millions sterling, which is about one-fourth part  of the national capital of France, including Belgia. The event of the last  harvest in each country proves that the soil of France is more productive than  that of England, and that it can better support twenty-four or twenty-five  millions of inhabitants than that of England can seven or seven and a half  millions. <br>
          <br>
          The thirtieth part of this capital of <em>&pound; </em>1,300,000,000 is &pound; 43,333,333 which is the part that will revolve every year by deaths in that  country to new possessors; and the sum that will annually revolve in France  in the proportion of four to one, will be about one hundred and seventy-three  millions sterling. From this sum of <em>&pound;</em> 43,333,333 annually  revolving, is to be subtracted the value of the natural inheritance absorbed  in it, which, perhaps, in fair justice, cannot be taken at less, and ought  not be taken for more, than a tenth part. <br>
          <br>
          It will always happen that of the property thus revolving by deaths every  year a part will descend in a direct line to sons and daughters, and  other  part collaterally, and the proportion will be found to be about three to  one; that is, about thirty millions of the above sum will descend to direct  heirs, and the remaining sum of <em>&pound;</em> 13,333,333 to more distant  relations, and in part to strangers. <br>
          <br>
          Considering, then, that man is always related to society, that relationship  will become comparatively greater in proportion as the next of kin is more  distant; it is therefore consistent with civilization to say that where  there are no direct heirs society shall be heir to a part over and above  the tenth part <em>due </em>to society. 
          If this additional part be from five to ten or twelve per cent, in proportion  as the next of kin be nearer or more remote, so as to average with the escheats  that may fall, which ought always to go to society and not to the government  (an addition of ten per cent more), the produce from the annual sum of &pound;<em> </em>43,333,333 will be: <br>
          <br>
          From <em>&pound;</em> 30,000,000 at ten per cent ......................<em>........................................&pound;</em> 3,000,000 <br>
          <br>
          From<em> &pound;</em> 13,333,333 at ten per cent with the addition of ten per cent more .... <em>&pound;</em> 2,666,666 <br>
          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
          <em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&pound;</em> 43,333,333&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&pound;</em> 5,666,666 <br>
          <br>
          Having thus arrived at the annual amount of the proposed fund, I come, in  the next place, to speak of the population proportioned to this fund and  to compare it with the uses to which the fund is to be applied. <br>
          <br>
          The population (I mean that of England) does not exceed seven millions and  a half, and the number of persons above the age of fifty will in that case  be about four hundred thousand. There would not, however, be more than that  number that would accept the proposed ten pounds sterling per annum, though  they would be entitled to it. I have no idea it would be accepted by many  persons who had a yearly income of two or three hundred pounds sterling.  But as we often see instances of rich people falling into sudden poverty,  even at the age of sixty, they would always have the right of drawing all  the arrears due to them. Four millions, therefore, of the above annual  sum of <em>&pound;</em> 5,666,666 will be required for four hundred thousand  aged persons, at ten pounds sterling each. <br>
          <br>
          I come now to speak of the persons annually arriving at twenty-one years  of age. If all the persons who died were above the age of twenty-one years,  the number of persons annually arriving at that age must be equal to the  annual number of deaths, to keep the population stationary. But the greater  part die under the age of twenty-one, and therefore the number of persons  annually arriving at twenty-one will be less than half the number of deaths. 
          The whole number of deaths upon a population of seven millions and an half  will be about 220,000 annually. The number arriving at twenty-one years  of age will be about 100,000. The whole number of these will not receive  the proposed fifteen pounds, for the reasons already mentioned, though,  as in the former case, they would be entitled to it. Admitting then that  a tenth part declined receiving it, the amount would stand thus: </p>

<hr width="60%">
<p><br>
  There are, in every country, a number of blind and lame persons totally incapable  of earning a livelihood. But as it will always happen that the greater number  of blind persons will be among those who are above the age of fifty years,  they will be provided for in that class. The remaining sum of &pound;&nbsp;316,666 will provide for the lame and blind under that age, at the same  rate of <em>&pound;</em> 10 annually for each person. <br>
    <br>
  Having now gone through all the necessary calculations, and stated the particulars of the plan, I shall conclude with some observations.  </p>
<p>It is not charity but a right, not bounty but justice, that I am pleading  for. The present state of civilization is as odious as it is unjust. It  is absolutely the opposite of what it should be, and it is necessary that  a revolution should be made in it. The contrast of affluence and wretchedness  continually meeting and offending the eye, is like dead and living bodies  chained together. Though I care as little about riches as any man, I am  a friend to riches because they are capable of good.
  I care not how affluent some may be, provided that none be miserable in  consequence of it. But it is impossible to enjoy affluence with the felicity  it is capable of being enjoyed, while so much misery is mingled in the scene.  The sight of the misery, and the unpleasant sensations it suggests, which,  though they may be suffocated cannot be extinguished, are a greater drawback  upon the felicity of affluence than the proposed ten per  cent upon property is worth. He that would not give the one to get rid of  the other has no charity, even for himself. <br>
  <br>
  There are, in every country, some magnificent charities established by individuals.  It is, however, but little that any individual can do, when the whole extent  of the misery to be relieved is considered. He may satisfy his conscience,  but not his heart. He may give all that he has, and that all will relieve  but little. It is only by organizing civilization upon such principles as  to act like a system of pulleys, that the whole weight of misery can be  removed. <br>
  <br>
  The plan here proposed will reach the whole. It will immediately relieve  and take out of view three classes of wretchedness &#8212; the blind, the lame,  and the aged poor; and it will furnish the rising generation with means  to prevent their becoming poor; and it will do this without deranging or  interfering with any national measures.
  To show that this will be the case, it is sufficient to observe that the  operation and effect of the plan will, in all cases, be the same as if every  individual were <em>voluntarily </em>to make his will and dispose of his  property in the manner here proposed. <br>
  <br>
  But it is justice, and not charity, that is the principle of the plan. In  all great cases it is necessary to have a principle more  universally active than charity; and, with respect to justice, it ought  not to be left to the choice of detached individuals whether they will do  justice or not. Considering, then, the plan on the ground of justice, it  ought to be the act of the whole growing spontaneously out of the principles  of the revolution, and the reputation of it ought to be national and not  individual. <br>
  <br>
  A plan upon this principle would benefit the revolution by the energy that  springs from the consciousness of justice. It would multiply also the national  resources; for property, like vegetation, increases by offsets. When a young  couple begin the world, the difference is exceedingly great whether they  begin with nothing or with fifteen pounds apiece. With this aid they could  buy a cow, and implements to cultivate a few acres of land; and instead  of becoming burdens upon society, which is always the case where children  are produced faster than they can be fed, would be put in the way of becoming  useful and profitable citizens. The national domains also would sell the  better if pecuniary aids were provided to cultivate them in small lots. <br>
  <br>
  It is the practice of what has unjustly obtained the name of civilization  (and the practice merits not to be called either charity or policy) to make  some provision for persons becoming poor and wretched only at the time they  become so. Would it not, even as a matter of economy, be  far better to adopt means to prevent their becoming poor? This can best  be done by making every person when arrived at the age of twenty-one years  an inheritor of something to begin with. 
  The rugged face of society, checkered with the extremes of affluence and  want, proves that some extraordinary violence has been committed upon it,  and calls on justice for redress. The great mass of the poor in countries  are become an hereditary race, and it is next to impossible them to get  out of that state of themselves. It ought also to be observed that this  mass increases in all countries that are called civilized. More persons fall  annually into it than get out of it. <br>
  <br>
  Though in a plan of which justice and humanity are the foundation principles,  interest ought not to be admitted into the calculation, yet it is always  of advantage to the establishment of any plan to show that it is beneficial as a matter of interest. The success of any proposed plan submitted to public  consideration must finally depend on the numbers interested in supporting  it, united with the justice of its principles. <br>
  <br>
  The plan here proposed will benefit all, without injuring any. It will consolidate  the interest of the republic with that of the individual. To the numerous  class dispossessed of their natural inheritance by the system of landed  property it will be an act of national justice. To persons dying possessed  of moderate fortunes it will operate as a tontine to their children, more  beneficial than the sum of money paid into the fund: and it will give to  the accumulation of riches a degree of security that none of old governments  of Europe, now tottering on their foundations, can give. <br>
  <br>
  I do not suppose that more than one family in ten, in any of the countries  of Europe, has, when the head of the family dies, a clear property of five  hundred pounds sterling. To all such the plan is advantageous. That property  would pay fifty pounds into the fund, and if there were only two children  under age they would receive fifteen pounds each (thirty pounds), on coming  of age, and be entitled to ten pounds a year after fifty.
  It is from the overgrown acquisition of property that the fund will support  itself; and I know that the possessors of such property in England, though  they would eventually be benefitted by the protection of nine-tenths of  it, will exclaim against the plan. But without entering  any inquiry how  they came by that property, let them recollect that they have been the advocates  of this war, and that Mr. Pitt has already laid on more new taxes to be  raised annually upon the people of England, and that for supporting the  despotism of Austria and the Bourbons against the liberties of France, than  would pay annually all the sums proposed in this plan. <br>
  <br>
  I have made the calculations stated in this plan, upon what is called personal,  as well as upon landed property. The reason for making it upon land is already  explained; and the reason for taking personal property into the calculation  is equally well founded though on a different principle. Land, as before  said, is the free gift of the Creator in common to the human race. Personal  property is the <em>effect of society;</em> and it is as impossible for  an individual to acquire personal property without the aid of society, as  it is for him to make land originally.
  Separate an individual from society, and give him an island or a continent  to possess, and he cannot acquire personal property. He cannot be rich.  So inseparably are the means connected with the end, in all cases, that  where the former do not exist the latter cannot be obtained. All accumulation,  therefore, of personal property, beyond what a man's own hands produce,  is derived to him by living in society; and he owes on every principle of  justice, of gratitude, and of civilization, a part of that accumulation  back again to society from whence the whole came. 
  This is putting the matter on a general principle, and perhaps it is best  to do so; for if we examine the case minutely it will be found that the  accumulation of personal property is, in many instances, the effect of paying  too little for the labor that produced it; the consequence of which is that  the working hand perishes in old age, and the employer abounds in affluence. 
  It is, perhaps, impossible to proportion exactly the price of labor to the  profits it produces; and it will also be said, as an apology for the injustice,  that were a workman to receive an increase of wages daily he would not save  it against old age, nor be much better for it in the interim. Make, then,  society the treasurer to guard it for him in a common fund; for it is no  reason that, because he might not make a good use of it for himself, another  should take it. <br>
  <br>
  The state of civilization that has prevailed throughout Europe, is as unjust  in its principle, as it is horrid in its effects; and it is the consciousness  of this, and the apprehension that such a state cannot continue when once  investigation begins in any country, that makes the possessors of property  dread every idea of a revolution. It is the hazard and not the principle  of revolutions that retards their progress. This being the case, it is necessary  as well for the protection of property as for the sake of justice and humanity,  to form a system that, while it preserves one part of society from wretchedness,  shall secure the other from depreciation. </p>
<p>  The superstitious awe, the enslaving reverence, that formerly surrounded  affluence, is passing away in all countries, and leaving the possessor of  property to the convulsion of accidents. When wealth and splendor, instead  of fascinating the multitude, excite emotions of disgust; when, instead of  drawing forth admiration, it is beheld as an insult on wretchedness; when  the ostentatious appearance it makes serves  call the right of it in question,  the case of property becomes critical, and it is only in  a system of justice that the possessor can contemplate security. <br>
  <br>
  To remove the danger, it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and this  can only be done by making property productive of a national blessing, extending  to every individual. When the riches of one man above other shall increase  the national fund in the same proportion; when it shall be seen that the  prosperity of that fund depends on the prosperity of individuals; when the  more riches a man acquires, the better it shall for the general mass; it  is then that antipathies will cease, and property be placed on the permanent  basis of national interest and protection. <br>
  <br>
  I have no property in France to become subject to the plan I proprose. What  I have, which is not much, is in the United States of America. But I will  pay one hundred pounds sterling toward this fund in France, the instant  it shall be established; and I will pay the same sum in England, whenever a  similar establishment shall take place in that country. <br>
  <br>
  A revolution in the state of civilization is the necessary companion of  revolutions in the system of government. If a revolution in any country  be from bad to good, or from good to bad, the state of what is called civilization  in that country, must be made conformable thereto, to give that revolution effect. 
  Despotic government supports itself by abject civilization, in which debasement  of the human mind, and wretchedness in the mass of the people, are the chief  criterions. Such governments consider man merely as an animal; that the  exercise of intellectual faculty is not his privilege; <em>that he has nothing  to do with the laws but to obey them;<span class="style3">2</span> </em>and they politically depend more  upon breaking the spirit of the people by poverty, than they fear enraging  it by desperation. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="style3">2 Expression of Horsley, an English bishop, in the English parliament.</span><br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>It is a revolution in the state of civilization that will give perfection  to Revolution of France. Already the conviction that government by representation  is the true system of government is spreading itself fast  in the world. The reasonableness of it can be seen by all. The justness  of it makes itself felt even by its opposers. But when a system of civilization,  growing out of that system of government, shall be so organized that not a man or woman born in the Republic but shall inherit some means  of beginning the world, and see before them the certainty of escaping the  miseries that under other governments accompany old age, the Revolution  of France will have an advocate and an ally in the heart  of all nations. <br>
  <br>
  An army of principles will penetrate where an army of soldiers cannot; it  will succeed where diplomatic management would fall: it is neither the Rhine,  the Channel, nor the ocean that can arrest its progress: it will march on  the horizon of the world, and it will conquer. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>MEANS FOR CARRYING  THE PROPOSED PLAN INTO EXECUTION, AND TO RENDER IT AT THE SAME TIME CONDUCIVE  TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST</strong><br>
  <br>
  I. Each canton shall elect in its primary assemblies, three persons, as commissioners  for that canton, who shall take cognizance, and keep a register of all matters  happening in that canton, conformable to the charter that shall be established  by law for carrying this plan into execution. <br>
  <br>
  II. The law shall fix the manner in which the property of deceased persons  shall be ascertained. <br>
  <br>
  III. When the amount of the property of any deceased persons shall be ascertained,  the principal heir to that property, or the eldest of the co-heirs, if of  lawful age, or if under age, the person authorized by the will of  the deceased to represent him or them, shall give bond to the commissioners  of the canton to pay the said tenth part thereof in four equal quarterly  payments, within the space of one year or sooner, at the choice of the payers.  One-half of the whole property shall remain as a security until the bond  be paid off. <br>
  <br>
  IV. The bond shall be registered in the office of the commissioners of the  canton, and the original bonds shall be deposited in the national bank at  Paris. The bank shall publish every quarter of a year the amount of the  bonds in its possession, and also the bonds that shall have been paid off,  or what parts thereof, since the last quarterly publication. <br>
  <br>
  V. The national bank shall issue bank notes upon the security of the bonds  in its possession. The notes so issued, shall be applied to pay the pensions  of aged persons, and the compensations to persons arriving at twenty-one  years of age. It is both reasonable and generous to suppose, that persons  not under immediate necessity, will suspend their right of drawing on the  fund, until it acquire, as it will do, a greater degree  of ability. In this case, it is proposed, that an honorary register be kept,  in each canton, of the names of the persons thus suspending that right,  at least during the present war. <br>
  <br>
  VI. As the inheritors of property must always take up their bonds in four  quarterly payments, or sooner if they choose, there will always be <em>numeraire</em> arriving at the bank after the expiration of the first quarter, to exchange  for the bank notes that shall be brought in. <br>
  <br>
  VII. The bank notes being thus put in circulation, upon the best of all  possible security, that of actual property, to more than four times the  amount of the bonds upon which the notes are issued, and with <em>numeraire</em> [cash]continually arriving at the bank to exchange or pay them off whenever  they shall be presented for that purpose, they will acquire a permanent  value in all parts of the Republic. They can therefore be received in payment  of taxes, or emprunts equal to <em>numeraire, </em>because the  Government can always receive <em>numeraire </em>for them at the bank. <br>
  <br>
  VIII. It will be necessary that the payments of the ten per cent be made  in <em>numeraire</em> for the first year from the establishment  of the plan. But after the expiration of the first year, the inheritors  of property may pay ten per cent either in bank notes issued upon the fund,  or in <em>numeraire.</em> <br>
  <br>
  If the payments be in <em>numeraire<strong>, </strong></em>it will lie as  a deposit at the bank, be exchanged for a quantity of notes equal  to that amount; and if in notes issued upon the fund, it will cause a demand  upon the fund equal thereto; and thus the operation of the plan will create  means to carry itself into execution. <br>
