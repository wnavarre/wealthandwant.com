<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geoism
and the Practice of Public Economics</span><br>
Edward H. Clarke<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">[a paper delivered at the Annual
Conference of the Council of Georgist Organizations, Plainfield, New
Jersey, August, 1997]</div>
<br>
I was happy to be invited here and talk about a topic which has come to
be known as Geo-Economics. (See Feder, 1994).<br>
<br>
I have long been sympathetic to the Geoist position, and to the extent
that you will let me characterize my views as Geoclassical rather than
Neoclassical, Geoism represents a position that many in the public
economics profession can gradually be attracted to, as I was over the
course of thirty years.<br>
<br>
The geoist position, at least as developed by people like Feder and
Tideman, is simply to advance principles of public economics known as
benefit taxation, to structure incentives that will constrain
rent-seeking behavior, and share rents from use of natural resources
and the exercise of government privileges more equitably among citizens
(present and future, ours and the world's citizens).<br>
<br>
In this talk, I pick up on some themes in Gwartney and Tideman (1996),
which references attempts to better measure rents from land, natural
resources and government sponsored privileges and a good statement by
Tideman ("<a href="Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The Morality of Taxation: The
Local Case</a>") about putting
limits on the extent to which citizens can treat their fellows as
targets of plunder (ie., through political exploitation).<br>
<br>
I would also like to elaborate on ideas of what might be done as we
move from the local case to higher levels of government, picking up on
a theme Tideman has expressed in other writing as follows:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"For local political decisions,
privilege and political exploitation of
fellow citizens have little salience, because dissatisfied citizens can
go elsewhere. Land value taxation, free trade, Wicksellian approval
procedures and user fees corresponding to marginal costs may be
attractive components of a local political order, but they cannot be
described as compulsory as long as no one is deprived or exploited. As
the scale of the political order grows, the possibility of depriving or
exploiting one's fellow citizens increases, and it becomes more and
more essential to use the forms of organization that are objectively
fair and efficient."</div>
<br>
My development of this theme is as follows: (1.) recounting some of my
experiences over the last 30 years, traveling through these higher
orders of government (2.) some history and political philosophy or
observations about converting the impossible to the possible (a
purpose, I suppose, of political philosophy) and (3.) some suggestions
about concrete steps that could be conceivably undertaken, by real
political actors in the foreseeable future, to better implement the
geoist vision as set forth by Tideman, Feder, and others. In some
respects, I propose to present geoism as social art -- in part science,
in part politics (the art of the possible) and part political
philosophy (converting the impossible to the possible).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(1.) Waiting for Turgot: Confessions
of A Geoist</span><br>
<br>
I certainly wasn't educated to be a Georgist. I encountered Henry
George first in the unfavorable (underground) light that Heilbroner
portrayed him in the Worldly Philosophers. My initial bout with
"Chicago economics" did not change this view.<br>
<br>
Geoism came fast to me, however, in the mid-1960's in working for a
land economics consulting firm, curiously named the Real Estate
Research Corporation. I worked on real world projects involving
transportation projects in the Chicago Metropolitan area (including a
new international airport in the Lake, and the planning and financing
of new towns (at the height of the "new town" movement). It was a time
of near-revolutionary activity (the period from 1964 through the
Chicago riots of 1968), and as part of a national attempt to understand
(or perhaps contain) the revolution, we also contributed to the study
of urban problems (as instanced by the contribution of the son of the
founder, Anthony Downs, to the work of the National Commission on Urban
Problems, known as the Douglas Commission).<br>
<br>
I was always curious about really what went on with that Commission in
its deliberations, and I may finally satisfy my curiosity. The source
of this curiosity was the somewhat passionate (a vote of 8 to 4, I
believe) dissent to the majority of the Commission recommending a
"Treasury study" of LVT. It was led further into my study of how people
like Paul Douglas (a Chicago economics professor) were led to carry
these ideas beyond simply having them further studied. I was led into a
study of how historians and political economists dealt with the
Georgist phenonomen (Steven Cord's 1964 book on Henry George) and led
me then into studying particularly the lives of people like Frederic
Howe, particularly in two books: <span style="font-style: italic;">Confessions
of A Monopolist</span> ( (1905)
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Confessions of A Reformer</span>
(1925). Howe had shared many of the same
frustrations as Douglas -- each dealing with the public utilities in
Cleveland and Chicago respectively.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Geoism -- Chicago style</span><br>
&nbsp;<br>
What I was learning in the world of public policy was reinforcing and
conflicting with what I was learning in a more theoretical realm.<br>
<br>
While working on projects such as building an airport in the Lake
(which happily died), I was starting a dissertation on the "economics
of water quality regulation", sitting for hours trying to figure out
how costs of cleaning up Lake Michigan ought to be allocated in a way
that might also lead to a process of revelation of preferences for
improved water quality, and even the location of an airport in the Lake.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Some 30 years later, the process (called demand revelation) I came up
with is finding its way into books on the economics of environmental
management (cite Oates and Mueller article on use of preference
revelation among communities surrounding the Chesapeake Bay). I
describe the process later in a discussion of incentive compatible
approaches to fiscal and regulatory coordination and in a related paper
recently presented at the annual meetings of the Sothern Economics
Association.<br>
<br>
In essentially working towards some better solution to the public goods
(preference revelation) problem in the context of environmental
management, I came to the view that land was a public good.<br>
<br>
As Petrela (1985) has noted in the same context, "Henry George's
resolution of the social implications of land as a public good is
consistent with modern economic theory's resolution of the negative
externalities created by the use or abuse of nature's gifts, for
example air and water... George's treatment of land as a public good
was alien to early classical economic analysis and as Terence Dwyer
(1982) has noted surprisingly modern "... rent reflects net
externalities, so establishing private tenure but at the same time
collecting the competitively determined economic rent for the public
benefit will establish an optimal level of externality."<br>
<br>
My initial experiences with treating land as a public good were not
fruitful (i.e., it was most alien to NCE thought at the U. of Chicago).
I was working as an Asst. Dean of Students in the Chicago Business
School and that school had one professor in an urban economics program,
but he had no students. I was his first formal student. There were
students in the economics department like Tideman who were
investigating something like what was later to come to be called the HG
Theorem (in an article I refer to later), which I gradually became
aware of. Nonetheless, when it became obvious to "middle of the road"
academic advisers that my Geoist pursuasions were perhaps in sharp
conflict with "properterian" (and overt anti-Georgist opinion -- two of
my advisers were republishing George's 1887 debate with Marshall in the
Journal of Law and Economics -- 1969), I was gradually encouraged to
shift my focus to some promising ideas on "preference, or demand
revealing" (DR) approaches to helping to solve the public goods problem.<br>
<br>
I got to introduce some of my Georgist thinking at the Smithsonian
Institution in what became the lead chapter of my 1980 book --- calling
it "The New Incentive Mechanisms: Capitalism, Socialism, and Henry
George". During this period there was also a real awakening among
economists to the merits of what has been named the "Henry George
Theorem" (HGT), in the work of Smolensky and Tideman (1970), Vickrey
(1977) and Arnott and Stiglitz (1979). There has also been work linking
these ideas -- HGT and DR -- Tideman (1985, 1993), the spirit of which
is contained in Gwartney and Tideman's article on the morality of
taxation mentioned above.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Remarks on Bailey and Tideman's
"Constitution".</span><br>
<br>
I would like now to turn to my main purpose -- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">how you design
"financial laws" that act as a complement to LVT and, more importantly,
force, or strongly encourage, the adoption of LVT as a source of
financing public services.</span><br>
<br>
The ideas are contained in several recent articles by Martin Bailey,
one of Chicago's most famous public finance professors, who recently
died. Nic Tideman has taken on the task of publishing his posthumous
work on <span style="font-style: italic;">A Constitution for A Future
Country</span>. In his articles (Public
Choice, 1996, 1997), Bailey structures a set of incentive compatible
decision mechanisms and agenda setting/referendum arrangements that
essentially mimic the operation of the private market in the public
sphere.<br>
<br>
These markets largely eliminate the incentive to rent-seeking and
politically exploitative behavior and to the extent that
community-created values are appropriately reflected in land rents
(ie., the building of a dam or flood control project) as opposed to
some good that has non-material or symbolic value (Bailey, 1996, uses
the example of public support of a monarchy), then there is a strong
motivation to adopt what amounts to LVT and/or the appropriate
(supplementary) marginal cost (user) charges.<br>
<br>
I have been trying in recent work to show how Bailey's method would
work in a subset of current expenditure activities -- for example
transportation or environmental trust fund expenditures (Clarke, 1996)
which has been integrated into a collection of essays, entitled
"Waiting for Turgot". I have also described the method in the revision
of a paper presented at the November, 1996 meetings of the Southern
Economics Association (SEA), entitled "Incentive Compatible Resource
Allocation: An Application to 'Distributive' Federal Programs".<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Turgot Unplugged: The Practice of
Social Art (and of Everyday Life).</span><br>
<br>
I'll briefly introduce the concept here, which Robert Conlan (presently
at the University of Hawaii) and I have called a "General Progress
Program". I explain this concept as follows in a treatment of
"intergovernmental coordination" in a section extracted from the
aforementioned essays.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">On Intergovernmental Coordination</span><br>
<br>
The Nation has long needed more effective decision-making mechanisms
for intergovernmental coordination of expenditures and regulations.
Efficient coordination can be achieved in an incentive-compatible way
where the effects of spending by any one subunit on another subunit can
be more effectively taken into account as compared with current
decision-making procedures.<br>
<br>
Effective coordination also relates to an important national economic
policy concern which is efficient and equitable spending and deficit
management. The need for better coordination is evidenced by fractious
Congressional debate (ie.,. the Congressional debate over welfare
reform) over how to implement acceptable reductions in
intergovernmental transfers, accompanied by reductions in Federally
mandated spending requirements.<br>
<br>
Given the existence of decision-making mechanisms (ie., demand
revealing) that would motivate decision-makers to accurately reveal the
positive and negative effects of spending and regulatory decisions on
one another, why not use these mechanisms to achieve more effective
coordination? The Federal Government can establish an initial level of
entitlements (called a distributional status quo) and then, with
appropriate provisions for agenda-control, let the political subunits
decide what levels of actual spending, including Federally mandated
spending, is required. In effect, Congress determines the initial
distribution but allows more implementation flexibility to the
subunits, adjusting the financial flows to reflect external effects.<br>
<br>
To illustrate, I will assume we are applying the process to a subset of
Federal discretionary programs (about $500 billion annually, and
including National defense expenditures). Consider a subset of these
programs consisting of about $55 billion in programs (transportation,
communications and the environment) financed by Federal excise taxes.
Assume first that, we take the President's budget and allow a
"citizen's advisory committee" to propose substitutes or eliminations
designed to "maximize the likelihood of minimizing harm" (a criterion
elaborated by Bailey, 1997). Subject to oversight by a "Commission", it
will allocate cost shares among political subunits (in this case
Congressional districts) so as to try to equalize per capita (or
household) net benefits among the jurisdictions (for example, by trying
to make the cost shares proportional to estimated benefits -- see
Clarke, 1980, Chapter V).<br>
<br>
Suppose that the allocation of beneficiary tax-shares resulted in
pressures for spending changes that were nonuniform among the
districts. For example, spending may be cut about 10% (from $550 per
household on average to $500. Lower spending districts with lower cost
shares might end up with an average of $450 while higher spending
districts remained close to the original $550 average. Under the
system, compensating transfers in the form of interest on expenditures
of $50 plus a credit on the $50 principal would be made in the form of
an accounting transfer from the higher to the lower spending districts.
If the advisory committee recommended prudent changes that also
generated large net benefits and the compensating transfers were
designed to achieve equal or proportional per capita net benefit
increases for each district (that, say also averaged $500 per
household), then the proposed package of changes would be accepted
unanimously. (The result is that, relative to the original status quo,
the lower spending districts would be loaning $50 per household to the
higher spending districts and sharing in the social surplus created by
more productive investments).<br>
<br>
Perhaps such transfers may seem fairly insignificant in each
household's budget. But what of the potential benefits to residents in
any district if they carefully scrutinize the entire $500 or so in
entitlements spent in or outside the district and can begin to effect
self sustaining projects that are, say, financed through land rent
increments and the appropriate marginal cost (user) charges? A resident
that in no way benefits may be saving $500 per year with accumulating
interest balances, accompanied by a significant incentive to make
his/her preferences known.<br>
<br>
In the SEA paper referred to above, I explore the potential for various
"federalist" arrangements to govern district and National spending
decisions. They range between close approximations of Bailey's
"constitution" or "financial laws" to very simple, if less effective
means of constraining rent seeking, means of determining interest rates
to reflect disproportionate uses of Trust funds relative to initial
entitlements (see appendix). The strongest incentive system, based on
Bailey's work, is a use of the pivotal mechanism for agenda setting and
combined use of the pivotal mechanism and the Thompson "preference
revealing" approach in making final budget and regulatory decisions in
a manner that will achieve efficiency while minimizing redistributive
harm. (To illustrate the power of the Thompson incentive if budgetary
conflicts reached a referendum stage, the citizen would have a strong
incentive to reveal the $500 he is paying for a project with no benefit
to him and would receive up to one half that amount in compensation if
his less preferred option was chosen).<br>
<br>
Less strong incentive arrangements are explored in my SEA paper which
are basically the integration of Bailey's approach with the Limited
Fund Mechanism (LFM) which, like Thompson's approach, uses information
generated by incentive-compatible means to compensate losers and
minimize redistributive harm, through a process I which has been called
"compensated incentive compatibility", or CIC (see Brough, Clarke and
Tideman, 1995 and Tideman, 1979).<br>
<br>
A second feature of my SEA paper is the combining of the agenda setting
process with incentive compatible Congressional voting, at least
initially, at the referendum stage. Rather than voting by individuals
through direct democracy (as in Bailey's approach), I rely on
representative voting in Congress or by Congressional committees
representing regions or states in the process of agenda setting. In my
SEA paper, I describe first an agenda setting stage where the system is
operating under the aegis of one (monopoly) advisory committee which
establishes one set of options for departures from the status quo. The
committee works with executive officers (EOs) which essentially
represent the interests of constituent regions (ie.,. the executive
officers substitute for competitive regional committees). I then turn
to cases where there are competitive alternatives (e. g. a national
committee's preferred alternatives competing with those of the
executive officers or regional committees), where the decisions are
made by Bailey's process in the context of Congressional voting via the
VCG-Thompson mechanism. While the idea of such a method used in present
legislatures may seem initially farfetched, one is usefully led into
investigations of how it could be implemented in a "second best"
setting.<br>
<br>
In terms of what aspects of this approach may be immediately
practicable, I suggest that they could be used in the context of
infrastructure banking, through revolving funds or the rapidly evolving
State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) in the transportation area. The
National government could, for example, come up with procedures for
determining "incentive-compatible" procedures for lending among the ten
administrative regions and the regions could "on-lend" in a similar
way. I describe this mechanism in Section IIA of the SEA paper (The
Limited Fund Mechanism: A Practical Approach?).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</span><br>
<br>
How does all this relate to Turgot and the problems of today? In a
chapter of my Turgot essays, entitled "The Practice of Social Art," I
speak of the various kinds of public finance and regulatory reforms
(education finance, environmental and "network" management reforms as
well as other efforts to structure financial laws to encourage benefit
taxation) as analogous to Turgot's "Memoire sur les Municipalities"
(September 1775). A good treatment of the "Memoire" in the
enlightenment conception of "social art" is contained in Keith Baker's
Condercet (1975). My interest in this area is how all this is traced
from Turgot, through Condercet and the Idealoges through two "Belgian
socialists" -- Colins and DePaepe. Colins (who died in 1859) is still
referred to in the Grand Larousse as a "disciplino of Henry George". In
his work during the mid-1830's, he built a grand "federalist"
superstructure, almost a metaphysical one, to try to create the
conditions in a "cosmopolitan" federalist superstructure that would
lead through the appropriate taxation of land (and public utility)
rent. His work included detailed discussion of auction techniques for
awarding franchises in the rapidly emerging public utility enterprises
of the time. His follower, DePaepe, tried to carry his ideas forward
and to demonstrate to both Marx and Proudhon that such techniques would
minimize the potential for political exploitation, either of the
capitalist or socialist variety. (See G.D.S. Cole's History of
Socialism, Chapter 4 of Volume II, for a brief treatment). I think both
these individuals deserve some attention in future anthologies of
geoist thought.<br>
<br>
I'll conclude this brief treatment of Waiting for Turgot with some of
the related writings of Turgot's co-author (Dupont) and follower
(Condercet).<br>
<br>
The actual Memoire was a very "bare-bones" and straightforward outline
of proposed reforms at the local level that did not involve economic
matters beyond notes on various economies to be achieved in particular
administrative reorganizations. Selective material to be introduced
here to the effect that Dupont had written the "Memoire" as part of
what he foresaw as an overall reform of government that would make
possible a country-wide administration of the physiocratic tax. "In a
letter to the Grand Duke of Baden, Dupont described the way in which
the planned system of municipal courts would determine levels of tax on
the net produce according to the needs both of the national and their
own local levels of government". (The Economic Writings of Dupont).<br>
<br>
Later, Condercet who picked up many of these themes in His "Vie de
Turgot" (1785) was developing these them further in his "Letter From A
Citizen of New Haven to A Citizen of Virginia".(1787).<br>
<br>
As we (the emerging United States) were deliberating very general
provisions involving the levy of direct taxes, excises and so forth (on
a uniform basis) and authorizing expenditures on postal services and
roads (U. S. Constitution), Condercet was advising as follows:<br>
<br>
Let us now discuss financial laws: They are concerned principally with
(3 things)...<br>
<br>
"First, the way in which taxes are levied. it is very important both
for the freedom and prosperity of the State that we decide once and for
all that the only tax which is just and involves no violation of
natural law is a tax levied directly on land, in proportion to its
direct product."<br>
<br>
Condercet then goes on to describe what must be done if this principle
is not adopted (in terms of voting rules and the pluralities among the
voting districts to decide about a direct territorial tax.<br>
<br>
Later, he says:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"The second concern of financial laws
is to fix the amount of the tax. I have to say I can find no good way
of doing this unless we accept the principle, which is very simple and
well proven -- even if rarely adopted-- that a land tax is the only
just form of taxation."</div>
<br>
Condercet then goes on with a detailed discussion of expenditure
controls. What I'm suggesting in this brief paper that having decided
to levy uniform excises, we can design a set of incentive compatible
expenditure arrangements that motivate the districts to return, to the
extent appropriate, to the land tax (or rent) as a final source of
revenue.<br>
<br>
I'm also suggesting a very simple moral to the story. No one is going
to seriously move forward on LVT when people think they can get what
they want largely for free. We need to live with that realization.
However, we often have episodic periods of reform when broad, if
discrete, administrative measures might be undertaken in conjunction
with an eye towards instituting what amounts to benefit taxation.
Imagine an alternative to a "Truth in Budgeting" bill that can take
Trust Funds off budget (which failed by one vote in the last Congress)
passing with the appropriate incentive-compatible allocation features).
One might find those with a strong bent towards benefit taxation (like
Dupont) working in tandem with those who have no strong ideological
bent towards the benefit tax idea (like Turgot).<br>
<br>
One can always imagine the results of one's conversations with an
overly agitated Finance Minister (who despite their calm exteriors are
often extremely agitated). Whether I've worked with one or more in a
functioning democracy here at home, in an autocracy (Morocco) or in
anarchy (Haiti), I often feel like a player in Waiting for Godot. The
mood is captured late in Act I when Estrogen (the assistant) turns to
Vladimir (the Finance Minister) and says: "Be Happy". Later (after
considerable reflection), Vladimir replies: Now That We Are Happy, What
Shall We Do? Later, Estrogen then says (not in the play): Let's Write
That Memoir".<br>
