<p><a name="I" id="I"></a><b>I.
Worthy goals often conflict with each other</b></p>
<p><b>A. Corn vs. Barley</b></p>
<p>Growing barley is a worthy goal (especially if you enjoy a little
beer). So is growing corn. It would be great to raise as much of each
as anyone wants, but the Earth has its limits. A choice and a
decision are required. People invented (or stumbled into) the
discipline of economics to help with such hard choices, and to
console ourselves that we are doing the right thing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The hardest
choices are those regarding land use, because there is just so much.
We can build more houses, cars, and boats, write more music and
drama, spawn and educate more people, but we cannot make another
Hudson Valley.</span></p>
<p>Barley grows on cheap land, and the demand is limited, so the best
barley land is used for growing corn.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Economics reconciles the
competing demands and rationalizes the outcome. It defines the
"highest and best use" of land as that yielding the highest net gain,
the excess of revenues over costs. </span>Economists include non-cash
"service flows" among "revenues," although they bear watching:
sometimes they forget. Thus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">economics
shows how the market sorts and
arranges land uses, giving us a corn belt, a wheat belt, and a cotton
belt.</span> Economists pride themselves on this achievement. (Some
preen
themselves too much, as we will see, and pride goeth before a
fall.)</p>
<p>By the same logic, irrigated crops take land from dry-farmed
crops; orchards take land from irrigated row crops; housing takes
land from orchards and groves; commerce takes land from housing.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rich take land from the poor, provoking sympathy,
strong rhetoric, and occasionally effective rear-guard resistance to
such changes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Actually, a well-oiled
market is often quite
democratic. People of moderate income, by crowding, can outcompete
those of high income for the same land</span>, as when a Sears or
Wal-mart
takes the best commercial sites from a Nordstroms or Broadway; or
when an old estate is subdivided into five lots per acre. This, too,
provokes negative rhetoric, but developers know how to make hay out
of this, and mincemeat of their opposition. At this point developers
become populists and accuse preservationists and environmentalists of
snobbery and elitism. We need an answer for that one if
environmentalists are going to command enough popular support to win,
and hold the gains. Of this, more later.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other worthy goals that conflict
are open space and water
conservation.</span> A major problem in an arid land is that much wide
open
space guzzles up water. Conserving open space and conserving water
conflict directly. Green grass uses more water per acre than almost
any farm crop except rice (and rice returns part of it downstream).
In cities most water is used not for swimming pools or toilets or
washing machines, but for sprinkling lawns. Cemeteries, golf courses,
horse-pastures, parks, freeway banks, and the spacious tax-exempt
grounds of institutions are the greatest water junkies outside of
farming itself, which of course takes much more than all cities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Something has to give. Thus far it
has been wetlands that gave.
</span>Once, perhaps, we had too much wetland, but that was long ago. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We
cannot accommodate all those uses, and save wetlands too, just by
having restaurants stop serving water, or putting bricks in toilet
tanks. Those are just token or "Goo-Goo" measures for parlor
reformers; they distract us from real problems, and substitute for
real solutions. What is the highest and best use of water? Wetlands,
maybe; more golf courses, maybe not. But we need a rule to gauge
"highest and best use." Is it the market? Read on.</span></p>
<p><b>B. New rules</b></p>
<p>Some of the losers in the market game are not willing to grin and
bear it. Instead, they write new rules; they want to play a different
game. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Soilsmen </span>did this long
since. They like to classify land and
rank it by its potentiality for growing crops. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Farming is - to them -
the ultimate value, so it is the highest and best use: cities may
have what's left over. </span>It is perhaps poetic justice that
habitat-savers are now doing the same thing to farmers. They conceive
highest use as that which saves endangered species: soils and farming
may be damned, right along with housing, commerce, transportation,
industry, storage, water supply, waste disposal, fire control,
education, religion, mining, government, national defense,
recreation, and whatever else needs land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">All human activities, and
survival itself, need land, so that list is a long one.</span> Each
constituent of the other uses becomes an enemy.</p>
<p><b>C. Unresolved
conflicts</b></p>
<p>Both Soilsmen and habitatspersons have a point, we will see, but
they have a fatal weakness. Neither has a system that composes
conflict with other worthy goals, including each others'. As to
cities, both soilsmen and habitat-savers would direct cities away
from low-cost, high-productivity land to the high-cost leftover
lands. They would not make this an end in itself, of course, but it
is the necessary by-product of downgrading urban usage in the
competition for land.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Thus, to restore citriculture and habitat
in what is now L.A. we
would move the city folks to hazard-prone floodplains, steep slopes
subject to fire and erosion, quake-prone fault lines and liquefiable
soils, etc. We would also move them away from the center, imposing
longer commutes, greater auto-dependency, longer utility lines,
longer hauls to dispose of solid wastes, more air to protect, more
aquifer surface to protect, more land to protect from flooding,
etc.</p>
<p><b>D. Danger of
isolation through overkill</b></p>
<p>Sometimes preservationism, like any good cause given power, runs
completely amok and makes itself ridiculous. For example, in Downey,
California, the Los Angeles Conservancy and the National Register of
Historic Places are fighting hard to save - I am not making this up -
a McDonald's drive-in, complete with neon sign! They are serious!
Governor Wilson weighed in with this outburst of California pride:
"The modern history of McDonald's will be as important to the
cultural history of our nation as the invention of Coca Cola." (That
comparison seems apt enough.) "Preserve for posterity the home of
McDonald's golden arches!"</p>
<p>In Victoria, B.C., the University of Victoria bars people from 2-3
acres of its tax-free campus to preserve habitat for its nesting
skylarks, an endangered species. Never mind that they are an import
from England, like starlings: now they are being "preserved" to keep
things natural. Likewise, a certain residence on a steep slope in the
arid Malibu Hills contains an artificial pond, filled with pumped
water, but adorned with reeds "to keep it natural."</p>
<p>Both soilsmen and habitat-persons will become isolated and
ineffective unless they forswear extremism, and modify their new
rules to accommodate other worthy goals with other constituencies.
Until then, they will appear to others to be single-valued
ideologues, fundamentalists with siege mentalities. To succeed they -
we - must learn to lead larger alliances by offering more complete
philosophies and guidelines for policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="II" id="II"></a><b>II.
The Dereliction of Economists</b></p>
<p>There is another kind of fundamentalist, the private property
kind. The economics profession (my tribe) has, in recent years,
largely abdicated its proper role as an arbitrator and gone over
mainly to the side of private-property extremism. This is the
essential meaning of "Neo-classical Economics," which is the idiom of
most discourse in the field today, both in business and in the
profession.</p>
<p>How did economics get so twisted? Don't blame Adam Smith, or David
Ricardo, or John Stuart Mill, or John E. Cairnes, or Knut Wicksell,
or Philip Wicksteed, sterling 19th Century writers. Rather, blame
J.B. Clark, Karl Marx, Richard T. Ely, Alvin Johnson, Frank Fetter,
Frank Knight, George Stigler, and a host of lesser figures who
gradually warped economics into its present form. How did they do
it?</p>
<p><b>A. Defining away
land</b></p>
<p>They wiped out land, resources, nature, and the environment as a
separate class for analysis. In official Neo-classical doctrine, the
world is an infinite reservoir of raw land and resources. Raw land
has no value until man does two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Man subjects land to private tenure. The very act of privatizing
land gives it value it lacked before. Land without an owner has no
value - take that, Aldo Leopold! You will find this in J.B. Clark,
1886, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Philosophy of Wealth</span>.
Clark points out that wealth is created
"from the mere appropriation of limited natural gifts ..." (p.10). The
atmosphere as a whole, showers or breezes, "minister transiently to
whomsoever they will, and, in the long run, with impartiality."
Therefore they are not wealth. Those who appropriate them create wealth
by so doing. The essential attribute of wealth is "appropriability," to
create which "the rights of property must be recognized and enforced,
.... Whoever makes, interprets, or enforces law produces wealth." It
follows that those who pollute the common air, or anything held in
common, are not damaging anything of value, since it belongs to no one.
    <p>Clark writes of "the essential wealth-constituting attribute of
appropriability." He goes on in that vein: those who seize land and
exclude others thereby produce its value. Clark founded Neo-classical
economics, and is emulated closely by the "New Resource Economists" of
today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Man improves the raw land, pumping value into it. After that it
is just like any man-made capital. Raw land has no value: God
contributed nothing. Consistently with this worldview, merely eyeing
the General Sherman redwood tree adds nothing to GNP, but cutting it
down would add a lot. Eyeing it would only raise GNP if you had to pay
for it, or had to drive a long way to get there, and bought a kewpie
doll while you were there. Likewise, commuting 80 miles a day raises
GNP, while finding a homesite near work lowers it.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>B. Private
property: from means to end</b></p>
<p>In a proper view of things, I submit, private property is a means
to an end. It is not an end in itself; it needs a functional
rationale. The end is to get land put to the best use. All the
private land in the world was originally granted by some sovereign
public person or body, mainly for that purpose, not as a welfare
entitlement. Landowners and their lawyers have slyly, over time,
turned the means into an end, a fetish they endow with "sanctity."
This is a term they borrowed from absolutist medieval theology.
"Sanctity" means the quality or state of being holy or sacred, hence
inviolable. It means property may not be challenged, or even
questioned. It has become an end in itself, its own voucher. You're
not even supposed to think about it, it is above thought. Taboo!</p>
<p>Neoclassical economics, historically, marked the final, total
surrender of the profession to this fetish. The modern economist's
view runs something like this: "I pledge allegiance to the 14th
Amendment, and to the overinterpretation of private landowner
supremacy for which it has come to stand." It is ironic to recall
that Radical Republicans passed that Amendment, at a time when a
"Radical Republican" was one who favored freeing the slaves. The 14th
Amendment was designed to protect the rights of freedmen. As
interpreted now, the 14th Amendment means that The Emancipation
Proclamation itself was unconstitutional! Fortunately, no one has
brought that case - yet.</p>
<p>The Neo-classical economists' view of their proper role is rather
like that in The Realtor's Oath, which includes a vow "To protect the
individual right of real estate ownership." The word "individual" is
construed broadly to include corporations, estates, trusts, anonymous
offshore funds, schools, government agencies, institutions,
partnerships, cooperatives, the Duke of Westminster, the Sultan of
Brunei, the Medellin Cartel, Saddam Hussein, congregations,
Archbishops, families (including criminal families) and so on, but
"individual" sounds more all-American and subsumes them all. This is
a potent chant that stirs people to extremes of self-righteousness
and siege mentality when challenged.</p>
<p>The resemblance between Neo-classical economics and the Realtor's
Oath is easier to understand when you learn that Professor Richard T.
Ely, founder of the modern discipline of Land Economics, was heavily
subsidized by the National Association of Real Estate Boards, the
utilities, the major landowning railroads, and others of like mind
and property interests.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When it comes to violating property
rights, air pollution today is
perhaps the greatest invader and confiscator of property. </span>Where
do
economists stand? Once a few of them tried to say, following A.C.
Pigou, "let the polluter pay," and in parts of Europe they still do.
In our modern backward thinking here at home, however, it's not the
polluter who is invading the property of others, nor the human rights
of those not owning property. Rather, when you tell them to stop, the
government is invading their rights. The wage-earning taxpayers must
pay them to stop, else you are violating both the 14th Amendment and
the "Coase Theorem," a rationalization for polluting now dearly
beloved by Neo-classical economists.</p>
<p><b>C. Leapfrogging,
floating value, and compensation</b></p>
<p>The environmental damage from those attitudes might not be so bad
were it not for leapfrogging, urban disintegration, and floating
value. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leapfrogging is when
developers jump over the next eligible
lands for urban expansion, and build farther out, here and there.
</span>This has been a problem in expanding economies ever since cities
emerged from within their ancient walls and stockades, but <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">in our
times and our country it has gone to unprecedented extremes, with
subsidized superhighways and universal auto ownership and truck
shipping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alfred Gobar, savvy real estate
consultant from Placentia, has
recorded the amount of land actually used by city and suburban
dwellers for all purposes. From this, he calculates that the entire
U.S. population could live in the state of Missouri (68,965 square
miles). </span>That would be at a density of 3625 people per square
mile, or
5.67 per acre. That is 7683 square feet per person. On a football
gridiron, this is the area from the goal to the 16-yard line.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">He is not being stingy with land,
at 3625 persons per square mile.</span>
The population density of Washington, D.C., is 10,000 per square
mile, with a 10-story height limit, with vast areas in parks, wide
baroque avenues and vistas, several campuses, and public buildings
and grounds. This is also the density of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, a
well-preserved upper-income residential suburb of Milwaukee, with
generous beaches and parks, tree-lined streets, detached dwellings,
retailing, and a little industry. San Francisco, renowned for its
liveability, has 15,000 per square mile. More than half the land is
in non-residential uses: vast parks, golf courses, huge
military/naval bases, water surface, industry, a huge regional CBD,
etc., so the actual residential density is over 30,000 per square
mile.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On Manhattan's upper East Side they
pile up at over 100,000 per
square mile. </span>They do not crowd like this out of desperation,
either.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may think of rats in
cages, but some of the world's wealthiest
people pay more than we could dream about to live that way. They'll
pay over a million dollars for less than a little patch of ground:
all they get is a stratum of space about 12 feet high on the
umpteenth floor over a little patch of ground they share with many
others. They could afford to live anywhere: they choose Manhattan,
they actually like it there!</span></p>
<p>Take 10,000 per square mile as a reference figure, because it is
easy to calculate with, and because it works in practice, as noted.
You may observe and experience it. At that density, 250 million
Americans would require 25,000 square miles, the land in a circle
with radius of 89 miles, no more. That gives a notion of how little
land is actually demanded for full urban use. It is 9.4% as big as
Texas, 4.2% as big as Alaska, and 7/10 of 1% of the area of the
United States.</p>
<p>And yet, the urban price influence of Los Angeles extends over 89
miles east-south-east clear to Temecula and Murrieta and beyond, at
which point, however, it meets demand pushing north from San Diego.
Urban valuation fever thus affects much more land than can ever
actually be developed for urban use. Regardless, most owners come to
imagine they might cash in at a high price, with high zoning, at
their own convenience, with public services supplied by "the public,"
meaning other taxpayers. This is the meaning of "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">floating value</span>."</p>
<p>If their land is downzoned for farming, open space, or habitat,
they regard it as a "taking," and plead the 14th Amendment. Once we
buy into the Sanctity (Holiness, Sacredness) of private property, we
owe them. If we think of the public's buying large quantities of it
to preserve habitat or open space, the price is already high above
its aggregate value, and the new demand will push the price higher
yet.</p>
<p>Here is a case showing how this works. The Los Angeles
Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) needed the old Union Station,
northeast of downtown in a run-down neighborhood, as the centerpiece
of its new, integrated mass transit system. With the decline of
interurban passenger rail traffic, the old station was unused. The
owners, mainly Southern Pacific, asked more than MTA offered, so MTA
invoked its power of <span style="font-weight: bold;">eminent domain</span>
and condemned the land. The case
went to judgement, and in 1984 the court awarded SP an amount about
twice the going price for land in the area. <i>The court's reason was
that the coming of mass transit would raise values around the new
central station, and SP should be paid as much as neighboring
landowners would be able to get after the station was built.</i></p>
<p><b>Thus, land originally <i>granted</i> to SP to help subsidize
mass transit was used instead to obstruct and penalize mass transit.
Private property had become an end in itself, Holy and Sacred, a
welfare entitlement, rather than a means to an end. MTA (the
taxpayers) had to pay a price for land based on the unearned
increment that its own construction and operation was expected to
create in the future.</b></p>
<p>Later, MTA was to stint on subway construction, resulting in
subsidence on Hollywood Boulevard, but there was no stinting on
paying off SP for doing nothing: the award came to $84.7 millions.
<b>This is how the 14th Amendment works in practice, making private
property an end, sanctified for its own sake, rather than a means to
a higher end. It makes landowners the spoiled children of the
national family, inflating the cost of every program that entails
acquiring land. It means there is no chance that the public, whether
through government or the Nature Conservancy, can preserve more than
token areas of habitat by buying it: it would bankrupt us.</b></p>
<p><b>D. Siege mentalities</b></p>
<p>The result of sprawl and floating value and the Sanctity of
Private Property and the 14th Amendment (as construed) is to put
conservationists-environmentalists-ecologists under siege. Here is a
sharp, clear statement of it from Vivian Null, San Bernardino Audubon
Society.</p>
<blockquote>"Once humans lived in small groups surrounded by expanses
of wilderness. Today, human civilization has pushed our natural world
into ever smaller, fragmented pockets of deteriorating habitat. As a
result, we are living in an age of mass extinction."</blockquote>
<p>I sympathize with the view expressed, and understand what outrages
provoked it. When it comes to solutions, however, we have a problem.
Being under siege fosters a siege mentality. "Science," for all its
virtues, can also be an ideology. To the layman, self-styled "hard"
Scientists can seem more hardheaded and hardball than scientific.
They can seem single-valued, self-righteous, imperious, and -- dare I
say it? -- even a bit arrogant at times. At the same time landowners
also feel under siege. You may observe how developers rage about
having their land set aside for the likes of Stephens Kangaroo Rats,
Three-toed Lizards, and California Gnatcatchers. The ideology of
Science and the ideology of Private Property have become clashing
absolutes, no more able to come to terms than Kach Movement militants
can compromise with Islamic Fundamentalists. What can we do? It helps
to read some history of the successful Conservation Movement of the
Progressive Era.</p>
<p><a name="III" id="III"></a><b>III.
Gifford Pinchot's Winning Formula</b></p>
<p><b>A. Defining
"Conservation"</b></p>
<p>Gifford Pinchot was a great leader of the Conservation Movement.
He defined his central term, conservation, as "The greatest good for
the greatest number for the longest time." Caviling theorists
sometimes pick at that famous phrase, since you cannot maximize three
things at the same time, but that is unfair, since he was not being
technical. He was making a speech, and obviously what he meant was
that those three elements should all be considered, and none was to
be slighted.</p>
<p>Notice especially the middle clause, for the greatest number.
Conservation was not just for landowners, or any other elite.
Conservation was part of the Progressive Movement, which had sprung
from the Populist Movement. Social equity was at its core. Here is
some more of Pinchot's speech (to the 1st National Conservation
Congress, 1909):</p>
<blockquote>... <span style="font-weight: bold;">the third principle
of conservation. It is this: the natural resources must be developed
and preserved for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit
of a few</span>. ... public action for public benefit has ... a much
larger part to play than was the case ... before certain constitutional
arrangements ... had given so tremendously strong a position to vested
rights and property in general. ... by reason of the 14th Amendment to
The Constitution, property rights in the U.S. occupy a stronger
position than in any other country in the civilized world. ... it
becomes then a matter of multiplied importance, ... when property
rights once granted are so strongly entrenched, that they shall be
granted only under such conditions as that the people shall get their
fair share of the benefit which comes from the development of the
country which belongs to us all. The time to do that is now.</blockquote>
<p>You modern habitat-savers, your foes score points against you by
calling you "elitists." Sure enough, you do appear a bit above, and
therefore outside the mainstream, especially when you talk down to
people from the eminence of "Science." Pinchot saw that brick coming
and dodged it before it was even thrown. He teamed up with the
populists; he spoke as a man for the people, even if not quite of
them. Can you say the same? Is there a place in your plans, and your
hearts, for Joe Sixpack?</p>
<p>Here is a list that the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG) has published from its recent public opinion
survey of public issues. Preserving habitat and endangered species
are not even among the top 17 priorities listed by citizens. Neither
are private property rights. Their top three concerns are crime,
education, and jobs. Politicians have preempted the crime issue, but
no one is doing a thing this year for education and jobs. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Take a leaf
from the successful Gifford Pinchot: team up with some populists.
Move into the vacuum left behind the gale of anti-crime oratory. No
one is serving the constituency for education and jobs.</span></p>
<p>Other populist issues high on the SCAG list are homelessness,
affordable housing, job training, and child care.</p>
<p><b>B. Finding common
ground</b></p>
<p>On what basis shall habitat-savers identify with median Americans?
We share a problem: we are all victims of private property rights
carried to extremes. Abraham Lincoln, the original Radical
Republican, once spoke to the effect that whenever landless people
cannot find work and shelter, then the rights of private property
have been carried too far and must be curbed. We have seen what
Gifford Pinchot said.</p>
<blockquote><i>"... natural resources must be developed and preserved
for the benefit of the many and not merely for the profit of a few. ...
the people shall get their fair share of the benefit which comes from
the development of the country WHICH BELONGS TO US ALL." </i></blockquote>
<p>Belongs to us all? Was Pinchot a Communist? Not likely: he was a
Republican, an active political one, twice Governor of
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>We have too little time together to develop that fully, but here
are some ideas. <span style="font-weight: bold;">First,
environmentalists might rethink what we mean
by "open space." To Pinchot, "open" meant the space had public
access. Today it often means the reverse: golf courses, duck clubs,
sacred Indian lands, private beaches, cemeteries, farmlands, vacant
speculative holdings, unpoliced parks taken over by gangs, protected
and posted habitat, water from which swimmers are excluded for power
boats, rights-of-way closed to hikers, University experimental plots,
and so on.</span> In this sense, there is more open land in downtown
Manhattan than in many of our rural and sylvan areas. Many a water
reservoir is open to beavers, ducks and geese, who routinely powder
their noses there, but not to humans who seldom do, and can be
trained not to.</p>
<p>To get more support for habitat, find ways to open it to people,
putting more funds and effort into behavioral controls if necessary.
In Pinchot's day, people spoke unblushingly of "character training,"
and practiced it. Pinchot himself said, "the training of our people
in citizenship is as germane to it (conservation) as the
productiveness of the earth." Wilderness clubs preached and taught
responsible behavior in the wilds. The Boy Scouts taught it, churches
taught it, schools taught it, forest rangers taught it, camp
counselors taught it, community leaders taught it: you heard it all
around, and it did help shape your character. It was a great
community effort, enlisting broad support and conviction. Then, in
that less mobile, less commercialized, more communitarian age, social
control over public behavior came naturally. We came to take it for
granted, until it silently slipped away. Today it may take more
conscious effort, but it was done then, it can be done now.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Second, go with the flow for
economy in government.</span> For most of
our lives now, we have looked to big government to resolve disputes
by buying out both parties. We would have government pay top dollar
for land, if needed, and then hire scientists to manage it for
habitat. Thus, both sides dream of cutting into line at the
government trough: but the trough is empty, and the taxpaying public
is in a foul mood. Rather, let's look for ways to cut spending by
curbing subsidies to urban sprawl. I shall return with
particulars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="IV" id="IV"></a><b>IV.
Pinchot on "Development"</b></p>
<p>Gifford Pinchot, the father of Conservation, was not against
developing land. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>"The first principle of conservation is development, the
use of the natural resources now existing ... for the benefit of the
people who live here now. There may be just as much waste in neglecting
the development and use of certain natural resources as there is in
their destruction by waste. ... Conservation, then, stands emphatically
for the use of substitutes for all the exhaustible natural resources,
... (water power and water transportation are his examples). ... The
development of our natural resources and the fullest use of them for
the present generation is the first duty of this generation. ...
  <p>In the second place conservation stands for the prevention of
waste. ... "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Pinchot was against waste, so what? Who isn't? This could be
just a banality, but he gives it a new turn. To him, waste means
failing to use renewable resources. His example was hydropower, which
he would substitute for coal and oil. That is not such a good example
today, when we cherish our few remaining wild rivers, but today urban
land makes an even better example.</p>
<p>"Urban land?", you may ask. "What has urban land in common with
falling water?" Economists (who are not all bad) classify urban land
as a "flow resource." They liken it to flowing water because its
services perish with time, whether used or not, and we are trapped in
the one-way flow of time. Likewise, urban land is not depleted by
use. It is an even better example of a "flow resource" than flowing
water itself, because, as we are so conscious today, "unharnessed"
flowing water may have other downstream uses. Even in wasting out
through the Golden Gate, it may repel salinity. The unreaped harvests
of idle land, however, flow down the river and out the gates of time
like lost loves dimming, and golden moments we let slip away beyond
recall.</p>
<p>What is this "service" of urban land, that we should be mindful of
it?</p>
<ul>
  <li>For one thing, using central urban land conserves all the
hydrocarbons and other resources otherwise needed to traverse it.
Compact urban settlement is a direct substitute for oil, with all
that implies - and it implies a great deal, which I will leave you to
fill in.</li>
  <li>Second, using good central land saves all the costs of settling
on
other land - including the cost of taking more of the shrinking
habitat from endangered species. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore,
habitat-savers should
emulate Pinchot and favor development in the right places, the better
to oppose it in the wrong places. This is the great lost secret of
conservation our times have forgot. </span>You cannot beat development
by
opposing it everywhere it pops up. People need land for all kinds of
legitimate things, and they will have it. To stop urban sprawl, you
must support compact, efficient urban development, including healthy,
timely renewal of older cities, inner suburbs, and neighborhoods.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="V" id="V"></a><b>V. Urban
Sprawl</b></p>
<p>We have met the enemy, and it is US (Urban Sprawl). Let's analyze
this beast, US.</p>
<p><b>A. Development is
not identical with Sprawl</b></p>
<p>Many people carelessly equate urban growth and urban sprawl, but
they are not the same, not at all. Cities may grow like the posh
upper East Side of Manhattan with 100,000 per square mile, or San
Francisco with 15,000, or Riverside, California with 2500, or
Oklahoma City with 734. Metropolitan regions are even more varied. We
have seen that 250 million Americans could fit nicely into a small
part of southern California, were it compactly settled at moderate
urban densities that are actually found in practice, as in the upper
middle class suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin (10,000 per square
mile).</p>
<p>Urban sprawl, which creates a psychological effect of great
crowding, is not the product of development as such, but of
leapfrogging. Leapfrogging means chaos, with development in the wrong
places and times. Infilling, on the other hand, is anti-sprawl. It is
the cure for sprawl.</p>
<p><b>B. Sprawl is not
a quest for open space</b></p>
<p>A common belief is that the search of open space is the main force
behind sprawl. You may test that by observing high density,
cookie-cutter subdivisions scattered throughout the land. Within each
such development, you are living at urban densities. It is when you
get onto the freeway to commute, or shop, or take the kids to school
or the dentist, or worship, that you experience open space. You
experience it as a negative resource, an obstacle between where you
are and where you want to go.</p>
<p><b>C. Sprawl is not
the product of free choice</b></p>
<p>A favorite fallacy is that sprawl results from free individual
choice. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In fact, sprawl results
mainly from subsidies to sprawl,
enforced through taxation and/or utility rate regulation. Thus it is
imposed, not freely chosen. </span>The classic case, which exemplifies
the
whole genus, is postal service. It costs you 29&cent; to send a
letter across the street downtown, or from rural Idaho to rural
Florida. The generic name for such subsidies to sprawl is
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">postage-stamp pricing</span>" (a
species of spatial cross-subsidy), which
gives you the idea.</p>
<p>In British Columbia, people move around a good deal by car-ferry,
because of the terrain. The Provincial Government ("The Crown
Provincial") runs the system. There are many lovely little islands in
the Straits of Georgia, between Vancouver Island and the mainland,
favored by the wealthy, the exclusive and reclusive. Being more
sybaritic than Henry D. Thoreau, and politically puissant, they have
demanded and received car-ferry service. This service costs about $10
for every $1 in revenue. The resulting deficit is covered by raising
rates on the main plebeian line, Victoria-Vancouver. Naturally, these
cheap ferries attract new visitors to the islands, and new demand for
land there.</p>
<p><b>D. Looking for Mr.
Goodbar</b></p>
<p>Here is how we get urban sprawl with leapfrogging. Remember the
last time you moved and went househunting? You saw some mouthwatering
homes, but they were not for sale. You had to find motivated sellers,
and pick from what they offered. It's the same with builders. They
scour the exurbs seeking motivated sellers. Ideally the most
motivated sellers would line up by distance from the existing city,
but the market is not ideal. Each seller is moved by his personal
circumstances, not the geographical location.</p>
<p>Potential builders are little concerned with the social costs they
might impose, so long as others are to bear them. Thus, they
sometimes settle for and build</p>
<ul>
  <li>on steep lands (like Malibu Hills)
with flammable brush and erosion problems,</li>
  <li>on flood plains (like
Victoria Woods subdivision in Riverside),  </li>
  <li>on soils subject to
liquefaction in quakes (like Northridge),  </li>
  <li>in canyons and arroyos,  </li>
  <li>on
lands with limited access for emergency equipment.  </li>
  <li>They even build on
lands without water supply, even in arid southern California, then
demand water and get it, secure in the knowledge that Sacramento
rejected a recent move to ban development in areas with no assured
water supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>E. The public pays
twice</b></p>
<p>Let's go back to those Channel Islands in British Columbia, with
subsidized car-ferries. Naturally, as I said, these cheap ferries
attract new visitors to the islands, and new demand for land there.
Developers and hopeful subdividers bid up land prices. This is not
what the old settlers had in mind: their environment is threatened,
including the habitat of endangered species. They appeal to the
Crown, which subsidizes their ferries, to help them preserve land for
habitat.</p>
<p>They want the government to buy some of it, paying the high prices
created by the ferry subsidy, to keep it from use by people who might
use the ferries. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the government
would pay twice: to subsidize
the ferries, and then to retire the land at the high prices made
possible by the ferries. </span>Failing that, they want the Crown to
downzone most of it. The landowners are not charged when the ferries
raise their asking prices, but demand compensation when
downzoned.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here, in microcosm, is the American
problem with sprawl and
habitat. </span>Multiply that ferry subsidy a thousand times, and you
have
the Great American System of Public Works and Services for Private
Gain. First the public pays to bring urban demand to remote lands;
now the landowners, the spoiled children of the national family,
demand to be paid again for downzoning or selling that same land to
preserve habitat. They demand payment not to cash in on the
opportunities we just gave them free.</p>
<p>T<span style="font-weight: bold;">hus far, it is true, the courts
have let us downzone without
compensating. However, now a storm has gathered. Proposition 300, on
the ballot in Arizona, demands compensation for downzoning - it is
aimed at the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. There is
a movement in Congress to compensate for any Federal regulation that
devalues land by more than 50%.</span> It is led by Congressman Billy
Tauzin, a Democrat from Louisiana. You can imagine what a more
conservative Congress might do. Speculative landowners may soon get
everything they demand, leaving heavy debts to which their light tax
payments now contribute very little.<br>

<p><b>F. Proactive
solutions</b></p>
<p>How do we dig out from this one?</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'll repeat: <span style="font-weight: bold;">go with the flow
of
cutting public spending by cutting down subsidies to urban sprawl.</span>
They are a major source of the problem. We'll never win the
environmental fight until those subsidies are withdrawn.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second proactive solution is
to motivate and help the owners of
good land to sell or develop it.</span> To help them, make infilling a
positive goal. If you put impost fees on new buildings, do so only in
outlying areas that require new public services, not on new buildings
that help renew places like South Central L.A. If you ration sewer
hookups, save them for central land with street improvements already
in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the carrots. A good stick is also needed. We have seen
how leapfrogging results from the scattered locations of motivated
sellers. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We
can motivate sellers near-in, and in compact increments
as we expand spatially, by raising land taxes there. </span>Proposition
13
makes this difficult, but not impossible: many special assessments
have the essential motivating quality of land taxes, with a different
legal form, that exempts them from Proposition 13.</p>
<p>I could wax rhapsodic about the results to expect from such
taxation, but have done so elsewhere and will leave it with a word:
visit Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Copenhagen, or Johannesburg, which
have made use of this principle to excellent effect.</p>
<p><a name="V" id="V"></a><b>VI. Dig
deep</b></p>
<p>These are basic issues, and call for bold actions. Do not waste
your time on wimpish meliorism, or "Goo-goo" thinking. For
example:</p>
<blockquote>It is said we need a land use inventory. We already have
lots of them: people have been classifying land for decades. The
question is, what shall we do with them?
  <p>It is said we need "risk ratings." These are subject to
manipulation and juggling, like benefit/cost analyses of recent ill
fame. The question is, who will control the ratings, and to what ends?</p>
  <p>It is said we need fire models. We have fire models; they were
already chic in 1950. The question is, how to keep scattered homes out
of fire-prone areas, where they make prescribed controlled burning
nearly impossible. The question is how to keep the State and the fire
insurance industry from cross-subsidizing these homes by averaging
their risks in with others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather, let us study how to emulate the model of Butchart Gardens,
near Victoria, B.C. Butchart doesn't sound like a gardener's name,
and sure enough, Mr. Butchart was a hardrock miner who attacked the
earth and left a great ugly gash in it. Ah, but Mrs. Butchart, she
wanted space for a garden, so she made one there. She rediscovered
the truth that land is not just the matter that occupies space, it is
space, always renewable and reclaimable. Now Butchart Gardens is one
of the world's great beauty spots, drawing visitors from everywhere -
in the summertime you hear every language there. Our decayed central
cities, too, may bloom again like Mrs. Butchart's garden. Let us make
it our model.</p>
