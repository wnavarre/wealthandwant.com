    <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE DEAN'S LETTER</span><br>
    <br>
  Having read much of you and your many acts of charity and philanthropy,
  I write to ask for a donation from you for our institution.<br>
  <br>
  It may seem strange that I ask this of one who is not of our faith, yet
  I have read in some of your speeches that you make no distinction of
  race, creed, or color, and that you regard all men as your brothers;
  that you believe in the Brotherhood of Man and the Fatherhood of God.
  Thus you are teaching what our institution teaches, and our school is
  doing, as best it can with limited means, the work you are trying to
  do. ...<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">MR. FELS' REPLY</span><br>
  <br>
  Replying to your communication, I am at a loss to know where you have
  read of my &quot;acts of charity and philanthropy." I am not a
  philanthropist, and give nothing to charity.<br>
  <br>
  When you say I am not of your "faith," I suppose you mean of your
  creed. Let me state my faith, and we can see wherein we differ.<br>
  <br>
  I believe in the Fatherhood of God, and therefore in the Brotherhood of
  Man. By "Man," I mean all men. So far, I suppose we agree.<br>
  <br>
  I believe that the Creator freely gave the earth to all of His
  children, that all may have equal rights to its use. Do you agree to
  that?<br>
  <br>
  I believe that the injunction, "In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat
  bread," necessarily implies, "Thou shalt not eat bread in the sweat of
  thy brother's brow." Do you agree?<br>
  <br>
  I believe that all are violating the divine law who live in idleness on
  wealth produced by others, since they eat bread in the sweat of their
  brothers' brows. Do you agree?<br>
  <br>
  I believe that no man should have power to take wealth he has not
  produced or earned unless freely given to him by the producer. Do you
  agree?<br>
  <br>
  I believe that brotherhood requires giving an equivalent for every
  service received from a brother. Do you agree?<br>
  <br>
  I believe it is blasphemous to assert or insinuate that God has
  condemned some of His children to hopeless poverty, and to the Crimea,
  want, and misery resulting therefrom, and has, at the same time,
  awarded to others lives of ease and luxury, without labor. Do you agree?<br>
  <br>
  I believe that involuntary poverty and involuntary idleness are
  unnatural, and are due to the denial by some of the right of others to
  use freely the gift of God to all. Do you agree?<br>
  <br>
  Since labor products are needed to sustain life, and since labor must
  be applied to land in order to produce, I believe that every child
  comes into life with divine permission to use land without the consent
  of any other child of God. Do you agree?<br>
  <br>
  Where men congregate in organized society, land has a value apart from
  the value of things produced by labor; as population and industry
  increase, the value of land increases, but the value of labor products
  does not. That increase in land value is community-made value. Inasmuch
  as your power to labor is a gift of God, all the wealth produced by
  your labor is yours, and no man nor collection of men has a right to
  take any of it from you. Do you agree to that?<br>
  <br>
  I believe the community-made value of land belongs to the community,
  just as the wealth produced by you belongs to you. Do you agree to that?<br>
  <br>
  Therefore, I believe that the fundamental evil, the great God-denying
  crime of society, is the iniquitous system under which men are
  permitted to put into their pocket, confiscate, in fact, the
  community-made values of land, while organized society confiscates for
  public purposes a part of the wealth created by individuals. Do you
  agree to that?<br>
  <br>
  Using a concrete illustration: I own in the city of Philadelphia 11-1/2
  acres of land, for which I paid 32,500 dollars a few years ago. On
  account of increase of population and industry in Philadelphia, that
  land is now worth about 125,000 dollars. I have expended no labor or
  money upon it. So I have done nothing to cause that increase of 92,500
  dollars in a few years. My fellow-citizens in Philadelphia created it,
  and I believe it therefore belongs to them, not to me. I believe that
  the man-made law which gives to me and other landlords values we have
  not created is a violation of the divine law. I believe that Justice
  demands that these community-made values be taken by the community for
  common purposes instead of taxing enterprise and industry. Do you agree?<br>
  <br>
  That is my creed, my faith, my religion. Do you teach that, or anything
  like it, in your theological school? If not, why not? I have a right to
  ask, since you have asked me for money. If you agree to my
  propositions, but do not teach them, tell me why. If I am in error,
  show me in what respect.<br>
  <br>
  I am using all the money I have to teach my creed, my faith, my
  religion, as best I can. I am using it as best I know how to abolish
  the Hell of civilization, which is want and fear of want. I am using it
  to bring in the will of our Father, to establish the Brotherhood of Man
  by giving each of my brothers an equal opportunity to have and use the
  gifts of our Father. Am I misusing that money? If so, why, and how?<br>
  <br>
  If my teaching is wrong and contrary to true religion, I want to know
  it. I take it that if you are not teaching religion to its fulness, you
  wish to know it. Am I correct?<br>
  <br>
  What I teach may be criticized as mixing politics with religion, but
  can I be successfully attacked on that ground? Politics, in its true
  meaning, is the science of government. Is government a thing entirely
  apart from religion or from righteousness? Is not just government
  founded upon right doing?<br>
  <br>
  If my religion is true, if it accords with the basic principles of
  morality taught by Jesus, how is it possible for your school to teach
  Christianity when it ignores the science of government? Or is your
  school so different from other theological schools that it does not
  teach the fundamental moral principles upon which men associate
  themselves in organised government?<br>
  <br>
  Do you question the relationship between taxation and righteousness?
  Let us see. If government is a natural growth, then surely God's
  natural law provides food and sustenance for government as that food is
  needed; for where in Nature do we find a creature coming into the world
  without timely provision of natural food for it? It is in our system of
  taxation that we find the most emphatic denial of the Fatherhood of God
  and the Brotherhood of Man, because, first, in order to meet our common
  needs, we take from individuals what does not belong to us in common;
  second, we permit individuals to take for themselves what does belong
  to us in common; thus, third, under the pretext of taxation for public
  purposes, we have established a system that permits some men to tax
  other men for private profit.<br>
  <br>
  Does not that violate the natural, the divine law? Does it not surely
  beget wolfish greed on the one hand, and gaunt poverty on the other?
  Does it not surely breed millionaires on one end of the social scale
  and tramps on the other end? Has it not brought into civilization a
  hell, of which the savage can have no conception? Could any better
  system be devised for convincing men that God is the father of a few
  and the stepfather of the many? Is not that destructive of the
  sentiment of brotherhood? With such a condition, how is it possible for
  men in masses to obey the new commandment, "that ye love one another"?
  What could more surely thrust men apart? What could more surely divide
  them into warring classes?<br>
  <br>
  You say that you need money to train young men and fit them "to carry
  the Word to the heathen of foreign lands, and thus be instrumental in
  dispelling the darkness that reigns among millions of our brethren in
  other lands." That is a noble purpose. But what message would your
  school give to these young men to take to the benighted brethren that
  would stand a fire of questions from an intelligent heathen? Suppose,
  for example, your school sends to some pagan country an intelligent
  young man, who delivers his message; and suppose an intelligent man in
  the audience asks these questions:  <br>
  </div>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">You come from America, when your
religion has been taught for about 400
years, where every small village has one of your churches, and the
great cities have scores upon scores. Do all the people attend these
churches? Do your countrymen generally practice what you preach to us?
Does even a considerable minority practice it? Are your laws consistent
with or contrary to the religion you preach to us? Are your cities
clean morally in proportion to the number of churches they contain? Do
your courts administer Justice impartially between man and man, between
rich and poor? Is it as easy for a poor man as for a rich one to get
his rights in your courts?<br>
<br>
You have great and powerful millionaires. How did they get their money?
Have they more influence than the poor in your churches and in your
congress, your legislatures and courts? Do they, in dealing with their
employees, observe the moral law that "the laborer is worthy of his
hire"? Do they treat their hired laborers as brothers? Do they put
children to work who ought to be at play or at school?<br>
<br>
Do your churches protect when the militia is called out during a
strike, or do they forget at such times what Jesus said about the use
of the sword?<br>
<br>
After four centuries of teaching and preaching of your religion in your
country, has crime disappeared or diminished? Have you less use for
jails? Are fewer and fewer of your people driven into madhouses, and
have suicides decreased? Is there a larger proportion of crime amongst
Jews and infidels than among those who profess the Christian Religion?</div>
<p>  What answers would your missionary return to these questions? How would
  you answer them?<br>
  <br>
  I do not attack Christianity. The foregoing questions are not intended
  as criticism of the great moral code underlying Christianity, but as
  criticism of the men who preach, but do not practice that code. My
  contention is that the code of morals taught to the fishermen of
  Galilee by the Carpenter of Nazareth is all-embracing and
  all-sufficient for our social life.<br>
  <br>
  I shall be glad to contribute to your theological school or to any
  other that gets down to the bedrock of that social and moral code,
  accepts it in its fulness, and trains its students to teach and preach
  it regardless of the raiment, the bank accounts, the social standing or
  political position of the persons in the pews.<br>
