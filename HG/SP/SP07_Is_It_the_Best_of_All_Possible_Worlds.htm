<p align="center"><strong>Is It the Best of All Possible Worlds?
</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 6 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
(1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>THERE are worlds and worlds &#8212; even within
  the bounds of the same horizon. The man who comes into New York with plenty
  of money, who puts up at the Windsor
  or Brunswick, and is received by hospitable hosts in Fifth Avenue mansions,
  sees one New York. The man who comes with a dollar and a half, and goes to
  a twenty-five cent lodging-house, sees another. There are also fifteen cent
  lodging-houses, and people too poor to go even to them.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> Into the pleasant avenues of the Park, in the bright May sunshine, dashes
  the railroad-wrecker's daughter, her tasty riding-habit floating free from
  the side of her glistening bay, and her belted groom, in fresh top-boots and
  smart new livery, clattering after, at a respectful distance, on another blooded
  horse, that chafes at the bit. The stock-gambler's son, rising from his trotter
  at every stride, in English fashion, his English riding-stick grasped by the
  middle, raises his hat to her nod. And as he whirls past in his London-made
  dog-cart, a liveried servant sitting with folded arms behind him, she exchanges
  salutations with the high-born descendant of the Dutch gardener, whose cabbage-patch,
  now covered with brick and mortar, has become an &quot;estate&quot; of lordly
  income. While in the soft, warm air rings a musical note, and drawn by mettled
  steeds, the four-in-hands of the coaching club rush by, with liveried guards
  and coach-tops filled with chattering people, to whom life, with its round
  of balls, parties, theaters, flirtations and excursions, is a holiday, in which,
  but for the invention of new pleasures, satiety would make time drag.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03]</font> How different this bright world from that of the old woman who, in the
  dingy lower street, sits from morning to night beside her little stock of apples
  and candy; from that of the girls who stand all day behind counters and before
  looms, who bend over sewing-machines for weary, weary hours, or who come out
  at night to prowl the streets!</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>One railroad king puts the great provinces of his realm in charge of
  satraps and goes to Europe; the new steel yacht of another is being fitted,
  regardless of expense, for a voyage around the world, if it pleases him to
  take it; a third will not go abroad &#8212;  he is too busy buying in his &quot;little
  old railroad&quot; every day. Other human beings are gathered into line every
  Sunday afternoon by the Rev. Coffee-and-rolls-man, and listen to his preaching
  for the dole they are to get. And upon the benches in the squares sit men from
  whose sullen, deadened faces the fire of energy and the light of hope, have
  gone &#8212; &quot;tramps&quot; and &quot;bums,&quot; the broken, rotted,
  human driftwood, the pariahs of our society.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>I stroll along Broadway in the evening, and by the magnificent saloon
  of the man who killed Jim Fisk, I meet a good fellow whom I knew years ago
  in California, when he could not jingle more than one dollar on another. It
  is different now, and he takes a wad of bills from his pocket to pay for the
  thirty-five-cent cigars we light. He has rooms in the most costly of Broadway
  hotels, his clothes are cut by Blissert, and he thinks Delmonico's about the
  only place to get a decent meal. He tells me about some &quot;big things&quot; he
  has got into, and talks about millions as though they were marbles. If a man
  has any speed in him at all, he says, it is just as easy to deal in big things
  as in little things, and the men who play such large hands in the great game
  are no smarter than other men, when you get alongside of them and take their
  measure. As to politics, he says, it is only a question who hold the offices.
  The corporations rule the country, and are going to rule it, and the man is
  a fool who doesn't get on their side. As for the people, what do they know
  or care! The press rules the people, and capital rules the press. Better hunt
  with the dogs than be hunted with the hare.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>We part, and as I turn down the street another acquaintance greets me,
  and, as his conversation grows interesting, I go out of my way, for to delay
  him were sin, as he must be at work by two in the morning. He has been trying
  to read &quot;<a href="../../George_P&P.html">Progress and
  Poverty</a>,&quot; he says: but he has to take it in
  such little snatches, and the children make such a noise in his two small rooms
  &#8212; for his wife is afraid to let them out on the street to learn so much
  bad &#8212; that it is hard work to understand some parts of it. He is a journeyman
  baker, but he has a good situation as journeyman bakers go. He works in a restaurant,
  and only twelve hours a day. Most bakers, he tells me, have to work fourteen
  and sixteen hours. Some of the places they work in would sicken a man not used
  to it, and even those used to it are forced to lie off every now and again,
  and to drink, or they could not stand it. In some bakeries they use good stock,
  he says, but they have to charge high prices, which only the richer people
  will pay. In most of them you often have to sift the maggots out of the flour,
  and the butter is always rancid. He belongs to a Union, and they are trying
  to get in all the journeyman bakers; but those that work longest, and have
  most need of it, are the hardest to get. Their long hours make them stupid,
  and take all the spirit out of them. He has tried to get into business for
  himself, and he and his wife once pinched and saved till they got a few hundred
  dollars, and then set up a little shop. But he had not money enough to buy
  a share in the Flour Association &#8212;  a cooperative association of boss
  bakers, by which the members get stock at lowest rates &#8212; and he could
  not compete, lost his money, and had to go to work again as a journeyman. He
  can see no
  chance at all of getting out of it, he says; he sometimes thinks he might as
  well be a slave. His family grows larger and it costs more to keep them. His
  rent was raised two dollars on the 1st of May. His wife remonstrated with the
  agent, said they were making no more, and it cost them more to live. The agent
  said he could not help that; the property had increased in value, and the rents
  must be raised. The reason people complained of rents was that they lived too
  extravagantly, and thought they must have everything anybody else had. People
  could live, and keep strong and fat, on nothing but oatmeal. If they would
  do that they would find it easy enough to pay their rent.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> There is such a rush across the Atlantic that it is difficult to engage
  a passage for months ahead. The doors of the fine, roomy houses in the fashionable
  streets will soon be boarded up, as their owners leave for Europe, for the
  sea-shore, or the mountains. &quot;Everybody is out of town,&quot; they will
  say. Not quite everybody, though. Some twelve or thirteen hundred thousand
  people, without counting Brooklyn, will be left to swelter through the hot
  summer. The swarming tenement houses will not be boarded up; every window and
  door will be open to catch the least breath of air. The dirty streets will
  be crawling with squalid life, and noisy with the play of unkempt children,
  who never saw a green field or watched the curl of a breaker, save perhaps,
  when charity gave them a treat. Dragged women will be striving to quiet pining
  babies, sobbing and wailing away their little lives for the want of wholesome
  nourishment and fresh air; and degradation and misery that hide during the
  winter will be seen on every hand.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>In such a city as this, the world of some is as different from the world
  in which others live as Jupiter may be from Mars. There are worlds we shut
  our eyes to, and do not bear to think of, still less to look at, but in which
  human beings yet live &#8212; worlds in which vice takes the place of virtue,
  and from which hope here and hope hereafter seem utterly banished &#8212; brutal,
  discordant, torturing hells of wickedness and suffering.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>&quot;Why do they cry for bread?&quot; asked the innocent French princess,
  as the roar of the fierce, hungry mob resounded through the courtyard of Versailles. &quot;If
  they have no bread, why don't they eat cake?&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>Yet, not a fool above other fools was the pretty princess, who never
  in her whole life had known that cake was not to be had for the asking. &quot;Why
  are not the poor thrifty and virtuous and wise and temperate?&quot; one hears
  whenever in luxurious parlors such subjects are mentioned. What is this but
  the question of the French princess? Thrift and virtue and wisdom and temperance
  are not the fruits of poverty.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>But it is not this of which I intended here to speak so much as of that
  complacent assumption which runs through current thought and speech, that this
  world in which we, nineteenth-century, Christian, American men and women live,
  is, in its social adjustments, at least, about such a world as the Almighty
  intended it to be.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12] </font>Some say this in terms, others say it by implication, but in one form
  or another it is constantly taught. Even the wonders of modern invention have,
  with a most influential part of society, scarcely shaken the belief that social
  improvement is impossible. Men of the sort who, a little while ago, derided
  the idea that steam-carriages might be driven over the land and steam-vessels
  across the sea, would not now refuse to believe in the most startling mechanical
  invention. But he who thinks society may be improved, he who thinks that poverty
  and greed may he driven from the world, is still looked upon in circles that
  pride themselves on their culture and rationalism as a dreamer, if not as a
  dangerous lunatic.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>The old idea that everything in the social world
  is ordered by the Divine Will &#8212; that it is the mysterious dispensations
  of Providence that give wealth to the few and order poverty as the lot of the
  many, make some rulers
  and the
  others serfs &#8212; is losing power; but another idea that serves the same
  purpose is taking its place, and we are told, in the name of science, that
  the only
  social improvement that is possible is by a slow race-evolution, of which the
  fierce struggle for existence is the impelling force; that, as I have recently
  read in &quot;a journal of civilization&quot; from the pen of a man who has
  turned from the preaching of what he called Christianity to the teaching of
  what he calls political economy, &quot;only the &eacute;lite of the race has
  been raised to the point where reason and conscience can even curb the lower
  motive forces,&quot; and that for all but a few of us the limit of attainment
  in life, in the best case, is to live out our term, to pay our debts, to place
  three or four children in a position as good as the father's was, and there
  make the account balance.&quot; As for &quot;friends of humanity,&quot; and
  those who would &quot;help the poor,&quot; they get from him the same scorn
  which the Scribes and Pharisees eighteen hundred years ago visited on a pestilent
  social reformer whom they finally crucified.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14]</font> Lying beneath all such theories is the selfishness that would resist
  any inquiry into the titles to the wealth which greed has gathered, and the
  difficulty and indisposition on the part of the comfortable classes of realizing
  the existence of any other world than that seen through their own eyes.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>That &quot;one-half of the world does not know how the other half live,&quot; is
  much more true of the upper than of the lower half. We look upon that which
  is pleasant rather than that which is disagreeable. The shop-girl delights
  in the loves of the Lord de Maltravers and the Lady Blanche, just as children
  without a penny will gaze in confectioners' windows, as hungry men dream of
  feasts, and poor men relish tales of sudden wealth. And social suffering is
  for the most part mute. The well-dressed take the main street, but the ragged
  slink into the byways. The man in a good coat will be listened to where the
  same man in tatters would be hustled off. It is that part of society that has
  the best reason to be satisfied with things as they are that is heard in the
  press, in the church, and in the school, and that forms the conventional opinion
  that this world in which we American Christians, in the latter half of the
  nineteenth century, live is about as good a world as the Creator (if there
  is a Creator) intended it should be.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>But look around. All over the world the beauty and the glory and the
  grace of civilization rest on human lives crushed into misery and distortion.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17]</font> I will not speak of Germany, of France, of England. Look even here, where
  European civilization flowers in the free field of a new continent; where there
  are no kings, no great standing armies, no relics of feudal servitude; where
  national existence began with the solemn declaration of the equal and inalienable
  rights of men. I clip, almost at random, from a daily paper, for I am not seeking
  the blackest shadows:</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18] </font>Margaret Hickey, aged 30 years, came to this city a few days ago from
  Boston with a seven-weeks-old baby. She tried to get work, but was not successful.
  Saturday night she placed the child in a cellar at No. 226 West Forty-second
  Street. At midnight she called at Police Headquarters and said she had lost
  her baby in Forty-third Street. In the meantime an officer found the child.
  The mother was held until yesterday morning, when she was taken to Yorkville
  Court and sent to the Island for six months.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19] </font>Morning and evening, day after day, in these times of peace and prosperity,
  one may read in our daily papers such items as this, and worse than this. We
  are so used to them that they excite no attention and no comment. We know what
  the fate of Margaret Hickey, aged thirty years, and of her baby, aged seven
  weeks, sent to the Island for six months, will be. Better for them and better
  for society were they drowned outright, as we would drown a useless cat and
  mangy kitten; but so common are such items that we glance at them as we glance
  at the number of birds wounded at a pigeon-match, and turn to read &quot;what
  is going on in society;&quot; of the last new opera or play; of the cottages
  taken for the season at Newport or Long Branch; of the millionaire's divorce
  or the latest great defalcation; how Heber Newton is to be driven out of the
  Episcopal Church for declaring the Song of Solomon a love-drama, and the story
  of Jonah and the whale a poetical embellishment; or how the great issue which
  the American people are to convulse them selves about next year is the turning
  of the Republican party out of power.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20]</font> I read the other day in a Brooklyn paper of a coroner's jury summoned
  to inquire, as the law directs, into the cause of death of a two days' infant.
  The unwholesome room was destitute of everything save a broken chair, a miserable
  bed and an empty whisky-bottle. On the bed lay, uncared for, a young girl,
  mother of the dead infant; over the chair, in drunken stupor, sprawled a man &#8212;  her
  father. &quot;The horror-stricken jury,&quot; said the report, &quot;rendered
  a verdict in accordance with the facts, and left the place as fast as they
  could.&quot; So do we turn from these horrors. Are there not policemen and
  station-houses, almshouses and charitable societies?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>Nevertheless, we send missionaries to the heathen; and I read the other
  day how the missionaries, sent to preach to the Hindus the Baptist version
  of Christ's gospel, had been financed out of the difference between American
  currency and Indian rupees by the godly men who stay at home and boss the job.
  Yet, from Arctic to Antarctic Circle, where are the heathen among whom such
  degraded and distorted human beings are to be found as in our centers of so-called
  Christian civilization, where we have such a respect for the all-seeing eye
  of God that if you want a drink on Sunday you must go into the saloon by the
  back door? Among what tribe of savages, who never saw a missionary, can the
  cold-blooded horrors testified to in the Tewksbury Almshouse investigation
  be matched? &quot;Babies don't generally live long here,&quot; they told the
  farmer's wife who brought them a little waif. And neither did they &#8212;  seventy-three
  out of seventy-four dying in a few weeks, their little bodies sold off at a
  round rate per dozen to the dissecting-table, and a six months' infant left
  there two days losing three pounds in weight. Nor did adults &#8212; the broken
  men and women who there sought shelter &#8212; fare better. They were robbed,
  starved, beaten, turned into marketable corpses as fast as possible, while
  the highly
  respectable managers waxed fat and rich, and set before legislative committees
  the best of dinners and the choicest of wines. It were slander to dumb brutes
  to speak of the bestial cruelty disclosed by the opening of this whited sepulcher.
  Yet, not only do the representatives of the wealth and culture and &quot;high
  moral ideas&quot; of Massachusetts receive coldly these revelations, they fight
  bitterly the man who has made them, as though the dragging of such horrors
  to light, not the doing of them, were the unpardonable sin. They were only
  paupers! And I read in the journal founded by Horace Greeley, that &quot;the
  woes of the Tewksbury paupers are no worse than the common lot of all inmates
  of pauper refuges the country over.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22] </font>Or take the revelations made this winter before a legislative committee
  of the barbarities practised in New York state prisons. The system remains
  unaltered; not an official has been even dismissed. The belief that dominates
  our society is evidently that which I find expressed in &quot;a journal of
  civilization&quot; by a reverend professor at Yale, that &quot;the criminal
  has no claims against society at all. What shall be done with him is a question
  of expediency&quot;! I wonder if our missionaries to the heathen ever read
  the American papers? I am certain they don't read them to the heathen.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23] </font>Behind all this is social disease. Criminals, paupers, prostitutes, women
  who abandon their children, men who kill themselves in despair of making a
  living, the existence of great armies of beggars and thieves, prove that there
  are large classes who find it difficult with the hardest toil to make an honest
  and sufficient livelihood. So it is. &quot;There is,&quot; incidentally said
  to me, recently, a New York Supreme Judge, &quot;a large class &#8212;  I
  was about to say a majority &#8212;  of the population of New York and Brooklyn,
  who just live, and to whom the rearing of two more children means inevitably
  a
  boy for the
  penitentiary and a girl for the brothel.&quot; A partial report of charitable
  work in New York city, not embracing the operations of a number of important
  societies, shows 36,000 families obtaining relief, while it is estimated that
  were the houses in New York city containing criminals and the recipients of
  charity set side by side they would make a street twenty-two miles long. One
  charitable society in New York city extended aid this winter to the families
  of three hundred tailors. Their wages are so small when they do work that when
  work gives out they must beg, steal or starve.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[24] </font>Nor is this state of things confined to the metropolis. In Massachusetts
  the statistician of the Labor Bureau declares that among wage laborers the
  earnings (exclusive of the earnings of minors) are less than the cost of living;
  that in the majority of cases working-men do not support their families on
  their individual earnings alone, and that fathers are forced to depend upon
  their children for from one-quarter to one-third of the family earnings, children
  under fifteen supplying from one-eighth to one-sixth of the total earnings.
  Miss Emma E. Brown has shown how parents are forced to evade the law prohibiting
  the employment of young children, and in Pennsylvania, where a similar law
  has been passed, I read how, forced by the same necessity, the operatives of
  a mill have resolved to boycott a storekeeper whose relative had informed that
  children under thirteen were employed. While in Canada last winter it was shown
  that children under thirteen were kept at work in the mills from six in the
  evening to six in the morning, a man on duty with a strap to keep them awake.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[25]</font> Illinois is one of the richest States of the Union. It is scarcely yet
  fairly settled, for the last census shows the male population in excess of
  the female, and wages are considerably higher than in more eastern States.
  In their last report the Illinois Commissioners of Labor Statistics say that
  their tables of wages and cost of living are representative only of intelligent
  working-men who make the most of their advantages, and do not reach &quot;the
  confines of that world of helpless ignorance and destitution in which multitudes
  in all large cities continually live, and whose only statistics are those of
  epidemics, pauperism and crime.&quot; Nevertheless, they go on to say, all
  examination of these tables will demonstrate that one-half of these intelligent
  working-men of Illinois &quot;are not even able to earn enough for their daily
  bread, and have to depend upon the labor of women and children to eke out their
  miserable existence.&quot;</p>
<p>[26] It is the fool who saith in his heart there is no God. But what shall
  we call the man who tells us that with this sort of a world God bids us be
  content? </p>
