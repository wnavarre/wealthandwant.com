<p align="center"><strong>Slavery and Slavery</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 15 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
  (1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> I MUST leave it to the reader to carry on in other
  directions, if he choose, such inquiries as those to which the last three chapters
  have been
  devoted.* The more carefully he examines, the more fully will he see that at
  the root of every social problem lies a social wrong, that &quot;ignorance,
  neglect or contempt of human rights are the causes of public misfortunes and
  corruptions of government.&quot; Yet, in truth, no elaborate examination is
  necessary. To understand why material progress does not benefit the masses
  requires but a recognition of the self evident truth that man cannot live without
land; that it is only on land and from land that human labor can produce.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>*They are pursued in more regular and scientific form in <em><a href="../../George_P&P.html">Progress
      and Poverty</a></em>,
    a book to which I must refer the reader a more elaborate discussion of economic
  questions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> Robinson Crusoe, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose, however,
  that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe had welcomed him
  as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of Independence, an Emancipation
  Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment, and informed him that he was a free
  and independent citizen, entitled to vote and hold office; but had at the same
  time also informed him that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's)
  private and exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since
  Friday could not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if
  he lived at all he must live on the island, he would have been in one case
  as much a slave as in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would be
  equivalent to his ownership of Friday.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>Chattel slavery is, in fact, merely the rude and
  primitive mode of property in man. It only grows up where population is sparse;
  it never, save by virtue
  of special circumstances, continues where the pressure of population gives
  land a high value, for in that case the ownership of land gives all the power
  that comes from the ownership of men, in more convenient form. When in the
  course of history we see the conquerors making chattel slaves of the conquered,
  it is always where population is sparse and land of little value, or where
  they want to carry off their human spoil. In other cases, the conquerors merely
  appropriate the lands of the conquered, by which means they just as effectually,
  and much more conveniently, compel the conquered to work for them. It was not
  until the great estates of the rich patricians began to depopulate Italy that
  the importation of slaves began. In Turkey and Egypt, where chattel slavery
  is yet legal, it is confined to the inmates and attendants of harems. English
  ships carried negro slaves to America, and not to England or Ireland, because
  in America land was cheap and labor was valuable, while in western Europe land
  was valuable and labor was cheap. As soon as the possibility of expansion over
  new land ceased, chattel slavery would have died out in our Southern States.
  As it is, Southern planters do not regret the abolition of slavery. They get
  out of the freedmen as tenants as much as they got out of them as slaves. While
  as for predial slavery &#8212;  the attachment of serfs to the soil&#8212;  the form of chattel slavery which existed longest in Europe, it is only of
  use
  to the proprietor
  where there is little competition for land. Neither predial slavery nor absolute
  chattel slavery could have added to the Irish landlord's virtual ownership
  of men &#8212; to his power to make them work for him without return. Their
  own competition for the means of livelihood insured him all they possibly could
  give. To the English proprietor the ownership of slaves would be only a burden
  and a loss, when he can get laborers for less than it would cost to maintain
  them as slaves, and when they are become ill or infirm can turn them on the
  parish. Or what would the New England manufacturer gain by the enslavement
  of his operatives? The competition with each other of so-called freemen, who
  are denied all right to the soil of what is called their country, brings him
  labor cheaper and more conveniently than would chattel slavery.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>That a people can be enslaved just as effectually by making property
  of their lands as by making property of their bodies, is a truth that conquerors
  in all ages have recognized, and that, as society developed, the strong and
  unscrupulous who desired to live off the labor of others, have been prompt
  to see. The coarser form of slavery, in which each particular slave is the
  property of a particular owner, is fitted only for a rude state of society,
  and with social development entails more and more care, trouble and expense
  upon the owner. But by making property of the land instead of the person, much
  care, supervision and expense are saved the proprietors; and though no particular
  slave is owned by a particular master, yet the one class still appropriates
  the labor of the other class as before.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>That each particular slave should be owned by a particular master would
  in fact become, as social development went on, and industrial organization
  grew complex, a manifest disadvantage to the masters. They would be at the
  trouble of whipping, or otherwise compelling the slaves to work; at the cost
  of watching them, and of keeping them when ill or unproductive; at the trouble
  of finding work for them to do, or of hiring them out, as at different seasons
  or at different times, the number of slaves which different owners or different
  contractors could advantageously employ would vary. As social development went
  on, these inconveniences might, were there no other way of obviating them,
  have led slave. owners to adopt some such device for the joint ownership and
  management of slaves, as the mutual convenience of capitalists has led to in
  the management of capital. In a rude state of society, the man who wants to
  have money ready for use must hoard it, or, if he travels, carry it with him.
  The man who has capital must use it himself or lend it. But mutual convenience
  has, as society developed, suggested methods of saving this trouble. The man
  who wishes to have his money accessible turns it over to a bank, which does
  not agree to keep or hand him back that particular money, but money to that
  amount. And so by turning over his capital to saving~banks or trust companies,
  or by buying the stock or bonds of corporations he gets rid of all trouble
  of handling and employing it. Had chattel slavery continued, some similar device
  for the ownership and management of slaves would in time have been adopted.
  But by changing the form of slavery &#8212; by freeing men and appropriating
  land &#8212; all the advantages of chattel slavery can be secured without
  any of the
  disadvantages which in a complex society attend the owning of a particular
  man by a particular master.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>Unable to employ themselves, the nominally free laborers are forced by
  their competition with each other to pay as rent all their earnings above a
  bare living, or to sell their labor for wages which give but a bare living;
  and as landowners the ex-slaveholders are enabled as before, to appropriate
  to themselves the labor or the produce of the labor of their former chattels,
  having in the value which this power of appropriating the proceeds of labor
  gives to the ownership of land, a capitalized value equivalent, or more than
  equivalent, to the value of their slaves. They no longer have to drive their
  slaves to work; want and the fear of want do that more effectually than the
  lash. They no longer have the trouble of looking out for their employment or
  hiring out their labor, or the expense of keeping them when they cannot work.
  That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that they still wring from labor
  seems like voluntary payment. In fact, they take it as their honest share of
  the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish the land! And they find
  so-called political economists, to say nothing of so-called preachers of Christianity,
  to tell them it is so.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>We of the United States take credit for having
  abolished slavery. Passing the question of how much credit the majority of
  us are entitled to for the
  abolition of negro slavery, it remains true that we have abolished only one
  form of slavery &#8212; and that a primitive form which had been abolished
  in the greater portion of the country by social development, and that, notwithstanding
  its race character gave it peculiar tenacity, would in time have been abolished
  in the same way in other parts of the country. We have not really abolished
  slavery; we have retained it in its most insidious and wide-spread form &#8212;  in
  a form which applies to whites as to blacks. So far from having abolished slavery,
  it is extending and intensifying, and we make no scruple of selling
  into it our own children &#8212; the citizens of the Republic yet to be. For
  what else are we doing in selling the land on which future citizens must live,
  if
  they are to live at all?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>The essence of slavery is the robbery of labor. It consists in compelling
  men to work, yet taking from them all the produce of their labor except what
  suffices for a bare living. Of how many of our &quot;free and equal American
  citizens&quot; is that already the lot? And of how many more is it coming to
  be the lot?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> In all our cities there are, even in good times, thousands and thousands
  of men who would gladly go to work for wages that would give them merely board
  and clothes &#8212; that is to say, who would gladly accept the wages of slaves.
  As I have previously stated, the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor Statistics and
  the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics both declare that in the majority of
  cases the earnings of wage-workers will not maintain their families, and must
  be pieced out by the earnings of women and children. In our richest States
  are to be found men reduced to a virtual peonage &#8212; living in their employers'
  houses, trading at their stores, and for the most part unable to get out of
  their debt from one year's end to the other. In New York, shirts are made for
  thirty-five cents a dozen, and women working from fourteen to sixteen hours
  a day average three dollars or four dollars a week. There are cities where
  the prices of such work are lower still. As a matter of dollars and cents,
  no master could afford to work slaves so hard and keep them so cheaply.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>But it may be said that the analogy between our industrial system and
  chattel slavery is only supported by the consideration of extremes. Between
  those who get but a bare living and those who can live luxuriously on the earnings
  of others, are many gradations, and here lies the great middle class. Between
  all classes, moreover, a constant movement of individuals is going on. The
  millionaire's grandchildren may be tramps, while even the poor man who has
  lost hope for himself may cherish it for his son. Moreover, it is not true
  that all the difference between what labor fairly earns and what labor really
  gets goes to the owners of land. And with us, in the United States, a great
  many of the owners of land are small owners &#8212; men who own the homesteads
  in which they live or the soil which they till, and who combine the characters
  of laborer and landowner.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>These objections will be best met by endeavoring to imagine a well-developed
  society, like our own, in which chattel slavery exists without distinction
  of race. To do this requires some imagination, for we know of no such case.
  Chattel slavery had died out in Europe before modern civilization began, and
  in the New World has existed only as race slavery, and in communities of low
  industrial development.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12] </font>But if we do imagine slavery without race distinction in a progressive
  community, we shall see that society, even if starting from a point where the
  greater part of the people were made the chattel slaves of the rest, could
  not long consist of but the two classes, masters and slaves. The indolence,
  interest and necessity of the masters would soon develop a class of intermediaries
  between the completely enslaved and themselves. To supervise the labor of the
  slaves, and to keep them in subjection, it would be necessary to take, from
  the ranks of the slaves, overseers, policemen, etc. and to reward them by more
  of the produce of slave labor than goes to the ordinary slave. So, too, would
  it be necessary to draw out special skill and talent. And in the course of
  social development a class of traders would necessarily arise, who, exchanging
  the products of slave labor, would retain a considerable portion; and a class
  of contractors, who, hiring slave labor from the masters, would also retain
  a portion of its produce. Thus, between the slaves forced to work for a bare
  living and the masters who lived without work, intermediaries of various grades
  would be developed, some of whom would doubtless acquire large wealth.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>And in the mutations of fortune, some slaveholders
  would be constantly falling into the class of intermediaries and finally into
  the class of slaves,
  while individual slaves would be rising. The conscience, benevolence or gratitude
  of masters would lead them occasionally to manumit slaves; their interest would
  lead them to reward the diligence, inventiveness, fidelity to themselves, or
  treachery to their fellows, of particular slaves. Thus, as has often occurred
  in slave countries, we would find slaves who were free to make what they could
  on condition of paying so much to their masters every month or every quarter;
  slaves who had partially bought their freedom, for a day or two days or three
  days in the week, or for certain months in the year, and those who had completely
  bought themselves, or had been presented with their freedom. And, as has always
  happened where slavery had not race character, some of these ex-slaves or their
  children would, in the constant movement, be always working their way to the
  highest places, so that in such a state of society the apologists of things
  as they are would triumphantly point to these examples, saying, &quot;See how
  beautiful a thing is slavery! Any slave can become a slaveholder himself if
  he is only faithful, industrious and prudent! It is only their own ignorance
  and dissipation and laziness that prevent all slaves from becoming masters!&quot; And
  then they would indulge in a moan for human nature. &quot;Alas!', they would
  say,&quot; the fault is not in slavery; it is in human nature&quot; &#8212;  meaning,
  of course, other human nature than their own. And if any one hinted at the
  abolition of slavery, they would charge him with assailing the sacred rights
  of property, and of endeavoring to rob poor blind widow women of the slaves
  that were their sole dependence; call him a crank and a communist; an enemy
  of man and a defiler of God!</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>Consider, furthermore, the operation of taxation in an advanced society
  based on chattel slavery; the effect of the establishment of monopolies of
  manufacture, trade and transportation; of the creation of public debts, etc.,
  and you will see that in reality the social phenomena would be essentially
  the same if men were made property as they are under the system that makes
  land property.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>It must be remembered, however, that the slavery that results from the
  appropriation of land does not come suddenly, but insidiously and progressively.
  Where population is sparse and land of little value, the institution of private
  property in land may exist without its effects being much felt. As it becomes
  more and more difficult to get land, so will the virtual enslavement of the
  laboring-classes go on. As the value of land rises, more and more of the earnings
  of labor will be demanded for the use of land, until finally nothing is left
  to laborers but the wages of slavery &#8212; a bare living.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>But the degree as well as the manner in which individuals are affected
  by this movement must vary very much. Where the ownership of land has been
  much diffused, there will remain, for some time after the mere laborer has
  been reduced to the wages of slavery, a greater body of smaller landowners
  occupying an intermediate position, and who, according to the land they hold,
  and the relation which it bears to their labor, may, to make a comparison with
  chattel slavery, be compared, in their gradations, to the owners of a few slaves;
  to those who own no slaves but are themselves free; or to partial slaves, compelled
  to render service for one, two, three, four or five days in the week, but for
  the rest of the time their own masters. As land becomes more and more valuable
  this class will gradually pass into the ranks of the completely enslaved. The
  independent American farmer working with his own hands on his own land is doomed
  as certainly as two thousand years ago his prototype of Italy was doomed. He
  must disappear, with the development of the private ownership of land, as the
  English yeoman has already disappeared.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>We have abolished negro slavery in the United States. But how small is
  the real benefit to the slave. George M. Jackson writes me from St. Louis,
  under date of August 15, 1883:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[18]</font> During the war I served in a Kentucky regiment
    in the Federal army. When the war broke out, my father owned sixty slaves.
    I had not been back to my
    old Kentucky home for years until a short time ago, when I was met by one
    of my father's old negroes, who said to me: &quot;Mas George, you say you sot
    us free; but 'fore God, I'm wus off than when I belonged to your father.&quot; The
    planters, on the other hand, are contented with the change. They say: &quot;How
    foolish it was in us to go to war for slavery. We get labor cheaper now than
    when we owned the slaves.&quot; How do they get it cheaper? Why, in the shape
    of rents they take more of the labor of the negro than they could under slavery,
    for then they were compelled to return him sufficient food, clothing and
    medical attendance to keep him well, and were compelled by conscience and
    public opinion,
    as well as by law, to keep him when he could no longer work. Now their interest
    and responsibility cease when they have got all the work out of him they
    can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[19] </font>In one of his novels, Capt. Marryat tells of a schoolmaster who announced
  that he had abandoned the use of the rod. When tender mothers, tempted by this
  announcement, brought their boys to his institution, he was eloquent in his
  denunciations of the barbarism of the rod; but no sooner had the doors closed
  upon them than the luckless pupils found that the master had only abandoned
  the use of the rod for the use of the cane! Very much like this is our abolition
  of negro slavery.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20] </font>The only one of our prominent men who had any glimmering of what was
  really necessary to the abolition of slavery was Thaddeus Stevens, but it was
  only a glimmering. &quot;Forty acres and a mule&quot; would have been a measure
  of scant justice to the freedmen, and it would for a while have given them
  something of that personal independence which is necessary to freedom. Yet
  only for a while. In the course of time, and as the pressure of population
  increased, the forty acres would, with the majority of them, have been mortgaged
  and the mule sold, and they would soon have been, as now, competitors for a
  foothold upon the earth and for the means of making a living from it. Such
  a measure would have given the freedmen a fairer start, and for many of them
  would have postponed the evil day; but that is all. Land being private property,
  that evil day must come.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>I do not deny that the blacks of the South have in some things gained
  by the abolition of chattel slavery. I will not even insist that, on the whole,
  their material condition has not been improved. But it must be remembered that
  the South is yet but sparsely settled, and is behindhand in industrial development.
  The continued existence of slavery there was partly the effect and partly the
  cause of this. As population increases, as industry is developed, the condition
  of the freedmen must become harder and harder. As yet, land is comparatively
  cheap in the South, and there is much not only unused but unclaimed. The consequence
  is, that the freedmen are not yet driven into that fierce competition which
  must come with denser population; there is no seeming surplus of labor seeking
  employment on any terms, as in the North. The freedmen merely get a living,
  as in the days of slavery, and in many cases not so good a living; but still
  there is little or no difficulty in getting that. To compare fairly the new
  estate of the freedmen with the old, we must wait until in population and industrial
  development the South begins to approach the condition of the North.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22] </font>But not even in the North (nor, for that matter, even in Europe) has
  that form of slavery which necessarily results from the disinheritance of labor
  by the monopolization of land, yet reached its culmination. For the vast area
  of unoccupied land on this continent has prevented the full effects of modern
  development from being felt. As it becomes more and more difficult to obtain
  land, so will the virtual enslavement of the laboring-classes go on. As the
  value of land rises, more and more of the earnings of labor will be demanded
  for the use of land &#8212; that is to say, laborers must give a greater and
  greater portion of their time up to the service of the landlord, until, finally,
  no
  matter how hard they work, nothing is left them but a bare living.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23] </font>Of the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon
  the same moral level, that which makes property of persons is more humane than
  that which results from making private property of land. The cruelties which
  are perpetrated under the system of chattel slavery are more striking and arouse
  more indignation because they are the conscious acts of individuals. But for
  the suffering of the poor under the more refined system no one in particular
  seems responsible. That one human being should be deliberately burned by other
  human beings excites our imagination and arouses our indignation much more
  than the great fire or railroad accident in which a hundred people are roasted
  alive. But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
  the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings are overworked,
  are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness of life, are condemned
  to ignorance and brutishness, and to the infection of physical and moral disease;
  are driven to crime and suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities
  for which it seems that no one in particular is responsible.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[24] </font>To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after
  day transpire unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization it would be
  necessary to go back to ancient slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest
  in the New World, or to stories of the Middle Passage.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[25] </font>That chattel slavery is not the worst form of slavery we know from the
  fact that in countries where it has prevailed irrespective of race distinctions,
  the ranks of chattel slaves have been recruited from the ranks of the free
  poor, who, driven by distress, have sold themselves or their children. And
  I think no one who reads our daily papers can doubt that even already, in the
  United States, there are many who, did chattel slavery, without race distinction,
  exist among us, would gladly sell themselves or their children, and who would
  really make a good exchange for their nominal freedom in doing so.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[26] </font>We have not abolished slavery. We never can abolish slavery, until we
  honestly accept the fundamental truth asserted by the Declaration of Independence
  and secure to all the equal and unalienable rights with which they are endowed
  by their Creator. If we cannot or will not do that, then, as a matter of humanity
  and social stability, it might be well, would it avail, to consider whether
  it were not wise to amend our constitution and permit poor whites and blacks
  alike to sell themselves and their children to good masters. If we must have
  slavery, it were better in the form in which the slave knows his owner, and
  the heart and conscience and pride of that owner can be appealed to. Better
  breed children for the slaves of good, Christian, civilized people, than breed
  them for the brothel or the penitentiary. But alas! that recourse is denied.
  Supposing we did legalize chattel slavery again, who would buy men when men
  can be hired so cheaply?</p>
