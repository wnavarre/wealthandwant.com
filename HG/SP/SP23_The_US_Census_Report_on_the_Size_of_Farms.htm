  SUPERINTENDENT WALKER'S EXPLANATION.<br />
</p>
<p align="right">BOSTON, May 10, 1883.</p>
<p align="left">To the Editor of <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>.</p>
<p align="left">  SIR : In Mr. Henry George's fifth paper on the &quot;Problems of the Time&quot; he
  declares that the statement of the  Census Bureau to the effect that the average
  size of farms  is decreasing in the United States, is inconsistent not only  with &quot;facts
  obvious all over the United States,&quot; but with &quot;the returns furnished
  by the Census Bureau itself;&quot; and  at a later point, after citing the
  Census Statistics of the  number of farms of certain classes, as to size, in
  1870, and  again in 1880, he says: &quot;How, in the face of these figures,  the
  Census Bureau can report a decline in the average size of farms in the United
States from 153 acres in 1870 to 134 acres in 1880, I cannot understand.&quot;</p>
<p>  Perhaps I can offer an explanation which may assist  Mr. George toward an
      understanding of what seems to him incomprehensible. </p>
<p>  The average size of farms in 1870 having been 153 acres,  any increase during
  the intervening decade in the number  of farms below this limit would tend
  to lower the average  size of farms in 1880; any increase in the number of
farms  above that limit would tend to raise the average for 1880. </p>
<p>  Now, in fact, there has been a greater increase, on the  whole, in the number
  of farms below 153 acres than in  the number above 153 acres, and, consequently,
the average size has been reduced.</p>
<p>  If I have not made the reason of the case plain, I shall  be happy to resort
  to a more elementary statement, illustrated with diagrams, if desired. </p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>  FRANCIS A. WALKER.<br />
</p>
<p align="center">THE CENSUS REPORT AND SUPERINTENDENT WALKER'S EXPLANATION.</p>
<p align="center">[From <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>, June 9, 1883.] </p>
<p>  I must ask the patience of the readers of these articles  if in this I make
  a digression, having reference to the  letter from General Francis A. Walker,
  Superintendent of the Ninth and Tenth Censuses, which appeared in the last
  issue of this journal.</p>
<p>  To my comprehension, General Walker has &quot;not made  the reason of the
  case plain,&quot; nor has he explained the  discrepancies I pointed out. I
  shall be happy to have his  more elementary statement, and, if he will be so
  kind, to  have it illustrated with diagrams. But, in the meantime as his reassertion
  of the statement of the Census Report  carries the weight of official authority
  and professional  reputation, I propose in this paper to show in more detail  my reasons for disputing its accuracy.</p>
<p>  It is specifically asserted in the reports of the Tenth  Census that the
  average size of farms in the United States  decreased during the decade ending
  in 1880 from 153 acres  to 134 acres, and this assertion has been quoted all
  over  the country as a conclusive reason why the people of the  United States
  should not trouble themselves about the  reckless manner in which what is now
  left of their once  great public domain is being disposed of, and the rapid  rate
  at which it is passing in enormous tracts into the  private estates of non-resident
  speculators, English lords  and foreign syndicates. All over the country the
  press  has pointed to this declaration of the Census Bureau as  conclusive
  proof, which no one could question (and which,  up to the publication of the
  fifth paper of this series, no  one seems to have thought of questioning),
  that these  things need excite no uneasiness, since the steady tendency is
  to the sub-division of large landholdings. The  inference would not be valid
  even if the alleged fact were  true. But that I will not now discuss. I dispute
  the fact. </p>
<p>  General Walker states that, during the last decade, &quot;there has been a
  greater increase, on the whole, in the  number of farms below 153 acres than
  in the number  above 153 acres.&quot; This I shall show from General Walker's
  own official report is not true is, in fact, the very  reverse of the truth.
  But such a misstatement of fact,  astonishing as it is, is not so astonishing
  as the misstatement of principle which precedes and follows it viz., to  quote
  the remainder of the sentence, &quot;and, <em>consequently</em>,  the average size has been reduced.&quot;</p>
<p>  I have occasionally met thoughtless people who talked  of discounts of 150
  and 200 percent; I once knew a man who insisted that another man was twice
  as old as he was,  because on a certain birthday, years before, he had been  twice
  as old; but I never yet met anybody, except very  little children, to whom
  all coins were pennies, who would  say that when a shopkeeper received one
  piece of money  and handed out two pieces, he had <em>consequently</em> reduced  the
  amount of money in his drawer! Yet this is just such  a statement as that made
  by General Walker. In asserting  that the general increase in the number of
  farms under a  certain size than in the number above that size must reduce  the
  average size, General Walker ignores area, just as any  one who would say that
  an amount of money had been  reduced by adding one coin and taking away two
  would  ignore value. Take, for instance, a farm of 100 acres.  Add to it two
  farms of 50 acres each and one farm of 400  acres. Here there has been a greater
  increase in the  number of farms below 100 acres than the number above  100
acres, but so far from the average having consequently been reduced, it has been
increased from 100 to 150 acres!</p>
<p>The truth is, of course, that number is only one of the  factors of average,
  which is in itself an expression of  proportion between number and some other
  property of  things, such as size, weight, length, value, etc. An average  does
  not, as General Walker says, increase or diminish  according to the numerical
  preponderance, on one side or  the other, of the items added, but according
  to the preponderance in number and quality. Thus, though the  addition of any
  farm of less than 153 acres would tend to  reduce an average of 153 acres,
  the addition of one farm  of three acres would tend much more strongly to reduce  the
  average than the addition of one of 152 acres, and the  addition of one farm
  of 1000 acres would do much more  to increase the average than the addition
  of several farms  of 154 acres. Just as weights upon the arms of a lever  tend
  more strongly to counterbalance each other the further they are placed from
  the fulcrum, so increase in the number of farms will tend more strongly to
  raise or reduce the average the further in point of area the new farms are
  from the previous average. And it may be worth while to remark that while the
  possibilities on the side of decrease are limited, the possibilities on the
  side of increase are unlimited. A farm less than 153 acres can only be less
  by something within 153 acres; but a farm greater than 153 acres may be greater
  by 10,000 or 100,000, or any larger number of acres.</p>
<p>  I speak of this simple and obvious principle not merely  to show the curious
  confusion of thought which General  Walker exhibits, but for the purpose of
  pointing out the  significance of the facts I have previously cited&#8212;  a
  significance which General Walker does not appear, even yet, to  realize.</p>
<p>  Let me refer those who may wish to verify the accuracy  of the figures I
  am about to quote to Table LXIIL,  pp. 650-657, Compendium of the Tenth Census,
  Part I. This  table gives the total number of farms for 1880, 1870, 1860  and
  1850, the number of farms in eight specified classes  for 1880, 1870 and 1860;
  the farm acreage and the average size of farms for four censuses. We are told
  in a  note that &quot;it will be noticed&quot; that the number of farms  given
  in the specified classes for 1860 fail to agree with  the total number given,
  and that &quot;these discrepancies  appear without explanation in the Census
  of 1860.&quot; This  is well calculated to impress one who casually turns over  the
  pages of the Compendium with the vigilant care that  has been exercised, but
  it becomes rather amusing when  read in the light of the far more striking
  discrepancies  which appear without explanation in the Census of 1880.  </p>
<p>What
  first struck me in glancing over this table, and  what is so obvious that I
  cannot understand how, from  Census Superintendent to lowest clerk, any one
  could have transcribed, or even glanced over not to say examined  these figures
  without being struck by it, is that in the  face of the fact that we are told
  that between 1870 and  1880 the average size of farms has been reduced, the
  same  table shows in its very first lines that the great increase  in the number
  of farms between 1870 and 1880 has all  been in the four classes of largest
  areas, and that the  larger the area the greater the increase; while the number  of
  farms in the four classes of smaller area have actually  diminished, and the
  smaller the class area the greater the  diminution! To recur to our simile,
  it is not only that  more weights have been placed on one end of the lever,  but
  they have been pushed out further from the center.  On the other arm the weights
  have not only been diminished, but they have been drawn in closer to the center.  Yet
we are told that the lever has tipped toward the end that has been lightened!</p>
<p>  This is the fact to which I called attention in the fifth  paper of this
  series as showing the inaccuracy of the  assertion that the average size of
  farms had decreased in  the United States during the last decade. So conclusive  is
  it, and so obvious is it, that I am forced to suppose that  the Superintendent
  of the Tenth Census has never even  glanced over the totals of his own report.
  For, although  the number of farms in 1880 and 1870 are merely placed  in parallel
  columns in the Census Report, without subtraction, yet such differences as
  4352 farms under three  acres in 1880, and 6875 in 1870, and of 28,578 farms
  over  1000 acres in 1880 against 3720 in 1870, are glaring enough  to strike
  the eye of any one who has been told that the  average size of farms has diminished,
  and to put him upon  inquiry.</p>
<p>  In order to show the striking results of a comparison  of the number of
  farms in the eight specified classes, in  1880 and 1870, as reported by the
  Census Bureau, I have taken the trouble to do what the Census Bureau has not  done, and figure out the differences.</p>
<p>CHANGES DURING DECADE ENDING 1880 IN THE NUMBER OF FARMS IN THE EIGHT SPECIFIED
    CLASSES, AS REPORTED BY CENSUS BUREAU.</p>
<p>  Class.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decrease
  in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio of decrease<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number.</p>
<p>I. Under 3 acres .......... 2,523 ..... 37 percent<br />
  II. 3 to 10 &quot; ............... 37,132 ..... 21 percent<br />
  III. 10 to 20 &quot; ............ 39,858 ..... 14 percent<br />
  IV. 20 to 50 &quot; ............ 66,140 ....... 8 percent</p>
<p>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increase
  in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ratio of increase<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number.<br />
  V. 50 to 100 acres ......278,689 ....... 37 percent <br />
  VI. 100 to 500 &quot;...... 1,130,929 ..... 200 percent<br />
  VII. 500 to 1,000 &quot;....... 60,099 ..... 379 percent<br />
  VIII. Over 1,000 &quot; ....... 24,858 .....668 percent<br />
  <br />
  This steady progression from a decrease of 37 per cent,  in farms under three
  acres up to an increase of 668 per  cent, in farms over 1000 acres is conclusive
  proof that the  average size of farms could not have decreased from 153  to
  134 acres. And the figures of numerical decrease and  increase are at the same
  time a disproof of General Walker  upon the ground he has chosen. &quot;Now,
  in fact,&quot; he says, &quot;there has been a greater increase, on the whole,
  in the  number of farms below
  153 acres than in the number  above 153 acres, and, consequently, the average
  size has  been reduced.&quot;</p>
<p>  The pivotal point, of 153 acres, falls in Class VI., which  includes farms
  between 100 and 500 acres. There is no  way of deciding with certainty how
  many of these farms  are between 100 and 153 acres, and how many between  153
  and 500 acres; but inasmuch as, in the absence of  special reasons to the contrary,
  there can be no doubt that  the average of the class must largely exceed 153
acres  (which is very much nearer the class minimum than the class maximum),
and therefore that, taken as a whole, the entire class must count on the side
of increase, we should reach substantial accuracy in setting
  down the  whole increase in this class as over 153 acres. This would  give:<br />
  Increase in number of farms above 153 acres ............... 1,215,886<br />
  Net increase in farms below 153 acres ............................ 133,036<br />
Excess in increase of number of farms above 153 acres. 1,082,850</p>
<p>  This would be substantially accurate; but if a greater  formal exactness
      is required, let us try to decide, as best we may, what part of the farms
      of
  between 100 and 500 acres should be counted as under 153 acres.</p>
<p>  Whoever knows anything of the United States land  system, and the parceling
  of land in our newer States and  Territories where the greater part of this
  increase in the  number of farms has taken place, knows that the farms  between
  100 and 160 acres must be comparatively few.  The reason of this is, that the
  government surveys divide  the land into sections and fractions of a section,
  the  practical unit being the quarter-section of 160 acres, which  is the
  amount open to preemption and homestead entry.  The land-grant railroad companies
  sell their land in the  same way by the government surveys; and, in fact, nearly  all
  the transfers of farms in our new States, long after the  land has passed into
  private hands, is by fractions of a  section, the quarter-section of 160
  acres being almost universally regarded as the unit. When the quarter-section  is
  divided, it is generally divided into the eighth, or as it  is commonly called,
  the half quarter section, which falls  into the class below the one we are
  considering. There  can be no doubt whatever that the great majority of the  newer
  farms of the class between 100 and 500 acres consist of quarter-sections, two-quarter
sections, and three-quarter  sections. Considering all this, it is certain that
we shall be making a most liberal allowance for the farms between 100 and 153
acres if we estimate the farms above 153 acres at 1,000,000 and those below at
the odd number of 130,929. This would give:</p>
<p>  Increase in farms above 153 acres .............. 1,084,957<br />
  Net increase in farms below 153 acres ........... 263,965<br />
  Excess in increase of farms above 153 acres... 820,992</p>
<p>I have disposed of General Walker's principle and of  his fact, and have sustained
  my own allegation of the  inaccuracy of the Census Report. I will now go further,
  and prove in another way the glaring discrepancies of the Census Report, and
  the
  grossness of the assumption  that it shows a reduction in the average size
  of farms.  Subtracting the totals given for 1870 from those given  for 1880,
we find the increase in acreage and number of  farms as follows: </p>
<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total
  Number of Farms Total acreage<br />
  1880 ............................... 4,008,907 536,081,835<br />
  1870 ............................... 2,659,985 407,735,041<br />
  Increase in decade............ 1,348,922 128,346,794</p>
<p>  The average size of farms in 1880, given at 134 acres,  has been obtained
      by dividing the total acreage by the given total number of farms. The division
      is correct, but  examination shows that there is an error either in the
      dividend or in the divisor, which makes the quotient less than it ought
      to be. Either
      the number of farms is too high,  or the acreage too low. Let me prove
      this beyond question.</p>
<p>  The net increase in the number of farms in the eight  specified classes,
  as I have given it, corresponds with the  total increase obtained by subtracting
from the total number of farms given for 1880 the total given for 1870.  But no estimate can make the increase in area correspond.</p>
<p>  To show that it is impossible on any supposition to  make the increased acreage
  of the specified classes as low as the increased acreage according to the census
  totals, we will, where there has been decrease in the number of farms, consider
  these farms to have been of the very largest size embraced in the class. Where
  the number of farms has increased we will consider these farms as having been
of the very smallest size embraced in the class.</p>
<p>  Thus we have-<br />
  Decrease.<br />
  I. Under 3 acres, 2,523, at 3 acres .... ....... 7,569<br />
  II. 3 to 10 &quot; 37,132, at 10 acres ............ 371,320<br />
  HI. 10 to 20 &quot; 39,858, at 20 acres......... 797,160<br />
  IV. 20 to50 &quot; 66,140,at 50 acres........ 3,307,000<br />
  Total decrease in area ........................ 4,483,049<br />
  Class. Increase.<br />
  V. 50 to 100 acres, 278,689, at 50 acres, ..13,934,450<br />
  VI. 100 to 500 &quot; 1,130,929, at 100 acres. 113,092,900<br />
  VII. -500 to 1,000 &quot; 60,099, at 500 acres  ..30,049,500<br />
  VIII. Over 1,000 &quot; 24,858, at 1,000 acres . 24,858,000<br />
  Total increase in area ................................181,934,850<br />
  Subtract decrease ........................................ 4,483,049<br />
Net increase in farm acreage .................... 177,451,801</p>
<p>  Thus this lowest possible estimate of increased farm  area exceeds the increase
  of 128,346,794, according to the  census totals, by no less than 49,105,007
  acres. According  to the census totals the average area of the 1,348,922 new
  farms was only 95.1 acres. According to this lowest possible estimate of the
  areas
  assigned to these new farms  in the table of specified classes, the average
is 131.6. And  adding this very lowest possible estimate of increased average
to that given for 1870, the total farm acreage of the
  United States in 1880 was 585,186,842 acres, instead  of 536,081,835 acres,
  as represented by the Census Bureau,  giving an average of 145.9 acres, instead
of 134 acres, as  reported.</p>
<p>  Of course, such an estimate is preposterous, but it  shows indisputably
  the glaring incorrectness of the Census  Report.</p>
<p>  To obtain from the table of specified classes an estimate  of the true increase
  of farm acreage in the United States  during the last decade, our only way
  is to ascertain from  the census of 1870, also made under General Walker's  superintendence,
  the average of class areas which would  give the total for that year, and take
  them for our calculation.</p>
<p>  To make the acreage of the specified classes for 1870  agree with the total
  acreage given, we must make some  such estimate as the following:</p>
<p>  ACREAGE BY SPECIFIED CLASSES FOR 1870.<br />
  Class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average
  acreage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of farms &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total
  acres<br />
I.&#8212; Under 3 acres .................. 2.5 ..................... 6,875 .........................17,187<br />
  II.&#8212; 3 to 10 acres ....................8.75.................172,020 ...................1,505,183<br />
  III. &#8212; 10 to 20 acres ..............18......................294,607 ..................5,302,926<br />
  IV.&#8212; 20 to 50 acres................44 .....................847,614 ................37,295,016<br />
  V.&#8212; 50 to 100 acres ..............90 .....................754,221 ................67,879,890<br />
  VI. &#8212;100 to 500 acres......... 400 .....................565,054 ..............226,021,600<br />
  VII.&#8212; 500 to 1,000 acres..... 900 .......................15,873 ................14,285,700<br />
  VIII.&#8212; Over 1,000 acres .14,900 .........................3,720 ................55,428,000<br />
  Totals .............................................................2,659,985
............. 407,735,502</p>
<p>This is about as close as I can figure with any regard  to proportion, and
  it comes so close to 407,735,041, the  acreage given for 1870, that the difference
would not  perceptibly affect any average.</p>
<p>Now, taking these averages of 1870 as a basis for calculating the true farm
acreage in 1880, we have:</p>
<p>  ACREAGE BY SPECIFIED CLASSES FOR 1880.<br />
  Class. ..............................Acres ..........Number
  of farms ....... Acreage<br />
  I. Under 3 acres ..................... 2.5 ............. 4,352 ...............10,880<br />

<p>  This would make the average size of farms in the United  States 325.5 acres,
  instead of 134 acres as reported by the  Census Bureau, an increase of 172.5
acres, instead of a  decrease of 19 acres as reported.</p>
<p>  I do not, of course, say that this estimate is correct. I  can only say
  that it is the best that can be made from the  Census Reports. These reports
  show such a lack of intelligent superintendence and editing, that I doubt their  reliability
  for any purpose. The only thing absolutely  certain is, that the conclusions
  of the Census Bureau are  not correct.</p>
<p>  And further than the gross discrepancies I have shown,  these returns of
  farms and farm areas give no idea of the  manner in which the ownership of
  land is concentrating  in the United States. It is not merely that in many
  cases  the same person is the owner of separate farms, but it is  evident from
  the returns that stock farms, cattle ranches,  and the large tracts held by
  absentees, have not been  included. This may be seen by the fact that the returns  of
  farms of over 1000 acres number only 14 for Wyoming, 43 for New Mexico, 20
  for Montana, 8 for Idaho, 74 for  Dakota, and so on.</p>
<p>  I have gone into this subject at such length because the  authority of the
  census has been so generally invoked as  conclusive proof that the ownership
  of land is not concentrating in the United States. The truth is, that it is  concentrating
  so rapidly that, should present tendencies  continue, it will not be many decades
  before we shall be  a nation of landlords and tenants.</p>

  SUPERINTENDENT WALKER'S FURTHER EXPLANATION.<br />
  [From <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>, June 16, 1883.]</p>
<p align="left">  To the Editor of <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>: </p>
<p align="left">  Mr. George's attack upon the Census Statistics of the  number and size.of farms,
  in your issue of June 9th,  affords a capital example of that writer's cleverness
  in  imposing upon the careless reader. Indeed, although  somewhat familiar
  with the subject-matter, I wasn't sure  myself, until I had gone through the
  article more than  once, that there might not be something in it, so portentous
  was the marshaling of figures, so loud and strenuous  the assertion that the
  census was wrong in this and  inconsistent in that; so artfully were all the
  resources of  controversy used to produce the impression Mr. George  desired.
  And yet there is absolutely nothing in it which  cannot be readily and completely
  disproved. It is, from  beginning to end, an utter sham.</p>
<p>  Suppose a township of 25 square miles to have been  divided, in 1870, into
  64 farms of 250 acres each. These  would have been reported, according to the
  classification  in use at each census from 1850 to the present time, as  farms
  of over 100 and under 500 acres; aggregate land in  farms, 10,000 acres. Now,
  suppose precisely the same territory to have been divided in 1880 into farms
  of 125  acres each. The official record would then read, 128 farms  of over
  100 and under 500 acres; aggregate land in farms,  16,000 acres. Ah, exclaims
  the critic, observe this monstrous blunder! Here is an increase of 64 farms
  in this  class, and yet no increase whatever of acreage! Let us,  he continues,
  concede, in the extreme spirit of fairness,  that these farms were all of the
  very smallest size contained in this class, viz.: 100 acres each, we still
  ought to  have, at the least, an increase of 6400 acres over the official  return,
which is thus shown on the face of it to be false. </p>
<p>  This is Mr. George's reasoning, precisely. To omit  minor classes, let us
  take the greatest class of all, that of  farms between 100 and 500 acres, the
  increase in the  number of farms of this class being no less than 1,130,929,  against
  217,993 only of all the other classes combined.  Mr. George assumes that these
  1,130,929 farms represent  a pure net addition to the acreage of inclosed land.
  Having made such an utterly gratuitous, utterly unfounded,  utterly dishonest
  assumption, Mr. George, with that inimitable show of candor which always characterizes
  him after  a logical larceny of this sort, very graciously gives the  Census
  Office the benefit of his concession that he will  only exact 100 acres for
  each of these 1,130,929 farms;  and having proceeded to deal this way with
  all the other  classes, he brings the Census Office out a debtor in the  sum
  of 49,105,007 acres. Perhaps, with that same remarkable candor, he would consent
  to strike off 105,007 acres  and call it only 49,000,000.</p>
<p>  Such is the wretched stuff which Mr. George imposes on  his readers as a
  serious statistical argument. That the  land of all the older States is in
  process of sub-division,  every one above the grade of a plantation hand, who
  has  lived three years east of the Rocky Mountains, knows perfectly well. In
  the main, the increase of farms in these  States is by the partition of land
  previously inclosed.  Thus, Connecticut showed 2,364,416 acres in 25,508 farms  in
  1870, and 2,453,541 acres in 30,598 farms in 1880 &#8212;  an increase of nearly
  20 percent, in farms, and of but  5 percent, in acreage. New York showed 22,190,810  acres
  in 216,253 farms in 1870, and 23,780,754 acres in  241,058 farms in 1880. Georgia,
  to take a State from  another section, showed 23,647,941 acres in 69,956 farms  in
  1870, and 26,043,282 acres in 138,626 farms in 1880 &#8212;  a gain of about
  10 percent, in acreage, and of almost 100  percent, in farms. This tremendous
  increase of farms in  Georgia is due to the continuous sub-division of the
  old  plantations in order to furnish small farms for the late  slaves and the &quot;poor
  whites&quot; of that region. The same  cause is operating, with great force,
  all over the South,  and this it is which has brought about that reduction
  of  the average size of farms in the United States from 153  acres in 1870
  to 134 acres in 1880, which arouses such  prodigious wrath on the part of Mr.
  George, who, having  started out on a crusade against landed property with
  the  cry that the country is going to the dogs through the  aggregation of
  great estates latifundia, as he magnificently calls it, to the confusion, there
  is reason to fear, of  most of his disciples is brought violently and injuriously  up
  against hard facts, such as those just cited. The following table shows the
  increase of the number of farms in  the chief cotton-planting States:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1880. 1870.<br />
  Alabama.............................135,864 .... 67,382<br />
  Arkansas............................. 94,433 .... 49,424<br />
  Georgia ..............................138,626 ... 69,956<br />
  Louisiana ............................. 48,292 ... 28,481<br />
  Mississippi ..........................101,772 ... 68,023<br />
  North Carolina ....................157,609 ... 93,565<br />
  South Carolina ..................... 93,864 ... 51,889<br />
  Tennessee............................165,650 . 118,141<br />
  Texas...................................174,184.... 61,125<br />
  <br />
  Such, then, is Mr. George's main argument against the  census figures. &quot;Let
  me,&quot; he says, &quot;prove this beyond  question.&quot; We may, therefore,
  understand this to be Mr.  George's idea of proving a proposition beyond question.  And,
  in truth, it is very much the way he has taken to  prove all the propositions
  I have read from his pen. To  make any assumption whatever that suits his purpose,  to
  reason therefrom most logically and felicitously, and to  apply thereto, when
  required, arithmetical computations  of the most minute accuracy, is the favorite
  method of  this apostle of a new political economy and a regenerated  humanity.</p>
<p>  In the case under consideration, he assumes that new  farms always represent
  new lands, a most gratuitous  assumption, contrary to the known facts of the
  situation,  and then proceeds, by a faultless series of additions and  multiplications,
  to bring the Census Office in as debtor in  the amount of 49,000,000 acres
lost to the nation through  its carelessness.</p>
<p>  Again, Mr. George's assumption that the farms between  100 and 500 acres
  must be preponderatingly above 153  acres, inasmuch as the government sells
  land in 160-acre  lots, &quot;quarter-sections,&quot; as they are called,
  may be met by
  the assertion that five-sixths of the present farms of the  United States were
  either not granted originally on the  quarter-section plan (as in the Eastern States), or else 
  have been long enough in private hands to allow, as  Americans buy and sell,
  abundant scope for changes of  area, in the way of partition, consolidation,
  etc. </p>
<p>  The question at issue between Mr. George and the  Census Office really turns
  upon the average size of the  farms between 100 and 500 acres. Mr. George estimates  that
  average at 400 acres! The reasonableness or unreasonableness of this will best
  be made to appear by
  presenting the number of farms in the classes above  and below:<br />
  20 to 50 acres..................................... 781,474<br />
  50 to 100  acres ............................... 1,032,910<br />
  100 to 500 acres ............................. 1,695,983<br />
  500 to 1,000 acres ............................... 75,972</p>
<p>  Any one who can look at these figures and not see, at a  glance, that the
  probabilities are overwhelmingly in favor  of the supposition that the great
  body of the farms of the  third class, in the above table, are nearer, much
  nearer,  very much nearer, to the lower than to the upper limit, is  to be
  pitied for his defective eyesight and his defective  mind-sight. If Mr. George
  cannot see that, there is reason  to fear that a diagram would not help him.
  Who can  believe it possible that, while the farms of Class IV are  only 1
  in 22 of the farms in Class III., the farms of the  latter class lie so close
  up to the limit of the fourth class  as to average 400 acres each, or for that
  matter, 300 acres,  or even 250 acres?</p>
<p>  It is certainly to be regretted, since this controversy has  arisen, that
  a new class, 100 to 150, or 100 to 200 acres,  was not introduced. But the
  classification taken for this  purpose is that which has always heretofore
  been employed, alike in 1850, in 1860, and 1870; while, so far as  I am aware,
  no one has ever before complained of its  inefficiency or suggested to the
  Census Office the subdivision of this class.</p>
<p>  Mr. George is undoubtedly right in his captious correction of my phraseology
  in speaking of the effect produced  by an increase in the number of farms,
  above or below the  line, 153 acres, upon the average size of all farms in
  comparison of 1870 with 1880. I think no one would have  failed to understand
  me who desired to do so, and what I  had in mind was perfectly just; yet, in
  a controversy with  a gentleman so much more particular about phraseology  than about facts, I should have done well to state my 
  meaning more explicitly. </p>
<p>  Respectfully,<br />
  FRANCIS A. WALKER.<br />
  BOSTON, June 10, 1883.</p>
<p>  FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE CENSUS REPORT.<br />
  [From <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>, June 30, 1883.]</p>
<p>  In his reply to my exhibition of the utter inconsistency  between the census
  figures and census conclusions as to  the size of farms, Professor Walker,
  instead of furnishing  the diagrams with which he, in the first place, proposed  to
  enlighten my ignorance, resorts to something more  resembling diatribes. To
  such controversy I cannot  descend.</p>
<p>  Professor Walker complains that I estimate the average  size of farms in
  the class between 100 and 500 acres at  400 acres, and devotes much space to
  showing that this  estimate is too great. But this estimate is not mine. Had  I
  been making a guess, without reference to the Census  Report, I should certainly
  not have put the average of  this class at above 250 acres. But at any such average 
  it is impossible to make the aggregate acreage of the  specified classes for
  1870 correspond with the total acreage  given. As I showed in detail, to make
  the acreage of  these classes agree with the total acreage given, such  averages
  as 90 acres for the class between 50 and 100  acres, 400 acres for the class
  between 100 and 500, 900  acres for the class between 500 and 1000 acres, and
  14,900  for farms over 1000 acres must be assumed. These averages seem to me
  preposterous; but I am not responsible 
  for them. Professor Francis A. Walker, Superintendent  of the Tenth Census,
  must settle this matter with Professor Francis A. Walker, Superintendent of
  the Ninth  Census.</p>
<p>  And to clench what I have already said as to the size of  farms in Class
  IV, I challenge Professor Walker to give  to the public any computation of
  acreage by specified  classes by which, putting the average of Class IV at
  153  acres, and having any regard whatever for proportion in  the other classes,
  he can make the total acreage correspond  with that given in the Census Report.</p>
<p>  As for Professor Walker's effort to prove that increase  in the number of
  farms does not necessarily involve increase  in total area, it would be as
  pertinent for him to attempt  to prove that in changing a dollar into ten dimes
  one gets  no more money, or that a big piece of cloth may be cut  into small
  pieces without increase in the amount of cloth.  This I have never heard denied,
  unless by Professor Walker  himself, who, in his previous letter, asserted
  that a greater  increase in the number of farms below than above a certain  point
  necessarily showed a decrease of average area. The  absurdity of this a principle
  which he offered to illustrate with diagrams I previously pointed out, and
  he now  admits, but in a style which reminds me of a dispute I  once heard
  between two colored citizens. One, who gloried  in the title of Professor Johnson,
  was boasting that he  could polish twelve dozen pairs of boots in half an hour.  A
  fellow boot-black disputed this, and pressed him with a  bet. Driven into a corner, Professor Johnson, with much 
  indignation, declared that when he said twelve dozen  pairs of boots he meant
  six pairs of shoes, and any &quot;fool  nigger&quot; ought to know what he
  meant. So, Professor  Walker, driven to admit the absurdity of his statement  of
  principle, speaks of my captious correction of his  phraseology, and declares
  that no one would have failed to  understand him who desired to do so. This
  is a rather  unbecoming descent from the altitude of an offer of diagrams!
  A frank admission that he had been betrayed by  carelessness would have inspired
  more respect. </p>
<p>  But it is to be feared that such carelessness is a habit  with Professor
  Walker. This letter shows as curious confusion of thought as his first, and,
  with seemingly utter  unconsciousness of the fallacy, he essays, with what
  the  logicians call an <em>ignoratio elenchi,</em> to break the force of my  marshaling
  of census figures. To prove the absolute  inconsistency of the census, I showed
  that the lowest  possible estimate of increased acreage by specified classes  gives
  an aggregate acreage of 49,105,107 acres in excess  of the census total. To
  this conclusive proof of gross  inaccuracy Professor Walker replies by supposing
  a  township of twenty-five square miles. [It may be worth  while to remark
  that a United States township is thirty-six,  not twenty-five, square miles.]
  He supposes this  township to have been divided in 1870 into 64 farms of  250
  acres each, which would be returned by the census in  the class between 100
  and 500 acres. In 1880 the same  township is divided into 128 farms of 125
  acres each. But  the acreage of 64 additional farms at the lowest class limit  of
  100 acres, added to the previous total acreage, would  give 6400 more acres
  than the township contains; which  proves, according to Professor Walker, that,
  in assuming  that the net increase of acreage of specified classes must  represent
  an addition to that acreage, I have made &quot;an  utterly gratuitous, utterly
  unfounded, utterly dishonest  assumption.&quot;</p>
<p>  In fact, however, Professor Walker's unfortunate example proves nothing
in point, unless it be the truth of  the old rhyme:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If <em>ifs</em> and <em>ans</em> were pots and pans,<br />
    There'd be few blundering tinkers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Professor Walker omits in his example as, of  course, he will see when
  his attention is called to it is  the essence of the matter, the division into
  classes. By  supposing the farms in his township to be all within one  class,
  Professor Walker ignores this essential element.  The case he presents is not
  analogous to the case presented by the census, but analogous to the case which  would
  be presented by the census were no returns by  classes given. If the census
  report merely gave us the  total acreage and total number of farms, we could
  go no  further in verifying what it told us as to increase or  decrease of
  average than by testing the division. But  the census gives us more than
  this. Besides total acreage  and total number, it gives us the number of farms
  in  eight specified classes as to area. </p>
<p> To make Professor Walker's supposed township analogous to the case in point,
  we must suppose its farms to  vary in size from under three acres to over 1000
  acres,  and that we are given for each decade, not merely the  total number
  of farms and total area, but also the number  in eight classes of specified
  areas. This given, in case the  average size of the farms in the township had
  decreased  from 250 acres to 125 acres, should we not expect the class  returns
  to show an increase in the number of farms in the  classes of smaller acreage,
  and a decrease in the classes of  larger acreage?  And if they were to show
  just the reverse  of this a decrease in the number of smaller farms and  an
  increase in the number of larger farms should we not  say that they were inconsistent
  with the reduction of  average? This inconsistency is just what the Census  Report shows.</p>
<p>  Professor Walker asserts that I have made a gratuitous  assumption, contrary
  to the known facts of the case, in  assuming that additional farms represent
  additional land.  If he will show me, with or without diagrams, any other  basis
  of computation, I shall be obliged to him. I do not  know what arithmetic they
  may use in the Boston Technical School, but I will take an example after the
  manner  of the old arithmetics:<br />
&quot;A boy's trousers contain two yards of cloth; his father's, three yards.
Last year they had each two pairs of trousers; this year they have each three
pairs. How much more cloth have they in their trousers this year than last?&quot;</p>
<p>  Any one outside, perhaps, the Census Bureau or Technical School of Boston
  would say: &quot;One more pair of  trousers for the boy, two yards; one more
  for the father,  three yards. Answer five yards.&quot; </p>
<p>  Supposing somebody should reply: &quot;You have made  in your calculation
  an utterly gratuitous, utterly unfounded, utterly dishonest assumption, contrary
  to all  the known facts of the case. You have assumed the boy's  new trousers
  to have been made from new cloth, whereas  they were cut down from his father's old ones!&quot;</p>
<p>  Any little child would smile, and answer: &quot;That makes  no difference.
  Whether the father's trousers have been  cut down for the boy, or the boy's
  trousers have been  pieced out for the father, the boy has one more pair of  trousers
  with two yards in them, and the father one more  pair of trousers with three
  yards in them, and together  they have five yards more cloth in their trousers.&quot;</p>
<p>  And so, though it is true that in many cases farms  of one class are formed
  from previously existing farms of  another class, the only method of computing
  increase of  area is by taking the increased number at the given area.  An
  acre of land may form part of a farm of one class at  one time, and of a farm
  of another class at another time.  But we cannot suppose it to be in two farms at the same 
  time.</p>
<p>  Without meeting the facts and figures which I gave  from the Census Report
  in disproof of the assertion that  the average size of farms had been reduced
in the last  decade, Professor Walker reiterates that assertion. He  says:</p>
<p>&quot;That the land of all the older States is in process of  sub-division,
  every one above the grade of a plantation  hand, who has lived three years
  east of the Rocky Mountains, knows perfectly well. In the main, the increase
  of  farms in these States is by the partition of land previously  inclosed.
  Thus, Connecticut showed 2,364,416 acres in  25,508 farms in 1870, and 2,453,541
  acres in 30,598 farms  in 1880 an increase of nearly 20 percent, in farms,
  and  of but 5 percent, in acreage. New York showed 22,190,810 acres
  in 216,253 farms in 1870, and 23,780,754 acres  in 241,058 farms in 1880. Georgia,
  to take a State from  another section, showed 23,647,941 acres in 69,956 farms  in
  1870, and 26,043,282 acres in 138,626 farms in 1880  a gain of about 10 percent,
  in acreage, and of almost 100  percent, in farms. This tremendous increase
  of farms in  Georgia is due to the continuous sub-division of the old  plantations
  in order to furnish small farms for the late  slaves and the 'poor whites'
  of that region. The same  cause is operating, with great force, all over the
  South,  and this it is which has brought about that reduction of  the average
  size of farms in the United States from 153  acres in 1870 to 134 acres in
  1880, which arouses such  prodigious wrath on the part of Mr. George.&quot;</p>
<p>  It is a very pleasant theory that the old plantations in  the South are
  being sub-divided in order to furnish small  farms for the late slaves and
  the &quot;poor whites,&quot; and it  would be still pleasanter if it involved
  any presumption  that they were getting these small farms as owners and  not
  as rack-rented tenants. But, unfortunately, while it  is not borne out by any
  information from the South that  I have been able to get, it is absolutely
  disproved by the  census returns. Professor Walker parades, as though it  were
  proof of this sub-division of plantations, a table giving  the total number
  of farms in nine cotton-growing States  in 1870 and 1880, which shows a large
  increase in the  number of farms; but he very prudently neglects to specify  the
  classes in which this increase took place. He could  not have done this without
  showing to the eye of the  reader that, instead of a continuous sub-division
  of the  old plantations, the general tendency in those States is to  an increase
  in the size of farms. Whoever will glance  over the census returns by specified
  classes will see that,  whereas there was in the decade ending 1870 a striking  decrease
  in the number of large farms, and a striking  increase in the number of small
  farms, yet in the decade  ending 1880 the striking increase is in the large
  farms,  and the striking decrease in the small farms. If old  plantations are
  being cut up, then new plantations in  greater number are being formed; for
  in all these States  the most striking increase is in the larger classes. The  farms
  having 500 and 1000 acres, and over 1000 acres,  are in all these States much
  more numerous in 1880 than  in 1870, and even much more numerous than in 1860.</p>
<p>  The following table, drawn from the census reports,  shows the number of
  farms of each class in the nine States  referred to by Professor Walker viz.,
Alabama, Arkansas,  Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South  Carolina, Tennessee, Texas for the last three censuses:</p>
<p>  NUMBER OF FARMS IN COTTON STATES BY CLASSES.<br />
  Class. . .......................1880 .............1870 ....... 1860<br />
  I. -Under 3 acres ..... No returns ......... 2,653 ........ 1,308<br />
  II. 3 to 10 acres .......... 11,248 ..........47,088 .......36,644<br />
  III. 10 to 20 acres ........37,494 ........101,272 .....111,111<br />
  IV.- 20 to 50 acres .....123,977 .......223,444 .....277,112<br />
  V. 50 to 100 acres ..... 101,576 ...... 124,852 .... 229,066<br />
  VI. 100 to 500 acres ...112,193 ....... 91,370 .....410,066<br />
  VII. 500 to 1000 acres ..11,976 ......... 6,407 ...... 37,843<br />
  VIII. Over 1000 acres .....3,557 ......... 1,500 ...... 17,394<br />
  <br />
  These figures show that the movement in these nine  Southern States was in
  the last decade the reverse of the  movement in the previous decade, and was
  to the increase,  not to the decrease, in the size of farms. This will be  even
  more strikingly shown to the eye of the reader by  the following table, which
  exhibits the percentage of  increase or decrease in each class for the decade ending 
  1870 and the decade ending 1880:</p>
<p>  PERCENTAGE OF CHANGE IN NUMBER OF FARMS IN COTTON STATES.<br />
  0 Percent.<br />
  I. Under 3 acres. . No returns for 1860 .............. 31 percent decrease<br />
  II. 3 to 10 acres ..... 319 percent increase .......... 22 percent decrease<br />
  III. 10 to 20 acres ..170 percent increase ........... 10 percent increase<br />
  IV.- 20 to 50 acres ..80 percent increase ........... 24 percent increase<br />
  V.- 50 to 100 ......... 23 percent increase ........... 77 percent increase<br />
  VI.-100 to 500 ....... 19 percent decrease ....... 349 percent increase<br />
  VII. 500 to 1,000 ... 47 percent decrease ....... 491 percent increase<br />
  VIII. Over 1,000 .... 58 percent decrease .... 1,060 percent increase
</p>
<p>  In the face of this exhibit, what could be more preposterously false than
  the census declaration, reiterated by  Superintendent Walker, that the average
  size of farms in  these States decreased in the last decade, and decreased  almost
  as much as in the previous decade! viz., 32 percent, in the decade ending
  1880, and 42 percent, in the  decade ending 1870!  </p>
<p>It is a work of supererogation
  to show in further detail  the utter incompatibility of census figures with
  census  conclusions; but inasmuch as Professor Walker calls  attention to the
  three States of Connecticut, New York,  and Georgia, let us follow him on the
  ground he has  selected, and look briefly at the returns for these States.  We shall see that they too utterly disprove the census 
  conclusions.</p>
<p>  For Connecticut the census totals give:</p>
<p>CONNECTICUT. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Acreage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number of farms. Average
size of farms<br />
  1870 ..... 2,364,416.............25,508 ................93 acres<br />
  1880 ......2,453,541 ............30,598 ...............80 acres</p>
<p>Increase...... 89,125 ........... 5,090 .................13 acres decrease</p>
<p>  Now let us see how this averred reduction in average  size of farms from
  93 to 80 acres is borne out by the  returns of increase by classes. These show: <br />
  CHANGE IN NUMBER OF FARMS IN CONNECTICUT,  DECADE ENDING 1880.<br />
  Class. ...............................Change in number ..... Change percent<br />
  I.&#8212;Under 3 acres .................. 37 decrease ....... 52 decrease<br />
  II.&#8212; 3 to 10 acres .................. 545 increase ..... 32 increase<br />
  III.&#8212; 10 to 20 acres ................310 increase ..... 10 increase<br />
  IV.&#8212; 20 to 50 acres ................145 decrease ...... 2 decrease<br />
  V.&#8212; 50 to 100 acres .............. 569 increase ....... 8 increase<br />
  VI.&#8212;100 to 500 acres ......... 3,725 increase ......64 increase<br />
VII.&#8212;500 to 1,000 acres ........ 107 increase ... 412 increase<br />
VIII.&#8212;over 1,000 acres .............16 increase . 1,600 increase</p>
<p>Net increase in farms under 100 acres ............. 1,242<br />
  Increase in farms over 100 acres ......................3,848</p>
<p>Could anything more conclusively disprove the assertion  of reduced average?</p>
<p>  Take now New York. The census totals give: <br />
  NEW YORK.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Acreage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number
  of farms. Average size of farms<br />
1870 ..... 22,190,810.............216,253 ................103 acres<br />
1880 ......23,780,754 ............241,058 ................ 99 acres</p>
<p>Increase.....1,589,944 ........... 24,805 .................4 acres
  decrease</p>
<p>  Turning to the tables of specified classes, we find the  increase has been:<br />
CHANGE IN NUMBER OF FARMS IN NEW YORK,  DECADE ENDING 1880.</p>
<p>Class. ...............................Change in number ..... Change percent<br />
I.&#8212;Under 3 acres .................. 298 increase ....... 414 increase<br />
II.&#8212; 3 to 10 acres ...............1,537 increase ......... 12 increase<br />
III.&#8212; 10 to 20 acres ..............916 decrease .......... 6 decrease<br />
IV.&#8212; 20 to 50 acres .........14,495 decrease ........ 26 decrease<br />
V.&#8212; 50 to 100 acres ..........3,295 decrease .......... 4 decrease<br />
VI.&#8212;100 to 500 acres...... 49,325 increase ..........72 increase<br />
VII.&#8212;500 to 1,000 acres .. 1,106 increase ........ 542 increase<br />
VIII.&#8212;over 1,000 acres ........245 increase ........ 681 increase</p>
<p>Net increase in farms under 100 acres ............. 16,871<br />
  Increase in farms over 100 acres ......................41,676</p>
<p>  In the face of these figures, will Professor Walker assert  that the average
  size of farms in New York has decreased  from 103 acres to 99 acres? </p>
<p>  Now, let us take the case of Georgia, in which Professor  Walker dwells,
  as the typical Southern State.  The census totals give:</p>
<p>  GEORGIA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Acreage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number
  of farms. Average size of farms<br />
<br />
  1870 ...... 23,647,941 ............69,956 ................ 338 acres<br />
  1880 ...... 26,043,282 ..........138,626 ................ 188 acres<br />
Increase.... 2,395,341 ............68,670 ................ 150 acres decrease</p>
<p>From the table of specified classes we find the increase  to have been:</p>
<p>  CHANGE IN NUMBER OF FARMS IN GEORGIA,  DECADE ENDING 1880.<br />
  Class. Change in number. Change per cent.<br />
  I. &#8212;Under 3 acres..... No return for 1870<br />
  II.&#8212; 3 to 10 acres ............... 147 decrease 4 decrease<br />
  III.&#8212; 10 to 20 acres .......... 1,752 increase 25 increase<br />
  IV.&#8212; 20 to 50 acres ........ 14,553 increase 66 increase<br />
  V.&#8212; 50 to 100 acres ......... 7,683 increase 41 increase<br />
  VI.&#8212; 100 to 500 acres .....56,145 increase 206 increase<br />
  VII.&#8212; 500 to 1,000 acres .. 5,511 increase 365 increase<br />
  VIII.&#8212;Over 1,000 acres .... 3,702 increase 733 increase</p>
<p>  After verifying these figures, will Professor Walker  again assert, on the
  authority of the census, that during  the last decade there has been a gain
  of about 10 per cent,  in acreage, and almost 100 per cent, in farms in Georgia,  and
  that the average size of farms has been reduced from  338 acres to 188 acres?</p>
<p>  It is, of course, manifest in the case of Georgia as in  the cases of Connecticut
  and New York, and of the United  States at large, that the real movement has
  been in the  other direction&#8212;to the large increase instead of to the  reduction
  of the average of farms. If we endeavor, from  the data which the census gives
  us, to work out some  approximation to the true average, our first step will
  be  to ascertain what averages in the various classes reported  for 1870 will
  give the total acreage for that year. The  moment we attempt this we run against
  an astounding  fact. The figures I am about to give I expressly commend to
  Superintendent Walker, but I request him to  remember that it is he, not I,
  who is responsible for them.  What has he to say to the fact that, in order
  to make  the acreage of the farms returned for Georgia by specified  classes
  for 1870 correspond with the total acreage given  for that year on which his
  calculation of average has been  based, <em>it is necessary to assume the very
  highest limit of each  class as the average of that class, and even then to
  assume the  average of the class over 1000 acres to be 24,558 acres</em>?</p>
<p>  Here is the tabulation:</p>
<p>  FARM ACREAGE OF GEORGIA, 1870.<br />
  Total farm acreage of Georgia for 1870, as given<br />
  by the Census Report....................... 23,647,941<br />
  Total number of farms............................. 69,956<br />
  <br />
  ACREAGE BY SPECIFIED CLASSES.</p>
<p>Class. ..............................Acres ..........Number of farms .......
  Acreage<br />
II. 3 to 10 acres ......................10 ...............3,257 ............32,570<br />
HI. 10 to 20 acres ................. 20 .............. 6,942 ..........138,840<br />
IV.- 20 to 50 acres ................ 50 .............21,971 .......1,098,550<br />
V. 50 to 100 acres ............... 100............. 18,371 .......1,837,100<br />
VI. -100 to 500 acres .......... 500 ............ 17,490 .......8,745,000<br />
VH.-500 to 1000 acres ..... 1,000 ............. 1,506 ........1,506,000<br />
VIII. Over 1000 acres .... 24,558 .................419 ...... 10,289,802<br />
<br />
Totals ......................................................69,956 .......23,647,862<br />
  <br />
  After this, it would be wasting space and time to go  further. Whoever wants
      to figure out what, at this rate,  has been the increase of farm acreage
    in Georgia during the decade, or what was the average in 1880, may do so.
  The Census Report offers opportunities for much amusing arithmetical exercise;
      but save for this purpose, it is  evidently not worth the paper on which
    it
      is printed. I  have conclusively shown its utter unreliability, both as
  a
    whole and in its parts, and with this, must decline further controversy.  </p>
