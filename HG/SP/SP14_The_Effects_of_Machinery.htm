<p align="center"><strong>The Effects of Machinery</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 14 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
  (1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> HOW ignorance, neglect or contempt of human rights may turn public benefits
  into public misfortunes we may clearly see if we trace the effect of labor-saving
inventions.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> It is not altogether from a blind dislike of innovation that even the
  more thoughtful and intelligent Chinese set their faces against the introduction
  into their dense population of the labor-saving machinery of Western civilization.
  They recognize the superiority which in many things invention has given us,
  but to their view this superiority must ultimately be paid for with too high
  a price. The Eastern mind, in fact, regards the greater powers grasped by Western
  civilization somewhat as the medieval European mind regarded the powers which
  it believed might be gained by the Black Art, but for which the user must finally
  pay in destruction of body and damnation of soul. And there is much in the
  present aspects and tendencies of our civilization to confirm the Chinese in
  this view.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03]</font> It is clear that the inventions and discoveries which during this century
  have so enormously increased the power of producing wealth have not proved
  an unmixed good. Their benefits are not merely unequally distributed, but they
  are bringing about absolutely injurious effects. They are concentrating capital.
  and increasing the power of these concentrations to monopolize and oppress;
  are rendering the workman more dependent; depriving him of the advantages of
  skill and of opportunities to acquire it; lessening his control over his own
  condition and his hope of improving it; cramping his mind, and in many cases
  distorting and enervating his body.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04]</font> It seems to me impossible to consider the present tendencies of our industrial
  development without feeling that if there be no escape from them, the Chinese
  philosophers are right, and that the powers we have called into our service
  must ultimately destroy us. We are reducing the cost of production; but in
  doing so, are stunting children, and unfitting women for the duties of maternity,
  and degrading men into the position of mere feeders of machines. We are not
  lessening the fierceness of the struggle for existence. Though we work with
  an intensity and application that with the great majority of us leaves time
  and power for little else, we have increased, not decreased, the anxieties
  of life. Insanity is increasing, suicide is increasing, the disposition to
  shun marriage is increasing. We are developing, on the one side, enormous fortunes,
  but on the other side, utter pariahs. These are symptoms of disease for which
  no gains can compensate.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> Yet it is manifestly wrong to attribute either necessary good or necessary
  evil to the improvements and inventions which are so changing industrial and
  social relations. They simply increase power &#8212; and power may work either
  good or evil as intelligence controls or fails to control it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06]</font> Let us consider the effects of the introduction of labor-saving machinery
  &#8212; or rather, of all discoveries, inventions and improvements, that increase
  the produce a given amount of labor can obtain.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> In that primitive state in which the labor of each family supplies its
  wants, any invention or discovery which increases the power of supplying one
  of these wants will increase the power of supplying all, since the labor saved
  in one direction may be expended in other directions.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>When division of labor has taken place, and different parts in production
  are taken by different individuals, the gain obtained by any labor-saving improvement
  in one branch of production will, in like manner, be averaged with all. If,
  for instance, improvements be made in the weaving of cloth and the working
  of iron, the effect will be that a bushel of grain will exchange for more cloth
  and more iron, and thus the farmer will be enabled to obtain the same quantity
  of all the things he wants with less labor, or a somewhat greater quantity
  with the same labor. And so with all other producers.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> Even when the improvement is kept a secret, or the inventor is protected
  for a time by a patent, it is only in part that the benefit can be retained.
  It is the general characteristic of labor-saving improvements, after at least
  a certain stage in the arts is reached, that the production of larger quantities
  is necessary to secure the economy. And those who have the monopoly are impelled
  by their desire for the largest profit to produce more at a lower price, rather
  than to produce the same quantity at the previous price, thus enabling the
  producers of other things to obtain for less labor the particular things in
  the production of which the saving has been effected, and thus diffusing part
  of the benefit, and generally the largest part, over the whole field of industry.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>In this way all labor-saving inventions tend to increase the productive
  power of all labor, and, except in so far as they arc monopolized, their whole
  benefit is thus diffused. For, if in one occupation labor become more profitable
  than in others, labor is drawn to it until the net average in different occupations
  is restored. And so, where not artificially prevented, does the same tendency
  bring to a common level the earnings of capital. The direct effect of improvements
  and inventions which add to productive power is, it is to be remarked, always
  to increase the earnings of labor, never to increase the earnings of capital.
  The advantage, even in such improvements as may seem primarily to be rather
  capital-saving than labor-saving &#8212; as, for instance, an invention which
  lessens the time required for the tanning of hides &#8212; becomes a property and
  advantage of labor. The reason is, not to go into a more elaborate explanation,
  that
  labor is the active factor in production. Capital is merely its tool and instrument.
  The great gains made by particular capitalists in the utilization of improvements,
  are not the gains of capital, but generally the gains of monopoly, though sometimes
  they may be gains of adventure or of management. The rate of interest, which
  is the measure of the earnings of capital, has not increased with all the enormous
  labor-saving improvements of our century; on the contrary, its tendency has
  been to diminish. But the requirement of larger amounts of capital, which is
  generally characteristic of labor-saving improvements, may increase the facility
  with which those who have large capitals can establish monopolies that enable
  them to intercept what would naturally go to labor. This, however, is an effect,
  rather than a cause, of the failure of labor to get the benefit of improvements
  in production.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11]</font> For the cause we must go further. While labor-saving improvements increase
  the power of labor, no improvement or invention can release labor from its
  dependence upon land. Labor-saving improvements only increase the power of
  producing wealth from land. And land being monopolized as the private property
  of certain persons, who can thus prevent others from using it, all these gains,
  which accrue primarily to labor, can be demanded from labor by the owners of
  land, in higher rents and higher prices. Thus, as we see it, the march of improvement
  and invention has increased neither interest nor wages, but its general effect
  has everywhere been to increase the value of land. Where increase of wages
  has been won, it has been by combination, or the concurrence of special causes;
  but what of the increased productiveness which primarily attaches to labor
  has been thus secured by labor is comparatively trivial. Some part of it has
  gone to various other monopolies, but the great bulk has gone to the monopoly
  of the soil, has increased ground-rents and raised the value of land.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12] </font>The railroad, for instance, is a great labor-saving invention. It does
  not increase the quantity of grain which the farmer can raise, nor the quantity
  of goods which the manufacturer can turn out; but by reducing the cost of transportation
  it increases the quantity of all the various things which can be obtained in
  exchange for produce of either kind; which practically amounts to the same
  thing.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>These gains primarily accrue to labor; that is to say, the advantage
  given by the railroad in the district which it affects, is to save labor; to
  enable the same labor to procure more wealth. But as we see where railroads
  are built, it is not labor that secures the gain. The railroad being a monopoly
  &#8212; and in the United States, a practically unrestricted monopoly &#8212; as
  large a portion as possible of these gains, over and above the fair returns
  on the
  capital invested, is intercepted by the managers, who by fictitious costs,
  watered stock, and in various other ways, thinly disguise their levies, and
  who generally rob the stockholders while they fleece the public. The rest of
  the gain &#8212; the advantage which, after these deductions, accrues to labor
  &#8212; is intercepted by the monopolists of land. As the productiveness of
  labor is
  increased, or even as there is a promise of its increase, so does the value
  of land increase, and labor, having to pay proportionately more for land, is
  shorn of all the benefit. Taught by experience, when a railroad opens a new
  district we do not expect wages to increase; what we expect to increase is
  the value of land.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>The elevated railroads of New York are great labor-saving machines, which
  have greatly reduced the time and labor necessary to take people from one end
  of the city to the other. They have made accessible to the overcrowded population
  of the lower part of the island, the vacant spaces at the upper. But they have
  not added to the earnings of labor, nor made it easier for the mere laborer
  to live. Some portion of the gain has been intercepted by Mr. Cyrus Field,
  Mr. Samuel J. Tilden, Mr. Jay Gould, and other managers and manipulators. Over
  and above this, the advantage has gone to the owners of land. The reduction
  in the time and cost of transportation has made much vacant land accessible
  to an overcrowded population, but as this land has been made accessible, so
  has its value risen, and the tenement-house population is as crowded as ever.
  The managers of the roads have gained some millions; the owners of the land
  affected, some hundreds of millions; but the working-classes of New York are
  no better off. What they gain in improved transportation they must pay in increased
  rent.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>And so would it be with any improvement or material benefaction. Supposing
  the very rich men of New York were to become suddenly imbued with that public
  spirit which shows itself in the Astor Library and the Cooper Institute, and
  that it should become among them a passion, leading them even to beggar themselves
  in the emulation to benefit their fellow-citizens. Supposing such a man as
  Mr. Gould were to make the elevated roads free, were to assume the cost of
  the Fire Department, and give every house a free telephone connection; and
  Mr. Vanderbilt, not to be outdone, were to assume the cost of putting down
  good pavements, and cleaning the streets, and running the horse-cars for nothing;
  while the Astors were to build libraries in every ward. Supposing the fifty,
  twenty, ten, and still smaller millionaires, seized by the same passion, were
  singly or together, at their own cost, to bring in plentiful supplies of water;
  to furnish heat, light and power free of charge; to improve and maintain the
  schools; to open theaters and concerts to the public; to establish public gardens
  and baths and markets; to open stores where everything could be bought at retail
  for the lowest wholesale price; &#8212; in short, were to do everything that
  could be done to make New York a cheap and pleasant place to live in? The result
  would be that New York being so much more desirable a place to live in, more
  people would desire to live in it, and the landowners could charge so much
  the more for the privilege. All these benefactions would increase rent.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16]</font> And so, whatever be the character of the improvement, its benefit, land
  being monopolized, must ultimately go to the owners of land. Were labor-saving
  invention carried so far that the necessity of labor in the production of wealth
  were done away with, the result would be that the owners of land could command
  all the wealth that could be produced, and need not share with labor even what
  is necessary for its maintenance. Were the powers and capacities of land increased,
  the gain would be that of landowners. Or were the improvement to take place
  in the powers and capacities of labor, it would still be the owners of land,
  not laborers, who would reap the advantage.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>For land being indispensable to labor, those who monopolize land are
  able to make their own terms with labor; or rather, the competition with each
  other of those who cannot employ themselves, yet must find employment or starve,
  will force wages down to the lowest point at which the habits of the laboring-class
  permit them to live and reproduce. At this point, in all countries where land
  is fully monopolized, the wages of common labor must rest, and toward it all
  other wages tend, being kept up above it only by the special conditions, artificial
  or otherwise, which give labor in some occupations higher wages than in others.
  And so no improvement even in the power of labor itself &#8212; whether it
  come from education, from the actual increase of muscular force, or from the
  ability
  to do with less sleep and work longer hours &#8212; could raise the reward
  of labor above this point. This we see in countries and in occupations where
  the labor
  of women and children is called in to aid the natural breadwinner in the support
  of the family. While as for any increase in economy and thrift, as soon as
  it became general it could only lessen, not increase, the reward of labor.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18]</font> This is the &quot;iron law of wages,&quot; as it is styled by the Germans
  -- the law which determines wages to the minimum on which laborers will consent
  to live and reproduce. It is recognized by all economists, though by most of
  them attributed to other causes than the true one. It is manifestly an inevitable
  result of making the land from which all must live the exclusive property of
  some. The lord of the soil is necessarily lord of the men who live upon it.
  They are as truly and as fully his slaves as though his ownership in their
  flesh and blood were acknowledged. Their competition with each other to obtain
  from him the means of livelihood must compel them to give up to him all their
  earnings save the necessary wages of slavery &#8212; to wit, enough to keep
  them in working condition and maintain their numbers. And as no possible increase
  in the power of his labor, or reduction in his expenses of living, can benefit
  the slave, neither can it, where land is monopolized, benefit those who have
  nothing but their labor. It can only increase the value of land &#8212; the
  proportion of the produce that goes to the landowner. And this being the case,
  the greater
  employment of machinery, the greater division of labor, the greater contrasts
  in the distribution of wealth, become to the working-masses positive evils
  &#8212; making their lot harder and more hopeless as material progress goes
  on. Even education adds but to the capacity for suffering. If the slave must
  continue
  to be a slave, it is cruelty to educate him.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19] </font>All this we may not yet fully realize, because the industrial revolution
  which began with the introduction of steam, is as yet in its first stages,
  while up to this time the overrunning of a new continent has reduced social
  pressure, not merely here, but even in Europe. But the new continent is rapidly
  being fenced in, and the industrial revolution goes on faster and faster. </p>
