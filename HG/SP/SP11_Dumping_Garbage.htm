<p align="center"><strong>Dumping Garbage</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 11 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
(1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> THIS gulf-stream of humanity that is setting on our shores with increasing
  volume is in all respects worthy of more attention than we give it. In many
  ways one of the most important phenomena of our time, it is one which forcibly
  brings to the mind the fact that we are living under conditions which must
  soon begin to change rapidly. But there is one part of the immigration coming
  to us this year which is specially suggestive. A number of large steamers of
  the trans-Atlantic lines are calling, under contract with the British government,
  at small ports on the west coast of Ireland, filling up with men, women and
  children, whose passages are paid by their government, and then, ferrying them
  across the ocean, are dumping them on the wharves of New York and Boston with
  a few dollars apiece in their pockets to begin life in the New World.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> The strength of a nation is in its men. It is its people that make a
  country great and strong, produce its wealth, and give it rank among other
  countries. Yet, here is a civilized and Christian government, or one that passes
  for such, shipping off its people, to be dumped upon another continent, as
  garbage is shipped off from New York to be dumped into the Atlantic Ocean.
  Nor are these people undesirable material for the making of a nation. Whatever
  they may sometimes become here, when cooped up in tenement houses and exposed
  to the corruption of our politics, and to the temptation of a life greatly
  differing from that to which they have been accustomed, they are in their own
  country, as any one who has been among them there can testify, a peaceable,
  industrious, and, in some important respects, a peculiarly moral people, who
  lack intellectual and political education, and the robust virtues that personal
  independence alone can give, simply because of the poverty to which they are
  condemned. Mr. Trevelyan, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, has declared in
  the House of Commons that they are physically and morally healthy, well capable
  of making a living, and yet the government of which he is a member is shipping
  them away at public expense as New York ships its garbage!</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>These people are well capable of making a living, Mr. Trevelyan says,
  yet if they remain at home they will be able to make only the poorest of poor
  livings in the best of times, and when seasons are not of the best, taxes must
  be raised and alms begged to keep them alive; and so as the cheapest way of
  getting rid of them, they are shipped away at public expense.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04]</font> What is the reason of this? Why is it that people, in themselves well
  capable of making a living, cannot make a living for themselves in their own
  country? Simply that the natural, equal, and unalienable rights of man, with
  which, as asserted by our Declaration of Independence, these human beings have
  been endowed by their Creator, are denied them. The famine, the pauperism,
  the misgovernment and turbulence of Ireland, the bitter wrongs which keep aglow
  the fire of Irish &quot;sedition,&quot; and the difficulties with regard to
  Ireland which perplex English statesmen, all spring from what the National
  Assembly of France, in 1789, declared to be the cause of all public misfortunes
  and corruptions of government &#8212; the contempt of human rights. The Irish
  peasant is forced to starve, to beg, or to emigrate; he becomes in the eyes
  of those
  who rule him mere human garbage, to be shipped off and dumped anywhere, because,
  like the English peasant, who, after a slave's life, dies a pauper's death,
  his natural rights in his native soil are denied him; because his unalienable
  right to procure wealth by his own exertions and to retain it for his own uses
  is refused him.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> The country from which these people are shipped &#8212;  and
  the government-aided emigration is as nothing compared to the voluntary emigration
  &#8212; is abundantly
  capable of maintaining in comfort a very much larger population than it has
  ever had. There is no natural reason why in it people themselves capable of
  making a living should suffer want and starvation. The reason that they do
  is simply that they are denied natural opportunities for the employment of
  their labor, and that the laws permit others to extort from them the proceeds
  of such labor as they are permitted to do. Of these people who are now being
  sent across the Atlantic by the English government, and dumped on our wharves
  with a few dollars in their pockets, there are probably none of mature years
  who have not by their labor produced wealth enough not only to have supported
  them hitherto in a much higher degree of comfort than that in which they have
  lived, but to have enabled them to pay their own passage across the Atlantic,
  if they wanted to come, and to have given them on landing here a capital sufficient
  for a comfortable start. They are penniless only because they have been systematically
  robbed from the day of their birth to the day they left their native shores.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06]</font> A year ago I traveled through that part of Ireland from which these government-aided
  emigrants come. What surprises an American at first, even in Connaught, is
  the apparent sparseness of population, and he wonders if this can indeed be
  that overpopulated Ireland of which he has heard so much. There is plenty of
  good land, but on it are only fat beasts, and sheep so clean and white that
  you at first think that they must be washed and combed every morning. Once
  this soil was tilled and was populous, but now you will find only traces of
  ruined hamlets, and here and there the miserable hut of a herd, who lives in
  a way no Tierra del Fuegan could envy. For the &quot;owners&quot; of this land,
  who live in London and Paris, many of them never having seen their estates,
  find cattle more profitable than men, and so the men have been driven off.
  It is only when you reach the bog and the rocks, in the mountains and by the
  seashore, that you find a dense population. Here they are crowded together
  on land on which Nature never intended men to live. It is too poor for grazing,
  so the people who have been driven from the better land are allowed to live
  upon it &#8212; as long as they pay their rent. If it were not too pathetic,
  the patches they call fields would make you laugh. Originally the surface of
  the
  ground must have been about as susceptible of cultivation as the surface of
  Broadway. But at the cost of enormous labor the small stones have been picked
  off and piled up, though the great boulders remain, so that it is impossible
  to use a plow; and the surface of the bog has been cut away, and manured by
  seaweed brought from the shore on the backs of men and women, till it can be
  made to grow something.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> For such patches of rock and bog &#8212; soil
  it could not be called, save by courtesy &#8212; which have been made to produce
  anything only by their unremitting
  toil &#8212; these people are compelled to pay their absentee landlords rents
  varying from &pound;1 to &pound;4 per acre, and then they must pay another rent for
  the seaweed, which the surf of the wild Atlantic throws upon the shore, before
  they are permitted to take it for manure, and another rent still for the bog
  from which they cut their turf. As a matter of fact, these people have to pay
  more for the land than they can get out of the land. They are really forced
  to pay not merely for the use of the land and for the use of the ocean, but
  for the use of the air. Their rents are made up, and they manage to live in
  good times, by the few shillings earned by the women, who knit socks as they
  carry their creels to and from the market or seashore; by the earnings of the
  men, who go over to England every year to work as harvesters; or by remittances
  sent home by husbands or children who have managed to get to America. In spite
  of their painful industry the poverty of these people is appalling. In good
  times they just manage to keep above the starvation line. In bad times, when
  a blight strikes their potatoes, they must eat seaweed, or beg relief from
  the poor-rates, or from the charitable contributions of the world. When so
  rich as to have a few chickens or a pig, they no more think of eating them
  than Vanderbilt thinks of eating his $50,000 trotters. They are sold to help
  pay the rent. In the loughs you may see fat salmon swimming in from the sea;
  but, if every one of them were marked by nature with the inscription, &quot;Lord
  So-and-So, London, with the compliments of God Almighty,&quot; they could not
  be more out of the reach of these people. The best shops to be found in the
  villages will have for stock a few pounds of sugar and tea weighed out into
  ounce and half-ounce papers, a little flour, two or three red petticoats, a
  little coarse cloth, a few yards of flannel, and a few of cotton, some buttons
  and thread, a little pigtail tobacco, and, perhaps, a bottle or two of &quot;the
  native&quot; hid away in the ground some distance from the cabin, so that if
  the police do capture it the shopkeeper cannot be put in jail. For the Queen
  must live and the army must be supported, and the great distillers of Dublin
  and Belfast and Cork, who find such a comfortable monopoly in the excise, have
  churches to build and cathedrals to renovate. So poor are these people, so
  little is there in their miserable cabins, that a sub-sheriff who, last year,
  superintended the eviction of near one hundred families in one place, declared
  that the effects of the whole lot were not worth &pound;3.</p>
<p>[08] But the landlords &#8212; ah! the landlords &#8212; they live differently.
  Every now and again in traveling through this country you come across some
  landlord's
  palatial home mansion, its magnificent grounds inclosed with high walls. Pass
  inside these walls and it is almost like entering another world &#8212; wide
  stretches of rich velvety lawn, beds of bright flowers, noble avenues of arching
  trees,
  and a spacious mansion rich with every appointment of luxury, with its great
  stables, kennels, and appurtenances of every kind. But though they may have
  these luxurious home places, the large landlords, with few exceptions, live
  in London or Paris, or pass part of the year in the great cities and the rest
  in Switzerland or Italy or along the shores of the Mediterranean; and occasionally
  one of them takes a trip over here to see our new country, with its magnificent
  opportunities for investing in wild lands which will soon be as valuable as
  English or Irish estates. They do not have to work; their incomes come without
  work on their part &#8212; all they have to do is to spend. Some collect galleries
  of the most valuable paintings; some are fanciers of old books, and give fabulous
  prices for rare editions. Some of them gamble, some keep studs of racers and
  costly yachts, and some get rid of their money in ways worse than these. Even
  their agents, whose business it is to extort the rent from the Irishmen who
  do work, live luxuriously. But it all comes out of the earnings of just such
  people as are now being dumped on our wharves &#8212; out of their earnings,
  or out of what is sent them by relatives in America, or by charitable contributions.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> It is to maintain such a system of robbery as this that Ireland is filled
  with policemen and troops and spies and informers, and a people who might be
  an integral part of the British nation are made to that nation a difficulty,
  a weakness and a danger. Economically, the Irish landlords are of no more use
  than so many great, ravenous, destructive beasts &#8212; packs of wolves,
  herds of wild elephants, or such dragons as St. George is reported to have
  killed.
  They produce nothing; they only consume and destroy. And what they destroy
  is more even than what they consume. For, not me rely is Ireland turned into
  a camp of military police and red-coated soldiery to hold down the people while
  they are robbed; but the wealth producers, stripped of capital by this robbery
  of their earnings, and condemned by it to poverty and ignorance, are unable
  to produce the wealth which they could and would produce did labor get its
  full earnings, and were wealth left to those who make it. Surely true statesmanship
  would suggest that if any one is to be shoveled out of a country it should
  be those who merely consume and destroy; not those who produce wealth.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>But English statesmen think otherwise, and these surplus Irish men and
  women; these garbage Irish men and women and little children &#8212; surplus
  and garbage because the landlords of Ireland have no use for them, are shoveled
  out of their own country and dumped on our wharves. They have reached &quot;the
  land of the free and the home of the brave &quot; just in time for the Fourth
  of July, when they may hear the Declaration of Independence, with its ringing
  assertion of unalienable rights, read again in our annual national celebration.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11]</font> Have they, then, escaped from the system which in their own country made
  them serfs and human garbage? Not at all. They have not even escaped the power
  of their old landlords to take from them the proceeds of their toil.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> For we are not merely getting these surplus tenants of English, Scotch
  and Irish landlords &#8212; we are getting the landlords, too. Simultaneously
  with this emigration is going on a movement which is making the landlords and
  monopolists
  of Great Britain owners of vast tracts of American soil. There is even now
  scarcely a large landowning family in Great Britain that does not own even
  larger American estates, and American land is becoming with them a more and
  more favorite investment. These American estates of &quot;their graces&quot; and &quot;my
  lords&quot; are not as yet as valuable as their home estates, but the natural
  increase in our population, augmented by emigration, will soon make them so.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>Every &quot;surplus&quot; Irishman, Englishman or Scotsman sent over
  here assists directly in sending up the value of land and the rent of land.
  The stimulation of emigration from the Old Country to this is a bright idea
  on the part of these landlords of two continents. They get rid of people whom,
  at home, in hard times, they might have to support in some sort of fashion,
  and lessen, as they think, the forces of disaffection, while at the same time
  they augment the value of their American estates.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14]</font> It is not improbable that some of these evicted tenants may find themselves
  over here paying rent to the very same landlords to swell whose incomes they
  have so long toiled in their old country; but whether this be so or not, their
  mere coming here, by its effect in increasing the demand for land, helps to
  enable those landlords to compel some others of the people of the United States
  to give up to them a portion of their earnings in return for the privilege
  of living upon American soil. It is merely with this view, and for this purpose,
  that the landlords of the Old World are buying so much land in the New. They
  do not want it to live upon; they prefer to live in London or Paris, as many
  of the privileged classes of America are now learning to prefer to live. They
  do not want to work it; they do not propose to work at all. All they want with
  it is the power, which, as soon as our population increases a little, its ownership
  will give, of demanding the earnings of other people. And under present conditions
  it is a matter, not of a generation or two, but of only a few years, before
  they will be able to draw from their American estates sums even greater than
  from their Irish estates. That is to say, they will virtually own more Americans
  than they now own Irishmen.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15]</font> So far from these Irish immigrants having escaped from the system that
  has impoverished and pauperized the masses of the Irish people for the benefit
  of a few of their number, that system has really more unrestricted sway here
  than in Ireland. In spite of the fact that we read the Declaration of Independence
  every Fourth of July, make a great noise and have a great jubilation, that
  first of the unalienable rights with which every man is endowed by his Creator
  &#8212; the equal right to the use of the natural elements without which wealth
  cannot be produced, nor even life maintained &#8212; is no better acknowledged
  with us than it is in Ireland.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>There is much said of &quot;Irish landlordism,&quot; as though it were
  a peculiar kind of landlordism, or a peculiarly bad kind of landlordism. This
  is not so. Irish landlordism is in nothing worse than English landlordism,
  or Scotch landlordism, or American landlordism, nor are the Irish landlords
  harder than any similar class. Being generally men of education and culture,
  accustomed to an easy life they are, as a whole, less grasping toward their
  tenants than the farmers who rent of them are to the laborers to whom they
  sub-let. They regard the land as their own, that is all, and expect to get
  an income from it; and the agent who sends them the best income they naturally
  regard as the best agent.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>Such popular Irish leaders as Mr. Parnell and Mr. Sullivan, when they
  come over here and make speeches, have a good deal to say about the &quot;feudal
  landlordism&quot; of Ireland. This is all humbug &#8212; an attempt to convey
  the impression that Irish landlordism is something different from American
  landlordism,
  so that American landowners will not take offense, while Irish landowners are
  denounced. There is in Ireland nothing that can be called feudal landlordism.
  All the power which the Irish landlord has, all the tyranny which he exercises,
  springs from his ownership of the soil, from the legal recognition that it
  is his property. If landlordism in Ireland seems more hateful than in England,
  it is only because the industrial organization is more primitive, and there
  are fewer intermediaries between the man who is robbed and the man who gets
  the plunder. And if either Irish or English landlordism seems more hateful
  than the same system in America, it is only because this is a new country,
  not yet quite fenced in. But, as a matter of law, these ''my lords&quot; and
  ''your graces,&quot; who are now getting themselves far greater estates in
  the United States than they have in their own country, have more power as landlords
  here than there.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[18]</font> In Ireland, especially, the tendency of legislation for a series of years
  has been to restrain the power of the landlord in dealing with the tenant.
  In the United States he has in all its fullness the unrestricted power of doing
  as he pleases with his own. Rack-renting is with us the common, almost the
  exclusive, form of renting. There is no long process to be gone through with
  to secure an eviction, no serving notice upon the relieving officer of the
  district. The tenant whom the landlord wants to get rid of can be evicted with
  the minimum of cost and expense.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[19] </font>Says the Tribune's &quot;Broadway Lounger&quot; incidentally in his chatter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-2">[20] </font>Judge Gedney tells me that on the first of this month he signed no less
    than two hundred and fifty warrants of dispossession against poor tenants.
    His district includes many blocks of the most squalid variety of tenement-houses,
    and he has fully as much unpleasant work of this kind as any of his judicial
    brethren. The first of May is, of course, the heaviest field-day of the year
    for such business, but there are generally at the beginning of every month
    at least one hundred warrants granted. And to those who fret about the minor
    miseries of life, no more wholesome cure could be administered than an enforced
    attendance in a district court on such occasions. The lowest depths of misery
    are sounded. Judge Gedney says, too, that in the worst cases the suffering
    is more generally caused by misfortune than by idleness or dissipation. A man
    gets a felon on his hand, which keeps him at home until his savings are gone
    and all his effects are in the pawnshop, and then his children fall sick or
    his wife dies, and the agent of the house, under instructions from the owner,
    who is perhaps in Europe enjoying himself, won't wait for the rent, and serves
    him with a summons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>A while ago, when it was bitter cold, I read in
  the papers an item telling how, in the city of Wilkes Barre, Pa., a woman
  and her three children were found
  one night huddled in a hogshead on a vacant lot, famished and almost frozen.
  The story was a simple one. The man. out of work, had tried to steal, and been
  sent to prison. Their rent unpaid, their landlord had evicted them, and as
  the only shelter they knew of; they had gone to the hogshead. In Ireland, bad
  as it is, the relieving officer would have had to be by to have offered them
  at least the shelter of the almshouse.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22] </font>These Irish men and women who are being dumped on our wharves with two
  or three dollars in their pockets, do they find access to nature any freer
  here than there? Far out in the West, if they know where to go, and can get
  there, they may, for a little while yet; but though they may see even around
  New York plenty of unused land, they will find that it all belongs to somebody.
  Let them go to work at what they will, they must, here as there, give up some
  of their earnings for the privilege of working, and pay some other human creature
  for the privilege of living. On the whole their chances will be better here
  than there, for this is yet a new country, and a century ago our settlements
  only fringed the eastern seaboard of a vast continent. But from the Atlantic
  to the Pacific we already have our human garbage, the volume of which some
  of this Irish human garbage will certainly go to swell. Wherever you go throughout
  the country the &quot;tramp&quot; is. known; and in this metropolitan city
  there are already, it is stated by the Charity Organization Society, a quarter
  of a million people who live on alms! What, in a few years more, are we to
  do for a dumping-ground? Will it make our difficulty the less that our human
  garbage can vote?</p>
