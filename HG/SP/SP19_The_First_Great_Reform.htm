<p align="center"><strong>The First Great Reform</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 19 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
  (1883)
</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>DO what we may, we can accomplish nothing real and lasting until we secure
  to all the first of those equal and unalienable rights with which, as our Declaration
  of Independence has it, man is endowed by his Creator &#8212; the equal and
  unalienable
right to the use and benefit of natural opportunities.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02] </font>There are people who are always trying to find some mean between right
  and wrong &#8212; people who, if they were to see a man about to be unjustly
  beheaded, might insist that the proper thing to do would be to chop off his
  feet. These
  are the people who, beginning to recognize the importance of the land question,
  propose in Ireland and England such measures as judicial valuations of rents
  and peasant proprietary, and in the United States, the reservation to actual
  settlers of what is left of the public lands, and the limitation of estates.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>Nothing whatever can be accomplished by such timid, illogical measures.
  If we would cure social disease we must go to the root.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>There is no use in talking of reserving what there may be left of our
  public domain to actual settlers. That would be merely a locking of the stable
  door after the horse had been stolen, and even if it were not, would avail
  nothing.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>There is no use in talking about restricting the amount of land any one
  man may hold. That, even if it were practicable, were idle, and would not meet
  the difficulty. The ownership of an acre in a city may give more command of
  the labor of others than the ownership of a hundred thousand acres in a sparsely
  settled district, and it is utterly impossible by any legal device to prevent
  the concentration of property so long as the general causes which irresistibly
  tend to the concentration of property remain untouched. So long as the wages
  tend to the point of a bare living for the laborer we cannot stop the tendency
  of property of all kinds to concentration, and this must be the tendency of
  wages until equal rights in the soil of their country are secured to all. We
  can no more abolish industrial slavery by limiting the size of estates than
  we could abolish chattel slavery by putting a limit on the number of slaves
  a single slaveholder might own. In the one case as in the other, so far as
  such restrictions could be made operative they would only increase the difficulties
  of abolition by enlarging the class who would resist it.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[06]</font> There is no escape from it. If we would save the Republic before social
  inequality and political demoralization have reached the point when no salvation
  is possible, we must assert the principle of the Declaration of Independence,
  acknowledge the equal and unalienable rights which inhere in man by endowment
  of the Creator, and make land common property.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> If there seems anything strange in the idea that
  all men have equal and unalienable rights to the use of the earth, it is merely
  that habit can blind
  us to the most obvious truths. Slavery, polygamy, cannibalism, the flattening
  of children's heads, or the squeezing of their feet, seem perfectly natural
  to those brought up where such institutions or customs exist. But, as a matter
  of fact, nothing is more repugnant to the natural perceptions of men than that
  land should be treated as subject to individual ownership, like things produced
  by labor. It is only among an insignificant fraction of the people who have
  lived on the earth that the idea that the earth itself could be made private
  property has ever obtained; nor has it ever obtained save as the result of
  a long course of usurpation, tyranny and fraud. This idea reached development
  among the Romans, whom it corrupted and destroyed. It took many generations
  for it to make its way among our ancestors; and it did not, in fact, reach
  full recognition until two centuries ago, when, in the time of Charles II,
  the feudal dues were shaken off by a landholders' parliament. We accepted it
  as we have accepted the aristocratic organization of our army and navy, and
  many other things, in which we have servilely followed European custom. Land
  being plenty and population sparse, we did not realize what it would mean when
  in two or three cities we should have the population of the thirteen colonies.
  But it is time that we should begin to think of it now, when we see ourselves
  confronted, in spite of our free political institutions, with all the problems
  that menace Europe &#8212; when, though our virgin soil is not yet quite fenced
  in, we have a &quot;working-class,&quot; a &quot;criminal class,&quot; and a &quot;pauper
  class;&quot; when there are already thousands of so-called free citizens of
  the Republic who cannot by the hardest toil make a living for their families,
  and when we are, on the other hand, developing such monstrous fortunes as the
  world has not seen since great estates were eating out the heart of Rome.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> What more preposterous than the treatment of land as individual property?
  In every essential land differs from those things which being the product of
  human labor are rightfully property. It is the creation of God; they are produced
  by man. It is fixed in quantity; they may be increased illimitably. It exists,
  though generations come and go; they in a little while decay and pass again
  into the elements. What more preposterous than that one tenant for a day of
  this rolling sphere should collect rent for it from his co-tenants, or sell
  to them for a price what was here ages before him and will be here ages after
  him ? What more preposterous than that we, living in New York city in this
  year, 1883, should be working for a lot of landlords who get the authority
  to live on our labor from some English king, dead and gone these centuries?
  What more preposterous than that we, the present population of the United States,
  should presume to grant to our own people or to foreign capitalists the right
  to strip of their earnings American citizens of the next generation? What more
  utterly preposterous than these titles to land? Although the whole people of
  the earth in one generation were to unite, they could no more sell title to
  land against the next generation than they could sell that generation. It is
  a self-evident truth, as Thomas Jefferson said, that the earth belongs in usufruct
  to the living.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>Nor can any defense of private property in land be made on the ground
  of expediency. On the contrary, look where you will, and it is evident that
  the private ownership of land keeps land out of use; that the speculation it
  engenders crowds population where it ought to be more diffused, diffuses it
  where it ought to be closer together; compels those who wish to improve to
  pay away a large part of their capital, or mortgage their labor for years before
  they are permitted to improve; prevents men from going to work for themselves
  who would gladly do so, crowding them into deadly competition with each other
  for the wages of employers; and enormously restricts the production of wealth
  while causing the grossest inequality in its distribution.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>No assumption can be more gratuitous than that constantly made that absolute
  ownership of land is necessary to the improvement and proper use of land. What
  is necessary to the best use of land is the security of improvements&#8212;  the assurance that the labor and capital expended upon it shall enjoy their
  reward.
  This is a very different thing from the absolute ownership of land. Some of
  the finest buildings in New York are erected upon leased ground. Nearly the
  whole of London and other English cities, and great parts of Philadelphia and
  Baltimore, are so built. All sorts of mines are opened and operated on leases.
  In California and Nevada the most costly mining operations, involving the expenditure
  of immense amounts of capital, were undertaken upon no better security than
  the mining regulations, which gave no ownership of the land, but only guaranteed
  possession as long as the mines were worked.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11]</font> If shafts can be sunk and tunnels can be run, and the most costly machinery
  can be put up on public land on mere security of possession, why could not
  improvements of all kinds be made on that security? If individuals will use
  and improve land belonging to other individuals, why would they not use and
  improve land belonging to the whole people? What is to prevent land owned by
  Trinity Church, by the Sailors' Snug Harbor, by the Astors or Rhinelanders,
  or any other corporate or individual owners, from being as well improved and
  used as now, if the ground-rents, instead of going to corporations or individuals,
  went into the public treasury?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> In point of fact, if land were treated as the common property of the
  whole people, it would be far more readily improved than now, for then the
  improver would get the whole benefit of his improvements. Under the present
  system, the price that must be paid for land operates as a powerful deterrent
  to improvement. And when the improver has secured land either by purchase or
  by lease, he is taxed upon his improvements, and heavily taxed in various ways
  upon all that he uses. Were land treated as the property of the whole people,
  the ground-rent accruing to the community would suffice for public purposes,
  and all other taxation might be dispensed with. The improver could more easily
  get land to improve, and would retain for himself the full benefit of his improvements
  exempt from taxation.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>To secure to all citizens their equal right to the land on which they
  live, does not mean, as some of the ignorant seem to suppose, that every one
  must be given a farm, and city land be cut up into little pieces. It would
  be impossible to secure the equal rights of all in that way, even if such division
  were not in itself impossible. In a small and primitive community of simple
  industries and habits, such as that Moses legislated for, substantial equality
  may be secured by allotting to each family an equal share of the land and making
  it unalienable. Or, as among our rude ancestors in western Europe, or in such
  primitive society as the village communities of Russia and India, substantial
  equality may be secured by periodical allotment or cultivation in common. Or
  in sparse populations, such as the early New England colonies, substantial
  equality may be secured by giving to each family its town-lot and its seed-lot,
  holding the rest of the land as town land or common. But among a highly civilized
  and rapidly growing population, with changing centers, with great cities and
  minute division of industry, and a complex system of production and exchange,
  such rude devices become ineffective and impossible.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>Must we therefore consent to inequality &#8212; must
  we therefore consent that some shall monopolize what is the common heritage
  of all? Not at all.
  If two men find a diamond, they do not march to a lapidary to have it cut in
  two. If three sons inherit a ship, they do not proceed to saw her into three
  pieces; nor yet do they agree that if this cannot be done equal division is
  impossible. Nor yet is there no other way to secure the rights of the owners
  of a railroad than by breaking up track, engines, cars and depots into as many
  separate bits as there are stockholders. And so it is not necessary, in order
  to secure equal rights to land, to make an equal division of land. All that
  it is necessary to do is to collect the ground-rents for the common benefit.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15]</font> Nor, to take ground-rents for the common benefit, is it necessary that
  the state should actually take possession of the land and rent it out from
  year to year, or from term to term, as some ignorant people suppose. It can
  be done in a much more simple and easy manner by means of the existing machinery
  of taxation. All it is necessary to do is to abolish all other forms of taxation
  until the weight of taxation rests upon the value of land irrespective of improvements,
  and take the ground-rent for the public benefit.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>In this simple way, without increasing governmental machinery, but, on
  the contrary, greatly simplifying it, we could make land common property. And
  in doing this we could abolish all other taxation, and still have a great and
  steadily increasing surplus &#8212; a growing common fund, in the benefits
  of which all might share, and in the management of which there would be such
  a direct
  and general interest as to afford the strongest guaranties against misappropriation
  or waste. Under this system no one could afford to hold land he was not using,
  and land not in use would be thrown open to those who wished to use it, at
  once relieving the labor market and giving an enormous stimulus to production
  and improvement, while land in use would be paid for according to its value,
  irrespective of the improvements the user might make. On these he would not
  be taxed. All that his labor could add to the common wealth, all that his prudence
  could save, would be his own, instead of, as now, subjecting him to fine. Thus
  would the sacred right of property be acknowledged by securing to each the
  reward of his exertion.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>Practically, then, the greatest, the most fundamental of all reforms,
  the reform which will make all other reforms easier, and without which no other
  reform will avail, is to be reached by concentrating all taxation into a tax
  upon the value of land, and making that heavy enough to take as near as may
  be the whole ground-rent for common purposes.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18] </font>To those who have never studied the subject, it will seem ridiculous
  to propose as the greatest and most far-reaching of all reforms a mere fiscal
  change. But whoever has followed the train of thought through which in preceding
  chapters I have endeavored to lead, will see that in this simple proposition
  is involved the greatest of social revolutions &#8212; a revolution compared
  with which that which destroyed ancient monarchy in France, or that which destroyed
  chattel slavery in our Southern States, were as nothing.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19]</font> In a book such as this, intended for the casual reader, who lacks inclination
  to follow the close reasoning necessary to show the full relation of this seemingly
  simple reform to economic laws, I cannot exhibit its full force, but I may
  point to some of the more obvious of its effects.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20]</font> To appropriate ground-rent* to public uses by means of taxation would
  permit the abolition of all the taxation which now presses so heavily upon
  labor and capital. This would enormously increase the production of wealth
  by the removal of restrictions and by adding to the incentives to production.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>*I use the term ground-rent because the proper economic term, rent, might
    not be understood by those who are in the habit of using it in its common sense,
  which applies to the income from buildings and improvements. as well as land.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[21]</font> It would at the same time enormously increase the production of wealth
  by throwing open natural opportunities. It would utterly destroy land monopoly
  by making the holding of land unprofitable to any but the user. There would
  be no temptation to any one to hold land in expectation of future increase
  in its value when that increase was certain to be demanded in taxes. No one
  could afford to hold valuable land idle when the taxes upon it would be as
  heavy as they would be were it put to the fullest use. Thus speculation in
  land would be utterly destroyed, and land not in use would become free to those
  who wished to use it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22]</font> The enormous increase in production which would result from thus throwing
  open the natural means and opportunities of production, while at the same time
  removing the taxation which now hampers, restricts and fines production, would
  enormously augment the annual fund from which all incomes are drawn. It would
  at the same time make the distribution of wealth much more equal. That great
  part of this fund which is now taken by the owners of land, not as a return
  for anything by which they add to production, but because they have appropriated
  as their own the natural means and opportunities of production, and which as
  material progress goes on, and the value of land rises, is constantly becoming
  larger and larger, would be virtually divided among all, by being utilized
  for common purposes. The removal of restrictions upon labor, and the opening
  of natural opportunities to labor, would make labor free to employ itself.
  Labor, the producer of all wealth, could never become &quot;a drug in the market&quot; while
  desire for any form of wealth was unsatisfied. With the natural opportunities
  of employment thrown open to all, the spectacle of willing men seeking vainly
  for employment could not be witnessed; there could be no surplus of unemployed
  labor to beget that cutthroat competition of laborers for employment which
  crowds wages down to the cost of merely living. Instead of the one-sided competition
  of workmen to find employment, employers would compete with each other to obtain
  workmen. There would be no need of' combinations to raise or maintain wages;
  for wages, instead of tending to the lowest point at which laborers can live,
  would tend to the highest point which employers could pay, and thus, instead
  of getting but a mere fraction of his earnings, the workman would get the full
  return of his labor, leaving to the skill, foresight and capital of the employer
  those additional earnings that are justly their due.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23]</font> The equalization in the distribution of wealth that would thus result
  would effect immense economies and greatly add to productive power. The cost
  of the idleness, pauperism and crime that spring from poverty would be saved
  to the community; the increased mobility of labor, the increased intelligence
  of the masses, that would result from this equalized distribution of wealth,
  the greater incentive to invention and to the use of improved processes that
  would result from the increase in wages, would enormously increase production.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[24] </font>To abolish all taxes save a tax upon the value of land would at the same
  time greatly simplify the machinery and expenses of government, and greatly
  reduce government expenses. An army of Custom-House officers, and internal
  revenue officials, and license collectors and assessors, clerks, accountants,
  spies, detectives, and government employees of every description, could be
  dispensed with. The corrupting effect of indirect taxation would be taken out
  of our politics. The rings and combinations now interested in keeping up taxation
  would cease to contribute money for the debauching of voters and to beset the
  law-making power with their lobbyists. We should get rid of the fraud and false
  swearing, of the bribery and subornation which now attend the collection of
  so much of our public revenues. We should get rid of the demoralization that
  proceeds from laws which prohibit actions in themselves harmless, punish men
  for crimes which the moral sense does not condemn, and offer a constant premium
  to evasion. &quot;Land lies out of doors.&quot; It cannot be hid or carried
  off. Its value can be ascertained with greater ease and exactness than the
  value of anything else, and taxes upon that value can be collected with absolute
  certainty and at the minimum of expense. To rely upon land values for the whole
  public revenue would so simplify government, would so eliminate incentives
  to corruption, that we could safely assume as governmental functions the management
  of telegraphs and railroads, and safely apply the increasing surplus to securing
  such common benefits and providing such public conveniences as advancing civilization
  may call for.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[25] </font>And in thinking of what is possible in the way of the management of common
  concerns for the common benefit, not only is the great simplification of government
  which would result from the reform I have suggested to be considered, but the
  higher moral tone that would be given to social life by the equalization of
  conditions and the abolition of poverty. The greed of wealth, which makes it
  a business motto that every man is to be treated as though he were a rascal,
  and induces despair of getting in places of public trust men who will not abuse
  them for selfish ends, is but the reflection of the fear of want. Men trample
  over each other from the frantic dread of being trampled upon, and the admiration
  with which even the unscrupulous money-getter is regarded springs from habits
  of thought engendered by the fierce struggle for existence to which the most
  of us are obliged to give up our best energies. But when no one feared want,
  when every one felt assured of his ability to make an easy and independent
  living for himself and his family, that popular admiration which now spurs
  even the rich man still to add to his wealth would be given to other things
  than the getting of money. We should learn to regard the man who strove to
  get more than he could use, as a fool &#8212; as indeed he is.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[26] </font>He must have eyes only for the mean and vile,
  who has mixed with men without realizing that selfishness and greed and vice
  and crime are largely
  the result of social conditions which bring out the bad qualities of human
  nature and stunt the good; without realizing that there is even now among men
  patriotism and virtue enough to secure us the best possible management of public
  affairs if our social and political adjustments enabled us to utilize those
  qualities. Who has not known poor men who might safely be trusted with untold
  millions? Who has not met with rich men who retained the most ardent sympathy
  with their fellows, the warmest devotion to all that would benefit their kind?
  Look today at our charities, hopeless of permanent good though they may be!
  They at least show the existence of unselfish sympathies, capable, if rightly
  directed, of the largest results.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[27] </font>It is no mere fiscal reform that I propose; it is a conforming of the
  most important social adjustments to natural laws. To those who have never
  even thought to the matter, it may seem irreverently presumptuous to say that
  it is the evident intent of the Creator that land values should be the subject
  of taxation; that rent should be utilized for the benefit of the entire community.
  Yet to whoever does think of it, to say this will appear no more presumptuous
  than to say that the Creator has intended men to walk on their feet, and not
  on their hands. Man in his social relations is as much included in the creative
  scheme as man in his physical relations. Just as certainly as the fish was
  intended to swim in the water, and the bird to fly through the air, and monkeys
  to live in trees, and moles to burrow underground, was man intended to live
  with his fellows. He is by nature a social animal. And the creative scheme
  must embrace the life and development of society, as truly as it embraces the
  life and development of the individual. Our civilization cannot carry us beyond
  the domain of law. Railroads, telegraphs and labor-saving machinery are no
  more accidents than are flowers and trees.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[28]</font> Man is driven by his instincts and needs to form society. Society, thus
  formed, has certain needs and functions for which revenue is required. These
  needs and functions increase with social development, requiring a larger and
  larger revenue. Now, experience and analogy, if not the instinctive perceptions
  of the human mind, teach us that there is a natural way of satisfying every
  natural want. And if human society is included in nature, as it surely is,
  this must apply to social wants as well as to the wants of the individual,
  and there must be a natural or right method of taxation, as there is a natural
  or right method of walking.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[29] </font>We know, beyond peradventure, that the natural
  or right way for a man to walk is on his feet, and not on his hands. We know
  this of a surety &#8212; because
  the feet are adapted to walking, while the hands are not; because in walking
  on the feet all the other organs of the body are free to perform their proper
  functions, while in walking on the hands they are not; because a man can walk
  on his feet with ease, convenience and celerity, while no amount of training
  will enable him to walk on his hands save awkwardly, slowly and painfully.
  In the same way we may know that the natural or right way of raising the revenues
  which are required by the needs of society is by the taxation of land values.
  The value of land is in its nature and relations adapted to purposes of taxation,
  just as the feet in their nature and relations are adapted to the purposes
  of walking. The value of land** only arises as in the integration of society
  the need for some public or common revenue begins to be felt. It increases
  as the development of society goes on, and as larger and larger revenues are
  therefore required. Taxation upon land values does not lessen the individual
  incentive to production and accumulation, as do other methods of taxation;
  on the contrary, it leaves perfect freedom to productive forces, and prevents
  restrictions upon production from arising. It does not foster monopolies, and
  cause unjust inequalities in the distribution of wealth, as do other taxes;
  on the contrary, it has the effect of breaking down monopoly and equalizing
  the distribution of wealth. It can be collected with greater certainty and
  economy than any other tax; it does not beget the evasion, corruption and dishonesty
  that flow from other taxes. In short, it conforms to every economic and moral
  requirement. What can be more in accordance with justice than that the value
  of land, which is not created by individual effort, but arises from the existence
  and growth of society, should be taken by society for social needs?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>**Value, it must always be remembered, is a totally different thing from utility.
    From the confounding of these two different ideas much error and confusion
    arise. No matter how useful it may be, nothing has a value until some one is
  willing to give labor or the produce of labor for it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[30] </font>In trying, in a previous chapter, to imagine a world in which natural
  material and opportunities were free as air, I said that such a world as we
  find ourselves in is best for men who will use the intelligence with which
  man has been gifted. So, evidently, it is. The very laws which cause social
  injustice to result in inequality, suffering and degradation are in their nature
  beneficent. All this evil is the wrong side of good that might be.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[31] </font>Man is more than an animal. And the more we consider the constitution
  of this world in which we find ourselves, the more clearly we see that its
  constitution is such as to develop more than animal life. If the purpose for
  which this world existed were merely to enable animal man to eat, drink and
  comfortably clothe and house himself for his little day, some such world as
  I have previously endeavored to imagine would be best. But the purpose of this
  world, so far at least as man is concerned, is evidently the development of
  moral and intellectual, even more than of animal, powers. Whether we consider
  man himself or his relations to nature external to him, the substantial truth
  of that bold declaration of the Hebrew scriptures, that man has been created
  in the image of God, forces itself upon the mind.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[32] </font>If all the material things needed by man could
  be produced equally well at all points on the earth's surface, it might seem
  more convenient for man
  the animal, but how would he have risen above the animal level? As we see in
  the history of social development, commerce has been and is the great civilizer
  and educator. The seemingly infinite diversities in the capacity of different
  parts of the earth's surface lead to that exchange of productions which is
  the most powerful agent in preventing isolation, in breaking down prejudice,
  in increasing knowledge and widening thought. These diversities of nature,
  which seemingly increase with our knowledge of nature's powers like the diversities
  in the aptitudes of individuals and communities, which similarly increase with
  social development, call forth powers and give rise to pleasures which could
  never arise had man been placed, like an ox, in a boundless field of clover.
  The &quot;international law of God&quot; which we fight with our tariffs &#8212;  so
  short-sighted are the selfish prejudices of men &#8212; is the law which stimulates
  mental and moral progress; the law to which civilization is due.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[33]</font> And so, when we consider the phenomenon of rent, it reveals to us one
  of those beautiful and beneficent adaptations, in which more than in anything
  else the human mind recognizes evidences of Mind infinitely greater, and catches
  glimpses of the Master Workman.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[34] </font>This is the law of rent: As individuals come together in communities,
  and society grows, integrating more and more its individual members, and making
  general interests and general conditions of more and more relative importance,
  there arises, over and above the value which individuals can create for themselves,
  a value which is created by the community as a whole, and which, attaching
  to land, becomes tangible, definite and capable of computation and appropriation.
  As society grows, so grows this value, which springs from and represents in
  tangible form what society as a whole contributes to production, as distinguished
  from what is contributed by individual exertion. By virtue of natural law in
  those aspects which it is the purpose of the science we call political economy
  to discover &#8212; as it is the purpose of the sciences which we call chemistry
  and astronomy to discover other aspects of natural law &#8212; all social
  advance necessarily contributes to the increase of this common value; to the
  growth
  of this common fund.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[35] </font>Here is a provision made by natural law for the increasing needs of social
  growth; here is an adaptation of nature by virtue of which the natural progress
  of society is a progress toward equality, not toward inequality; a centripetal
  force tending to unity, growing out of and ever balancing a centrifugal force
  tending to diversity. Here is a fund belonging to society as a whole from which,
  without the degradation of alms, private or public, provision can be made for
  the weak, the helpless, the aged; from which provision can be made for the
  common wants of all as a matter of common right to each, and by the utilization
  of which society, as it advances, may pass, by natural methods and easy stages,
  from a rude association for purposes of defense and police, into a co&#157;perative
  association, in which combined power guided by combined intelligence can give
  to each more than his own exertions multiplied many fold could produce.</p>
<p><font size="-3">[36] </font>By making land private property, by permitting individuals to appropriate
  this fund which nature plainly intended for the use of all, we throw the children's
  bread to the dogs of Greed and Lust; we produce a primary inequality which
  gives rise in every direction to other tendencies to inequality; and from this
  perversion of the good gifts of the Creator, from this ignoring and defying
  of his social laws, there arise in the very heart of our civilization those
  horrible and monstrous things that betoken social putrefaction.<br />
