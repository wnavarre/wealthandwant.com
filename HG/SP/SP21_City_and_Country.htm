<p align="center"><strong>City and Country</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 20 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George (1883)
</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>COBBETT compared London, even in his day, to a great wen growing upon
  the fair face of England. There is truth in such comparison. Nothing more clearly
  shows the unhealthiness of present social tendencies than the steadily increasing
  concentration of population in great cities. There are about 12,000 head of
  beef cattle killed weekly in the shambles of New York, while, exclusive of
  what goes through for export, there are about 2100 beef carcasses per week
  brought in refrigerator-cars from Chicago. Consider what this single item in
  the food supply of a great city suggests as to the elements of fertility, which,
  instead of being returned to the soil from which they come, are swept out through
  the sewers of our great cities. The reverse of this is the destructive character
  of our agriculture, which is year by year decreasing the productiveness of
  our soil, and virtually lessening the area of land available for the support
of our increasing millions.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> In all the aspects of human life similar effects are being produced.
  The vast populations of these great cities are utterly divorced from all the
  genial influences of nature. The great mass of them never, from year's end
  to year's end, press foot upon mother earth, or pluck a wild flower, or hear
  the tinkle of brooks, the rustle of grain, or the murmur of leaves as the light
  breeze comes through the woods. All the sweet and joyous influences of nature
  are shut out from them. Her sounds are drowned by the roar of the streets and
  the clatter of the people in the next room, or the next tenement; her sights
  are hidden from their eyes by rows of high buildings. Sun and moon rise and
  set, and in solemn procession the constellations move across the sky, but these
  imprisoned multitudes behold them only as might a man in a deep quarry. The
  white snow falls in winter only to become dirty slush on the pavements, and
  as the sun sinks in summer a worse than noonday heat is refracted from masses
  of brick and stone. Wisely have the authorities of Philadelphia labeled with
  its name every tree in their squares; for how else shall the children growing
  up in such cities know one tree from another? how shall they even know grass
  from clover?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>This life of great cities is not the natural life of man. He must, under
  such conditions, deteriorate, physically, mentally, morally. Yet the evil does
  not end here. This is only one side of it. This unnatural life of the great
  cities means an equally unnatural life in the country. Just as the wen or tumor,
  drawing the wholesome juices of the body into its poisonous vortex, impoverishes
  all other parts of the frame, so does the crowding of human beings into great
  cities impoverish human life in the country.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04]</font> Man is a gregarious animal. He cannot live by bread alone. If he suffers
  in body, mind and soul from being crowded into too close contact with his fellows,
  so also does he suffer from being separated too far from them. The beauty and
  the grandeur of nature pall upon man where other men are not to be met; her
  infinite diversity becomes monotonous where there is not human companionship;
  his physical comforts are poor and scant, his nobler powers languish; all that
  makes him higher than the animal suffers for want of the stimulus that comes
  from the contact of man with man. Consider the barrenness of the isolated farmer's
  life &#8212; the dull round of work and sleep, in which so much of it passes.
  Consider, what is still worse, the monotonous existence to which his wife is
  condemned;
  its lack of recreation and excitement, and of gratifications of taste, and
  of the sense of harmony and beauty; its steady drag of cares and toils that
  make women worn and wrinkled when they should be in their bloom. Even the discomforts
  and evils of the crowded tenement-house are not worse than the discomforts
  and evils of such a life. Yet as the cities grow, unwholesomely crowding people
  together till they are packed in tiers, family above family, so are they unwholesomely
  separated in the country. The tendency everywhere that this process of urban
  concentration is going on, is to make the life of the country poor and hard,
  and to rob it of the social stimulus and social gratifications that are so
  necessary to human beings. The old healthy social life of village and townland
  is everywhere disappearing. In England, Scotland and Ireland, the thinning
  out of population in the agricultural districts is as marked as is its concentration
  in cities and large towns. In Ireland, as you ride along the roads, your car-driver,
  if he be an old man, will point out to you spot after spot, which, when he
  was a boy, were the sites of populous hamlets, echoing in the summer evenings
  with the laughter of children and the joyous sports of young people, but now
  utterly desolate, showing, as the only evidences of human occupation, the isolated
  cabins of miserable herds. In Scotland, where in such cities as Glasgow, human
  beings are so crowded together that two-thirds of the families live in a single
  room, where if you go through the streets of a Saturday night, you will think,
  if you have ever seen the Tierra del Fuegans, that these poor creatures might
  envy them, there are wide tracts once populous, now given up to cattle, to
  grouse and to deer &#8212; glens that once sent out their thousand fighting
  men, now tenanted by a couple of gamekeepers. So across the Tweed, while London,
  Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester and Nottingham have grown, the village life of &quot;merrie&quot; England
  is all but extinct. Two-thirds of the entire population is crowded into cities.
  Clustering hamlets, such as those through which, according to tradition, Shakespeare
  and his comrades rollicked, have disappeared; village greens where stood the
  May-pole, and the cloth-yard arrow flew from the longbow to the bull's-eye
  of the butt, are plowed under or inclosed by the walls of some lordly demesne,
  while here and there stand mementos alike of a bygone faith and a departed
  population, in great churches or their remains &#8212; churches such as now
  could never be filled unless the congregations were brought from town by railroad
  excursion trains.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> So in the agricultural districts of our older
  States the same tendency may be beheld; but it is in the newer States that
  its fullest expression is
  to be found &#8212; in ranches measured by square miles, where live half-savage
  cowboys, whose social life is confined to the excitement of the &quot;round-up&quot; or
  a periodical &quot;drunk&quot; in a railroad town; and in bonanza farms, where
  in the spring the eye wearies of seas of waving grain before resting on a single
  home &#8212; farms where the cultivators are lodged in barracks, and only
  the superintendent enjoys the luxury of a wife.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>That present tendencies are hurrying modern society toward inevitable
  catastrophe, is apparent from the constantly increasing concentration of population
  in great cities, if in nothing else. A century ago New York and its suburbs
  contained about 25,000 souls; now they contain over 2,000,000. The same growth
  for another century would put here a population of 160,000,000. Such a city
  is impossible. But what shall we say of the cities of ten and twenty millions,
  that, if present tendencies continue, children now born shall see?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> On this, however, I will not dwell. I merely wish to call attention to
  the fact that this concentration of population impoverishes social life at
  the extremities, as well as poisons it at the center; that it is as injurious
  to the farmer as it is to the inhabitant of the city.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> This unnatural distribution of population, like that unnatural distribution
  of wealth which gives one man hundreds of millions and makes other men tramps,
  is the result of the action of the new industrial forces in social conditions
  not adapted to them. It springs primarily from our treatment of land as private
  property, and secondarily from our neglect to assume social functions which
  material progress forces upon us. Its causes removed, there would ensue a natural
  distribution of population, which would give every one breathing-space and
  neighborhood.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>It is in this that would be the great gain of the farmer in the measures
  I have proposed. With the resumption of common rights to the soil, the overcrowded
  population of the cities would spread, the scattered population of the country
  would grow denser. When no individual could profit by advance in the value
  of land, when no one need fear that his children could be jostled out of their
  natural rights, no one would want more land than he could profitably use. Instead
  of scraggy, half-cultivated farms, separated by great tracts lying idle, homesteads
  would come close to each other. Emigrants would not toil through unused acres,
  nor grain be hauled for thousands of miles past half-tilled land. The use of
  machinery would not be abandoned: where culture on a large scale secured economies
  it would still go on; but with the breaking up of monopolies, the rise in wages
  and the better distribution of wealth, industry of this kind would assume the
  co&brvbar;perative form. Agriculture would cease to be destructive, and would
  become more intense, obtaining more from the soil and returning what it borrowed.
  Closer settlement would give rise to economies of all kinds; labor would be
  far more productive, and rural life would partake of the conveniences, recreations
  and stimulations now to be obtained only by the favored classes in large towns.
  The monopoly of land broken up, it seems to me that rural life would tend to
  revert to the primitive type of the village surrounded by cultivated fields,
  with its common pasturage and woodlands. But however this may be, the working
  farmer would participate fully in all the enormous economies and all the immense
  gains which society can secure by the substitution of orderly co&brvbar;peration
  for the anarchy of reckless, greedy scrambling.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10]</font> That the masses now festering in the tenement-houses of our cities, under
  conditions which breed disease and death, and vice and crime, should each family
  have its healthful home, set in its garden; that the working farmer should
  be able to make a living with a daily average of two or three hours' work,
  which more resembled healthy recreation than toil; that his home should be
  replete with all the conveniences yet esteemed luxuries; that it should be
  supplied with light and heat, and power if needed, and connected with those
  of his neighbors by the telephone; that his family should be free to libraries,
  and lectures, and scientific apparatus, and instruction; that they should be
  able to visit the theater, or concert, or opera, as often as they cared to,
  and occasionally to make trips to other parts of the country or to Europe;
  that, in short, not merely the successful man, the one in a thousand, but the
  man of ordinary parts and ordinary foresight and prudence, should enjoy all
  that advancing civilization can bring to elevate and expand human life, seems,
  in the light of existing facts, as wild a dream as ever entered the brain of
  hashish-eater. Yet the powers already within the grasp of man make it easily
  possible.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>In our mad scramble to get on top of one another, how little do we take
  of the good things that bountiful nature offers us! Consider this fact: To
  the majority of people in such countries as England, and even largely in the
  United States, fruit is a luxury. Yet mother earth is not niggard of her fruit.
  If we chose to have it so, every road might be lined with fruit-trees. </p>
