      <p align="center"><strong>Political Dangers</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 2 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George (1883)</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> THE American Republic is today unquestionably
  foremost of the nations
  &#8212; the van leader of modern civilization. Of all the great peoples of
  the European family, her people are the most homogeneous, the most active and
  most assimilative.
  Their average standard of intelligence and comfort is higher; they have most
  fully adopted modern industrial improvements, and are quickest to utilize discovery
  and invention; their political institutions are most in accordance with modern
  ideas, their position exempts them from dangers and difficulties besetting
  the European nations, and a vast area of unoccupied land gives them room to
  grow.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> At the rate of increase so far maintained, the English-speaking people
  of America will, by the close of the century, number nearly one hundred million
  &#8212; a population as large as owned the sway of Rome in her palmiest days.
  By the middle of the next century &#8212; a time which children now born will
  live to see &#8212; they will, at the same rate, number more than the present population
  of Europe; and by its close nearly equal the population which, at the beginning
  of this century, the whole earth was believed to contain.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>But the increase of power is more rapid than the increase of population,
  and goes on in accelerating progression. Discovery and invention stimulate
  discovery and invention; and it is only when we consider that the industrial
  progress of the last fifty years bids fair to pale before the achievements
  of the next that we can vaguely imagine the future that seems opening before
  the American people. The center of wealth, of art, of luxury and learning,
  must pass to this side of the Atlantic even before the center of population.
  It seems as if this continent had been reserved &#8212; shrouded for ages
  from the rest of the world &#8212; as the field upon which European civilization
  might freely
  bloom. And for the very reason that our growth is so rapid and our progress
  so swift; for the very reason that all the tendencies of modern civilization
  assert themselves here more quickly and strongly than anywhere else, the problems
  which modern civilization must meet, will here first fully present themselves,
  and will most imperiously demand to be thought out or fought out.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>It is difficult for any one to turn from the history of the past to think
  of the incomparable greatness promised by the rapid growth of the United States
  without something of awe &#8212; something of that feeling which induced Amasis
  of Egypt to dissolve his alliance with the successful Polycrates, because &quot;the
  gods do not permit to mortals such prosperity.&quot; Of this, at least, we
  may be certain: the rapidity of our development brings dangers that can be
  guarded against only by alert intelligence and earnest patriotism.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> There is a suggestive fact that must impress any one who thinks over
  the history of past eras and preceding civilizations. The great, wealthy and
  powerful nations have always lost their freedom; it is only in small, poor
  and isolated communities that Liberty has been maintained. So true is this
  that the poets have always sung that Liberty loves the rocks and the mountains;
  that she shrinks from wealth and power and splendor, from the crowded city
  and the busy mart. So true is this that philosophical historians have sought
  in the richness of material resources the causes of the corruption and enslavement
  of peoples.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>Liberty is natural. Primitive perceptions are of the equal rights of
  the citizen, and political organization always starts from this base. It is
  as social development goes on that we find power concentrating, in institutions
  based upon the equality of rights passing into institutions which make the
  many the slaves of the few. How this is we may see. In all institutions which
  involve the lodgment of governing power there is, with social growth, a tendency
  to the exaltation of their function and the centralization of their power,
  and in the stronger of these institutions a tendency to the absorption of the
  powers of the rest. Thus the tendency of social growth is to make government
  the business of a special class. And as numbers increase and the power and
  importance of each become less and less as compared with that of all, so, for
  this reason, does government tend to pass beyond the scrutiny and control of
  the masses. The leader of a handful of warriors, or head man of a little village,
  can command or govern only by common consent, and anyone aggrieved can readily
  appeal to his fellows. But when a tribe becomes a nation and the village expands
  to a populous country, the powers of the chieftain, without formal addition,
  become practically much greater. For with increase of numbers scrutiny of his
  acts becomes more difficult, it is harder and harder successfully to appeal
  from them, and the aggregate power which he directs becomes irresistible as
  against individuals. And gradually, as power thus concentrates, primitive ideas
  are lost, and the habit of thought grows up which regards the masses as born
  but for the service of their rulers.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> Thus the mere growth of society involves danger of the gradual conversion
  of government into something independent of and beyond the people, and the
  gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling class &#8212; though not necessarily
  a class marked off by personal titles and a hereditary status, for, as history
  shows, personal titles and hereditary status do not accompany the concentration
  of power, but follow it. The same methods which, in a little town where each
  knows his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,
  enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great city, as we
  have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of plunderers to gain and
  hold the government. So, too, as we see in Congress, and even in our State
  legislatures, the growth of the country and the greater number of interests
  make the proportion of the votes of a representative, of which his constituents
  know or care to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial
  departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the people.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> But to the changes produced by growth are, with
  us, added the changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency
  of steam and of
  machinery is to the division of labor, to the concentration of wealth and power.
  Workmen are becoming massed by hundreds and thousands in the employ of single
  individuals and firms; small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks
  and salesmen of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues
  and payrolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this concentration
  grows the facility of combination among these great business interests. How
  readily the railroad companies, the coal operators, the steel producers, even
  the match manufacturers, combine, either to regulate prices or to use the powers
  of government! The tendency in all branches of industry is to the formation
  of rings against which the individual is helpless, and which exert their power
  upon government whenever their interests may thus be served.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great aggregations
  of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to corrupt government and
  take it out of the control of the masses of the people. &quot;Nothing is more
  timorous than a million dollars &#8212; except two million dollars.&quot; Great
  wealth always supports the party in power, no matter how corrupt it may be.
  It never exerts itself for reform, for it instinctively fears change. It never
  struggles against misgovernment. When threatened by the holders of political
  power it does not agitate, nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is
  in this way, no less than by its direct interference, that aggregated wealth
  corrupts government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our organized lobbies,
  both legislative and Congressional, rely as much upon the fears as upon the
  hopes of moneyed interests. When &quot;business&quot; is dull, their resource
  is to get up a bill which some moneyed interest will pay them to beat. So,
  too, these large moneyed interests will subscribe to political funds, on the
  principle of keeping on the right side of those in power, just as the railroad
  companies deadhead President Arthur when he goes to Florida to fish.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it. Where legislation
  is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where justice is to be purchased,
  the rich have the ear of the courts. And if, for this reason, great wealth
  does not absolutely prefer corrupt government to pure government, it becomes
  none the less a corrupting influence. A community composed of very rich and
  very poor falls an easy prey to whoever can seize power. The very poor have
  not spirit and intelligence enough to resist; the very rich have too much at
  stake.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the aggregation
  of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations, necessarily implies the loss
  by the people of governmental control. Democratic forms may be maintained,
  but there can be as much tyranny and misgovernment under democratic forms as
  any other &#8212; in fact, they lend themselves most readily to tyranny and
  misgovernment. Forms count for little. The Romans expelled their kings, and
  continued to abhor
  the very name of king. But under the name of C&aelig;sars and Imperators, that
  at first meant no more than our &quot;Boss,&quot; they crouched before tyrants
  more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of &quot;bosses,&quot; developed
  political C&aelig;sars in municipalities and states. If this development continues,
  in time there will come a national boss. We are young but we are growing. The
  day may arrive when the &quot;Boss of America&quot; will be to the modern world
  what C&aelig;sar was to the Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic
  government in more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
  something like equality &#8212; where the great mass of citizens are personally
  free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty nor made subject by
  their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in a property qualification.
  The man who is dependent on a master for his living is not a free man. To give
  the suffrage to slaves is only to give votes to their owners. That universal
  suffrage may add to, instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we
  see when mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
  without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the freedom to
  vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican institutions be secured.
  How can a man be said to have a country where he has no right to a square inch
  of soil; where he has nothing but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must
  bid against his fellows for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting
  tramps, some principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
  I have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the almshouse
  to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the interest of good government.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
  of wealth. This our people do not generally recognize, and they listen to quacks
  who propose to cure the symptoms without touching the disease. &quot;Let us
  elect good men to office,&quot; say the quacks. Yes; let us catch little birds
  by sprinkling salt on their tails!</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13]</font> It behooves us to look facts in the face. The experiment of popular government
  in the United States is clearly a failure. Not that it is a failure everywhere
  and in everything. An experiment of this kind does not have to be fully worked
  out to be proved a failure. But speaking generally of the whole country, from
  the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, our government
  by the people has in large degree become, is in larger degree becoming, government
  by the strong and unscrupulous.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14]</font> The people, of course, continue to vote; but the people are losing their
  power. Money and organization tell more and more in elections. In some sections
  bribery has become chronic, and numbers of voters expect regularly to sell
  their votes. In some sections large employers regularly bulldoze their hands
  into voting as they wish. In municipal, State and Federal politics the power
  of the &quot;machine&quot; is increasing. In many places it has become so strong
  that the ordinary citizen has no more influence in the government under which
  he lives than he would have in China. He is, in reality, not one of the governing
  classes, but one of the governed. He occasionally, in disgust, votes for &quot;the
  other man,&quot; or &quot;the other party;&quot; but, generally, to find that
  he has effected only a change of masters, or secured the same masters under
  different names. And he is beginning to accept the situation, and to leave
  politics to politicians, as something with which an honest, self-respecting
  man cannot afford to meddle.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15]</font> We are steadily differentiating a governing class, or rather a class
  of Pretorians, who make a business of gaining political power and then selling
  it. The type of the rising party leader is not the orator or statesman of an
  earlier day, but the shrewd manager, who knows how to handle the workers, how
  to combine pecuniary interests, how to obtain money and to spend it, how to
  gather to himself followers and to secure their allegiance. One party machine
  is becoming complementary to the other party machine, the politicians, like
  the railroad managers, having discovered that combination pays better than
  competition. So rings are made impregnable and great pecuniary interests secure
  their ends no matter how elections go. There are sovereign States so completely
  in the hands of rings and corporations that it seems as if nothing short of
  a revolutionary uprising of the people could dispossess them. Indeed, whether
  the General Government has not already passed beyond popular control may be
  doubted. Certain it is that possession of the General Government has for some
  time past secured possession. And for one term, at least, the Presidential
  chair has been occupied by a man not elected to it. This, of course, was largely
  due to the crookedness of the man who was elected, and to the lack of principle
  in his supporters. Nevertheless, it occurred.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16]</font> As for the great railroad managers, they may well say, &quot;The people
  be d--d!&quot; When they want the power of the people they buy the people's
  masters. The map of the United States is colored to show States and Territories.
  A map of real political powers would ignore State lines. Here would be a big
  patch representing the domains of Vanderbilt; there Jay Gould's dominions would
  be brightly marked. In another place would be set off the empire of Stanford
  and Huntington; in another the newer empire of Henry Villard. The States and
  parts of States that own the sway of the Pennsylvania Central would be distinguished
  from those ruled by the Baltimore and Ohio; and so on. In our National Senate,
  sovereign members of the Union are supposed to be represented; but what are
  more truly represented are railroad kings and great moneyed interests, though
  occasionally a jobber from Nevada or Colorado, not inimical to the ruling
  powers, is suffered to buy himself a seat for glory. And the Bench as well
  as the Senate is being filled with corporation henchmen. A railroad king makes
  his attorney a judge of last resort, as the great lord used to make his chaplain
  a bishop.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>We do not get even cheap government. We might keep a royal family, house
  them in palaces like Versailles or Sans Souci, provide them with courts and
  guards, masters of robes and rangers of parks, let them give balls more costly
  than Mrs. Vanderbilt's, and build yachts finer than Jay Gould's, for much less
  than is wasted and stolen under our nominal government of the people. What
  a noble income would be that of a Duke of New York, a Marquis of Philadelphia,
  or a Count of San Francisco, who would administer the government of these municipalities
  for fifty per cent. of present waste and stealage! Unless we got an esthetic
  Chinook, where could we get an absolute ruler who would erect such a monument
  of extravagant vulgarity as the new Capitol of the State of New York? While,
  as we saw in the Congress just adjourned, the benevolent gentlemen whose desire
  it is to protect us against the pauper labor of Europe quarrel over their respective
  shares of the spoil with as little regard for the taxpayer as a pirate crew
  would have for the consignees of a captured vessel.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18]</font> The people are largely conscious of all this, and there is among the
  masses much dissatisfaction. But there is a lack of that intelligent interest
  necessary to adapt political organization to changing conditions. The popular
  idea of reform seems to be merely a change of men or a change of parties, not
  a change of system. Political children, we attribute to bad men or wicked parties
  what really springs from deep general causes. Our two great political parties
  have really nothing more to propose than the keeping or the taking of the offices
  from the other party. On their outskirts are the Greenbackers, who, with a
  more or less definite idea of what they want to do with the currency, represent
  vague social dissatisfaction; civil service reformers, who hope to accomplish
  a political reform while keeping it out of politics; and anti-monopolists,
  who propose to tie up locomotives with packthread. Even the labor organizations
  seem to fear to go further in their platforms than some such propositions as
  eight-hour laws, bureaus of labor statistics, mechanics' liens, and prohibition
  of prison contracts.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19]</font> All this shows want of grasp and timidity of thought. It is not by accident
  that government grows corrupt and passes out of the hands of the people. If
  we would really make and continue this a government of the people, for the
  people and by the people, we must give to our politics earnest attention; we
  must be prepared to review our opinions, to give up old ideas and to accept
  new ones. We must abandon prejudice, and make our reckoning with free minds.
  The sailor, who, no matter how the wind might change, should persist in keeping
  his vessel under the same sail and on the same tack, would never reach his
  haven. </p>
