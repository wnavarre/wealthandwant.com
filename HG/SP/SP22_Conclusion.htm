<p align="center"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 21 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
(1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> HERE, it seems to me, is the gist and meaning of the great social problems
  of our time: More is given to us than to any people at any time before; and,
  therefore, more is required of us. We have made, and still are making, enormous
  advances on material lines. It is necessary that we commensurately advance
  on moral lines. Civilization, as it progresses, requires a higher conscience,
  a keener sense of justice, a warmer brotherhood, a wider, loftier, truer public
  spirit. Falling these, civilization must pass into destruction. It cannot be
  maintained on the ethics of savagery. For civilization knits men more and more
  closely together, and constantly tends to subordinate the individual to the
  whole, and to make more and more important social conditions.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> The social and political problems that confront us are darker than they
  realize who have not given thought to them; yet their solution is a mere matter
  of the proper adjustment of social forces. Man masters material nature studying
  her laws, and in conditions and powers that seemed most forbidding, has already
  found his richest storehouses and most powerful servants. Although we have
  but begun to systematize our knowledge of physical nature, it is evident she
  will refuse us no desire if we but seek its gratification in accordance with
  her laws.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[03] </font>And that faculty of adapting means to ends which has enabled man to convert
  the once impassable ocean into his highway, to transport himself with a speed
  which leaves the swallow behind, to annihilate space in the communication of
  his thoughts, to convert the rocks into warmth and light and power and material
  for a thousand uses, to weigh the stars and analyze the sun, to make ice under
  the equator, and bid flowers bloom in Northern winters, will also, if he will
  use it, enable him to overcome social difficulties and avoid social dangers.
  The domain of law is not confined to physical nature. It just as certainly
  embraces the mental and moral universe, and social growth and social life have
  their laws as fixed as those of matter and of motion. Would we make social
  life healthy and happy, we must discover those laws, and seek our ends in accordance
  with them.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04]</font> I ask no one who may read this book to accept my views. I ask him to
  think for himself.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>Whoever, laying aside prejudice and self-interest, will honestly and
  carefully make up his own mind as to the causes and the cure of the social
  evils that are so apparent, does, in that, the most important thing in his
  power toward their removal. This primary obligation devolves upon us individually,
  as citizens and as men. Whatever else we may be able to do, this must come
  first. For &quot;if the blind lead the blind, they both shall fall into the
  ditch.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06]</font> Social reform is not to be secured by noise and shouting; by complaints
  and denunciation; by the formation of parties, or the making of revolutions;
  but by the awakening of thought and the progress of ideas. Until there be correct
  thought, there cannot be right action; and when there is correct thought, right
  action will follow. Power is always in the hands of the masses of men. What
  oppresses the masses is their own ignorance, their own short-sighted selfishness.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> The great work of the present for every man, and
  every organization of men, who would improve social conditions, is the work
  of education &#8212; the propagation
  of ideas. It is only as it aids this that anything else can avail. And in this
  work every one who can think may aid &#8212; first by forming clear ideas
  himself, and then by endeavoring to arouse the thought of those with whom he
  comes in
  contact.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> Many there are, too depressed, too embruted with hard toil and the struggle
  for animal existence, to think for themselves. Therefore the obligation devolves
  with all the more force on those who can. If thinking men are few, they are
  for that reason all the more powerful. Let no man imagine that he has no influence.
  Whoever he may be, and wherever he may be placed, the man who, thinks becomes
  a light and a power. That for every idle word men may speak they shall give
  an account at the day of judgment, seems a hard saying. But what more clear
  than that the theory of the persistence of force, which teaches us that every
  movement continues to act and react, must apply as well to the universe of
  mind as to that of matter? Whoever becomes imbued with a noble idea kindles
  a flame from which other torches are lit, and influences those with whom he
  comes in contact, be they few or many. How far that influence, thus perpetuated,
  may extend, it is not given to him here to see. But it may be that the Lord
  of the Vineyard will know.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> As I said in the first of these chapters, the progress of civilization
  necessitates the giving of greater and greater attention and intelligence to
  public affairs. And for this reason I am convinced that we make a great mistake
  in depriving one sex of voice in public matters, and that we could in no way
  so increase the attention, the intelligence and the devotion which may be brought
  to the solution of social problems as by enfranchising our women. Even if in
  a ruder state of society the intelligence of one sex suffices for the management
  of common interests, the vastly more intricate, more delicate and more important
  questions which the progress of civilization makes of public moment, require
  the intelligence of women as of men, and that we never can obtain until we
  interest them in public affairs. And I have come to believe that very much
  of the inattention, the flippancy, the want of conscience, which we see manifested
  in regard to public matters of the greatest moment, arises from the fact that
  we debar our women from taking their proper part in these matters. Nothing
  will fully interest men unless it also interests women. There are those who
  say that women are less intelligent than men; but who will say that they are
  less influential?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10]</font> And I am firmly convinced, as I have already said, that to effect any
  great social improvement, it is sympathy rather than self-interest, the sense
  of duty rather than the desire for self-advancement, that must be appealed
  to. Envy is akin to admiration, and it is the admiration that the rich and
  powerful excite which secures the perpetuation of aristocracies. Where tenpenny
  Jack looks with contempt upon ninepenny Joe, the social injustice which makes
  the masses of the people hewers of wood and drawers of water for a privileged
  few, has the strongest bulwarks. It is told of a certain Florentine agitator
  that when he had received a new pair of boots, he concluded that all popular
  grievances were satisfied. How often do we see this story illustrated anew
  in working-men's movements and trade-union struggles? This is the weakness
  of all movements that appeal only to self-interest.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>And as man is so constituted that it is utterly impossible for him to
  attain happiness save by seeking the happiness of others, so does it seem to
  be of the nature of things that individuals and classes can obtain their own
  just rights only by struggling for the rights of others. To illustrate: When
  workmen in any trade form a trades-union, they gain, by subordinating the individual
  interests of each to the common interests of all, the power of making better
  terms with employers. But this power goes only a little way when the combination
  of the trades-union is met and checked by the pressure for employment of those
  outside its limits. No combination of workmen can raise their own wages much
  above the level of ordinary wages. The attempt to do so is like the attempt
  to bail out a boat without stopping up the seams. For this reason, it is necessary,
  if workmen would accomplish anything real and permanent for themselves, not
  merely that each trade should seek the common interests of all trades, but
  that skilled workmen should address themselves to those general measures which
  will improve the condition of unskilled workmen. Those who are most to be considered,
  those for whose help the struggle must be made, if labor is to be enfranchised,
  and social justice won, are those least able to help or struggle for themselves,
  those who have no advantage of property or skill or intelligence,&#8212;  the men and women who are at the very bottom of the social scale. In securing
  the equal
  rights of these we shall secure the equal rights of all.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Hence it is, as Mazzini said, that it is around the standard of duty
  rather than around the standard of self-interest that men must rally to win
  the rights of man. And herein may we see the deep philosophy of Him who bade
  men love their neighbors as themselves.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13]</font> In that spirit, and in no other, is the power to solve social problems
  and carry civilization onward. </p>
