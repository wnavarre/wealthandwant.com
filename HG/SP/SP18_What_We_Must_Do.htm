<p align="center"><strong>What We Must Do</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 18 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by
  Henry George
(1883)</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> AT the risk of repetition let me recapitulate:</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> The main source of the difficulties that menace us is the growing inequality
  in the distribution of wealth. To this all modern inventions seem to contribute,
  and the movement is hastened by political corruption, and by special monopolies
  established by abuse of legislative power. But the primary cause lies evidently
  in fundamental social adjustments &#8212; in the relations which we have established
  between labor and the natural material and means of labor &#8212; between
  man and the planet which is his dwelling-place, workshop and storehouse. As
  the earth
  must be the foundation of every material structure, so institutions which regulate
  the use of land constitute the foundation of every social organization, and
  must affect the whole character and development of that organization. In a
  society where the equality of natural rights is recognized, it is manifest
  that there can be no great disparity in fortunes. None except the physically
  incapacitated will be dependent on others; none will be forced to sell their
  labor to others. There will be differences in wealth, for there are differences
  among men as to energy, skill, prudence, foresight and industry; but there
  can be no very rich class, and no very poor class; and, as each generation
  becomes possessed of equal natural opportunities, whatever differences in fortune
  grow up in one generation will not tend to perpetuate themselves. In such a
  community, whatever may be its form, the political organization must be essentially
  democratic.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03]</font> But, in a community where the soil is treated
  as the property of but a portion of the people, some of these people from the
  very day of their birth
  must be at a disadvantage, and some will have an enormous advantage. Those
  who have no rights in the land will be forced to sell their labor to the landholders
  for what they can get; and, in fact, cannot live without the landlords' permission.
  Such a community must inevitably develop a class of masters and a class of
  serfs &#8212; a class possessing great wealth, and a class having nothing;
  and its political organization, no matter what its form, must become a virtual
  despotism.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>Our fundamental mistake is in treating land as private property. On this
  false basis modern civilization everywhere rests, and hence, as material progress
  goes on, is everywhere developing such monstrous inequalities in condition
  as must ultimately destroy it. As without land man cannot exist; as his very
  physical substance, and all that he can acquire or make, must be drawn from
  the land, the ownership of the land of a country is necessarily the ownership
  of the people of that country &#8212; involving their industrial, social and
  political subjection. Here is the great reason why the labor-saving inventions,
  of which
  our century has been so strikingly prolific, have signally failed to improve
  the condition of laborers. Labor-saving inventions primarily increase the power
  of labor, and should, therefore, increase wages and improve the condition of
  the laboring-classes. But this only where land is free to labor; for labor
  cannot exert itself without land. No labor-saving inventions can enable us
  to make something out of nothing, or in any wise lessen our dependence upon
  land. They can merely add to the efficiency of labor in working up the raw
  materials drawn from land. Therefore, wherever land has been subjected to private
  ownership, the ultimate effect of labor-saving inventions, and of all improved
  processes and discoveries, is to enable landowners to demand, and labor to
  pay, more for the use of land. Land becomes more valuable, but the wages of
  labor do not increase; on the contrary, if there is any margin for possible
  reductions, they may be absolutely reduced.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>This we already see, and that in spite of the fact that a very important
  part of the effect of modern invention has been, by the improvement of transportation,
  to open up new land. What will be the effect of continued improvement in industrial
  processes when the land of this continent is all &quot;fenced in&quot; as in
  a few more years it will be, we may imagine if we consider what would have
  been the effect of labor-saving inventions upon Europe had no New World been
  opened.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06]</font> But it may be said that, in asserting that where land is private property
  the benefit of industrial improvements goes ultimately to landowners, I ignore
  facts, and attribute to one principle more importance than is its due, since
  it is clear that a great deal of the increased wealth arising from modern improvements
  has not gone to the owners of land, but to capitalists, manufacturers, speculators,
  railroad-owners, and the holders of other monopolies than that of land. It
  may be pointed out that the richest family in Europe are the Rothschilds, who
  are more loan-jobbers and bankers than landowners; that the richest in America
  are the Vanderbilts, and not the Astors; that Jay Gould got his money, not
  by securing land, but by bulling and bearing the stock-market, by robbing people
  with hired lawyers and purchased judges and corrupted legislatures, I may be
  asked if I attach no importance to the jobbery and robbery of the tariff, under
  pretense of &quot;protecting American labor;&quot; to the jugglery with the
  monetary system, from the wildcat State banks and national banking system down
  to the trade-dollar swindle?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> In previous chapters I have given answers to all such objections; but
  to repeat in concise form, my reply is, that I do not ignore any of these things,
  but that they in no wise invalidate the self-evident principle that land being
  private property, the ultimate benefit of all improvements in production must
  go to the landowners. To say that if a man continues to play at rondo the table
  will ultimately get his money, is not to say that in the meantime he may not
  have his pocket picked. Let me illustrate:</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> Suppose an island, the soil of which is conceded to be the property of
  a few of the inhabitants. The rest of the inhabitants of this island must either
  hire land of these landowners, paying rent for it, or sell their labor to them,
  receiving wages. As population increases, the competition between the non-landowners
  for employment or the means of employment must increase rent and decrease wages
  until the non-landowners get merely a bare living, and the landholders get
  all the rest of the produce of the island. Now, suppose any improvement or
  invention made which will increase the efficiency of labor, it is manifest
  that, as soon as it becomes general, the competition between the non-landholders
  must give to the landholders all the benefit. No matter how great the improvement
  be, it can have but this ultimate result. If the improvements are so great
  that all the wealth the island can produce or that the landowners care for
  can be obtained with one-half the labor, they can let the other half of the
  laborers starve or evict them into the sea; or if they are pious people of
  the conventional sort, who believe that God Almighty intended these laborers
  to live, though he did not provide any land for them to live on, they may support
  them as paupers or ship them off to some other country as the English government
  is shipping the &quot;surplus&quot; Irishmen. But whether they let them die
  or keep them alive, they would have no use for them, and, if improvement still
  went on they would have use for less and less of them.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> This is the general principle.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>But in addition to this population of landowners and their tenants and
  laborers, let us suppose there are on the island a storekeeper, an inventor,
  a gambler and a pirate. To make our supposition conform to modern fashion,
  we will suppose a highly respectable gambler &#8212; one of the kind who endows
  colleges and subscribes to the conversion of the heathen &#8212; and a very
  gentlemanly pirate, who flies on his swift cruiser the ensign of a yacht club
  instead of
  the old rawhead and bloody-bones, but who, even more regularly and efficiently
  than the old-fashioned pirate, levies his toll.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11]</font> Let us suppose the storekeeper, the gambler and the pirate well established
  in business and making money. Along comes the inventor, and says: &quot;I have
  an invention which will greatly add to the efficiency of labor and enable you
  greatly to increase the produce of this island, so that there will be very
  much more to divide among you all; but, as a condition for telling you of it,
  I want you to agree that I shall have a royalty upon its use.&quot; This is
  agreed to, the invention is adopted, and does greatly increase the production
  of wealth. But it does not benefit the laborers. The competition between them
  still forces them to pay such high rent or take such low wages that they are
  no better off than before. They still barely live. But the whole benefit of
  the invention does not in this case go to the landowners. The inventor's royalty
  gives him a great income, while the storekeeper, the gambler and the pirate
  all find their incomes much increased. The incomes of each one of these four,
  we may readily suppose, are larger than any single one of the landowners, and
  their gains offer the most striking contrast to the poverty of the laborers,
  who are bitterly disappointed at not getting any share of the increased wealth
  that followed the improvement. Something they feel is wrong, and some among
  them even begin to murmur that the Creator of the island surely did not make
  it for the benefit of only a few of its inhabitants, and that, as the common
  creatures of the Creator, they, too, have some rights to the use of the soil
  of the island.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12] </font>Suppose then some one to arise and say: &quot;What
  is the use of discussing such abstractions as the land question, that cannot
  come into practical politics
  for many a day, and that can only excite dissension and general unpleasantness,
  and that, moreover, savor of communism, which as you laborers, who have nothing
  but your few rags, very well know is a highly wicked and dangerous thing, meaning
  the robbery of widow women and orphans, and being opposed to religion! Let
  us be practical. You laborers are poor and can scarcely get a living, because
  you are swindled by the storekeeper, taxed by the inventor, gouged by the gambler
  and robbed by the pirate. Landholders and non-landholders, our interests are
  in common as against these vampires. Let us unite to stop their exactions.
  The storekeeper makes a profit of from ten to fifty per cent. on all that he
  sells. Let us form a cooperative society, which will sell everything
  at cost and enable laborers to get rich by saving the storekeeper's profit
  on all that they use. As for the inventor, he has been already well enough
  paid. Let us stop his royalty, and there will be so much more to divide between
  the landowners and the non-landowners. As for the gambler and the pirate, let
  us put a summary end to their proceedings and drive them off the island!&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13]</font> Let us imagine a roar of applause, and these propositions carried out.
  What then? Then the landowners would become so much the richer. The laborers
  would gain nothing, unless it might be in a clearer apprehension of the ultimate
  cause of their poverty. For although, by getting rid of the storekeeper, the
  laborers might be able to live cheaper, the competition between them would
  soon force them to give up this advantage to the landowners by taking lower
  wages or giving higher rents. And so the elimination of the inventor's royalty,
  and of the pickings and stealings of the gambler and pirate, would only make
  land more valuable and increase the incomes of the landholders. The saving
  made by getting rid of the storekeeper, inventor, gambler and pirate would
  accrue to their benefit, as did the increase in production from the application
  of the invention.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>That all this is true we may see, as I have shown. The growth of the
  railroad system has, for instance, resulted in putting almost the whole transportation
  business of the country in the hands of giant monopolies, who, for the most
  part, charge &quot;what the traffic will bear,&quot; and who frequently discriminate
  in the most outrageous way against localities. The effect where this is done,
  as is alleged in the complaints that are made, is to reduce the price of land.
  And all this might be remedied, without raising wages or improving the condition
  of labor. It would only make land more valuable &#8212; that is to say, in
  consideration of the saving effected in transportation, labor would have to
  pay a higher
  premium for land.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>So with all monopolies, and their name is legion. If all monopolies,
  save the monopoly of land, were abolished; if, even, by means of co&brvbar;perative
  societies, or other devices, the profits of exchange were saved, and goods
  passed from producer to consumer at the minimum of cost; if government were
  reformed to the point of absolute purity and economy, nothing whatever would
  be done toward equalization in the distribution of wealth. The competition
  between laborers, who, having no rights in the land, cannot work without some
  one else's permission, would increase the value of land, and force wages to
  the point of bare subsistence.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16]</font> Let me not be misunderstood. I do not say that in the recognition of
  the equal and unalienable right of each human being to the natural elements
  from which life must be supported and wants satisfied, lies the solution of
  all social problems. I fully recognize the fact that even after we do this,
  much will remain to do. We might recognize the equal right to land, and yet
  tyranny and spoliation be continued. But whatever else we do, so long as we
  fail to recognize the equal right to the elements of nature, nothing will avail
  to remedy that unnatural inequality in the distribution of wealth which is
  fraught with so much evil and danger. Reform as we may, until we make this
  fundamental reform our material progress can but tend to differentiate our
  people into the monstrously rich and the frightfully poor. Whatever be the
  increase of wealth, the masses will still be ground toward the point of bare
  subsistence &#8212; we must still have our great criminal classes, our paupers
  and our tramps, men and women driven to degradation and desperation from inability
  to make an honest living. </p>
