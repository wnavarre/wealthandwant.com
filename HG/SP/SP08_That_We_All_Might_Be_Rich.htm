<p align="center"><strong>That We All Might Be Rich</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 8 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George (1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>THE terms rich and poor are of course frequently used in a relative sense.
  Among Irish peasants, kept on the verge of starvation by the tribute wrung
  from them to maintain the luxury of absentee landlords in London or Paris, &quot;the
  woman of three cows&quot; will be looked on as rich, while in the society of
  millionaires a man with only $500,000 will be regarded as poor. Now, we cannot,
  of course, all be rich in the sense of having more than others; but when people
  say, as they so often do, that we cannot all be rich, or when they say that
  we must always have the poor with us, they do not use the words in this comparative
  sense. They mean by the rich those who have enough, or more than enough, wealth
  to gratify all reasonable wants, and by the poor those who have not.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02] </font>Now, using the words in this sense, I join issue with those who say that
  we cannot all be rich; with those who declare that in human society the poor
  must always exist. I do not, of course, mean that we all might have an array
  of servants; that we all might outshine each other in dress, in equipage, in
  the lavishness of our balls or dinners, in the magnificence of our houses.
  That would be a contradiction in terms. What I mean is, that we all might have
  leisure, comfort and abundance, not merely of the necessaries, but even of
  what are now esteemed the elegancies and luxuries of life. I do not mean to
  say that absolute equality could be had, or would be desirable. I do not mean
  to say that we could all have, or would want, the same quantity of all the
  different forms of wealth. But I do mean to say that we might all have enough
  wealth to satisfy reasonable desires; that we might all have so much of the
  material things we now struggle for, that no one would want to rob or swindle
  his neighbor; that no one would worry all day, or lie awake at nights, fearing
  he might be brought to poverty, or thinking how he might acquire wealth.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>Does this seem an utopian dream? What would people of fifty years ago
  have thought of one who would have told them that it was possible to sew by
  steam-power; to cross the Atlantic in six days, or the continent in three;
  to have a message sent from London at noon delivered in Boston three hours
  before noon; to hear in New York the voice of a man talking in Chicago?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>Did you ever see a pail of swill given to a pen of hungry hogs? That
  is human society as it is.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> Did you ever see a company of well-bred men and women sitting down to
  a good dinner, without scrambling, or jostling, or gluttony, each, knowing
  that his own appetite will be satisfied, deferring to and helping the others?
  That is human society as it might be.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>&quot;Devil catch the hindmost&quot; is the motto of our so-called civilized
  society today. We learn early to &quot;take care of No.1,&quot; lest No.1
  should suffer; we learn early to grasp from others that we may not want ourselves.
  The fear of poverty makes us admire great wealth; and so habits of greed are
  formed, and we behold the pitiable spectacle of men who have already more than
  they can by any possibility use, toiling, striving, grasping to add to their
  store up to the very verge of the grave &#8212; that grave which, whatever
  else it may mean, does certainly mean the parting with all earthly possessions
  however
  great they be.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>In vain, in gorgeous churches, on the appointed Sunday, is the parable
  of Dives and Lazarus read. What can it mean in churches where Dives would be
  welcomed and Lazarus shown the door? In vain may the preacher preach of the
  vanity of riches, while poverty engulfs the hindmost. But the mad struggle
  would cease when the fear of poverty had vanished. Then, and not till then,
  will a truly Christian civilization become possible.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> And may not this be?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>We are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced countries
  we regard it as the natural lot of the great masses of the people; that we
  take it as a matter of course that even in our highest civilization large classes
  should want the necessaries of healthful life, and the vast majority should
  only get a poor and pinched living by the hardest toll. There are professors
  of political economy who teach that this condition of things is the result
  of social laws of which it is idle to complain! There are ministers of religion
  who preach that this is the condition which an all-wise, all-powerful Creator
  intended for his children! If an architect were to build a theater so that
  not more than one-tenth of the audience could see and hear, we would call him
  a bungler and a botch. If a man were to give a feast and provide so little
  food that nine tenths of his guests must go away hungry, we would call him
  a fool, or worse. Yet so accustomed are we to poverty, that even the preachers
  of what passes for Christianity tell us that the great Architect of the Universe,
  to whose infinite skill all nature testifies, has made such a botch job of
  this world that the vast majority of the human creatures whom he has called
  into it are condemned by the conditions he has imposed to want, suffering,
  and brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity for the development of mental
  powers &#8212; must pass their lives in a hard struggle to merely live!</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>Yet who can look about him without seeing that to whatever cause poverty
  may be due, it is not due to the niggardliness of nature; without seeing that
  it is blindness or blasphemy to assume that the Creator has condemned the masses
  of men to hard toil for a bare living?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11]</font> If some men have not enough to live decently, do not others have far
  more than they really need? If there is not wealth sufficient to go around,
  giving every one abundance, is it because we have reached the limit of the
  production of wealth? Is our land all in use? is our labor all employed? is
  our capital all utilized? On the contrary, in whatever direction we look we
  see the most stupendous waste of productive forces &#8212; of productive forces
  so potent that were they permitted to play freely the production of wealth
  would be so enormous that there would be more than a sufficiency for all. What
  branch of production is there in which the limit of production has been reached?
  What single article of wealth is there of which we might not produce enormously
  more?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12] </font>If the mass of the population of New York are jammed into the fever-breeding
  rooms of tenement houses, it is not because there are not vacant lots enough
  in and around New York to give each family space for a separate home. If settlers
  are going into Montana and Dakota and Manitoba, it is not because there are
  not vast areas of untilled land much nearer the centers of population. If farmers
  are paying one-fourth, one-third, or even one-half their crops for the privilege
  of getting land to cultivate, it is not because there are not, even in our
  oldest States, great quantities of land which no one is cultivating.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13]</font> So true is it that poverty does not come from
  the inability to produce more wealth that from every side we hear that the
  power to produce is in excess
  of the ability to find a market; that the constant fear seems to be not that
  too little, but that too much, will be produced! Do we not maintain a high
  tariff, and keep at every port a horde of Custom-House officers, for fear the
  people of other countries will overwhelm us with their goods? Is not a great
  part of our machinery constantly idle? Are there not, even in what we call
  good times, an immense number of unemployed men who would gladly be at work
  producing wealth if they could only get the opportunity? Do we not, even now,
  hear, from every side, of embarrassment from the very excess of productive
  power, and of combinations to reduce production? Coal operators band together
  to limit their output; iron-works have shut down, or are running on half-time;
  distillers have agreed to limit their production to one-half their capacity,
  and sugar-refiners to sixty percent; paper-mills are suspending for one,
  two or three days a week; the gunny-cloth manufacturers, at a recent meeting,
  agreed to close their mills until the present overstock on the market is greatly
  reduced; many other manufacturers have done the same thing. The shoemaking
  machinery of New England can, in six months' full running, it is said, supply
  the whole demand of the United States for twelve months; the machinery for
  making rubber goods can turn out twice as much as the market will take.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>This seeming glut of production, this seeming excess of productive power,
  runs through all branches of industry, and is evident all over the civilized
  world. From black berries, bananas or apples, to ocean steamships or plate-glass
  mirrors, there is scarcely an article of human comfort or convenience that
  could not be produced in very much greater quantities than now without lessening
  the production of anything else.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>So evident is this that many people think and talk and write as though
  the trouble is that there is not work enough to go around. We are in constant
  fear that other nations may do for us some of the work we might do for ourselves,
  and, to prevent them, guard ourselves with a tariff. We laud as public benefactors
  those who, as we say, &quot;furnish employment.&quot; We are constantly talking
  as though this &quot;furnishing of employment,&quot; this &quot;giving of work,&quot; were
  the greatest boon that could be conferred upon society. To listen to much that
  is talked and much that is written, one would think that the cause of poverty
  is that there is not work enough for so many people, and that if the Creator
  had made the rock harder, the soil less fertile, iron as scarce as gold, and
  gold as diamonds; or if ships would sink and cities burn down oftener, there
  would be less poverty, because there would be more work to do.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>The Lord Mayor of London tells a deputation of
  unemployed working-men that there is no demand for their labor, and that the
  only resource for them
  is to go to the poorhouse or emigrate. The English government is shipping from
  Ireland able-bodied men and women to avoid maintaining them as paupers. Even
  in our own land there are at all times large numbers, and in hard times vast
  numbers, earnestly seeking work &#8212; the opportunity to give labor for
  the things produced by labor.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>Perhaps nothing shows more clearly the enormous forces of production
  constantly going to waste than the fact that the most prosperous time in all
  branches of business that this country has known was during the civil war,
  when we were maintaining great fleets and armies, and millions of our industrial
  population were engaged in supplying them with wealth for unproductive consumption
  or for reckless destruction. It is idle to talk about the fictitious prosperity
  of those &quot;flush&quot; times. The masses of the people lived better, dressed
  better, found it easier to get a living, and had more luxuries and amusements
  than in normal times. There was more real, tangible wealth in the North at
  the close than at the beginning of the war. Nor was it the great issue of paper
  money, nor the creation of the debt, which caused this prosperity. The government
  presses struck off promises to pay; they could not print ships, cannon, arms,
  tools, food and clothing. Nor did we borrow these things from other countries
  or &quot;from posterity.&quot; Our bonds did not begin to go to Europe until
  the close of the war, and the people of one generation can no more borrow from
  the people of a subsequent generation than we who live on this planet can borrow
  from the inhabitants of another planet or another solar system. The wealth
  consumed and destroyed by our fleets and armies came from the then existing
  stock of wealth. We could have carried on the war without the issue of a single
  bond, if, when we did not shrink from taking from wife and children their only
  bread-winner, we had not shrunk from taking the wealth of the rich.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18] </font>Our armies and fleets were maintained, the enormous unproductive and
  destructive use of wealth was kept up, by the labor and capital then and there
  engaged in production. And it was that the demand caused by the war stimulated
  productive forces into activity that the enormous drain of the war was not
  only supplied, but that the North grew richer. The waste of labor in marching
  and countermarching, in digging trenches, throwing up earthworks, and fighting
  battles, the waste of wealth consumed or destroyed by our armies and fleets,
  did not amount to as much as the waste constantly going on from unemployed
  labor and idle or partially used machinery.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19] </font>It is evident that this enormous waste of productive power is due, not
  to defects in the laws of nature, but to social maladjustments which deny to
  labor access to the natural opportunities of labor and rob the laborer of his
  just reward. Evidently the glut of markets does not really come from over-production
  when there are so many who want the things which are said to be over-produced.
  and would gladly exchange their labor for them did they have opportunity. Every
  day passed in enforced idleness by a laborer who would gladly be at work could
  he find opportunity, means so much less in the fund which creates the effective
  demand for other labor; every time wages are screwed down means so much reduction
  in the purchasing power of the workmen whose incomes are thus reduced. The
  paralysis which at all times wastes productive power, and which in times of
  industrial depression causes more loss than a great war, springs from the difficulty
  which those who would gladly satisfy their wants by their labor find in doing
  so. It cannot come from any natural limitation, so long as human desires remain
  unsatisfied, and nature yet offers to man the raw material of wealth. It must
  come from social maladjustments which permit the monopolization of these natural
  opportunities, and which rob labor of its fair reward.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20] </font>What these maladjustments are I shall in subsequent chapters endeavor
  to show. In this I wish simply to call attention to the fact that productive
  power in such a state of civilization as ours is sufficient, did we give it
  play, to so enormously increase the production of wealth as to give abundance
  to all &#8212; to point out that the cause of poverty is not in natural limitations,
  which we cannot alter, but in inequalities and injustices of distribution entirely
  within our control.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>The passenger who leaves New York on a trans-Atlantic steamer does not
  fear that the provisions will give out. The men who run these steamers do not
  send them to sea without provisions enough for all they carry. Did He who made
  this whirling planet for our sojourn lack the forethought of man? Not so. In
  soil and sunshine, in vegetable and animal life, in veins of minerals, and
  in pulsing forces which we are only beginning to use, are capabilities which
  we cannot exhaust &#8212; materials and powers from which human effort, guided
  by intelligence, may gratify every material want of every human creature. There
  is in nature no reason for poverty &#8212; not even for the poverty of the
  crippled or the decrepit. For man is by nature a social animal, and the family
  affections
  and the social sympathies would, where chronic poverty did not distort and
  embrute, amply provide for those who could not provide for themselves.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22] </font>But if we will not use the intelligence with which we have been gifted
  to adapt social organization to natural laws &#8212; if we allow dogs in the
  manger to monopolize what they cannot use; if we allow strength and cunning
  to rob
  honest labor, we must have chronic poverty, and all the social evils it inevitably
  brings. Under such conditions there would be poverty in paradise.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23] </font>&quot;The poor ye have always with you.&quot; If ever a scripture has
  been wrested to the devil's service, this is that scripture. How often have
  these words been distorted from their obvious meaning to soothe conscience
  into acquiescence in human misery and degradation &#8212; to bolster that
  blasphemy, the very negation and denial of Christ's teachings, that the All-Wise
  and Most
  Merciful, the Infinite Father, has decreed that so many of his creatures must
  be poor in order that others of his creatures to whom he wills the good things
  of life should enjoy the pleasure and virtue of doling out alms! &quot;The
  poor ye have always with you,&quot; said Christ; but all his teachings supply
  the limitation, &quot;until the coming of the Kingdom.&quot; In that kingdom
  of God on earth, that kingdom of justice and love for which he taught his followers
  to strive and pray, there will be no poor. But though the faith and the hope
  and the striving for this kingdom are of the very essence of Christ's teaching,
  the staunchest disbelievers and revilers of its possibility are found among
  those who call themselves Christians. Queer ideas of the Divinity have some
  of these Christians who hold themselves orthodox and contribute to the conversion
  of the heathen. A very rich orthodox Christian said to a newspaper reporter,
  a while ago, on the completion of a large work out of which he is said to have
  made millions: &quot;We have been peculiarly favored by Divine Providence;
  iron never was so cheap before, and labor has been a drug in the market.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[24] </font>That in spite of all our great advances we have
  yet with us the poor, those who, without fault of their own, cannot get healthful
  and wholesome conditions
  of life, is our fault and our shame. Who that looks about him can fail to see
  that it is only the injustice that denies natural opportunities to labor, and
  robs the producer of the fruits of his toil, that prevents us all from being
  rich? Consider the enormous powers of production now going to waste; consider
  the great number of unproductive consumers maintained at the expense of producers
  &#8212;  the rich men and dudes, the worse than useless government officials,
  the pickpockets, burglars and confidence men; the highly respectable thieves
  who
  carry on their operations inside the law; the great army of lawyers; the beggars
  and paupers, and inmates of prisons; the monopolists and cornerers and gamblers
  of every kind and grade. Consider how much brains and energy and capital are
  devoted, not to the production of wealth, but to the grabbing of wealth. Consider
  the waste caused by competition which does not increase wealth; by laws which
  restrict production and exchange. Consider how human power is lessened by insufficient
  food, by unwholesome lodgings, by work done under conditions that produce disease
  and shorten life. Consider how intemperance and unthrift follow poverty. Consider
  how the ignorance bred of poverty lessens production, and how the vice bred
  of poverty causes destruction, and who can doubt that under conditions of social
  justice all might be rich?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[25]</font> The wealth-producing powers that would be evoked in a social state based
  on justice, where wealth went to the producers of wealth, and the banishment
  of poverty had banished the fear and greed and lusts that spring from it, we
  now can only faintly imagine. Wonderful as have been the discoveries and inventions
  of this century, it is evident that we have only begun to grasp that dominion
  which it is given to mind to obtain over matter. Discovery and invention are
  born of leisure, of material comfort, of freedom. These secured to all, and
  who shall say to what command over nature man may not attain?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[26]</font> It is not necessary that any one should be condemned
  to monotonous toil; it is not necessary that any one should lack the wealth
  and the leisure which
  permit the development of the faculties that raise man above the animal. Mind,
  not muscle, is the motor of progress, the force which compels nature and produces
  wealth. In turning men into machines we are wasting the highest powers. Already
  in our society there is a favored class who need take no thought for the morrow
  &#8212; what they shall eat, or what they shall drink, or wherewithal they
  shall be clothed. And may it not be that Christ was more than a dreamer when
  he told
  his disciples that in that kingdom of justice for which he taught them to work
  and pray this might be the condition of all? </p>
