<p align="center"><strong>Two Opposing Tendencies
</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 4 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
(1883)</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>SO much freer, so much higher, so much fuller and wider is the life of
  our time, that, looking back, we cannot help feeling something like pity, if
  not contempt, for preceding generations.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02] </font>Comforts, conveniences, luxuries, that a little while ago wealth could
  not purchase, are now matters of ordinary use. We travel in an hour, easily
  and comfortably, what to our fathers was a hard day's journey; we send in minutes
  messages that, in their time, would have taken weeks. We are better acquainted
  with remote countries than they with regions little distant; we know as common
  things what to them were fast locked secrets of nature; our world is larger,
  our horizon is wider; in the years of our lives we may see more, do more, learn
  more.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>Consider the diffusion of knowledge, the quickened
  transmission of intelligence. Compare the school-books used by our children
  with the school-books used by
  our fathers; see how cheap printing has brought within the reach of the masses
  the very treasures of literature; how enormously it has widened the audience
  of the novelist, the historian, the essayist and the poet; see how superior
  are even the trashy novels and story-papers in which shop-girls delight, to
  the rude ballads and &quot;last dying speeches and confessions,&quot; which
  were their prototypes. Look at the daily newspapers, read even by the poorest,
  and giving to them glimpses of the doings of all classes of society, news from
  all parts of the world. Consider the illustrated journals that every week bring
  to the million pictures of life in all phases and in all countries &#8212;  bird's-eye
  views of cities, of grand and beautiful landscapes; the features of noted men
  and women; the sittings of parliaments, and congresses, and conventions;
  the splendor of courts, and the wild life of savages; triumphs of art; glories
  of architecture; processes of industry; achievements of inventive skill. Such
  a panorama as thus, week after week, passes before the eyes of common men and
  women, the richest and most powerful could not a generation ago have commanded.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>These things, and the many other things that the mention of these will
  suggest, are necessarily exerting a powerful influence upon thought and feeling.
  Superstitions are dying out, prejudices are giving way, manners and customs
  are becoming assimilated, sympathies are widening, new aspirations are quickening
  the masses.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>We come into the world with minds ready to receive any impression. To
  the eyes of infancy all is new, and one thing is no more wonderful than another.
  In whatever lies beyond common experience we assume the beliefs of those about
  us, and it is only the strongest intellects that can in a little raise themselves
  above the accepted opinions of their times. In a community where that opinion
  prevailed, the vast majority of us would as unhesitatingly believe that the
  earth is a plain, supported by a gigantic elephant, as we now believe it a
  sphere circling round the sun. No theory is too false, no fable too absurd,
  no superstition too degrading for acceptance when it has become embedded in
  common belief. Men will submit themselves to tortures and to death, mothers
  will immolate their children, at the bidding of beliefs they thus accept. What
  more unnatural than polygamy! Yet see how long and how widely polygamy has
  existed!</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>In this tendency to accept what we find, to believe what we are told,
  is at once good and evil. It is this which makes social advance possible; it
  is this which makes it so slow and painful. Each generation thus obtains without
  effort the hard-won knowledge bequeathed to it; it is thus, also, enslaved
  by errors and perversions which it in the same way receives.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>It is thus that tyranny is maintained and superstition
  perpetuated. Polygamy is unnatural. Obvious facts of universal experience prove
  this. The uniform
  proportion in which the sexes are brought into the world; the exclusiveness
  of the feeling with which in healthy conditions they attract each other; the
  necessities imposed by the slow growth and development of children, point to
  the union of one man with one woman as the intent of Nature. Yet, although
  it is repugnant to the most obvious facts and to the strongest instincts, polygamy
  seems a perfectly natural thing to those educated in a society where it has
  become an accepted institution, and it is only by long effort and much struggling
  that this idea can be eradicated. So with slavery. Even to such minds as those
  of Plato and Aristotle, to own a man seemed as natural as to own a horse. Even
  in this nineteenth century and in this &quot;land of liberty,&quot; how long
  has it been since those who denied the right of property in human flesh and
  blood were denounced as &quot;communists,&quot; as &quot;infidels,&quot; as &quot;incendiaries,&quot; bent
  on uprooting social order and destroying all property rights! So with monarchy,
  so with aristocracy, so with many other things as unnatural that are still
  unquestioningly accepted. Can anything be more unnatural &#8212; that is to
  say, more repugnant to right reason and to the facts and laws of nature &#8212;  than
  that those who work least should get most of the things that work produces? &quot;He
  that will not work, neither shall he eat.&quot; That is not merely the word
  of the Apostle; it is the obvious law of nature. Yet all over the world, hard
  and poor is the fare of the toiling masses; while those who aid production
  neither with hand nor with head live luxuriously and fare sumptuously. This
  we have been used to, and it has therefore seemed to us natural; just as polygamy,
  slavery, aristocracy and monarchy seem natural to those accustomed to them.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> But mental habits which made this state of things seem natural are breaking
  up; superstitions which prevented its being questioned are melting away. The
  revelations of physical science, the increased knowledge of other times and
  other peoples, the extension of education, emigration, travel, the rise of
  the critical spirit and the changes in old methods everywhere going on, are
  destroying beliefs which made the masses of men content with the position of
  hewers of wood and drawers of water, are softening manners and widening sympathies,
  are extending the idea of human equality and brotherhood.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>All over the world the masses of men are becoming more and more dissatisfied
  with conditions under which their fathers would have been contented. It is
  in vain that they are told that their situation has been much improved; it
  is in vain that it is pointed out to them that comforts, amusements, opportunities,
  are within their reach that their fathers would not have dreamed of. The having
  got so much, only leads them to ask why they should not have more. Desire grows
  by what it feeds on. Man is not like the ox. He has no fixed standard of satisfaction.
  To arouse his ambition, to educate him to new wants, is as certain to make
  him discontented with his lot as to make that lot harder. We resign ourselves
  to what we think cannot be bettered; but when we realize that improvement is
  possible, then we become restive. This is the explanation of the paradox that
  De Tocqueville thought astonishing: that the masses find their position the
  more intolerable the more it is improved. The slave codes were wise that prescribed
  pains and penalties for teaching bondsmen to read, and they reasoned well who
  opposed popular education on the ground that it would bring revolution.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>But there is in the conditions of the civilized
  world today something more portentous than a growing restiveness under evils
  long endured. Everything
  tends to awake the sense of natural equality, to arouse the aspirations and
  ambitions of the masses, to excite a keener and keener perception of the gross
  injustice of existing inequalities of privilege and wealth. Yet, at the same
  time, everything tends to the rapid and monstrous increase of these inequalities.
  Never since great estates were eating out the heart of Rome has the world seen
  such enormous fortunes as are now arising &#8212;  and never more utter proletarians.
  In the paper which contained a many-column account of the Vanderbilt ball,
  with its gorgeous dresses and its wealth of diamonds, with its profusion of
  roses, costing $2 each, and its precious wines flowing like water, I also read
  a brief item telling how, at a station-house near by, thirty-nine persons &#8212;  eighteen
  of them women &#8212;  had sought shelter, and how they were all marched
  into court next morning and sent for six months to prison. &quot;The women,&quot; said
  the item, &quot;shrieked and sobbed bitterly as they were carried to prison.&quot; Christ
  was born of a woman. And to Mary Magdalen he turned in tender blessing. But
  such vermin have some of these human creatures, made in God's image, become,
  that we must shovel them off to prison without being too particular.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The railroad is a new thing. It has scarcely begun its work. Yet it has
  already differentiated the man who counts his income by millions every month,
  and the thousands of men glad to work for him at from 90 cents to $1.50 a day.
  Who shall set bounds, under present tendencies, to the great fortunes of the
  next generation? Or to the correlatives of these great fortunes, the tramps?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12] </font>The tendency of all the inventions and improvements so wonderfully augmenting
  productive power is to concentrate enormous wealth in the hands of a few, to
  make the condition of the many more hopeless to force into the position of
  machines for the production of wealth they are not to enjoy, men whose aspirations
  are being aroused. Without a single exception that I can think of, the effect
  of all modern industrial improvements is to production upon a large scale,
  to the minute division of labor, to the giving to the possession of large capital
  an overpowering advantage. Even such inventions as the telephone and the typewriter
  tend to the concentration of wealth, by adding to the ease with which large
  businesses can be managed, and lessening limitations that after a certain point
  made further extension more difficult.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>The tendency of the machine is in everything not merely to place it out
  of the power of the workman to become his own employer, but to reduce him to
  the position of a mere attendant or feeder; to dispense with judgment, skill
  and brains, save in a few overseers; to reduce all others to the monotonous
  work of automatons, to which there is no future save the same unvarying round.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>Under the old system of handicraft, the workman
  may have toiled hard and long, but in his work he had companionship, variety,
  the pleasure that
  comes of the exercise of creative skill, the sense of seeing things growing
  under his hand to finished form. He worked in his own home or side by side
  with his employer. Labor was lightened by emulation, by gossip, by laughter,
  by discussion. As apprentice, he looked forward to becoming a journeyman; as
  a journeyman, he looked forward to becoming a master and taking an apprentice
  of his own. With a few tools and a little raw material he was independent.
  He dealt directly with those who used the finished articles he produced. If
  he could not find a market for money he could find a market in exchange. That
  terrible dread &#8212; the dread of having the opportunities of livelihood
  shut off; of finding himself utterly helpless to provide for his family &#8212;  never
  cast its shadow over him.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>Consider the blacksmith of the industrial era now everywhere passing
  &#8212; or rather the &quot;black and white smith,&quot; for the finished workman
  worked in steel as well. The smithy stood by roadside or street. Through its
  open doors were caught glimpses of nature all that was passing could be seen.
  Wayfarers stopped to inquire, neighbors to tell or hear the news, children
  to see the hot iron glow and watch the red sparks fly. Now the smith shoed
  a horse; now he put on a wagon-tire; now he forged and tempered a tool; again
  he welded a broken andiron, or beat out with graceful art a crane for the deep
  chimney-place, or, when there was nothing else to do, he wrought iron into
  nails.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>Go now into one of those enormous establishments
  covering acres and acres, in which workmen by the thousand are massed together,
  and, by the aid of steam
  and machinery, iron is converted to its uses at a fraction of the cost of the
  old system. You cannot enter without permission from the office, for over each
  door you will find the sign, &quot;Positively no admittance.&quot; If you are
  permitted to go in, you must not talk to the workmen; but that makes little
  difference, as amid the din and the clatter, and whir of belts and wheels,
  you could not if you would. Here you find men doing over and over the selfsame
  thing &#8212;  passing, all day long, bars of iron through great rollers;
  presenting plates to steel jaws; turning, amid clangor in which you can scarcely &quot;hear
  yourself think,&quot; bits of iron over and back again, sixty times a minute,
  for hour after hour, for day after day, for year after year. In the whole great
  establishment there will be not a man, save here and there one who got his
  training under the simpler system now passing away, who can do more than some
  minute part of what goes to the making of a salable article. The lad learns
  in a little while how to attend his particular machine. Then his progress stops.
  He may become gray-headed without learning more. As his children grow, the
  only way he has of augmenting his income is by setting them to work. As for
  aspiring to become master of such an establishment, with its millions of capital
  in machinery and stock, he might as well aspire to be King of England or Pope
  of Rome. He has no more control over the conditions that give him employment
  than has the passenger in a railroad car over the motion of the train. Causes
  which he can neither prevent nor foresee may at any time stop his machine and
  throw him upon the world, an utterly unskilled laborer, unaccustomed even to
  swing a pick or handle a spade. When times are good, and his employer is coining
  money, he can only get an advance by a strike or a threatened strike. At the
  least symptoms of harder times his wages are scaled down, and he can only resist
  by a strike, which means, for a longer or shorter time, no wages.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>I have spoken of but one trade; but the tendency is the same in all others.
  This is the form that industrial organization is everywhere assuming, even
  in agriculture. Great corporations are now stocking immense ranges with cattle,
  and &quot;bonanza farms&quot; are cultivated by gangs of nomads destitute of
  anything that can be called home. In all occupations the workman is steadily
  becoming divorced from the tools and opportunities of labor; everywhere the
  inequalities of fortune are becoming more glaring. And this at a time when
  thought is being quickened; when the old forces of conservatism are giving
  way; when the idea of human equality is growing and spreading.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18] </font>When between those who work and want and those who live in idle luxury
  there is so great a gulf fixed that in popular imagination they seem to belong
  to distinct orders of beings; when, in the name of religion, it is persistently
  instilled into the masses that all things in this world are ordered by Divine
  Providence, which appoints to each his place; when children are taught from
  the earliest infancy that it is, to use the words of the Episcopal catechism,
  their duty toward God and man to &quot;honor and obey the civil authority,&quot; to &quot;order
  themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters, and to do their duty
  in that state of life unto which it shall please God to call them;&quot; when
  these counsels of humility, of contentment and of self-abasement are enforced
  by the terrible threat of an eternity of torture, while on the other hand the
  poor are taught to believe that if they patiently bear their lot here God will
  after death translate them to a heaven where there is no private property and
  no poverty, the most glaring inequalities in condition may excite neither envy
  nor indignation.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19] </font>But the ideas that are stirring in the world today
  are different from these.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20] </font>Near nineteen hundred years ago, when another civilization was developing
  monstrous inequalities, when the masses everywhere were being ground into hopeless
  slavery, there arose in a Jewish village an unlearned carpenter, who, scorning
  the orthodoxies and ritualisms of the time, preached to laborers and fishermen
  the gospel of the fatherhood of God, of the equality and brotherhood of men,
  who taught his disciples to pray for the coming of the kingdom of heaven on
  earth. The college professors sneered at him, the orthodox preachers denounced
  him. He was reviled as a dreamer, as a disturber, as a &quot;communist,&quot; and,
  finally, organized society took the alarm, and he was crucified between two
  thieves. But the word went forth, and, spread by fugitives and slaves, made
  its way against power and against persecution till it revolutionized the world,
  and out of the rotting old civilization brought the germ of the new. Then the
  privileged classes rallied again, carved the effigy of the man of the people
  in the courts and on the tombs of kings, in his name consecrated inequality,
  and wrested his gospel to the defense of social injustice. But again the same
  great ideas of a common fatherhood, of a common brotherhood, of a social state
  in which none shall be overworked and none shall want, begin to quicken in
  common thought.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>When a mighty wind meets a strong current, it does not portend a smooth
  sea. And whoever will think of the opposing tendencies beginning to develop
  will appreciate the gravity of the social problems the civilized world must
  soon meet. He will also understand the meaning of Christ's words when he said:</p>
