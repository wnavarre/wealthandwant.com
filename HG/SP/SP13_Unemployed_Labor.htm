<p align="center"><strong>Unemployed Labor</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 13 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by
  Henry George (1883)
</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>HOW contempt of human rights is the essential element in building up
  the great fortunes whose growth is such a marked feature of our development,
  we have already seen. And just as clearly may we see that from the same cause
spring poverty and pauperism. The tramp is the complement of the millionaire.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> Consider this terrible phenomenon, the tramp&#8212;  an
  appearance more menacing to the Republic than that of hostile armies and fleets
  bent on destruction.
  What is the tramp? In the beginning, he is a man able to work, and willing
  to work, for the satisfaction of his needs; but who, not finding opportunity
  to work where he is, starts out in quest of it; who, failing in this search,
  is, in a later stage, driven by those imperative needs to beg or to steal,
  and so, losing self-respect, loses all that animates and elevates and stimulates
  a man to struggle and to labor; becomes a vagabond and an outcast &#8212;  a
  poisonous pariah, avenging on society the wrong that he keenly, but vaguely,
  feels has
  been done him by society.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>Yet the tramp, known as he is now from the Atlantic to the Pacific, is
  only a part of the phenomenon. Behind him, though not obtrusive, save in what
  we call &quot;hard times,&quot; there is, even in what we now consider normal
  times, a great mass of unemployed labor which is unable, unwilling, or not
  yet forced to tramp, but which bears to the tramp the same relation that the
  submerged part of an iceberg does to that much smaller part which shows above
  the surface.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>The difficulty which so many men who would gladly work to satisfy their
  needs find in obtaining opportunity of doing so, is so common as to occasion
  no surprise, nor, save when it becomes particularly intensified, to arouse
  any inquiry. We are so used to it, that although we all know that work is in
  itself distasteful, and that there never yet was a human being who wanted work
  for the sake of work, we have got into the habit of thinking and talking as
  though work were in itself a boon. So deeply is this idea implanted in the
  common mind that we maintain a policy based on the notion that the more work
  we do for foreign nations and the less we allow them to do for us, the better
  off we shall be; and in public and in private we hear men lauded and enterprises
  advocated because they &quot;furnish employment;&quot; while there are many
  who, with more or less definiteness, hold the idea that labor-saving inventions
  have operated injuriously by lessening the amount of work to be done.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>Manifestly, work is not an end, but a means; manifestly, there can be
  no real scarcity of work, which is but the means of satisfying material wants,
  until human wants are all satisfied. How, then, shall we explain the obvious
  facts which lead men to think and speak as though work were in itself desirable?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>When we consider that labor is the producer of all wealth, the creator
  of all values, is it not strange that labor should experience difficulty in
  finding employment? The exchange for commodities of that which gives value
  to all commodities, ought to be the most certain and easy of exchanges. One
  wishing to exchange labor for food or clothing, or any of the manifold things
  which labor produces, is like one wishing to exchange gold-dust for coin, cotton
  for cloth, or wheat for flour. Nay, this is hardly a parallel; for, as the
  terms upon which the exchange of labor for commodities takes place are usually
  that the labor is first rendered, the man who offers labor in exchange generally
  proposes to produce and render value before value is returned to him.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>This being the case, why is not the competition of employers to obtain
  workmen as great as the competition of workmen to find employment? Why is it
  that we do not consider the man who does work as the obliging party, rather
  than the man who, as we say, furnishes work?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> So it necessarily would be, if in saying that
  labor is the producer of wealth, we stated the whole case. But labor is only
  the producer of wealth
  in the sense of being the active factor of production. For the production of
  wealth. labor must have access to pre-existing substance and natural
  forces. Man has no power to bring something out of nothing. He cannot create
  an atom
  of matter or initiate the slightest motion. Vast as are his powers of modifying
  matter and utilizing force, they are merely powers of adapting, changing, recombining,
  what previously exists. The substance of the hand with which I write these
  lines, as of the paper on which I write, has previously formed the substance
  of other men and other animals, of plants, soils, rocks, atmospheres, probably
  of other worlds and other systems. And so of the force which impels my pen.
  All we know of it is that it has acted and reacted through what seem to us
  eternal circlings, and appears to reach this planet from the sun. The destruction
  of matter and motion, as the creation of matter and motion, are to us unthinkable.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> In the human being, in some mysterious way which neither the researches
  of physiologists nor the speculations of philosophers enable us to comprehend,
  conscious, planning intelligence comes into control, for a limited time and
  to a limited extent, of the matter and motion contained in the human frame.
  The power of contracting and expanding human muscles is the initial force with
  which the human mind acts upon the material world. By the use of this power
  other powers are utilized, and the forms and relations of matter are changed
  in accordance with human desire. But how great soever be the power of affecting
  and using external nature which human intelligence thus obtains, &#8212; and
  how great this may be we are only beginning now to realize, &#8212; it is
  still only
  the power of affecting and using what previously exists. Without access to
  external nature, without the power of availing himself of her substance and
  forces, man is not merely powerless to produce anything, he ceases to exist
  in the material world. He himself, in physical body at least, is but a changing
  form of matter, a passing mode of motion, that must be continually drawn from
  the reservoirs of external nature.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>Without either of the three elements, land, air and water, man could
  not exist; but he is peculiarly a land animal, living on its surface, and drawing
  from it his supplies. Though he is able to navigate the ocean, and may some
  day be able to navigate the air, he can only do so by availing himself of materials
  drawn from land. Land is to him the great storehouse of materials and reservoir
  of forces upon which he must draw for his needs. And as wealth consists of
  materials and products of nature which have been secured, or modified by human
  exertion so as to fit them for the satisfaction of human desires,* labor is
  the active factor in the production of wealth, but land is the passive factor,
  without which labor can neither produce nor exist.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>*However great be its utility, nothing can be counted as wealth unless it
    requires labor for its production; nor however much labor has been required
    for its production, can anything retain the character of wealth longer than
  it can gratify desire. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>All this is so obvious that it may seem like wasting space to state it.
  Yet, in this obvious fact lies the explanation of that enigma that to so many
  seems a hopeless puzzle &#8212; the labor question. What is inexplicable,
  if we lose sight of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear
  when
  we recognize it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Let us suppose, as well as we can, human society in a world as near as
  possible like our own, with one essential difference. Let us suppose this imaginary
  world and its inhabitants so constructed that men could support themselves
  in air, and could from the material of the air produce by their labor what
  they needed for nourishment and use. I do not mean to suppose a state of things
  in which men might float around like birds in the air or fishes in the ocean,
  supplying the prime necessities of animal life from what they could pick up.
  I am merely trying to suppose a state of things in which men as they are, were
  relieved of absolute dependence upon land for a standing-place and reservoir
  of material and forces. We will suppose labor to be as necessary as with us,
  human desires to be as boundless as with us, the cumulative power of labor
  to give to capital as much advantage as with us and the division of labor to
  have gone as far as with us &#8212; the only difference being (the idea of
  claiming the air as private property not having been thought of) that no human
  creature
  would be compelled to make terms with another in order to get a resting-place,
  and to obtain access to the material and forces without which labor cannot
  produce. In such a state of things, no matter how minute had become the division
  of labor, no matter how great had become the accumulation of capital, or how
  far labor-saving inventions had been carried, &#8212; there could never be
  anything that seemed like an excess of the supply of labor over the demand
  for labor;
  there could never be any difficulty in finding employment; and the spectacle
  of willing men, having in their own brains and muscles the power of supplying
  the needs of themselves and their families, yet compelled to beg for work or
  for alms, could never be witnessed. It being in the power of every one able
  to labor to apply his labor directly to the satisfaction of his needs without
  asking leave of any one else, that cutthroat competition, in which men who
  must find employment or starve are forced to bid against each other, could
  never arise.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>Variations there might be in the demand for particular commodities or
  services, which would produce variations in the demand for labor in different
  occupations, and cause wages in those occupations somewhat to rise above or
  fall below the general level, but the ability of labor to employ itself, the
  freedom of indefinite expansion in the primary employments, would allow labor
  to accommodate itself to these variations, not merely without loss or suffering,
  but so easily that they would be scarcely noticed. For occupations shade into
  one another by imperceptible degrees, no matter how minute the division of
  labor &#8212; or, rather, the more minute the division of labor the more insensible
  the gradation &#8212; so that there are in each occupation enough who could
  easily pass to other occupations, readily to allow of such contractions and
  expansions
  as might in a state of freedom occur. The possibility of indefinite expansion
  in the primary occupations, the ability of every one to make a living by resort
  to them, would produce elasticity throughout the whole industrial system.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>Under such conditions capital could not oppress labor. At present, in
  any dispute between capital and labor, capital enjoys the enormous advantage
  of being better able to wait. Capital wastes when not employed; but labor starves.
  Where, however, labor could always employ itself, the disadvantage in any conflict
  would be on the side of capital, while that surplus of unemployed labor which
  enables capital to make such advantageous bargains with labor would not exist.
  The man who wanted to get others to work for him would not find men crowding
  for employment, but, finding all labor already employed, would have to offer
  higher wages, in order to tempt them into his employment, than the men he wanted
  could make for themselves. The competition would be that of employers to obtain
  workmen, rather than that of workmen to get employment, and thus the advantages
  which the accumulation of capital gives in the production of wealth would (save
  enough to secure the accumulation and employment of capital) go ultimately
  to labor. In such a state of things, instead of thinking that the man who employed
  another was doing him a favor, we would rather look upon the man who went to
  work for another as the obliging party.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>To suppose that under such conditions there could be such inequality
  in the distribution of wealth as we now see, would require a more violent presumption
  than we have made in supposing air, instead of land, to be the element from
  which wealth is chiefly derived. But supposing existing inequalities to be
  translated into such a state, it is evident that large fortunes could avail
  little, and continue but a short time. Where there is always labor seeking
  employment on any terms; where the masses earn only a bare living, and dismissal
  from employment means anxiety and privation, and even beggary or starvation,
  these large fortunes have monstrous power. But in a condition of things where
  there was no unemployed labor, where every one could make a living for himself
  and family without fear or favor, what could a hundred or five hundred millions
  avail in the way of enabling its possessor to extort or tyrannize?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16]</font> The upper millstone alone cannot grind. That it may do so, the nether
  millstone as well is needed. No amount of force will break an egg-shell if
  exerted on one side alone. So capital could not squeeze labor as long as labor
  was free to natural opportunities, and in a world where these natural materials
  and opportunities were as free to all as is the air to us, there could be no
  difficulty in finding employment, no willing hands conjoined with hungry stomachs,
  no tendency of wages toward the minimum on which the worker could barely live.
  In such a world we would no more think of thanking anybody for furnishing us
  employment than we here think of thanking anybody for furnishing us with appetites.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17]</font> That the Creator might have put us in the kind of world I have sought
  to imagine, as readily as in this kind of a world, I have no doubt. Why he
  has not done so may, however, I think, be seen. That kind of a world would
  be best for fools. This is the best for men who will use the intelligence with
  which they have been gifted. Of this, however, I shall speak hereafter. What
  I am now trying to do by asking my readers to endeavor to imagine a world in
  which natural opportunities were &quot;as free as air,&quot; is to show that
  the barrier which prevents labor from freely using land is the nether millstone
  against which labor is ground, the true cause of the difficulties which are
  apparent through the whole industrial organization.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18] </font>But it may be said, as I have often heard it said, &quot;We do not all
  want land! We cannot all become farmers!&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19]</font> To this I reply that we do all want land, though it may be in different
  ways and in varying degrees. Without land no human being can live; without
  land no human occupation can be carried on. Agriculture is not the only use
  of land. It is only one of many. And just as the uppermost story of the tallest
  building rests upon land as truly as the lowest, so is the operative as truly
  a user of land as is the farmer. As all wealth is in the last analysis the
  resultant of land and labor, so is all production in the last analysis the
  expenditure of labor upon land.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20]</font> Nor is it true that we could not all become farmers. That is the one
  thing that we might all become. If all men were merchants, or tailors, or mechanics,
  all men would soon starve. But there have been, and still exist, societies
  in which all get their living directly from nature. The occupations that resort
  directly to nature are the primitive occupations, from which, as society progresses,
  all others are differentiated. No matter how complex the industrial organization,
  these must always remain the fundamental occupations, upon which all other
  occupations rest, just as the upper stories of a building rest upon the foundation.
  Now, as ever, &quot;the farmer feedeth all.&quot; And necessarily, the condition
  of labor in these first and widest of occupations, determines the general condition
  of labor, just as the level of the ocean determines the level of all its arms
  and bays and seas. Where there is a great demand for labor in agriculture,
  and wages are high, there must soon be a great demand for labor, and high wages,
  in all occupations. Where it is difficult to get employment in agriculture,
  and wages are low, there must soon be a difficulty of obtaining employment,
  and low wages, in all occupations. Now, what determines the demand for labor
  and the rate of wages in agriculture is manifestly the ability of labor to
  employ itself &#8212; that is to say, the ease with which land can be obtained.
  This is the reason that in new countries, where land is easily had, wages,
  not merely in agriculture, but in all occupations, are higher than in older
  countries, where land is hard to get. And thus it is that, as the value of
  land increases, wages fall, and the difficulty in finding employment arises.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>This whoever will may see by merely looking around him. Clearly the difficulty
  of finding employment, the fact that in all vocations, as a rule, the supply
  of labor seems to exceed the demand for labor, springs from difficulties that
  prevent labor finding employment for itself &#8212; from the barriers that
  fence labor off from land. That there is a surplus of labor in any one occupation
  arises from the difficulty of finding employment in other occupations, but
  for which the surplus would be immediately drained off. When there was a great
  demand for clerks no bookkeeper could suffer for want of employment. And so
  on, down to the fundamental employments which directly extract wealth from
  land, the opening in which of opportunities for labor to employ itself would
  soon drain off any surplus in derivative occupations. Not that every unemployed
  mechanic, or operative, or clerk, could or would get himself a farm; but that
  from all the various occupations enough would betake themselves to the land
  to relieve any pressure for employment.</p>
