<p align="center"><strong>  Coming Increase of Social Pressure
</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 3 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
(1883)</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>THE trees, as I write, have not yet begun to leaf,
  nor even the blossoms to appear; yet, passing down the lower part of Broadway
  these early days of
  spring, one breasts a steady current of uncouthly dressed men and women, carrying
  bundles and boxes and all manner of baggage. As the season advances, the human
  current will increase; even in winter it will not wholly cease its flow. It
  is the great gulf-stream of humanity which sets from Europe upon America &#8212; 
  the greatest migration of peoples since the world began. Other minor branches
  has the stream. Into Boston and Philadelphia, into Portland, Quebec and Montreal,
  into New Orleans, Galveston, San Francisco and Victoria, come offshoots of
  the same current; and as it flows it draws increasing volume from wider sources.
  Emigration to America has, since 1848, reduced the population of Ireland by
  more than a third; but as Irish ability to feed the stream declines, English
  emigration increases; the German outpour becomes so vast as to assume the first
  proportions, and the millions of Italy, pressed by want as severe as that of
  Ireland, begin to turn to the emigrant ship as did the Irish. In Castle Garden
  one may see the garb and hear the speech of all European peoples. From the
  fiords of Norway, from the plains of Russia and Hungary, from the mountains
  of Wallachia, and from Mediterranean shores and islands, once the center of
  classic civilization, the great current is fed. Every year increases the facility
  of its flow. Year by year improvements in steam navigation are practically
  reducing the distance between the two continents; year by year European railroads
  are making it easier for interior populations to reach the seaboard, and the
  telegraph, the newspaper, the schoolmaster and the cheap post are lessening
  those objections of ignorance and sentiment to removal that are so strong with
  people long rooted in one place. Yet, in spite of this great exodus, the population
  of Europe, as a whole, is steadily increasing.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02] </font>And across the continent, from east to west, from the older to the newer
  States, an even greater migration is going on. Our people emigrate more readily
  than those of Europe, and increasing as European immigration is, it is yet
  becoming a less and less important factor of our growth, as compared with the
  natural increase of our population. At Chicago and St. Paul, Omaha and Kansas
  City, the volume of the westward-moving current has increased, not diminished.
  From what, so short a time ago, was the new West of unbroken prairie and native
  forest, goes on, as children grow up, a constant migration to a newer West.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>This westward expansion of population has gone on steadily since the
  first settlement of the Eastern shore. It has been the great distinguishing
  feature in the conditions of our people. Without its possibility we would have
  been in nothing what we are. Our higher standard of wages and of comfort and
  of average intelligence, our superior self-reliance, energy, inventiveness,
  adaptability and assimilative power, spring as directly from this possibility
  of expansion as does our unprecedented growth. All that we are proud of in
  national life and national character comes primarily from our background of
  unused land. We are but transplanted Europeans, and, for that matter mostly
  of the &quot;inferior classes.&quot; It is not usually those whose position
  is comfortable and whose prospects are bright who emigrate; it is those who
  are pinched and dissatisfied, those to whom no prospect seems open. There are
  heralds' colleges in Europe that drive a good business in providing a certain
  class of Americans with pedigrees and coats of arms; but it is probably well
  for this sort of self-esteem that the majority of us cannot truly trace our
  ancestry very far. We had some Pilgrim Fathers, it is true; likewise some Quaker
  fathers, and other sorts of fathers; yet the majority even of the early settlers
  did not come to America for &quot;freedom to worship God,&quot; but because
  they were poor, dissatisfied, unsuccessful, or recklessly adventurous &#8212;  many
  because they were evicted, many to escape imprisonment, many because they were
  kidnapped, many as self-sold bondsmen, as indentured apprentices, or mercenary
  soldiers. It is the virtue of new soil, the freedom of opportunity given by
  the possibility of expansion, that has here transmuted into wholesome human
  growth material that, had it remained in Europe, might have been degraded and
  dangerous, just as in Australia the same conditions have made respected and
  self-respecting citizens out of the descendants of convicts, and even out of
  convicts themselves.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04]</font> It may be doubted if the relation of the opening of the New World to
  the development of modern civilization is yet fully recognized. In many respects
  the discovery of Columbus has proved the most important event in the history
  of the European world since the birth of Christ. How important America has
  been to Europe as furnishing an outlet for the restless, the dissatisfied,
  the oppressed and the downtrodden; how influences emanating from the freer
  opportunities and freer life of America have reacted upon European thought
  and life &#8212; we can begin to realize only when we try to imagine what
  would have been the present condition of Europe had Columbus found only a watery
  waste between Europe and Asia, or even had he found here a continent populated
  as India, or China, or Mexico, were populated.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> And, correlatively, one of the most momentous events that could happen
  to the modern world would be the ending of this possibility of westward expansion.
  That it must sometime end is evident when we remember that the earth is round.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06]</font> Practically, this event is near at hand. Its shadow is even now stealing
  over us. Not that there is any danger of this continent being really overpopulated.
  Not that there will not be for a long time to come, even at our present rate
  of growth, plenty of unused land or of land only partially used. But to feel
  the results of what is called pressure of population, to realize here pressure
  of the same kind that forces European emigration upon our shores, we shall
  not have to wait for that. Europe today is not overpopulated. In Ireland,
  whence we have received such an immense immigration, not one-sixth of the soil
  is under cultivation, and grass grows and beasts feed where once were populous
  villages. In Scotland there is the solitude of the deer forest and the grouse
  moor where a century ago were homes of men. One may ride on the railways through
  the richest agricultural districts of England and see scarcely as many houses
  as in the valley of the Platte, where the buffalo herded a few years back.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>Twelve months ago, when the hedges were blooming, I passed along a lovely
  English road near by the cottage of that &quot;Shepherd of Salisbury Plain&quot; of
  whom I read, when a boy, in a tract which is a good sample of the husks frequently
  given to children as religious food, and which is still, I presume, distributed
  by the American, as it is by the English, Tract Society. On one side of the
  road was a wide expanse of rich land, in which no plowshare had that season
  been struck, because its owner demanded a higher rent than the farmers would
  give. On the other, stretched, for many a broad acre, a lordly park, its velvety
  verdure untrodden save by a few light-footed deer. And, as we passed along,
  my companion, a native of those parts, bitterly complained that, since this
  lord of the manor had inclosed the little village green and set out his fences
  to take in the grass of the roadside, the cottagers could not keep even a goose,
  and the children of the village had no place to play! Place there was in plenty,
  but, so far as the children were concerned, it might as well be in Africa or
  in the moon. And so in our Far West, I have seen emigrants toiling painfully
  for long distances through vacant land without finding a spot on which they
  dared settle. In a country where the springs and streams are all inclosed by
  walls he cannot scale, the wayfarer, but for charity, might perish of thirst,
  as in a desert. There is plenty of vacant land on Manhattan Island. But on
  Manhattan Island human beings are packed closer than anywhere else in the world.
  There is plenty of fresh air all around &#8212; one man owns forty acres of
  it, a whiff of which he never breathes, since his home is on his yacht in European
  waters; but, for all that, thousands of children die in New York every summer
  for want of it, and thousands more would die did not charitable people subscribe
  to fresh-air funds. The social pressure which forces on our shores this swelling
  tide of immigration arises not from the fact that the land of Europe is all
  in use, but that it is all appropriated. That will soon be our case as well.
  Our land will not all be used; but it will all be &quot;fenced in.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>We still talk of our vast public domain, and figures showing millions
  and millions of acres of unappropriated public land yet swell grandly in the
  reports of our Land Office. But already it is so difficult to find public land
  fit for settlement, that the great majority of those wishing to settle find
  it cheaper to buy, and rents in California and the New Northwest run from a
  quarter to even one-half of the crop. It must be remembered that the area which
  yet figures in the returns of our public domain includes all the great mountain
  chains, all the vast deserts and dry plains fit only for grazing, or not even
  for that; it must be remembered that of what is really fertile, millions and
  millions of acres are covered by railroad grants as yet unpatented, or what
  amounts to the same thing to the settler, are shadowed by them; that much land
  is held by appropriation of the water, without which it is useless; and that
  much more is held under claims of various kinds, which, whether legal or illegal,
  are sufficient to keep the settler off unless he will consent to pay a price,
  or to mortgage his labor for years.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> Nevertheless, land with us is still comparatively cheap. But this cannot
  long continue. The stream of immigration that comes swelling in, added to our
  steadily augmenting natural increase, will soon now so occupy the available
  lands as to raise the price of the poorest land worth settling on to a point
  we have never known. Nearly twenty years ago Mr. Wade, of Ohio, in a speech
  in the United States Senate, predicted that by the close of the century every
  acre of good agricultural land in the Union would be worth at least $50. That
  his prediction will be even more than verified we may already see. By the close
  of the century our population, at the normal rate of increase, will be over
  forty millions more than in 1880. That is to say, within the next seventeen
  years an additional population greater than that of the whole United States
  at the close of the civil war will be demanding room. Where will they find
  cheap land? There is no farther West Our advance has reached the Pacific, and
  beyond the Pacific is the East, with its teeming millions. From San Diego to
  Puget Sound there is no valley of the coastline that is not settled or preempted.
  To the very farthest corners of the Republic settlers are already going. The
  pressure is already so great that speculation and settlement are beginning
  to cross the northern border into Canada and the southern border into Mexico;
  so great that land is being settled and is becoming valuable that a few years
  ago would have been rejected &#8212; land where winter lasts for six months
  and the thermometer goes down into the forties below zero; land where, owing
  to
  insufficient rainfall, a crop is always a risk; land that cannot be cultivated
  at all without irrigation. The vast spaces of the western half of the continent
  do not contain anything like the proportion of arable land that does the eastern.
  The &quot;great American desert&quot; yet exists, though not now marked upon
  our maps. There is not today remaining in the United States any considerable
  body of good land unsettled and unclaimed, upon which settlers can go with
  the prospect of finding a homestead on government terms. Already the tide of
  settlement presses angrily upon the Indian reservations, and but for the power
  of the General Government would sweep over them. Already, although her population
  is as yet but a fraction more than six to the square mile, the last acre of
  the vast public domain of Texas has passed into private hands, the rush to
  purchase during the past year having been such that many thousands of acres
  more than the State had were sold.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>We may see what is coming by the avidity with which capitalists, and
  especially foreign capitalists, who realize what is the value of land where
  none is left over which population may freely spread, are purchasing land in
  the United States. This movement has been going on quietly for some years,
  until now there is scarcely a rich English peer or wealthy English banker who
  does not, either individually or as the member of some syndicate, own a great
  tract of our new land, and the purchase of large bodies for foreign account
  is going on every day. It is with these absentee landlords that our coming
  millions must make terms.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>Nor must it be forgotten that, while our population is increasing, and
  our &quot;wild lands&quot; are being appropriated, the productive capacity
  of our soil is being steadily reduced, which, practically, amounts to the same
  thing as reducing its quantity. Speaking generally, the agriculture of the
  United States is an exhaustive agriculture. We do not return to the earth what
  we take from it; each crop that is harvested leaves the soil the poorer. We
  are cutting down forests which we do not replant; we are shipping abroad, in
  wheat and cotton and tobacco and meat, or flushing into the sea through the
  sewers of our great cities, the elements of fertility that have been embedded
  in the soil by the slow processes of nature, acting for long ages.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> The day is near at hand when it will be no longer possible for our increasing
  population freely to expand over new land; when we shall need for our own millions
  the immense surplus of food-stuffs now exported; when we shall not only begin
  to feel that social pressure which comes when natural resources are all monopolized,
  but when increasing social pressure here will increase social pressure in Europe.
  How momentous is this fact we begin to realize when we cast about for such
  another outlet as the United States has furnished. We look in vain. The British
  possessions to the north of us embrace comparatively little arable land; the
  valleys of the Saskatchewan and the Red River are being already taken up, and
  land speculation is already raging there in fever. Mexico offers opportunities
  for American enterprise and American capital and American trade, but scarcely
  for American emigration. There is some room for our settlers in that northern
  zone that has been kept desolate by fierce Indians; but it is very little.
  The table-land of Mexico and those portions of Central and South America suited
  to our people are already well filled by a population whom we cannot displace
  unless, as the Saxons displaced the ancient Britons, by a war of extermination.
  Anglo-Saxon capital and enterprise and influence will doubtless dominate those
  regions, and many of our people will go there but it will be as Englishmen
  go to India or British Guiana. Where land is already granted and where peon
  labor can be had for a song, no such emigration can take place as that which
  has been pushing its way westward over the United States. So of Africa. Our
  race has made a permanent lodgment on the southern extremity of that vast continent,
  but its northern advance is met by tropical heats and the presence of races
  of strong vitality. On the north, the Latin branches of the European family
  seem to have again become acclimated, and wilt probably in time revive the
  ancient populousness and importance of Mediterranean Africa; but it will scarcely
  furnish an outlet for more than them. As for Equatorial Africa, though we may
  explore and civilize and develop, we cannot colonize it in the face of the
  climate and of races that increase rather than disappear in presence of the
  white man. The arable land of Australia would not merely be soon well populated
  by anything like the emigration that Europe is pouring on America, but there
  the forestalling of land goes on as rapidly as here. Thus we come again to
  that greatest of the continents, from which our race once started on its westward
  way, Asia &#8212; mother of peoples and religions &#8212; which yet contains
  the greater part of the human race &#8212; millions who live and die in all
  but utter
  unconsciousness
  of our modern world. In the awakening of those peoples by the impact of Western
  civilization lies one of the greatest problems of the future.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13]</font> But it is not my purpose to enter into such speculations.
  What I want to point out is that we are very soon to lose one of the most important
  conditions
  under which our civilization has been developing &#8212; that possibility
  of expansion over virgin soil that has given scope and freedom to American
  life, and relieved
  social pressure in the most progressive European nations. Tendencies, harmless
  under this condition, may become most dangerous when it is changed. Gunpowder
  does not explode until it is confined. You may rest your hand on the slowly
  ascending jaw of a hydraulic press. It will only gently raise it. But wait
  a moment till it meets resistance! </p>
