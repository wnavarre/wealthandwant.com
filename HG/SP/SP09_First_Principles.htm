<p align="center"><strong>First Principles</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 9 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by
  Henry George (1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>WHOEVER considers the political and social problems that confront us,
  must see that they center in the problem of the distribution of wealth, and
he must also see that, though their solution may be simple, it must be radical.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> For every social wrong there must be a remedy. But the remedy can be
  nothing less than the abolition of the wrong. Half-way measures, mere ameliorations
  and secondary reforms, can at any time accomplish little, and can in the long
  run avail nothing. Our charities, our penal laws, our restrictions and prohibitions,
  by which, with so little avail, we endeavor to assuage poverty and check crime,
  what are they, at the very best, but the device of the clown who, having put
  the whole burden of his ass into one pannier, sought to enable the poor animal
  to walk straight by loading up the other pannier with stones?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>In New York, as I write, the newspapers and the
  churches are calling for subscriptions to their &quot;fresh-air funds,&quot; that
  little children may be taken for a day or for a week from the deadly heat of
  stifling tenement
  rooms and given a breath of the fresh breeze of seashore or mountain; but how
  little does it avail, when we take such children only to return them to their
  previous conditions &#8212; conditions which to many mean even worse than
  death of the body; conditions which make it certain that of the lives that
  may thus
  be saved, some are saved for the brothel and the almshouse, and some for the
  penitentiary? We may go on forever merely raising fresh-air funds, and how
  great soever be the funds we raise, the need will only grow, and children &#8212;  just
  such children as those of whom Christ said, &quot;Take heed that ye despise
  not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels
  do always behold the face of my Father&quot; &#8212; will die like flies,
  so long as poverty compels fathers and mothers to the life of the squalid tenement
  room. We may open &quot;midnight missions&quot; and support &quot;Christian
  homes for destitute young girls,&quot; but what will they avail in the face
  of general conditions which render so many men unable to support a wife; which
  make young girls think it a privilege to be permitted to earn three dollars
  by eighty one hours' work, and which can drive a mother to such despair that
  she will throw her babies from a wharf of our Christian city and then leap
  into the river herself! How vainly shall we endeavor to repress crime by our
  barbarous punishment of the poorer class of criminals so long as children are
  reared in the brutalizing influences of poverty, so long as the bite of want
  drives men to crime! How little better than idle is it for us to prohibit infant
  labor in factories when the scale of wages is so low that it will not enable
  fathers to support their families without the earnings of their little children!
  How shall we try to prevent political corruption by framing new checks and
  setting one official to watch another official, when the fear of want stimulates
  the lust for wealth, and the rich thief is honored while honest poverty is
  despised?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>Nor yet could we accomplish any permanent equalization in the distribution
  of wealth were we forcibly to take from those who have and give to those who
  have not. We would do great injustice; we would work great harm; but, from
  the very moment of such a forced equalization the tendencies which show themselves
  in the present unjust inequalities would begin to assert themselves again,
  and we would in a little while have as gross inequalities as before.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>What we must do if we would cure social disease and avert social danger
  is to remove the causes which prevent the just distribution of wealth.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>This work is only one of removal. It is not necessary for us to frame
  elaborate and skilful plans for securing the just distribution of wealth. For
  the just distribution of wealth is manifestly the natural distribution of wealth,
  and injustice in the distribution of wealth must, therefore, result from artificial
  obstructions to this natural distribution.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>As to what is the just distribution of wealth there can be no dispute.
  It is that which gives wealth to him who makes it, and secures wealth to him
  who saves it. So clearly is this the only just distribution of wealth that
  even those shallow writers who attempt to defend the existing order of things
  are driven, by a logical necessity, falsely to assume that those who now possess
  the larger share of wealth made it and saved it, or got it by gift or by inheritance,
  from those who did make it and save it; whereas the fact is, as I have in a
  previous chapter shown, that all these great fortunes, whose corollaries are
  paupers and tramps, really come from the sheer appropriation of the makings
  and savings of other people.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>And that this just distribution of wealth is the natural distribution
  of wealth can be plainly seen. Nature gives wealth to labor, and to nothing
  but labor. There is, and there can be no article of wealth but such as labor
  has got by making it, or searching for it, out of the raw material which the
  Creator has given us to draw from. If there were but one man in the world it
  is manifest that he could have no more wealth than he was able to make and
  to save. This is the natural order. And, no matter how great be the population,
  or how elaborate the society, no one can have more wealth than he produces
  and saves, unless he gets it as a free gift from some one else, or by appropriating
  the earnings of some one else.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>An English writer has divided all men into three classes&#8212;  workers, beggars and thieves. The classification is not complimentary to the &quot;upper
  classes&quot; and the &quot;better classes,&quot; as they are accustomed to
  esteem themselves, yet it is economically true. There are only three ways by
  which any individual can get wealth &#8212; by work, by gift or by theft.
  And, clearly, the reason why the workers get so little is that the beggars
  and thieves get
  so much. When a man gets wealth that he does not produce, he necessarily gets
  it at the expense of those who produce it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>All we need do to secure a just distribution of
  wealth, is to do that which all theories agree to be the primary function of
  government &#8212;  to secure to each the free use of his own powers, limited
  only by the equal freedom of
  all others; to secure to each the full enjoyment of his own earnings, limited
  only by such contributions as he may be fairly called upon to make for purposes
  of common benefit. When we have done this we shall have done all that we can
  do to make social institutions conform to the sense of justice and to the natural
  order.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>I wish to emphasize this point, for there are those who constantly talk
  and write as though whoever finds fault with the present distribution of wealth
  were demanding that the rich should be spoiled for the benefit of the poor;
  that the idle should be taken care of at the expense of the industrious, and
  that a false and impossible equality should be created, which, by reducing
  every one to the same dead level, would destroy all incentive to excel and
  bring progress to a halt.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> In the reaction from the glaring injustice of present social conditions,
  such wild schemes have been proposed, and still find advocates. But to my way
  of thinking they are as impracticable and repugnant as they can seem to those
  who are loudest in their denunciations of &quot;communism.&quot; I am not willing
  to say that in the progress of humanity a state of society may not be possible
  which shall realize the formula of Louis Blanc, &quot;From each according to
  his abilities; to each according to his wants,&quot; for there exist today
  in the religious Orders of the Catholic Church, associations which maintain
  the communism of early Christianity. But it seems to me that the only power
  by which such a state of society can be attained and preserved is that which
  the framers of the schemes I speak of generally ignore, even when they do not
  directly antagonize &#8212; a deep, definite, intense, religious faith, so
  clear, so burning as utterly to melt away the thought of self  &#8212; a general
  moral condition
  such as that which the Methodists declare, under the name of &quot;sanctification,&quot; to
  be individually possible, in which the dream of pristine innocence should become
  reality, and man, so to speak, should again walk with God.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>But the possibility of such a state of society seems to me in the present
  stage of human development a speculation which comes within the higher domain
  of religious faith rather than that with which the economist or practical statesman
  can concern himself. That nature, as it is apparent to us here, in this infinitesimal
  point in space and time that we call the world, is the highest expression of
  the power and purpose that called the universe into being, what thoughtful
  man dare affirm? Yet it is manifest that the only way by which man may attain
  higher things is by conforming his conduct to those commandments which are
  as obvious in his relations with his fellows and with external nature as though
  they were graved by the finger of Omnipotence upon tablets of imperishable
  stone. In the order of moral development, Moses comes before Christ &#8212;&quot;Thou
  shalt not kill;&quot; &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery;&quot; &quot;Thou
  shalt not steal;&quot; before &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.&quot; The
  command, &quot;Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,&quot; precedes
  the entrancing vision of universal peace, in which even nature's rapine shall
  cease, when the lion shall lie down with the lamb, and a little child shall
  lead them.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>That justice is the highest quality in the moral hierarchy I do not say;
  but that it is the first. That which is above justice must be based on justice,
  and include justice, and be reached through justice. It is not by accident
  that, in the Hebraic religious development which through Christianity we have
  inherited, the declaration, &quot;The Lord thy God is a just God,&quot; precedes
  the sweeter revelation of a God of Love. Until the eternal justice is perceived,
  the eternal love must be hidden. As the individual must be just before he can
  be truly generous, so must human society be based upon justice before it can
  be based on benevolence.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>This, and this alone, is what I contend for &#8212; that our social
  institutions be conformed to justice; to those natural and eternal principles
  of right that
  are so obvious that no one can deny or dispute them &#8212; so obvious that
  by a law of the human mind even those who try to defend social injustice must
  invoke
  them. This, and this alone, I contend for &#8212; that he who makes should
  have; that he who saves should enjoy. I ask in behalf of the poor nothing whatever
  that properly belongs to the rich. Instead of weakening and confusing the idea
  of property, I would surround it with stronger sanctions. Instead of lessening
  the incentive to the production of wealth, I would make it more powerful by
  making the reward more certain. Whatever any man has added to the general stock
  of wealth, or has received of the free will of him who did produce it, let
  that be his as against all the world &#8212; his to use or to give, to do
  with it whatever he may please, so long as such use does not interfere with
  the equal
  freedom of others. For my part, I would put no limit on acquisition. No matter
  how many millions any man can get by methods which do not involve the robbery
  of others &#8212; they are his: let him have them. I would not even ask him
  for charity, or have it dinned into his ears that it is his duty to help the
  poor.
  That is his own affair. Let him do as he pleases with his own, without restriction
  and without suggestion. If he gets without taking from others, and uses without
  hurting others, what he does with his wealth is his own business and his own
  responsibility.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>I reverence the spirit that, in such cities as London and New York, organizes
  such great charities and gives to them such magnificent endowments, but that
  there is need for such charities proves to me that it is a slander upon Christ
  to call such cities Christian cities. I honor the Astors for having provided
  for New York the Astor Library, and Peter Cooper for having given it the Cooper
  Institute; but it is a shame and a disgrace to the people of New York that
  such things should be left to private beneficence. And he who struggles for
  that recognition of justice which, by securing to each his own, will make it
  needless to beg for alms from one for another, is doing a greater and a higher
  work than he who builds churches, or endows hospitals, or founds colleges and
  libraries. This justice, which would first secure to each his own earnings,
  is, it seems to me, of that higher than almsgiving, which the Apostle had in
  mind, when he said, <em>&quot;Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,
  and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
  me nothing.&quot;</em></p>
<p><font size="-2">[17]</font> Let us first ask what are the natural rights of men, and endeavor to
  secure them, before we propose either to beg or to pillage.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18]</font> In what succeeds I shall consider what are the natural rights of men,
  and how, under present social adjustments, they are ignored and denied. This
  is made necessary by the nature of this inquiry. But I do not wish to call
  upon those my voice may reach to demand their own rights, so much as to call
  upon them to secure the rights of others more helpless. I believe that the
  idea of duty is more potent for social improvement than the idea of interest;
  that in sympathy is a stronger social force than in selfishness. I believe
  that any great social improvement must spring from, and be animated by, that
  spirit which seeks to make life better, nobler, happier for others, rather
  than by that spirit which only seeks more enjoyment for itself. For the Mammon
  of Injustice can always buy the selfish whenever it may think it worth while
  to pay enough but unselfishness it cannot buy.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19]</font> In the idea of the incarnation &#8212; of the
  God voluntarily descending to the help of men, which is embodied not merely
  in Christianity, but in other
  great religions &#8212; lies, I sometimes think, a deeper truth than perhaps
  even the churches teach. This is certain, that the deliverers, the liberators,
  the
  advancers of humanity, have always been those who were moved by the sight of
  injustice and misery rather than those spurred by their own suffering. As it
  was a Moses, learned in all the lore of the Egyptians, and free to the Court
  of Pharaoh, and not a tasked slave, forced to make bricks without straw, who
  led the Children of Israel from the House of Bondage; as it was the Gracchi,
  of patrician blood and fortune, who struggled to the death against the land-grabbing
  system which finally destroyed Rome, as it must, should it go on, in time destroy
  this republic, so has it always been that the oppressed, the degraded, the
  downtrodden have been freed and elevated rather by the efforts and the sacrifices
  of those to whom fortune had been more kind than by their own strength. For
  the more fully men have been deprived of their natural rights, the less their
  power to regain them. The more men need help, the less can they help themselves.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20] </font>The sentiment to which I would appeal is not envy, nor yet self-interest,
  but that nobler sentiment which found strong, though rude, expression in that
  battle-hymn which rang through the land when a great wrong was going down in
  blood:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-2">[21]</font> In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,<br />
    With a glory in his bosom to transfigure you and me;<br />
    <em>As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!</em>*</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[22]</font> And what is there for which life gives us opportunity that can be compared
  with the effort to do what we may, be it ever so little, to improve social
  conditions and enable other lives to reach fuller, nobler development? Old
  John Brown, dying the death of the felon, launched into eternity with pinioned
  arms and the kiss of the slave child on his lips &#8212; was not his a greater
  life and a grander death than though his years had been given to self-seeking?
  Did
  he not take with him more than the man who grabs for wealth and leaves his
  millions? Envy the rich! Who that realizes that he must some day wake up in
  the beyond can envy those who spend their strength to gather what they cannot
  use here and cannot take away! The only thing certain to any of us is death. &quot;Like
  the swallow darting through thy hall, such, O King, is the life of man!&quot; We
  come from where we know not; we go &#8212; who shall say? Impenetrable darkness
  behind, and gathering shades before. What, when our time comes, does it matter
  whether we have fared daintily or not, whether we have worn soft raiment or
  not, whether we leave a great fortune or nothing at all, whether we shall have
  reaped honors or been despised, have been counted learned or ignorant &#8212;  as
  compared with how we may have used that talent which has been intrusted to
  us for the Master's service? What shall it matter, when eyeballs glaze and
  ears grow dull, if out of the darkness may stretch a hand, and into the silence
  may come a voice:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-2">[23] </font><em>&quot;Well done, thou good and faithful servant:
        thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
        things: enter thou into
      the joy of thy Lord!&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[24]</font> I shall speak of rights, I shall speak of utility, I shall speak of interest;
  I shall meet on their chosen ground those who say that the largest production
  of wealth is the greatest good, and material progress the highest aim. Nevertheless,
  I appreciate the truth embodied in these words of Mazzini to the working-classes
  of Italy, and would echo them:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-2">[25]</font> Working-men, brothers! When Christ came and changed the face of the
    world, he spoke not of rights to the rich, who needed not to achieve them;
    nor to the poor, who would doubtless have abused them, in imitation of the
    rich; he spoke not of utility, nor of interest, to a people whom interest and
    utility had corrupted; he spoke of duty, he spoke of love, of sacrifice and
    of faith; and he said that they should be first among all who had contributed
    most by their labor to the good of all.</p>
  <p> <font size="-2">[26]</font> And the word of Christ breathed in the ear of a society in which all
    true life was extinct, recalled it to existence, conquered the millions, conquered
    the world, and caused the education of the human race to ascend one degree
    on the scale of progress.</p>
  <p> <font size="-2">[27]</font> Working-men! We live in an epoch similar to
    that of Christ. We live in the midst of a society as corrupt as that of the
    Roman Empire, feeling in
    our inmost souls the need of reanimating and transforming it, and of uniting
    all its various members in one sole faith, beneath one sole law, in one sole
    aim &#8212; the free and progressive development of all the faculties of
    which God has given the germ to his creatures. We seek the kingdom of God
    on earth
    as
    it is in heaven, or, rather, that earth may become a preparation for heaven,
    and society an endeavor after the progressive realization of the divine idea.</p>
  <p> <font size="-2">[28]</font> But Christ's every act was the visible representation of the faith he
    preached; and around him stood apostles who incarnated in their actions the
    faith they had accepted. Be you such and you will conquer. Preach duty to the
    classes about you, and fulfill, as far as in you lies, your own. Preach virtue,
    sacrifice and love; and be yourselves virtuous, loving and ready for self-sacrifice.
    Speak your thoughts boldly, and make known your wants courageously; but without
    anger, without reaction, and without threats. The strongest menace, if indeed
    there be those for whom threats are necessary, will be the firmness, not the
    irritation, of your speech.</p>
