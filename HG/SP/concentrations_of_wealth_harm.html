<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"> From Henry George, <b><i>Social
Problems</i></b> (New York, 1883).
</div>
<p> There is in all the past nothing to compare with the rapid
changes now going on in the civilized world. It seems as though in
the European race, and in the nineteenth century, man was just
beginning to live -- just grasping his tools and becoming conscious of
his powers. The snails pace of crawling ages has suddenly become the
headlong rush of the locomotive, speeding faster and faster. This
rapid progress is primarily in industrial methods and material
powers. But industrial changes imply social changes and necessitate
politic changes. Progressive societies outgrow institutions as
children outgrow clothes. Social progress always requires greater
intelligence in the management of public affairs; but this the more
as progress is rapid and change quicker...</p>
<p>  <a name="Wealth and Civilization"></a><b>Wealth and
  Civilization</b></p>
<p> A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power in
the hands of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human
machines, must inevitably evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a
civilization is possible in which the poorest could have all the
comforts and conveniences now enjoyed by the rich; in which prisons
and almshouses would be needless, and charitable societies unthought
of. Such a civilization waits only for the social intelligence that
will adapt means to ends. Powers that might give plenty to all are
already in our hands. Though there is poverty and want, there is,
yet, seeming embarrassment from the very excess of wealth-producing
forces. "Give us but a market," say manufacturers, "and we will
supply goods without end!" "Give us but work!" cry idle men....</p>
<p> The progress of civilization requires that more and more
intelligence be devoted to social affairs, and this not the
intelligence of the few, but that of the many. We cannot safely leave
politics to politicians, or political economy to college professors.
The people themselves must think, because the people alone can act.
</p>
<p> In a "journal of civilization" a professed teacher declares
the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his own
business. This is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes
to those who, having fared well themselves, think everybody should be
satisfied. But the salvation of society, the hope for the free, full
development of humanity, is in the gospel of brotherhood -- the gospel
of Christ. Social progress makes the well-being of all more and more
the business of each; it 'binds all closer and closer together in
bonds from which none can escape. He who observes the law and the
proprieties, and cares for his family, yet takes no interest in the
general weal, and gives no thought to those who are trodden under
foot, save now and then to bestow alms, is not a true Christian. Nor
is he a good citizen. The duty of the citizen is more and harder than
this. . . .</p>
<p> There is a suggestive fact that must impress any one who
thinks over the history of past eras and preceding civilizations. The
great, wealthy and powerful nations have always lost their freedom;
it is only in small, poor and isolated communities that Liberty has
been maintained. So true is this that the poets have always sung that
Liberty loves the rocks and tile mountains; that she shrinks from
wealth and power and splendor, from the crowded city and the busy
mart....</p>
<p> The mere growth of society involves danger of the gradual
conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the
people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling
class -- though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles
and a hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and
hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but
follow it. The same methods which, in a little town where each knows
his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,
enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great
city, as we have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of
plunderers to gain and hold the government. So, too, as we see in
Congress, and even in our State legislatures, the growth of the
country and the greater number of interests make the proportion of
the votes of a representative, of which his constituents know or care
to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial
departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the
people.</p>
<p> But to the changes produced by growth are, with us, added the
changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of
steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the
concentration of wealth and power. Workmen are becoming massed by
hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;
small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen
of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues
and pay rolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this
concentration grows the facility of combination among these great
business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal
operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers,
combine, either to regulate prices or to use the powers of
government! The tendency in all branches of industry is to the
formation of rings against which the individual is helpless, and
which exert their power upon government whenever their interests may
thus be served. </p>
<p> It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great
aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to
corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of
the people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars -- except
two million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in
power, no matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for
reform, for it instinctively fears change. It never struggles against
misgovemment. When threatened by the holders of political power it
does not agitate, nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is
in this way, no less than by its direct interference, that aggregated
wealth corrupts government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our
organized lobbies, both legislative and Congressional, rely as much
upon the fears as upon the hopes of moneyed interests. When
"business" is dull, their resource is to get up a bill which some
moneyed interest will pay them to beat. So, too, these large moneyed
interests will subscribe to political funds, on the principle of
keeping on the right side of those in power, just as the railroad
companies deadhead [transport for free] President
[Chester A.] Arthur when he goes to Florida to fish. </p>
The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it.
Where legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where
justice is to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And
if, for this reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt
government to pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting
influence. A community composed of very rich and very poor falls an
easy prey to whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit
and intelligence enough to resist; the very rich have too much at
stake.<br>
<p> <a name="Developments in America"></a><b> Developments in
America</b></p>
<p> The rise in the United States of monstrous fortunes, the
aggregation of enormous wealth in the hands of corporations,
necessarily
implies, the loss by the people of governmental control. Democratic
forms may be maintained, but there can be as much tyranny and
misgovemment under democratic forms as any other -- in fact, they lend
themselves most readily to tyranny and misgovernment. Forms count for
little. The Romans expelled their kings, and continued to abhor the
very name of king. But under the name of Caesars and Imperators, that
at first meant no more than our "Boss," they crouched before tyrants
more absolute than kings. We have already, under the popular name of
"bosses," developed political Caesars in municipalities and states.
If this development continues, in time there will come a national
boss. We are young; but we are growing. The day may arrive when the
"Boss of America" will be to the modem world what Caesar was to the
Roman world. This, at least, is certain: Democratic government in
more than name can exist only where wealth is distributed with
something like equality -- where the great mass of citizens are
personally free and independent, neither fettered by their poverty
nor made subject by their wealth. There is, after all, some sense in
a property qualification. The man who is dependent on a master for
his living is not a free man. To give the suffrage to slaves is only
to give votes to their owners. That universal suffrage may add to,
instead of decreasing, the political power of wealth we see when
mill-owners and mine operators vote their hands. The freedom to earn,
without fear or favor, a comfortable living, ought to go with the
freedom to vote. Thus alone can a sound basis for republican
institutions be secured. How can a man be said to have a country
where he has no right to a square inch of soil; where he has nothing
but his hands, and, urged by starvation, must bid against his fellows
for the privilege of using them? When it comes to voting tramps, some
principle has been carried to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme. I
have known elections to be decided by the carting of paupers from the
almshouse to the polls. But such decisions can scarcely be in the
interest of good government. </p>
<p> Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the
distribution of wealth. This our people do not generally recognize,
and they listen to quacks who propose to cure the symptoms without
touching the disease. "Let us elect good men to office," say the
quacks. Yes; let us catch little birds by sprinkling salt on their
tails! </p>
<p> It behooves us to look facts in the face. The experiment of
popular government in the United States is clearly a failure. Not
that it is a failure everywhere and in everything. An experiment of
this kind does not have to be fully worked out to be proved a
failure. But speaking generally of the whole country, from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, our
government by the people has in large degree become, is in larger
degree becoming, government by the strong and unscrupulous.</p>
<br>
<a name="People Losing Power"></a><b>People Losing Power</b>
<p> The people, of course, continue to vote; but the people are
losing their power. Money and organization tell more and more in
elections. In some sections bribery has become chronic, and numbers
of voters expect regularly to sell their votes. In some sections
large employers regularly bulldoze their hands into voting as they
wish. In municipal, State and Federal politics the power of the
"machine" is increasing. In many places it has become so strong that
the ordinary citizen has no more influence in the government under
which he lives than he would have in China. He is, in reality, not
one of the governing classes, but one of the governed. He
occasionally, in disgust, votes for "the other man," or "the other
party;" but, generally, to find that he has effected only a change of
masters, or secured the same masters under different names. And he is
beginning to accept the situation, and to leave politics to
politicians, as something with which an honest, self-respecting man
cannot afford meddle....</p>
<p> As for the great railroad managers, they may well say, "The
people be d-d!" When they want the power of the people they buy the
people's masters. The map of the United States is colored to show
States and Territories. A map of real political powers would ignore
State lines. Here would be a big patch representing the domains of
Vanderbilt; there Jay Gould's dominions would be brightly marked. In
another place would be set off the empire of Stanford and Huntington;
in another the newer empire of Henry Villard. The States and parts of
States that own the sway of the Pennsylvania Central would be
distinguished from those ruled by the Baltimore and Ohio; and so on.
In our National Senate, sovereign members of the Union are supposed
to be represented; but what are more truly represented are railroad
longs and great moneyed interests, though occasionally a mine jobber
from Nevada or Colorado, not inimical to the ruling powers, is
suffered to buy himself a seat for glory. And the Bench as well as
the Senate is being filled with corporation henchmen. A railroad king
makes his attorney a judge of last resort, as the great lord used to
make his chaplain a bishop....</p>
<p> The people are largely conscious of all this, and there is
among the masses much dissatisfaction. But there is a lack of that
intelligent interest necessary to adapt political organization to
changing conditions. The popular idea of reform seems to be merely a
change of men or a change of parties, not a change of system.
Political children, we attribute to bad men or wicked parties what
really springs from deep general causes...</p>
&nbsp;<br>
<a name="Can Anyone Be Rich?"></a><b>Can Anyone Be Rich?</b><br>
<br>
The comfortable theory that it is in the nature of things that
some should be poor and some should be rich, and that the gross and
constantly increasing inequalities in the distribution of wealth
imply no fault in our institutions, pervades our literature, and is
taught in the press, in the church, in school and in college. 
<p> This is a free country, we are told -- every man has a vote and
every man has a chance. The laborer's son may become President; poor
boys of today will be millionaires thirty or forty years from now,
and the millionaire's grandchildren will probably be poor. What more
can be asked? If a man has energy, industry, prudence and foresight,
he may win his way to great wealth. If he has not the ability to do
this he must not complain of those who have. If some enjoy much and
do little, it is because they, or their parents, possessed superior
qualities which enabled, them to "acquire property" or "make money."
If others must work hard and get little, it is because they have not
yet got their start, because they are ignorant, shiftless, unwilling
to practise that economy necessary for the first accumulation of
capital; or because their fathers were wanting in these respects. The
inequalities in condition result from the inequalities of human
nature, from the difference in the powers and capacities of different
men. If one has to toil ten or twelve hours a day for a few hundred
dollars a year, while another, doing little or no hard work, gets an
income of many thousands, it is because all that the former
contributes to the augmentation of the common stock of wealth is
little more than the mere force of his muscles. He can expect little
more than the animal, because he brings into play little more than
animal powers. He is but a private in the ranks of the great army of
industry, who has but to stand still or march, as he is bid. The
other is the organizer, the general, who guides and wields the whole
great machine, who must think, plan and provide; and his larger
income is only commensurate with the far higher and rarer powers
which he exercises, and the far greater importance of the function he
fulfils. Shall not education have its reward, and skill its payment?
What incentive would there be to the toil needed to learn to do
anything well were great prizes not to be gained by those who learn
to excel? It would not merely be gross injustice to refuse a Raphael
or a Rubens more than a housepainter, but it would prevent the
development of great painters. To destroy inequalities in condition
would be to destroy the incentive to progress. To quarrel with them
is to quarrel with the laws of nature. We might as well rail against
the length of the days or the phases of the moon; complain that there
are valleys and mountains; zones of tropical heat and regions of
eternal ice. And were we by violent measures to divide wealth
equally, we should accomplish nothing but harm; in a little while
there would be inequalities as great as before. </p>
<p> This, in substance, is the teaching which we constantly hear.
It is accepted by some because it is flattering to their vanity, in
accordance with their interests or pleasing to their hope; by others,
because it is dinned into their ears. Like all false theories that
obtain wide acceptance, it contains much truth. But it is truth
isolated from other truth or alloyed with falsehood. </p>
<p> To try to pump out a ship with a hole in her hull would be
hopeless; but that is not to say that leaks may not be stopped and
ships pumped dry. It is undeniable that, under present conditions,
inequalities in fortune would tend to reassert themselves even if
arbitrarily leveled for a moment; but that does not prove that the
conditions from which this, tendency to, inequality springs may not
be altered. Nor because there are differences in human qualities and
powers does it follow that existing inequalities of fortune are thus
accounted for. I have seen very fast compositors and very slow
compositors, but the fastest I ever saw could not set twice as much
type as the slowest, and I doubt if in other trades the variations
are greater. Between normal men the difference of a sixth or seventh
is a great difference in height -- the tallest giant ever known was
scarcely more than four times as tall as the smallest dwarf ever
known, and I doubt if any good observer will say that the mental
differences of men are greater than the physical differences. Yet we
already have men hundreds of millions of times richer than other men.
</p>
<p> That he who produces should have, that he who saves should
enjoy, is consistent with human reason and with the natural order.
But existing inequalities of wealth cannot be justified on this
ground. As a matter of fact, how many great fortunes can be
truthfully said to have been fairly earned? How many of them
represent wealth produced by their possessors or those from whom
their present possessors derived them? Did there not go to the
formation of all of them something more than superior industry and
skill? Such qualities may give the first start, but when fortunes
begin to roll up into millions there will always be found some
element of monopoly, some appropriation of wealth produced by others.
Often mere is a total absence of superior industry, skill or
self-denial, and merely better luck or greater unscrupulousness.</p>
<p> <a name="Sources of Great Wealth"></a><b> Sources of Great
Wealth</b></p>
<p> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco recently,
leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in
England. I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more
temperate than he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This
man did not get his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He
no more produced it than did those lucky relations in England who may
now do nothing for the rest of their lives. He became rich by getting
hold of a piece of land in the early days, which, as San Francisco
grew, became very valuable. His wealth represented not what he had
earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of the earth's surface
enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</p>
<p> A man died in Pittsburgh, the other day, leaving $3,000,000.
He may or may not have been particularly industrious, skilful and
economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that he got
so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby
through a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against
the pauper labor of Europe," gave him the advantage of a
sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day of his death he was a stanch
protectionist, and said free trade would ruin our "infant
industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to lay by
from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by
the tariff that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's
earnings.</p>
<center>"Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of
the distribution of wealth."</center>
<p> This element of monopoly, of appropriation and spoliation
will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account for
all great fortunes....</p>
<p> Take the great Vanderbilt fortune. The first Vanderbilt was a
boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it. But it was not
working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money
enough he used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He
ran off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel.
Then he went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. The
Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working and saving than did the
fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</p>
<p> Or take the great Gould fortune. Mr. Gould might have got his
first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial. But
it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions.
It was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures,
getting up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock
values and transportation rates. </p>
<p> So, like wise, of the great fortunes which the Pacific
railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations
of Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by
monopolizing and gouging. And so of fortunes made by such
combinations as the Standard Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring,
the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and the various rings
for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper labor of
Europe." </p>
<p> Or take the fortunes made out of successful patents. Like that
element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased value of
land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I am
not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make
fortunes out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </p>
<p> Through all great fortunes, and, in fact, through nearly all
acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes, these
elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me
recently, "It is not on our ordinary business that we make our money;
it is where we can get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally
true.</p>
<p> <a name="The Evils of Monopolists"></a><b> The Evils of
Monopolists</b></p>
<p> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the
increase of land values has had, and is having, in the United States.
This is, of course, monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in
value it does not mean that its owner has added to the general
wealth. The owner may never have seen the land or done aught to
improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant city or in
another country. Increase of land values simply means that the
owners, by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed
before man was, have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth
produced by other people's labor. Consider how much the monopolies
created and the advantages given to the unscrupulous by the tariff
and by our system of internal taxation -- how much the railroad (a
business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water and other
similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and
stock-gambling, the destructive use of wealth in driving off or
buying off opposition which the public must finally pay for, and many
other things which these will suggest, have operated to build up
large fortunes, and it will at least appear that the unequal
distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many
who work little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the
earnings of the one class are, in one way or another, filched away
from them to swell the incomes of the other. </p>
<p> That individuals are constantly making their way from the
ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those
who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state of things
right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that
piracy was right and that no effort should be made to suppress
it.</p>
<p> I am not denouncing the rich, nor seeking, by speaking of
these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear
understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that it
is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which
we give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by
law and by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so
enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. If we look
around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. Capital is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
doing so.</p>
<p> There are deep wrongs in the present constitution of society,
but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
bad
adjustments which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social
state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but
in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general
stock. And in such a social state there would not be less incentive
to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive. Men will be
more industrious and more moral, better workmen and better citizens,
if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his family, than
where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them until
some have far more than they could have earned, and others have
little or nothing.<br>
