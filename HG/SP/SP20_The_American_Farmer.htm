<p align="center"><strong>The American Farmer</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter  20 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George (1883)
</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> IT is frequently asserted that no proposition for the recognition of
  common rights to land can become a practical question in the United States
  because of the opposition of the farmers who own their own farms, and who constitute
  the great body of our population, wielding when they choose to exert it a dominating
political power.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> That new ideas make their way more slowly among an agricultural population
  than among the population of cities and towns is true &#8212; though, I think,
  in less degree true of the United States than of any other country. But beyond
  this, it seems to me that those who look upon the small farmers of the United
  States as forming an impregnable bulwark to private property in land very much
  miscalculate.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>Even admitting, which I do not, that farmers could be relied upon to
  oppose measures fraught with great general benefits if seemingly opposed to
  their smaller personal interests, it is not true that such measures as I have
  suggested are opposed to the interests of the great body of farmers. On the
  contrary, these measures would be as clearly to their advantage as to the advantage
  of wage workers. The average farmer may at first start at the idea of virtually
  making land common property, but given time for discussion and reflection,
  and those who are already trying to persuade him that to put all taxation upon
  the value of land would be to put all taxation upon him, have as little chance
  of success as the slaveholders had of persuading their negroes that the Northern
  armies were bent on kidnapping and selling them in Cuba. The average farmer
  can read, write and cipher &#8212; and on matters connected with his own interests
  ciphers pretty closely. He is not out of the great currents of thought, though
  they may affect him more slowly, and he is anything but a contented peasant,
  ignorantly satisfied with things as they are, and impervious to ideas of change.
  Already dissatisfied, he is becoming more so. His hard and barren life seems
  harder and more barren as contrasted with the excitement and luxury of cities,
  of which he constantly reads even if he does not frequently see, and the great
  fortunes accumulated by men who do nothing to add to the stock of wealth arouse
  his sense of injustice. He is at least beginning to feel that he bears more
  than his fair share of the burdens of society, and gets less than his fair
  share of its benefits; and though the time for his awakening has not yet come,
  his thought, with the decadence of old political issues, is more and more turning
  to economic and social questions.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>It is clear that the change in taxation which
  I propose as the means whereby equal rights to the soil may be asserted and
  maintained, would be to
  the advantage of farmers who are working land belonging to others, of those
  whose farms are virtually owned by mortgagees, and of those who are seeking
  farms. And not only do the farmers whose opposition is relied upon &#8212;  those
  who own their own farms &#8212; form, as I shall hereafter show, but a decreasing
  minority of the agricultural vote, and a small and even more rapidly decreasing
  minority of the aggregate vote; but the change would be so manifestly to the
  advantage of the smaller farmers who constitute the great body, that when they
  come to understand it they will favor instead of opposing it. The farmer who
  cultivates his own small farm with his own hands is a landowner, it is true,
  but he is in greater degree a laborer, and in his ownership of stock, improvements,
  tools, etc., a capitalist. It is from his labor, aided by this capital, rather
  than from any advantage represented by the value of his land, that he derives
  his living. His main interest is that of a producer, not that of a landowner.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>There lived in Dublin, some years ago, a gentleman
  named Murphy &#8212;&quot;Cozy&quot; Murphy,
  they called him, for short, and because he was a very comfortable sort of a
  Murphy. Cozy Murphy owned land in Tipperary; but as he had an agent in Tipperary
  to collect his rents and evict his tenants when they did not pay, he himself
  lived in Dublin, as being the more comfortable place. And he concluded, at
  length, that the most comfortable place in Dublin, in fact the most comfortable
  place in the whole world, was &#8212; in bed. So he went to bed and stayed
  there for nearly eight years; not because he was at all ill, but because he
  liked
  it. He ate his dinners, and drank his wine, and smoked his cigars, and read,
  and played cards, and received visitors, and verified his agent's accounts
  and drew checks &#8212; all in bed. After eight years' lying in bed, he grew
  tired of it, got up, dressed himself, and for some years went around like other
  people,
  and then died. But his family were just as well off as though he had never
  gone to bed &#8212; in fact, they were better off; for while his income was
  not a whit diminished by his going to bed, his expenses were.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06]</font> This was a typical landowner &#8212; a landowner
  pure and simple. Now let the working farmer consider what would become of
  himself and family if he and
  his boys were to go to bed and stay there, and he will realize how much his
  interests as a laborer exceed his interests as a landowner.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> It requires no grasp of abstractions for the working farmer to see that
  to abolish all taxation, save upon the value of land, would be really to his
  interest, no matter how it might affect larger landholders. Let the working
  farmer consider how the weight of indirect taxation falls upon him without
  his having power to shift it off upon any one else; how it adds to the price
  of nearly everything he has to buy, without adding to the price of what he
  has to sell; how it compels him to contribute to the support of government
  in far greater proportion to what he possesses than it does those who are much
  richer, and he will see that by the substitution of direct for indirect taxation,
  he would be largely the gainer. Let him consider further, and he will see that
  he would be still more largely the gainer if direct taxation were confined
  to the value of land. The land of the working farmer is improved land, and
  usually the value of the improvements and of the stock used in cultivating
  it bears a very high proportion to the value of the bare land. Now, as all
  valuable land is not improved as is that of the working farmer, as there is
  much more of valuable land than of improved land, to substitute for the taxation
  now levied upon improvements and stock, a tax upon the naked value of land,
  irrespective of improvements, would be manifestly to the advantage of the owners
  of improved land, and especially of small owners, the value of whose improvements
  bears a much greater ratio to the value of their land than is the case with
  larger owners; and who, as one of the effects of treating improvements as a
  proper subject of taxation, are taxed far more heavily, even upon the value
  of their land, than are larger owners.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> The working farmer has only to look about him to realize this. Near by
  his farm of eighty or one hundred and sixty acres he will find tracts of five
  hundred or a thousand, or in some places, tens of thousands of acres, of equally
  valuable land, on which the improvements, stock, tools and household effects
  are much less in proportion than on his own small farm, or which may be totally
  unimproved and unused. In the villages he will find acre, half-acre and quarter-acre
  lots, unimproved or slightly improved, which are more valuable than his whole
  farm. If he looks further, he will see tracts of mineral land, or land with
  other superior natural advantages, having immense value, yet on which the taxable
  improvements amount to little or nothing; while, when he looks to the great
  cities, he will find vacant lots, twenty-five by one hundred feet, worth more
  than a whole section of agricultural land such as his; and as he goes toward
  their centers he will find most magnificent buildings less valuable than the
  ground on which they stand, and block after block where the land would sell
  for more per front foot than his whole farm. Manifestly to put all taxes on
  the value of land would be to lessen relatively and absolutely the taxes the
  working farmer has to pay.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> So far from the effect of placing all taxes upon the value of land being
  to the advantage of the towns at the expense of the agricultural districts,
  the very reverse of this is obviously true. The great increase of land values
  is in the cities, and with the present tendencies of growth this must continue
  to be the case. To place all taxes on the value of land would be to reduce
  the taxation of agricultural districts relatively to the taxation of towns
  and cities. And this would be only just; for it is not alone the presence of
  their own populations which gives value to the land of towns and cities, but
  the presence of the more scattered agricultural population, for whom they constitute
  industrial, commercial and financial centers.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10]</font> While at first blush it may seem to the farmer that to abolish all taxes
  upon other things than the value of land would be to exempt the richer inhabitants
  of cities from taxation, and unduly to tax him, discussion and reflection will
  certainly show him that the reverse is the case. Personal property is not,
  never has been, and never can be, fairly taxed. The rich man always escapes
  more easily than the man who has but little; the city, more easily than the
  country. Taxes which add to prices bear upon the inhabitants of sparsely settled
  districts with as much weight, and in many cases with much more weight, than
  upon the inhabitants of great cities. Taxes upon improvements manifestly fall
  more heavily upon the working farmer, a great part of the value of whose farm
  consists of the value of improvements, than upon the owners of valuable unimproved
  land, or upon those whose land, as that of cities, bears a higher relation
  in value to the improvements.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The truth is, that the working farmer would be an immense gainer by the
  change. Where he would have to pay more taxes on the value of his land, he
  would be released from the taxes now levied on his stock and improvements,
  and from all the indirect taxes that now weigh so heavily upon him. And as
  the effect of taxing unimproved land as heavily as though it were improved
  would be to compel mere holders to sell, and to destroy mere speculative values,
  the farmer in sparsely settled districts would have little or no taxes to pay.
  It would not be until equally good land all about him was in use, and he had
  all the advantages of a well-settled neighborhood, that his taxes would be
  more than nominal.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> What the farmer who owns his own farm would lose
  would be the selling value of his land, but its usefulness to him would be
  as great as before &#8212;  greater than before, in fact, as he would get
  larger returns from his labor upon it; and as the selling value of other land
  would be similarly affected,
  this loss would not make it harder for him to get another farm if he wished
  to move, while it would be easier for him to settle his children or to get
  more land if he could advantageously cultivate more. The loss would be nominal;
  the gain would be real. It is better for the small farmer, and especially for
  the small farmer with a growing family, that labor should be high than that
  land should be high. Paradoxical as it may appear, small landowners do not
  profit by the rise in the value of land. On the contrary they are extinguished.
  But before speaking of this let me show how much misapprehension there is in
  the assumption that the small independent farmers constitute, and will continue
  to constitute, the majority of the American people.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>Agriculture is the primitive occupation; the farmer is the American pioneer;
  and even in those cases, comparatively unimportant, where settlement is begun
  in the search for the precious metals, it does not become permanent until agriculture
  in some of its branches takes root. But as population increases and industrial
  development goes on, the relative importance of agriculture diminishes. That
  the non-agricultural population of the United States is steadily and rapidly
  gaining on the agricultural population is of course obvious. According to the
  census report the urban population of the United States was in 1790 but 3.3
  per cent. of the whole population, while in 1880 it had risen to 22.5 per cent.1
  Agriculture is yet the largest occupation, but in the aggregate other occupations
  much exceed it. According to the census, which, unsatisfactory as it is, is
  yet the only authority we have, the number of persons engaged in agriculture
  in 1880 was 7,670,493 out of 17,392,099 returned as engaged in gainful occupations
  of all kinds. Or, if we take the number of adult males as a better comparison
  of political power, we may find, with a little figuring, that the returns show
  6,491,116 males of sixteen years and over engaged in agriculture, against 7,422,639
  engaged in other occupations. According to these figures the agricultural vote
  is already in a clear minority in the United States, while the preponderance
  of the non-agricultural vote, already great, is steadily and rapidly increasing.2</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1 It is an illustration of the carelessness with which the census reports
      have been shoveled together, that although the Compendium (Table V) gives the
      urban population, no information is given as to what is meant by urban population.
      The only clue given the inquirer is that the urban population is stated to
      be contained in 286 cities. Following up this clue through other tables, I
      infer that the population of towns and cities of over 8000 people is meant.</p>
  <p>2 Comparing the returns as to occupations for 1870 with 1880, it will be
    seen that while during the last decade the increase of persons engaged in
    agriculture has been only 29.5 percent, in personal and professional services
    the increase has been 51.7 percent, in trade and transportation, 51.9 percent,
    and in manufacturing, mechanical and mining industries, 41.7 percent.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[14]</font> But while the agricultural population of the United States is thus already
    in a minority, the men who own their own farms are already in a minority in
    the agricultural population. According to the census the number of farms and
    plantations in the United States in 1880 was 4,008,907. The number of tenant
    farmers, paying money rents or share rents, is given by one of the census bulletins
    at 1,024,601. This would leave but 2,984,306 nominal owners of farms, out of
    the 7,679,493 persons employed in agriculture. The real owners of their farms
    must be greatly less even than this. The most common form of agricultural tenancy
    in the United States is not that of money or share rent, but of mortgage. What
    proportion of American farms occupied by their nominal owners are under mortgage
    we can only guess. But there can be little doubt that the number of mortgaged
    farms must largely exceed the number of rented farms, and it may not be too
    high an estimate to put the number of mortgaged farms at one-half the number
    of unrented ones.3 However this may be, it is certain that the farmers who
    really own their farms are but a minority of farmers, and a small minority
    of those engaged in agriculture.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3 Could the facts be definitely ascertained, I have not the least doubt
    that they would show that at least fifty per cent. of the small farm-ownerships
      in the older States are merely nominal That that number, at least, of the
    small
      farmers in those States are so deeply in debt, so covered by mortgages,
    that their supreme effort is to pay the constantly accruing interest, that
    a roof
      may be kept over the heads of the family &#8212; an effort that can have
      but the one ending.</p>
  <p>In the newer States is found a similar condition of things. The only difference
      is, that there the small farmer is usually compelled to commence with what,
      to him, is a mountain of debt. He must obtain his land upon deferred payments,
      drawing interest, and can obtain no title until those deferred payments, with
      the interest, are paid in full. He must also obtain his farm implements on
      part credit, with interest, for which he mortgages his crops. Credit must help
      him to his farm stock, his hovel, his seed, his food, his clothing. With this
      load of debt must the small farmer in the newer States commence, if he is not
      a capitalist, or he cannot even make a beginning. With such a commencement
      the common ending is not long in being found.</p>
  <p>In traveling through those sections, one of the most notable things that
    meets the attention of the observer is the great number of publications,
    everywhere
      met with, devoted exclusively to the advertising of small farm holdings,
    more or less improved, that are for sale. One is almost forced to the conclusion
      that the entire class of small farmers are compelled, from some cause,
    to find
      the best and quickest market that can be obtained for all that they possess.</p>
  <p>The entire agricultural regions of our country are crowded with loan agents,
      representing capital from all the great money centers of the world, who
    are making loans and taking mortgages upon the farms to an amount that, in
    aggregate,
      appears to be almost beyond calculation. In this movement the local capitalists,
      lawyers and traders appear as active co-workers. &#8212; <em>Land and Labor
      in the United States</em>, by William Godwin Moody, New York, 1883, p.85.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[15]</font> Further than this, all the tendencies of the time
  are to the extinction of the typical American farmer &#8212; the man who cultivates
  his own acres with his own hands. This movement has only recently begun, but
  it is going on, and
  must go on, under present conditions, with increasing rapidity. The remarkable
  increase in the large farms and diminution in the small ones, shown by the
  analysis of the census figures which will be found in the Appendix, is but
  evidence of the fact &#8212; too notorious to need the proof of figures&#8212;  that
  the tendency to concentration, which in so many other branches of industry
  has substituted the factory for self-employing workmen, has reached agriculture.
  One invention after another has already given the large farmer a crushing advantage
  over the small farmer; and invention is still going on.4 And it is not merely
  in the making of his crops, but in their transportation and marketing, and
  in the purchase of his supplies, that the large producer in agriculture gains
  an advantage over the small one. To talk, as some do, about the bonanza farms
  breaking up in a little while into small homesteads, is as foolish as to talk
  of the great shoe-factory giving way again to journeymen shoemakers with their
  lap-stones and awls. The bonanza farm and the great wire-fenced stock-ranch
  have come to stay while present conditions last. If they show themselves first
  on new land, it is because there is on new land the greatest freedom of development,
  but the tendency exists wherever modern industrial influences are felt, and
  is showing itself in the British Isles as well as in our older States.5</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>4 One of the most important agricultural inventions yet made is just announced
      in the long-sought cotton-picker. If this machine will do what is said to have
      been already demonstrated, it must revolutionize the industry of the cotton
      States, and produce as far-reaching social and political effects as the invention
      of the cotton-gin which revived and extended negro slavery in the United States,
      and made it an aggressive political power.</p>
  <p>5 The persistence of small properties in some parts of the continent of Europe
      is due, I take it, to the prevalence of habits differing from those of the
      people of English speech, and to the fact that modern tendencies are not yet
      felt there as strongly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>This tendency means the extirpation of the typical American farmer, who
  with his own hands and the aid of his boys cultivates his own small farm. When
  a Brooklyn lawyer or Boston banker can take a run in a palace-car out to the
  New Northwest; buy some sections of land; contract for having it broken up,
  seeded, reaped and threshed; leave on it a superintendent, and make a profit
  on his first year's crop of from six to ten thousand dollars a section, what
  chance has the emigrant farmer of the old type who comes toiling along in the
  wagon which contains his wife and children, and the few traps that with his
  team constitute his entire capital? When English and American capitalists can
  run miles of barbed-wire fence, and stock the great inclosure with large herds
  of cattle, which can be tended, carried to market, and sold, at the minimum
  of expense and maximum of profit, what chance has the man who would start stock-raising
  with a few cows?</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>From the typical American farmer of the era now
  beginning to pass away, two types are differentiating &#8212; the capitalist
  farmer and the farm-laborer. The former does not work with his own hands, but
  with the hands of other men.
  He passes but a portion of his time, in some cases hardly any of it, upon the
  land he cultivates. His home is in a large town or great city, and he is, perhaps,
  a banker and speculator as well as a farmer. The latter is a proletarian, a
  nomad &#8212; part of the year a laborer and part of the year a tramp, migrating
  from farm to farm and from place to place, without family or home or any of
  the influences and responsibilities that develop manly character. If our treatment
  of land continues as now, some of our small independent farmers will tend toward
  one of these extremes, and many more will tend toward the other. But besides
  the tendency to production on a large scale, which is operating to extirpate
  the small independent farmer, there is, in the rise of land values, another
  powerful tendency operating in the same direction.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18] </font>At the looting of the Summer Palace at Pekin by the allied forces in
  1860, some valuable jewels were obtained by private soldiers. How long did
  they remain in such possession? If a Duke of Brunswick were to distribute his
  hoard of diamonds among the poor, how long would the poor continue to hold
  them? The peasants of Ireland and the costermongers of London have their donkeys,
  which are worth only a few shillings. But if by any combination of circumstances
  the donkey became as valuable as a blooded horse, no peasant or costermonger
  would be found driving a donkey. Where chickens are cheap, the common people
  eat them; where they are dear, they are to be found only on the tables of the
  rich. So it is with land. As it becomes valuable it must gravitate from the
  hands of those who work for a living into the possession of the rich.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19]</font> What has caused the extreme concentration of landownership in England
  is not so much the conversion of the feudal tenures into fee simple, the spoliation
  of the religious houses and the inclosure of the commons, as this effect of
  the rise in the value of land. The small estates, of which there were many
  in England two centuries and even a century ago,6 have become parts of large
  estates mainly by purchase. They gravitated to the possession of the rich,
  just as diamonds, or valuable paintings, or fine horses, gravitate to the possession
  of the rich.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>6According to Macaulay, at the accession of James II, in 1685, the majority
      of English farmers were owners of the land they cultivated. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[20]</font> So long as the masses are fools enough to permit private property in
  land, it is rightly esteemed the most secure possession. It cannot be burned,
  or destroyed by any accident; it cannot be carried off; it tends constantly
  to increase in value with the growth of population and improvement in the arts.
  Its possession being a visible sign of secure wealth, and putting its owner,
  as competition becomes sharp, in the position of a lord or god to the human
  creatures who have no legal rights to this planet, carries with it social consideration
  and deference. For these reasons land commands a higher price in proportion
  to the income it yields than anything else, and the man to whom immediate income
  is of more importance than a secure investment finds it cheaper to rent land
  than to buy it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21]</font> Thus, as land grew in value in England, the small owners were not merely
  tempted or compelled by the vicissitudes of life to sell their land, but it
  became more profitable to them to sell it than to hold it, as they could hire
  land cheaper than they could hire capital. By selling and then renting, the
  English farmer, thus converted from a landowner into a tenant, acquired, for
  a time at least, the use of more land and more capital, and the ownership of
  land thus gravitated from the hands of those whose prime object is to get a
  living into the hands of those whose prime object is a secure investment.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22] </font>This process must go on in the United States as land rises in value.
  We may observe it now. It is in the newer parts of our growing cities that
  we find people of moderate means living in their own houses. Where land is
  more valuable, we find such people living in rented houses. In such cities,
  block after block is built and sold, generally under mortgage, to families
  who thus endeavor to secure a home of their own. But I think it is the general
  experience, that as years pass by, and land acquires a greater value, these
  houses and lots pass from the nominal ownership of dwellers into the possession
  of landlords, and are occupied by tenants. So, in the agricultural districts,
  it is where land has increased little if anything in value that we find homesteads
  which have been long in the possession of the same family of working farmers.
  A general officer of one of the great trunk railroad lines told me that his
  attention had been called to the supreme importance of the land question by
  the great westward emigration of farmers, which, as the result of extensive
  inquiries, he found due to the rise of land values As land rises in value the
  working farmer finds it more and more difficult for his boys to get farms of
  their own, while the price for which be can sell will give him a considerably
  larger tract of land where land is cheaper; or he is tempted or forced to mortgage,
  and the mortgage eats and eats until it eats him out, or until he concludes
  that the wisest thing he can do is to realize the difference between the mortgage
  and the selling value of his farm and emigrate west. And in many cases he commences
  again under the load of a mortgage; for as settlement is now going, very much
  of the land sold to settlers by railroad companies and speculators is sold
  upon mortgage. And what is the usual result may be inferred from such announcements
  as those placarded in the union depot at Council Bluffs, offering thousands
  of improved farms for sale on liberal terms as to payment. One man buys upon
  mortgage, fails in his payments, or gets disgusted, and moves on, and the farm
  he has improved is sold to another man upon mortgage. Generally speaking, the
  ultimate result is, that the mortgagee, not the mortgageor, becomes the full
  owner. Cultivation under mortgage is, in truth, the transitional form between
  cultivation by the small owner and cultivation by the large owner or by tenant.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23]</font> The fact is, that the typical American farmer, the cultivator of a small
  farm of which he is the owner, is the product of conditions under which labor
  is dear and land is cheap. As these conditions change, labor becoming cheap
  and land becoming dear, he must pass away as he has passed away in England.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[24]</font> It has already become impossible in our older States for a man starting
  with nothing to become by his labor the owner of a farm. As the public domain
  disappears this will become impossible all over the United States. And as in
  the accidents and mutations of life the small owners are shaken from their
  holdings, or find it impossible to compete with the grand culture of capitalistic
  farming, they will not be able to recover, and must swell the mass of tenants
  and laborers. Thus the concentration of landownership is proceeding, and must
  proceed, if private property in land be continued. So far from it being to
  the interest of the working farmer to defend private property in land, its
  continued recognition means that his children, if not himself, shall lose all
  right whatever in their native soil; shall sink from the condition of freemen
  to that of serfs.<br />
