<p align="center"><strong>The Rights of Man</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 10 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George (1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> THERE are those who, when it suits their purpose, say that there are
  no natural rights, but that all rights spring from the grant of the sovereign
  political power. It were waste of time to argue with such persons. There are
  some facts so obvious as to be beyond the necessity of argument. And one of
  these facts, attested by universal consciousness, is that there are rights
  as between man and man which existed before the formation of government, and
  which continue to exist in spite of the abuse of government; that there is
  a higher law than any human law &#8212; to wit, the law of the Creator, impressed
  upon and revealed through nature, which is before and above human laws, and
  upon conformity to which all human laws must depend for their validity. To
  deny this is to assert that there is no standard whatever by which the rightfulness
  or wrongfulness of laws and institutions can be measured; to assert that there
  can be no actions in themselves right and none in themselves wrong; to assert
  that an edict which commanded mothers to kill their children should receive
  the same respect as a law prohibiting infanticide.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02] </font>These natural rights, this higher law, form the only true and sure basis
  for social organization. Just as, if we would construct a successful machine,
  we must conform to physical laws, such as the law of gravitation, the law of
  combustion, the law of expansion, etc.; just as, if we would maintain bodily
  health, we must conform to the laws of physiology; so, if we would have a peaceful
  and healthful social state, we must conform our institutions to the great moral
  laws &#8212; laws to which we are absolutely subject, and which are as much
  above our control as are the laws of matter and of motion. And as, when we
  find that
  a machine will not work, we infer that in its construction some law of physics
  has been ignored or defied, so when we find social disease and political evils
  may we infer that in the organization of society moral law has been defied
  and the natural rights of man have been ignored.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03]</font> These natural rights of man are thus set forth in the American Declaration
  of Independence as the basis upon which alone legitimate government can rest:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-2">[04] </font>We hold these truths to be self-evident &#8212; that
      all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
    certain unalienable rights;
      that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that,
    to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their
    just
      powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government
      becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter
    or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundations
    on
      such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as shall seem
    to them most likely to effect their safety and happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>So does the preamble to the Constitution of the United States appeal
  to the same principles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-2">[06] </font>We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect
    union, <em>establish</em> justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common
    defense, promote the general welfare, <em>and secure the blessings of liberty
    to ourselves and our posterity</em>, do ordain and establish this Constitution for
    the United States of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>And so, too, is the same fundamental and self-evident truth set forth
  in that grand Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens, issued by the
  National Assembly of France in 1789:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-2">[08]</font> The representatives of the people of France, formed into a National
    Assembly, considering that ignorance, neglect, or contempt of human rights
    are the sole causes of public misfortunes and corruptions of government, have
    resolved to set forth, in a Solemn declaration, those natural, imprescriptible
    and inalienable rights, [and do] recognize and declare, in the presence of
    the Supreme Being, and with the hope of His blessing and favor, the following
    sacred rights of men and of citizens:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-2">[09]</font> I. Men are born and always continue free and equal in respect of their
      rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can only be founded on public utility.</p>
    <p> <font size="-2">[10]</font> II. The end of all political associations is the preservation of the
      natural and imprescriptible rights of man, and these rights are liberty, property,
      security, and resistance of oppression.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>It is one thing to assert the eternal principles,
  as they are asserted in times of upheaval, when men of convictions and of the
  courage of their convictions
  come to the front, and another thing for a people just emerging from the night
  of ignorance and superstition, and enslaved by habits of thought formed by
  injustice and oppression, to adhere to and carry them out. The French people
  have not been true to these principles, nor yet, with far greater advantages,
  have we. And so, though the ancient regime, with its blasphemy of &quot;right
  divine,&quot; its Bastille and its <em>lettres-de-cachet</em>, has been abolished
  in France; there have come red terror and white terror, Anarchy masquerading
  as
  Freedom, and Imperialism deriving its sanction from universal suffrage, culminating
  in such a poor thing as the French Republic of today. And here, with our virgin
  soil, with our exemption from foreign complications, and our freedom from powerful
  and hostile neighbors, all we can show is another poor thing of a Republic,
  with its rings and its bosses, its railroad kings controlling sovereign states,
  its gangrene of corruption eating steadily toward the political heart, its
  tramps and its strikes, its ostentation of ill-gotten wealth, its children
  toiling in factories, and its women working out their lives for bread.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> It is possible for men to see the truth, and assert the truth, and to
  hear and repeat, again and again, formulas embodying the truth, without realizing
  all that that truth involves. Men who signed the Declaration of Independence,
  or applauded the Declaration of Independence, men who year after year read
  it, and heard it, and honored it, did so without thinking that the eternal
  principles of right which it invoked condemned the existence of negro slavery
  as well as the tyranny of George III. And many who, awakening to the fuller
  truth, asserted the unalienable rights of man against chattel slavery, did
  not see that these rights involved far more than the denial of property in
  human flesh and blood; and as vainly imagined that they had fully asserted
  them when chattel slaves had been emancipated and given the suffrage, as their
  fathers vainly imagined they had fully asserted them, when they threw off allegiance
  to the English king and established here a democratic republic.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>The common belief of Americans of today is that among us the equal and
  unalienable rights of man are now all acknowledged, while as for poverty, crime,
  low wages, &quot;over-production,&quot; political corruption, and so on, they
  are to be referred to the nature of things &#8212; that is to say, if any
  one presses for a more definite answer, they exist because it is the will of
  God, the Creator,
  that they should exist. Yet I believe that these evils are demonstrably due
  to our failure fully to acknowledge the equal and unalienable rights with which,
  as asserted as a self-evident truth by the Declaration of Independence, all
  men have been endowed by God, their Creator. I believe the National Assembly
  of France were right when, a century ago, inspired by the same spirit that
  gave us political freedom, they declared that the great cause of public misfortunes
  and corruptions of government is ignorance, neglect or contempt of human rights.
  And just as the famine which was then decimating France, the bankruptcy and
  corruption of her government, the brutish degradation of her working-classes,
  and the demoralization of her aristocracy, were directly traceable to the denial
  of the equal, natural and imprescriptible rights of men, so now the social
  and political problems which menace the American Republic, in common with the
  whole civilized world, spring from the same cause.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>Let us consider the matter. The equal, natural and unalienable right
  to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, does it not involve the right
  of each to the free use of his powers in making a living for himself and his
  family, limited only by the equal right of all others? Does it not require
  that each shall be free to make, to save and to enjoy what wealth he may, without
  interference with the equal rights of others; that no one shall be compelled
  to give forced labor to another, or to yield up his earnings to another; that
  no one shall be permitted to extort from another labor or earnings? All this
  goes without the saying. Any recognition of the equal right to life and liberty
  which would deny the right to property &#8212; the right of a man to his labor
  and to the full fruits of his labor &#8212; would be mockery.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>But that is just what we do. Our so-called recognition of the equal and
  natural rights of man is to large classes of our people nothing but a mockery,
  and as social pressure increases, is becoming a more bitter mockery to larger
  classes, because our institutions fail to secure the rights of men to their
  labor and the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>That this denial of a primary human right is the cause of poverty on
  the one side and of overgrown fortunes on the other, and of all the waste and
  demoralization and corruption that flow from the grossly unequal distribution
  of wealth, may be easily seen.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17]</font> As I am speaking of conditions general over the whole civilized world,
  let us first take the case of another country, for we can sometimes see the
  faults of our neighbors more clearly than our own. England, the country from
  which we derive our language and institutions, is behind us in the formal recognition
  of political liberty; but there is as much industrial liberty there as here
  &#8212; and in some respects more, for England, though she has not yet reached
  free trade, has got rid of the &quot;protective&quot; swindle, which we still hug.
  And the English people &#8212; poor things &#8212; are, as a whole, satisfied
  with their freedom, and boast of it. They think, for it has been so long preached
  to them
  that most of them honestly believe it, that Englishmen are the freest people
  in the world, and they sing &quot;Britons never shall be slaves,&quot; as though
  it were indeed true that slaves could not breathe British air.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18]</font> Let us take a man of the masses of this people &#8212;  a &quot;free-born
  Englishman,&quot; coming
  of long generations of &quot;free-born Englishmen,&quot; in Wiltshire or Devonshire
  or Somersetshire, on soil which, if you could trace his genealogy, you would
  find his fathers have been tilling from early Saxon times. He grows to manhood,
  we will not stop to inquire how, and, as is the natural order, he takes himself
  a wife. Here he stands, a man among his fellows, in a world in which the Creator
  has ordained that he should get a living by his labor. He has wants, and as,
  in the natural order, children come to him, he will have more; but he has in
  brain and muscle the natural power to satisfy these wants from the storehouse
  of nature. He knows how to dig and plow, to sow and to reap, and there is the
  rich soil, ready now, as it was thousands of years ago, to give back wealth
  to labor. The rain falls and the sun shines, and as the planet circles around
  her orbit, spring follows winter, and summer succeeds spring. It is this man's
  first and clearest right to earn his living, to transmute his labor into wealth,
  and to possess and enjoy that wealth for his own sustenance and benefit, and
  for the sustenance and benefit of those whom nature places in dependence on
  him. He has no right to demand any one else's earnings, nor has any one else
  a right to demand any portion of his earnings. He has no right to compel any
  one else to work for his benefit; nor have others a right to demand that he
  shall work for their benefit. This right to himself, to the use of his own
  powers and the results of his own exertions, is a natural, self-evident right,
  which, as a matter of principle, no one can dispute, save upon the blasphemous
  contention that some men were created to work for other men. And this primary,
  natural right to his own labor, and to the fruits of his own labor, accorded,
  this man can abundantly provide for his own needs and for the needs of his
  family. His labor will, in the natural order, produce wealth, which, exchanged
  in accordance with mutual desires for wealth which others have produced, will
  supply his family with all the material comforts of life, and in the absence
  of serious accident, enable him to bring up his children, and lay by such a
  surplus that he and his wife may take their rest, and enjoy their sunset hour
  in the declining years when strength shall fail, without asking any one's alms
  or being beholden to any bounty save that of &quot;Our Father which art in
  heaven.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19] </font>But what is the fact? The fact is, that the right
  of this &quot;free-born
  Englishman &quot; to his own labor and the fruits of his labor is denied as
  fully and completely as though he were made by law a slave; that he is compelled
  to work for the enrichment of others as truly as though English law had made
  him the property of an owner. The law of the land does not declare that he
  is a slave: on the contrary, it formally declares that he is a free man &#8212;  free
  to work for himself, and free to enjoy the fruits of his labor. But a man cannot
  labor without something to labor on, any more than he can eat without
  having something to eat. It is not in human powers to make something out of
  nothing. This is not contemplated in the creative scheme. Nature tells us that
  if we will not work we must starve; but at the same time supplies us with everything
  necessary to work. Food, clothing, shelter, all the articles that minister
  to desire and that we call wealth, can be produced by labor, but only when
  the raw material of which they must be composed is drawn from the land.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20] </font>To drop a man in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and tell him he is
  at liberty to walk ashore, would not be more bitter irony than to place a man
  where all the land is appropriated as the property of other people and to tell
  him that he is a free man, at liberty to work for himself and to enjoy his
  own earnings. That is the situation in which our Englishman finds himself.
  He is just as free as he would be were he suspended over a precipice while
  somebody else held a sharp knife to the rope; just as free as if thirsting
  in a desert he found the only spring for miles walled and guarded by armed
  men who told him he could not drink unless he freely contracted with them on
  their terms. Had this Englishman lived generations ago, in the time of his
  Saxon ancestors, he would, when he became of age, and had taken a wife, have
  been allotted his house-plot and his seed-plot; he would have had an equal
  share in the great fields which the villagers cultivated together, he would
  have been free to gather his fagots or take game in the common wood, or to
  graze his beasts on the common pasturage. Even a few generations ago, after
  the land-grabbing that began with the Tudors had gone on for some centuries,
  he would have found in yet existing commons some faint survival of the ancient
  principle that this planet was intended for all men, not for some men. But
  now he finds every foot of land inclosed against him. The fields which his
  forefathers tilled, share and share alike, are the private property of &quot;my
  lord,&quot; who rents it out to large farmers on terms so high that, to get
  ordinary interest on their capital, they must grind the faces of their laborers;
  the ancient woodland is inclosed by a high wall, topped with broken glass,
  and is patroled by gamekeepers with loaded guns and the authority to take any
  intruder before the magistrate, who will send him to prison; the old-time common
  has become &quot;my lord's&quot; great park, on which his fat cattle graze,
  and his supple-limbed deer daintily browse. Even the old foot-paths that gave
  short cuts from road to road, through hazel thicket and by tinkling brook,
  are now walled in.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>Yet this &quot;free-born Englishman,&quot; this Briton who never shall
  be a slave, cannot live without land. He must find some bit of the earth's
  surface on which he and his wife can rest, which they may call &quot;home.&quot; But,
  save the highroads, there is not as much of their native land as they may cover
  with the soles of their feet, that they can use without some other human creature's
  permission; and on the highroad they would not be suffered to lie down, still
  less to make them a bower of leaves. So, to get living space in his native
  land, our &quot;free-born Englishman&quot; must consent to work so many days
  in the month for one of the &quot;owners&quot; of England, or, what amounts
  to the same thing, he must sell his labor, or the fruits of his labor, to some
  third party and pay the &quot;owner&quot; of some particular part of the planet
  for the privilege of living on the planet. Having thus sacrificed a part of
  his labor to get permission from another fellow-creature to live, if he can,
  our &quot;freeborn Englishman&quot; must next go to work to procure food, clothing,
  etc. But as he cannot get to work without land to work on, he is compelled,
  instead of going to work for himself, to sell his labor to those who have land,
  on such terms as they please, and those terms are only enough just to support
  life in the most miserable fashion &#8212; that is to say, all the produce
  of his labor is taken from him, and he is given back out of it just what the
  hardest
  owner would be forced to give the slave &#8212; enough to support life on.
  He lives in a miserable hovel, with its broken floor on the bare ground, and
  an ill-kept
  thatch, through which the rain comes. He works from morning to night, and his
  wife must do the same and their children, as soon almost as they can walk,
  must also go to work, pulling weeds, or scaring away crows, or doing such like
  jobs for the landowner, who graciously lets them live and work on his land.
  Illness often comes, and death too often. Then there is no recourse but the
  parish or &quot;My Lady Bountiful,&quot; the wife or daughter or almoner of &quot;the
  God Almighty of the countryside,&quot; as Tennyson calls him &#8212; the owner
  (if not the maker) of the world in these parts &#8212; who doles out in insulting
  and degrading charity some little stint of the wealth appropriated from the
  labor
  of this family and of other such families. If he does not &quot;order himself
  lowly and reverently to all his betters;&quot; if he does not pull his poor
  hat off his sheepish head whenever &quot;my lord&quot; or &quot;my lady,&quot; or &quot;his
  honor,&quot; or any of their understrappers, go by; if he does not bring up
  his children in the humility which these people think proper and becoming in
  the &quot;lower classes;&quot; if there is suspicion that he may have helped
  himself to an apple or snared a hare, or slyly hooked a fish from the stream,
  this &quot;free-born Englishman &quot; loses charity and loses work. He must
  go on the parish or starve. He becomes bent and stiff before his time. His
  wife is old and worn, when she ought to be in her prime of strength and beauty.
  His girls &#8212; such as live &#8212; marry such as he, to lead such lives
  as their mother's, or, perhaps, are seduced by their &quot;betters,&quot; and
  sent, with a few pounds, to a great town, to die in a few years in brothel,
  or hospital,
  or prison. His boys grow up ignorant and brutish; they cannot support him when
  he grows old, even if they would, for they do not get back enough of the proceeds
  of their labor. The only refuge for the pair in their old age is the almshouse,
  where, for shame to let them starve on the roadside, these worked-out slaves
  are kept to die &#8212; where the man is separated from the wife, and the
  old couple, over whom the parson of the church, by law established, has said, &quot;Whom
  God hath joined together let no man put asunder,&quot; lead, apart from each
  other, a prison-like existence until death comes to their relief.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22]</font> In what is the condition of such a &quot;free-born
  Englishman&quot; as
  this, better than that of a slave? Yet if this is not a fair picture of the
  condition of the English agricultural laborers, it is only because I have not
  dwelt upon the darkest shades &#8212; the sodden ignorance and brutality,
  the low morality of these degraded and debased classes. In quantity and quality
  of
  food, in clothing and housing, in ease and recreation, and in morality, there
  can be no doubt that the average Southern slave was better off than the average
  agricultural laborer is in England today &#8212; that his life was healthier
  and happier and fuller. So long as a plump, well-kept, hearty negro was worth
  $1000,
  no slave-owner, selfish or cold-blooded as he might be, would keep his negroes
  as &quot;free-born Englishmen&quot; must live. But these white slaves have
  no money value. It is not the labor, it is the land that commands the labor,
  that has a capitalized value. You can get the labor of men for from nine to
  twelve shillings a week &#8212; less than it would cost to keep a slave in
  good marketable condition; and of children for sixpence a week, and when they
  are
  worked out they can be left to die or &quot;go on the parish.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23] </font>The negroes, some say, are an inferior race. But these white slaves of
  England are of the stock that has given England her scholars and her poets,
  her philosophers and statesmen, her merchants and inventors, who have formed
  the bulwark of the sea-girt isle, and have carried the meteor flag around the
  world. They are ignorant, and degraded, and debased; they live the life of
  slaves and die the death of paupers, simply because they are robbed of their
  natural rights.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[24] </font>In the same neighborhood in which you may find such people as these,
  in which you may see squalid laborers' cottages where human beings huddle together
  like swine, you may also see grand mansions set in great, velvety, oak-graced
  parks, the habitations of local &quot;God Almighties,&quot; as the Laureate
  styles them, and as these brutalized English people seem almost to take them
  to be. They never do any work &#8212; they pride themselves upon the fact
  that for hundreds of years their ancestors have never done any work; they look
  with
  the utmost contempt not merely upon the man who works, but even on the man
  whose grandfather hand to work. Yet they live in the utmost luxury. They have
  town houses and country houses, horses, carriages, liveried servants, yachts,
  packs of hounds; they have all that wealth can command i the way of literature
  and education and the culture of travel. And they have wealth to spare, which
  they can invest in railway shares, or public debts, or in buying up land in
  the United States. But not an iota of this wealth do they produce. They get
  it because, it being conceded that they own the land, the people who do produce
  wealth must hand their earnings over to them.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[25]</font> Here, clear and plain, is the beginning and primary cause of that inequality
  in the distribution of wealth which, in England, produces such dire, soul-destroying
  poverty, side by side with such wantonness of luxury, then in the country.
  Here, clear and plain, is the reason why labor seems a drug, and why, in all
  occupations in which mere laborers can engage, wages tend to the merest pittance
  on which life can be maintained. Deprived of their natural rights to land,
  treated as intruders upon God's earth, men are compelled to an unnatural competition
  for the privilege of mere animal existence, that in manufacturing towns and
  city slums reduces humanity to a depth of misery and debasement in which beings,
  created in the image of God, sink below the level of the brutes.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[26] </font>And the same inequality of conditions which we see beginning here, is
  it not due to the same primary cause? American citizenship confers no right
  to American soil. The first and most essential rights of man &#8212; the rights
