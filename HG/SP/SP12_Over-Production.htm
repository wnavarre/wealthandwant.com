<p align="center"><strong>Over-Production</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 12 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by
  Henry George (1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> THAT, as declared by the French Assembly, public misfortunes and corruptions
  of government spring from ignorance, neglect or contempt of human rights, may
  be seen from whatever point we look.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02] </font>Consider this matter of &quot;over-production&quot; of which we hear
  so much &#8212; to which is so commonly attributed dullness of trade and the
  difficulty of finding employment. What, when we come to think of it, can be
  more preposterous
  than to speak in any general sense of over-production? Over-production of wealth
  when there is everywhere a passionate struggle for more wealth; when so many
  must stint and strain and contrive, to get a living; when there is poverty
  and actual want among large classes! Manifestly there cannot be over-production,
  in any general and absolute sense, until desires for wealth are all satisfied;
  until no one wants more wealth.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03]</font> Relative over-production, of course, there may be. The production of
  certain commodities may be so far in excess of the proper proportion to the
  production of other commodities that the whole quantity produced cannot be
  exchanged for enough of those other commodities to give the usual returns to
  the labor and capital engaged in bringing them to market. But this relative
  over-production is merely disproportionate production. It may proceed from
  increased production of things of one kind, or from decreased production of
  things of other kinds.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>Thus, what we would call an over-production of watches &#8212;  meaning not that more watches had been produced than were wanted, but that
  more had been
  produced than could be sold at a remunerative price &#8212; would be purely
  relative. It might arise from an increase in the production of watches, outrunning
  the
  ability to purchase watches; or from a decrease in the production of other
  things, lessening the ability to purchase watches. No matter how much the production
  of watches were to increase, within the limits of the desire for watches, it
  would not be over-production, if at the same time the production of other things
  increased sufficiently to allow a proportionally increased quantity of other
  things to be given for the increased quantity of watches. And no matter how
  much the production of watches might be decreased, there would be relative
  over-production, if at the same time the production of other things were decreased
  in such proportion as to diminish in greater degree the ability to give other
  things for watches.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> In short, desire continuing, the over-production of particular commodities
  can be only relative to the production of other commodities, and may result
  from unduly increased production in some branches of industry, or from the
  checking of production in other branches. But while the phenomena of over-production
  may thus arise from causes directly operating to increase production, or from
  causes directly operating to check production, just as the equipoise of a pair
  of scales may be disturbed by the addition or the removal of a weight, there
  are certain symptoms by which we may determine from which of these two kinds
  of causes any disturbance proceeds. For while to a limited extent, and in a
  limited field, these diverse causes may produce similar effects, their general
  effects will be widely different. The increase of production in any branch
  of industry tends to the general increase of production; the checking of production
  in any branch of industry tends to the general checking of production.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>This may be seen from the different general effects which follow increase
  or diminution of production in the same branch of industry. Let us suppose
  that from the discovery of new mines, the improvement of machinery, the breaking
  up of combinations that control it, or any other cause, there is a great and
  rapid increase in the production of coal, out of proportion to the increase
  of other production. In a free market the price of coal therefore falls. The
  effect is to enable all consumers of coal somewhat to increase their consumption
  of coal, and somewhat to increase their consumption of other things, and to
  stimulate production, by reducing cost, in all those branches of industry into
  which the use of coal directly or indirectly enters. Thus the general effect
  is to increase production, and to beget a tendency to re&acute;stablish the
  equilibrium between the production of coal and the production of other things,
  by raising the aggregate production.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> But let the coal operators and syndicates, as
  they frequently do, determine to stop or reduce the production of coal in order
  to raise prices. At once
  a large body of men engaged in producing coal find their power of purchasing
  cut off or decreased. Their demand for commodities they habitually use thus
  falls off; demand and production in other branches of industry are lessened,
  and other consumers, in turn, are obliged to decrease their demands. At the
  same time the enhancement in the price of coal tends to increase the cost of
  production in all branches of industry in which coal is used, and to diminish
  the amount both of coal and of other things which the users of coal can call
  for. Thus the check to production is perpetuated through all branches of industry,
  and when the re-establishment of equilibrium between the production of
  coal and the production of other things is effected, it is on a diminished
  scale of aggregate production.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>All trade, it is to be remembered, is the exchange of commodities for
  commodities &#8212; money being merely the measure of values and the instrument
  for conveniently and economically effecting exchanges. Demand (which is a different
  thing from desire, as it involves purchasing power) is the asking for things
  in exchange for an equivalent value of other things. Supply is the offering
  of things in exchange for an equivalent value of other things. These terms
  are therefore relative; demand involves supply, and supply involves demand.
  Whatever increases the quantity of things offered in exchange for other things
  at once inereases supply and augments demand. And, reversely, whatever checks
  the bringing of things to market at once reduces supply and decreases demand.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>Thus, while the same primary effect upon the relative supply of and demand
  for any particular commodity or group of commodities may be caused either by
  augmentation of the supply of such commodities, or by reduction in the supply
  of other commodities &#8212; in the one case, the general effect will be to
  stimulate trade, by calling out greater supplies of other commodities, and
  increasing
  aggregate demand; and in the other case, to depress trade, by lessening aggregate
  demand and diminishing supply. The equation of supply and demand between agricultural
  productions and manufactured goods might thus be altered in the same direction
  and to the same extent by such prosperous seasons or improvements in agriculture
  as would reduce the price of agricultural productions as compared with manufactured
  goods, or by such restrictions upon the production or exchange of manufactured
  goods as would raise their price as compared with agricultural productions.
  But in the one case, the aggregate produce of the community would be increased.
  There would be not only an increase of agricultural products, but the increased
  demand thus caused would stimulate the production of manufactured goods; while
  this prosperity in manufacturing industries, by enabling those engaged in them
  to increase their demand for agricultural productions, would react upon agriculture.
  In the other case, the aggregate produce would be decreased. The increase in
  the price of manufactured goods would compel farmers to reduce their demands,
  and this would in turn reduce the ability of those engaged in manufacturing
  to demand farm products. Thus trade would slacken, and production be checked
  in all directions. That this is so, we may see from the different general effects
  which result from good crops and poor crops, though to an individual farmer
  high prices may compensate for a poor yield.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>To recapitulate: Relative over-production may proceed from causes which
  increase, or from causes which diminish, production. But increased production
  in any branch of industry tends to increase production in all; to stimulate
  trade and augment the general prosperity; and any disturbance of equilibrium
  thus caused must be speedily readjusted. Diminished production in any branch
  of industry, on the other hand, tends to decrease production in all; to depress
  trade and lessen the general prosperity; and depression thus produced tends
  to perpetuate itself through larger circles, as in one branch of industry after
  another the check to production reduces the power to demand the products of
  other branches of industry.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>Whoever will consider the wide-spread phenomena which are currently attributed
  to over-production can have no doubt from which of these two classes of causes
  they spring. He will see that they are symptoms, not of the excess of production,
  but of the restriction and strangulation of production.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> There are with us many restrictions of production, direct and indirect;
  for production, it must be remembered, involves the transportation and exchange
  as well as the making of things. And restrictions imposed upon commerce or
  any of its instruments may operate to discourage production as fully as restrictions
  imposed upon agriculture or manufactures. The tariff which we maintain for
  the express purpose of hampering our foreign commerce, and restricting the
  free exchange of our own productions for the productions of other nations,
  is in effect a restriction upon production. The monopolies which we have created
  or permitted to grow up, and which levy their toll upon internal commerce,
  or by conspiracy and combination diminish supply and artificially enhance prices,
  restrict production in the same way; while the taxes levied upon certain manufactures
  by our internal revenue system directly restrict production.*</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> *Whether taxes upon liquor and tobacco can be defended upon other grounds
    is not here in question. What Adam Smith says upon this point may, however,
  be worth quoting:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> &quot;If we consult experience, the cheapness of wine seems to be a
      cause, not of drunkenness, but of sobriety. The inhabitants of the wine countries
      are in general the soberest people in Europe; witness the Spaniards, the Italians,
      and the inhabitants of the southern provinces of France. People are seldom
      guilty of excess in what is their daily fare. Nobody affects the character
      of liberality and good fellowship, by being profuse of a liquor which is as
      cheap as small beer. On the, contrary, in the countries which, either from
      excessive heat or cold, produce no grapes, and where wine consequently is dear,
      and a rarity, drunkenness is a common vice, as among the northern nations,
      and all those who live between the tropics &#8212; the negroes, for example,
      on the coast of Guinea. When a French regiment comes from some of the northern
      provinces of France, where wine is somewhat dear, to be quartered in the southern,
      where it is very cheap, the soldiers, I have frequently heard it observed,
      are at first debauched by the cheapness and novelty of good wine; but after
      a few months' residence, the greater part of them become as sober as the rest
      of the inhabitants. Were the duties upon foreign wines, and the excises upon
      malt, beer, and ale, to be taken away all at once, it might, in the same manner,
      occasion in Great Britain a pretty general and temporary drunkenness among
      the middling and inferior ranks of people, which would probably be soon followed
      by a permanent and almost universal sobriety. At present, drunkenness is by
      no means the vice of people of fashion, or of those who can easily afford the
      most expensive liquors. A gentleman drunk with ale has scarce ever been seen
      among us. The restraints upon the wine trade in Great Britain, besides, do
      not so much seem calculated to hinder the people from going, if I may say so,
      to the ale-house, as from going where they can buy the best and cheapest liquor.&quot; &#8212; Wealth
      of Nations, Book IV., Chapter III.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[13]</font> So, too, is production discouraged by the direct taxes levied by our
  States, counties and municipalities, which in the aggregate exceed the taxation
  of the Federal government. These taxes are generally levied upon all property,
  real and personal, at the same rate, and fall partly on land, which is not
  the result of production, and partly on things which are the result of production;
  but insomuch as buildings and improvements are not only thus taxed, but the
  land so built upon and improved is universally rated at a much higher assessment,
  and generally at a very much higher assessment, than unused land of the same
  quality,** even the taxation that falls upon land values largely operates as
  a deterrent to production.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> ** This arises from the widely spread but utterly false notion that property
    should pay taxes only in proportion to the income it yields. In Great Britain,
    this is carried to such a pitch of absurdity that unused land pays no taxes,
  no matter how valuable it may be. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>To produce, to improve, is thus fraught with a penalty. We, in fact,
  treat the man who produces wealth, or accumulates wealth, as though he had
  done something which public policy calls upon us to discourage. If a house
  is erected, or a steamship or a factory is built, down comes the tax-gatherer
  to fine the men who have done such things. If a farmer go upon vacant land,
  which is adding nothing to the wealth of the community, reclaim it, cultivate
  it, cover it with crops, or stock it with cattle, we not only make him pay
  for having thus increased wealth, but, as an additional discouragement to the
  doing of such things, we tax him very much more on the value of his land than
  we do the man who holds an equal piece idle. So, too, if a man saves, our taxes
  operate to punish him for his thrift. Thus is production checked in every direction.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15]</font> But this is not all. There is with us a yet greater check to production.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16]</font> If there be in this universe superior intelligences engaged, with higher
  powers, in the study of its infinite marvels, who sometimes examine the speck
  we tenant with such studious curiosity as our microscopists watch the denizens
  of a drop of water, the manner in which, in such a country as this, population
  is distributed, must greatly puzzle them. In our cities they find people packed
  together so closely that they live over one another in tiers; in the country
  they see people separated so widely that they lose all the advantages of neighborhood.
  They see buildings going up in the outskirts of our towns, while much more
  available lots remain vacant. They see men going great distances to cultivate
  land while there is yet plenty of land to cultivate in the localities from
  which they come and through which they pass. And as these higher intelligences
  watch this process of settlement through whatever sort of microscopes they
  may require to observe such creatures as we, they must notice that, for the
  most part, these settlers, instead of being attracted by each other, leave
  between each other large patches of unused land. If there be in the universe
  any societies which have the same relation to us as our learned societies have
  to ants and animalcules, these phenomena must lead to no end of curious theories.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>Take in imagination such a bird's-eye view of
  the city of New York as might be had from a balloon. The houses are climbing
  heavenward &#8212; ten, twelve,
  even fifteen stories, tier on tier of people, living, one family above another,
  without sufficient water, without sufficient light or air, without playground
  or breathing-space. So close is the building that the streets look like narrow
  rifts in the brick and mortar, and from street to street the solid blocks stretch
  until they almost meet; in the newer districts only a space of twenty feet,
  a mere crack in the masonry through which at high noon a sunbeam can scarcely
  struggle down, being left to separate the backs of the tenements fronting on
  one street from the backs of those fronting on another street. Yet, around
  this city, and within easy access of its center, there is plenty of vacant
  land; within the city limits, in fact, not one-half the land is built upon;
  and many blocks of tall tenement-houses are surrounded by vacant lots. If the
  improvement of our telescopes were to show us on another planet, lakes where
  the water, instead of presenting a level surface, ruffled only by the action
  of the wind, stood up here and there in huge columns, it could hardly perplex
  us more than these phenomena must perplex such extramundane intelligences as
  I have supposed. How is it, they may well speculate, that the pressure of population
  which piles families, tier on tier, above each other, and raises such towering
  warehouses and workshops, does not cover this vacant land with buildings and
  with homes? Some restraining cause there must be; but what, it might well puzzle
  them to tell.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18]</font> A South Sea Islander, however &#8212; one of
  the old heathen sort, whom, in civilizing, we have well-nigh exterminated,
  might make a guess. If one of their
  High Chiefs tabooed a place or object, no one of the common sort of these superstitious
  savages dare use or touch it. He must go around for miles rather than set his
  feet on a tabooed path; must parch or die with thirst rather than drink of
  a tabooed spring; must go hungry though the fruit of a tabooed grove rotted
  on the ground before bis eyes. A South Sea Islander would say that this vacant
  laud must be &quot;taboo.&quot; And he would be not far from the truth This
  land is vacant, simply because it is cursed by that form of the taboo which
  we superstitiously venerate under the names of &quot;private property&quot; and &quot;vested
  rights.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19] </font>The invisible barrier but for which buildings would rise and the city
  would spread, is the high price of land, a price that increases the more certainly
  it is seen that a growing population needs the land. Thus the stronger the
  incentive to the use of land, the higher the barrier that arises against its
  use. Tenement-houses are built among vacant lots because the price that must
  be paid for land is so great that people who have not large means must economize
  their use of land by living one family above another.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20] </font>While in all of our cities the value of land, which increases not merely
  with their growth, but with the expectation of growth, thus operates to check
  building and improvement, its effect is manifested through the country in a
  somewhat different way. Instead of unduly crowding people together it unduly
  separates them. The expectation of profit from the rise in the value of land
  leads those who take up new land, not to content themselves with what they
  may most profitably use, but to get all the land they can, even though they
  must let a great part of it lie idle; and large tracts are seized upon by those
  who make no pretense of using any part of it, but merely calculate to make
  a profit out of others who in time will be driven to use it. Thus population
  is scattered, not only to loss of all the comforts, refinements, pleasures
  and stimulations that come from neighborhood, but to the great loss of productive
  power. The extra cost of constructing and maintaining roads and railways, the
  greater distances over which produce and goods must be transported, the difficulties
  which separation interposes to that commerce between men which is necessary
  even to the ruder forms of modern production, all retard and lessen production.
  While just as the high value of land in and about a great city makes more difficult
  the erection of buildings, so does increase in the value of agricultural land
  make improvement difficult. The higher the value of land the more capital does
  the farmer require if he buys outright; or, if he buys on installments, or
  rents, the more of his earnings must he give up every year. Men who would eagerly
  improve and cultivate land could it be had for the using are thus turned away
  &#8212; to wander long distances and waste their means in looking for better
  opportunities; to swell the ranks of those seeking for employment as wage-workers;
  to go back
  to the cities or manufacturing villages in the endeavor to make a living; or
  to remain idle, frequently for long periods, and sometimes until they become
  utterly demoralized and worse than useless tramps.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>Thus is production checked in those vocations which form the foundation
  for all others. This check to the production of some forms of wealth lessens
  demand for other forms of wealth, and so the effect is propagated from one
  branch of industry to another, begetting the phenomena that are spoken of as
  over-production, but which are primarily due to restricted production.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22]</font> And as land values tend to rise, not merely with the growth of population
  and wealth, but with the expectation of that growth, thus enlisting in pushing
  on the upward movement, the powerful and illusive sentiment of hope, there
  is a constant tendency, especially strong in rapidly growing countries, to
  carry up the price of land beyond the point at which labor and capital can
  profitably engage in production, and the only check to this is the refusal
  of labor and capital so to engage. This tendency becomes peculiarly strong
  in recurring periods, when the fever of speculation runs high, and leads at
  length to a correspondingly general and sudden check to production, which propagating
  itself (by checking demand) through all branches of industry, is the main cause
  of those paroxysms known as commercial or industrial depressions, and which
  are marked by wasting capital, idle labor, stocks of goods that cannot be sold
  without loss, and wide-spread want and suffering. It is true that other restrictions
  upon the free play of productive forces operate to promote, intensify and continue
  these dislocations of the industrial system, but that here is the main and
  primary cause I think there can be no doubt.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23]</font> And this, perhaps, is even more clear: That from whatever cause disturbance
  of industrial and commercial relations may originally come, these periodical
  depressions in which demand and supply seem unable to meet and satisfy each
  other could not become wide-spread and persistent did productive forces have
  free access to land. Nothing like general and protracted congestion of capital
  and labor could take place were this natural vent open. The moment symptoms
  of relative over-production manifested themselves in any derivative branch
  of industry, the turning of capital and labor toward those occupations which
  extract wealth from the soil would give relief.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[24]</font> Thus may we see that those public misfortunes which we speak of as &quot;business
  stagnation&quot; and &quot;hard times,&quot; those public misfortunes that
  in periods of intensity cause more loss and suffering than great wars, spring
  truly from our ignorance and contempt of human rights; from our disregard of
  the equal and unalienable right of all men freely to apply to nature for the
  satisfaction of their needs, and to retain for their own uses the full fruits
  of their labor.</p>
