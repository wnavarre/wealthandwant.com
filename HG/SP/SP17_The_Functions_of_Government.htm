<p align="center"><strong>The Functions of Government</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 17 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by
  Henry George
(1883)</p>
<p><font size="-2">[01] </font>TO prevent government from becoming corrupt and tyrannous, its organization
  and methods should be as simple as possible, its functions be restricted to
  those necessary to the common welfare, and in all its parts it should be kept
  as close to the people and as directly within their control as may be.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02] </font>We have ignored these principles in many ways, and the result has been
  corruption and demoralization, the loss of control by the people, and the wresting
  of government to the advantage of the few and the spoliation of the many. The
  line of reform, on one side at least, lies in simplification.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>The first and main purpose of government is admirably stated in that
  grand document which we Americans so honor and so ignore &#8212; the Declaration
  of Independence. It is to secure to men those equal and unalienable rights
  with which the Creator has endowed them. I shall hereafter show how the adoption
  of the only means by which, in civilized and progressive society, the first
  of these unalienable rights &#8212; the equal right to land &#8212; can be
  secured, will at the same time greatly simplify government and do away with
  corrupting
  influences.
  And beyond this, much simplification is possible, and should be sought wherever
  it can be attained. As political corruption makes it easier to resist the demand
  for reform, whatever may be done to purify politics and bring government within
  the intelligent supervision and control of the people is in itself not merely
  an end to be sought, but a means to larger ends.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>The American Republic has no more need for its burlesque of a navy than
  a peaceable giant would have for a stuffed club or a tin sword. It is maintained
  only for the sake of the officers and the naval rings. In peace it is a source
  of expense and corruption; in war it would be useless. We are too strong for
  any foreign power wantonly to attack, we ought to be too great wantonly to
  attack others. If war should ever be forced upon us, we could safely rely upon
  science and invention, which arc already superseding navies faster than they
  can be built.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>So with our army. All we need, if we even now need that, is a small force
  of frontier police, such as is maintained in Australia and Canada. Standing
  navies and standing armies are inimical to the genus of democracy, and it ought
  to be our pride, as it is our duty, to show the world that a great republic
  can dispense with both. And in organization, as in principle, both our navy
  and our army are repugnant to the democratic idea. In both we maintain that
  distinction between commissioned officers and common soldiers and sailors which
  arose in Europe when the nobility who furnished the one were considered a superior
  race to the serfs and peasants who supplied the other. The whole system is
  an insult to democracy, and ought to be swept away.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>Our diplomatic system, too, is servilely copied from the usages of kings
  who plotted with each other against the liberties of the people, before the
  ocean steamship and the telegraph were invented. It serves no purpose save
  to reward unscrupulous politicians and corruptionists, and occasionally to
  demoralize a poet. To abolish it would save expense, corruption and national
  dignity.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>In legal administration there is a large field for radical reform. Here,
  too, we have servilely copied English precedents, and have allowed lawyers
  to make law in the interests of their class until justice is a costly gamble
  for which a poor man cannot afford to sue. The best use that could be made
  of our great law libraries, to which the reports of thirty-eight States, of
  the Federal courts, and of the English, Scotch and Irish courts are each year
  being added, would be to send them to the paper-mills, and to adopt such principles
  and methods of procedure as would reduce our great army of lawyers at least
  to the French standard. At the same time our statute-books are full of enactments
  which could, with advantage, be swept away. It is not the business of government
  to make men virtuous or religious, or to preserve the fool from the consequences
  of his own folly. Government should be repressive no further than is necessary
  to secure liberty by protecting the equal rights of each from aggression on
  the part of others, and the moment governmental prohibitions extend beyond
  this line they are in danger of defeating the very ends they are intended to
  serve. For while the tendency of laws which prohibit or command what the moral
  sense does not, is to bring law into contempt and produce hypocrisy and evasion,
  so the attempt to bring law to the aid of morals as to those acts and relations
  which do not plainly involve violation of the liberty of others, is to weaken
  rather than to strengthen moral influences; to make the standard of wrong and
  right a legal one, and to enable him who can dexterously escape the punishment
  of the law to escape all punishment. Thus, for instance, there can be no doubt
  that the standard of commercial honesty would be much higher in the absence
  of laws for the collection of debts. As to all such matters, the cunning rogue
  keeps within the law or evades the law, while the existence of a legal standard
  lowers the moral standard and weakens the sanction of public opinion.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>Restrictions, prohibitions, interferences with the liberty of action
  in itself harmless, are evil in their nature, and, though they may sometimes
  be necessary, may for the most part be likened to medicines which suppress
  or modify some symptom without lessening the disease and, generally, where
  restrictive or prohibitive laws are called for, the evils they are designed
  to meet may be traced to previous restriction &#8212; to some curtailment
  of natural rights.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>I can but briefly allude to these matters, though in themselves they
  deserve much attention. It is the more necessary to simplify government as
  much as possible and to improve, as much as may be, what may be called the
  mechanics of government, because, with the progress of society, the functions
  which government must assume steadily increase. It is only in the infancy of
  society that the functions of government can be properly confined to providing
  for the common defense and protecting the weak against the physical power of
  the strong. As society develops in obedience to that law of integration and
  increasing complexity of which I spoke in the first of these chapters, it becomes
  necessary in order to secure equality that other regulations should be made
  and enforced; and upon the primary and restrictive functions of government
  are superimposed what may be called co&brvbar;perative functions, the refusal
  to assume which lead, in many cases, to the disregard of individual rights
  as surely as does the assumption of directive and restrictive functions not
  properly belonging to government.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10]</font> All the tendencies of the time are to the absorption of smaller communities,
  to the enlargement of the area within which uniformity of law and administration
  is necessary or desirable. But for this very reason we ought with the more
  tenacity to hold, wherever possible, to the principle of local self-government
  &#8212; the principle that, in things which concern only themselves, the people
  of each political sub-division &#8212; township, ward, city or State, as may
  be
  &#8212; shall act for themselves. We have neglected this principle within
  our States even more than in the relations between the State and National Governments,
  and in attempting to govern great cities by State commissions, and in making
  what properly belongs to County Supervisors and Township Trustees the business
  of legislatures, we have divided responsibility and promoted corruption.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11]</font> Much, too, may be done to restrict the abuse of party machinery, and
  make the ballot the true expression of the will of the voter, by simplifying
  our elective methods. And a principle should always be kept in mind which we
  have largely ignored, that the people cannot manage details, nor intelligently
  choose more than a few officials. To call upon the average citizen to vote
  at each election for a long string of candidates, as to the majority of whom
  he can know nothing unless he makes a business of politics, is to relegate
  choice to nominating conventions and political rings. And to divide power is
  often to destroy responsibility, and to provoke, not to prevent, usurpation.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12] </font>In the division of labor and the specialization of vocation that begin
  in an early stage of social development, and increase with it, the assumption
  by individuals of certain parts in the business of society necessarily operates
  to the exclusion of other individuals. Thus when one opens a store or an inn,
  or establishes a regular carriage of passengers or goods, or devotes himself
  to a special trade or profession of which all may have need, his doing of these
  things operates to prevent others from doing them, and leads to the establishment
  of habits and customs which make resort to him a necessity to others, and which
  would put those who were denied this resort at a great disadvantage as compared
  with other individuals. Thus to secure quality it becomes necessary so to limit
  liberty of action as to oblige those who thus take upon themselves quasi-public
  functions to serve without discrimination those who may apply to them upon
  customary conditions. This principle is recognized by all nations that have
  made any progress in civilization, in their laws relating to common carriers,
  innkeepers, etc.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>As civilization progresses and industrial development goes on, the concentration
  which results from the utilization of larger powers and improved processes
  operates more and more to the restriction and exclusion of competition, and
  to the establishment of complete monopolies. This we may see very clearly in
  the railroad. It is but a sheer waste of capital and labor to build one railroad
  alongside of another; and even where this is done, an irresistible tendency
  leads either to consolidation or to combination; and even at what are called
  competing points, competition is only transitional. The consolidation of companies,
  which in a few years bids fair to concentrate the whole railway business of
  the United States in the hands of half a dozen managements, the pooling of
  receipts, and agreements as to business and charges, which even at competing
  points prevent competition, are due to a tendency inherent in the development
  of the railroad system, and of which it is idle to complain.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>The primary purpose and end of government being
  to secure the natural rights and equal liberty of each, all businesses that
  involve monopoly are
  within the necessary province of governmental regulation, and businesses that
  are in their nature complete monopolies become properly functions of the state.
  As society develops, the state must assume these functions, in their nature
  cooperative, in order to secure the equal rights and liberty of all.
  That is to say, as, in the process of integration, the individual becomes more
  and more dependent upon and subordinate to the all, it becomes necessary for
  government, which is properly that social organ by which alone the whole body
  of individuals can act, to take upon itself, in the interest of all, certain
  functions which cannot safely be left to individuals. Thus out of the principle
  that it is the proper end and purpose of government to secure the natural rights
  and equal liberty of the individual, grows the principle that it is the business
  of government to do for the mass of individuals those things which cannot be
  done, or cannot be so well done, by individual action. As in the development
  of species, the power of conscious, coordinated action of the whole
  being must assume greater and greater relative importance to the automatic
  action of parts, so is it in the development of society. This is the truth
  in socialism, which, although it is being forced upon us by industrial progress
  and social development, we are so slow to recognize.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15]</font> In the physical organism, weakness and disease result alike from the
  overstraining of functions and from the non-use of functions. In like manner
  governments may be corrupted and public misfortunes induced by the failure
  to assume, as governmental, functions that properly belong to government as
  the controlling organ in the management of common interests, as well as from
  interferences by government in the proper sphere of individual action. This
  we may see in our own case. In what we attempt to do by government and what
  we leave undone we are like a man who should leave the provision of his dinner
  to the promptings of his stomach while attempting to govern his digestion by
  the action of his will; or like one who, in walking through a crowded street
  or over a bad road, should concentrate all his conscious faculties upon the
  movement of his legs without paying any attention to where he was going.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>To illustrate: It is not the business of government to interfere with
  the views which any one may hold of the Creator or with the worship he may
  choose to pay him, so long as the exercise of these individual rights does
  not conflict with the equal liberty of others; and the result of governmental
  interference in this domain has been hypocrisy, corruption, persecution and
  religious war. It is not the business of government to direct the employment
  of labor and capital, and to foster certain industries at the expense of other
  industries; and the attempt to do so leads to all the waste, loss and corruption
  due to protective tariffs.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>On the other hand, it is the business of government
  to issue money. This is perceived as soon as the great laborsaving invention
  of money supplants
  barter. To leave it to every one who chose to do so to issue money would be
  to entail general inconvenience and loss, to offer many temptations to roguery,
  and to put the poorer classes of society at a great disadvantage. These obvious
  considerations have everywhere, as society became well organized, led to the
  recognition of the coinage of money as an exclusive function of government.
  When, in the progress of society, a further labor-saving improvement becomes
  possible by the substitution of paper for the precious metals as the material
  for money, the reasons why the issuance of this money should be made a government
  function become still stronger. The evils entailed by wildcat banking in the
  United States are too well remembered to need reference. The loss and inconvenience,
  the swindling and corruption that flowed from the assumption by each State
  of the Union of the power to license banks of issue ended with the war, and
  no one would now go back to them. Yet instead of doing what every public consideration
  impels us to, and assuming wholly and fully as the exclusive function of the
  General Government the power to issue paper money, the private interests of
  bankers have, up to this, compelled us to the use of a hybrid currency, of
  which a large part, though guaranteed by the General Government, is issued
  and made profitable to corporations. The legitimate business of banking &#8212;  the
  safekeeping and loaning of money, and the making and exchange of credits, is
  properly left to individuals and associations; but by leaving to them, even
  in part and under restrictions and guaranties, the issuance of money, the people
  of the United States suffer an annual loss of millions of dollars, and sensibly
  increase the influences which exert a corrupting effect upon their government.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18]</font> The principle evident here may be seen in even stronger light in another
  department of social life.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19]</font> The great &quot;railroad question,&quot; with its dangers and perplexities,
  is a most striking instance of the evil consequences which result from the
  failure of the state to assume functions that properly belong to it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20] </font>In rude stages of social development, and where government, neglectful
  of its proper functions, has been occupied in making needless wars and imposing
  harmful restrictions, the making and improvement of highways have been left
  to individuals, who, to recompense themselves, have been permitted to exact
  tolls. It has, however, from the first, been recognized that these tolls are
  properly subject to governmental control and regulation. But the great inconveniences
  of this system, and the heavy taxes which, in spite of attempted regulation,
  are under it levied upon production, have led, as social advance went on, to
  the assumption of the making and maintenance of highroads as a governmental
  duty. In the course of social development came the invention of the railroad,
  which merged the business of making and maintaining roads with the business
  of carrying freight and passengers upon them. It is probably due to this that
  it was not at first recognized that the same reasons which render it necessary
  for the state to make and maintain common roads apply with even greater force
  to the building and operating of railroads. In Great Britain and the United
  States, and, with partial exceptions, in other countries, railroads have been
  left to private enterprise to build and private greed to manage. In the United
  States, where railroads are of more importance than in any other country in
  the world, our only recognition of their public character has been in the donation
  of lands and the granting of subsidies, which have been the cause of much corruption,
  and in some feeble attempts to regulate fares and freights.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>But the fact that the railroad system as far as yet developed (and perhaps
  necessarily) combines transportation with the maintenance of roadways, renders
  competition all the more impossible, and brings it still more clearly within
  the province of the state. That it makes the assumption of the railroad business
  by the state a most serious matter is not to be denied. Even if it were possible,
  which may well be doubted, as has been sometimes proposed, to have the roadway
  maintained by the state, leaving the furnishing of trains to private enterprise,
  it would be still a most serious matter. But look at it which way we may, it
  is so serious a matter that it must be faced. As the individual grows from
  childhood to maturity, he must meet difficulties and accept responsibilities
  from which he well might shrink. So is it with society. New powers bring new
  duties and new responsibilities. Imprudence in going forward involves danger,
  but it is fatal to stand still. And however great be the difficulties involved
  in the assumption of the railroad business by the state, much greater difficulties
  are involved in the refusal to assume it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22]</font> It is not necessary to go into any elaborate argument to show that the
  ownership and management of railroads are functions of the state. That is proved
  beyond dispute by the logic of events and of existing facts. Nothing is more
  obvious &#8212; at least in the United States, where the tendencies of modern
  development may be seen much more clearly than in Europe &#8212; than that
  a union of railroading
  with the other functions of government is inevitable. We may not like it, but
  we cannot avoid it. Either government must manage the railroads, or the railroads
  must manage the government. There is no escape. To refuse one horn of the dilemma
  is to be impaled on the other.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23]</font> As for any satisfactory state regulation of railroads, the experience
  of our States shows it to be impossible. A strong-willed despot, clothed with
  arbitrary power, might curb such leviathans; but popular governments cannot.
  The power of the whole people is, of course, greater than the power of the
  railroads, but it cannot be exerted steadily and in details. Even a small special
  interest is, by reason of its intelligence, compactness and flexibility, more
  than a match for large and vague general interests; it has the advantage which
  belongs to a well-armed and disciplined force in dealing with a mob. But in
  the number of its employees, the amount of its revenues, and the extent of
  the interests which it controls, the railroad power is gigantic. And, growing
  faster than the growth of the country, it is tending still faster to concentration.
  It may be that the man is already born who will control the whole railroad
  system of the United States, as Vanderbilt, Gould and Huntington now control
  great sections of it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[24] </font>Practical politicians all over the United States recognize the utter
  hopelessness of contending with the railroad power. In many if not in most
  of the States, no prudent man will run for office if he believes the railroad
  power is against him. Yet in the direct appeal to the people a power of this
  kind is weakest, and railroad kings rule States where, on any issues that came
  fairly before the people, they would be voted down. It is by throwing their
  weight into primaries, and managing conventions, by controlling the press,
  manipulating legislatures, and filling the bench with their creatures, that
  the railroads best exert political power. The people of California, for instance,
  have voted against the railroad time and again, or rather imagined they did,
  and even adopted a very bad new constitution because they supposed the railroad
  was against it. The result is, that the great railroad company, of whose domain
  California, with an area greater than twice that of Great Britain, is but one
  of the provinces, absolutely dominates the State. The men who really fought
  it are taken into its service or crushed, and powers are exerted in the interests
  of the corporation managers which no government would dare attempt. This company,
  heavily subsidized, in the first place, as a great public convenience, levies
  on commerce, not tolls, but tariffs. If a man goes into business requiring
  transportation he must exhibit his profits and take it into partnership for
  the lion's share. Importers are bound by an &quot;iron-clad agreement&quot; to
  give its agents access to their books, and if they do anything the company
  deems against its interests they are fined or ruined by being placed at a disadvantage
  to their rivals in business. Three continental railroads heavily subsidized
  by the nation under the impression that the competition would keep down rates,
  have now reached the Pacific. Instead of competing they have pooled their receipts.
  The line of steamers from San Francisco to New York via the Isthmus receives
  $100,000 a month to keep up fares and freights to a level with those exacted
  by the railroad, and if you would send goods from New York to San Francisco
  by way of the Isthmus, the cheapest way is first to ship them to England. Shippers
  to interior points are charged as much as though their goods were carried to
  the end of the road and then shipped back again; and even, by means of the
  agreements mentioned, an embargo is laid upon ocean commerce by sailing-vessels,
  wherever it might interfere with the monopoly.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[25] </font>I speak of California only as an instance. The power of the railroads
  is apparent in State after State, as it is in the National Government. Nothing
  can be clearer than that, if present conditions must continue, the American
  people might as well content themselves to surrender political power to these
  great corporations and their affiliated interests. There is no escape from
  this. The railroad managers cannot keep out of politics, even if they wished
  to. The difficulties of the railroad question do not arise from the fact that
  peculiarly bad men have got control of the railroads; they arise from the nature
  of the railroad business and its intimate relations to other interests and
  industries.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[26]</font> But it will be said: &quot;If the railroads are even now a corrupting
  element in our politics, what would they be if the government were to own and
  to attempt to run them? Is not governmental management notoriously corrupt
  and inefficient? Would not the effect of adding such a vast army to the already
  great number of government employees, of increasing so enormously the revenues
  and expenditures of government, be to enable those who got control of government
  to defy opposition and perpetuate their power indefinitely; and would it not
  be, finally, to sink the whole political organization in a hopeless slough
  of corruption?&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[27]</font> My reply is, that great as these dangers may be,
  they must be faced, lest worse befall us. When a gale sets him on a lee shore,
  the seaman must
  make sail, even at the risk of having his canvas fly from the bolt-ropes and
  his masts go by the board. The dangers of wind and sea urge him to make everything
  snug as may be, alow and aloft; to get rid of anything that might diminish
  the weatherly qualities of his ship, and to send his best helmsman to the wheel,
  &#8212; not supinely to accept the certain destruction of the rocks.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[28]</font> Instead of belittling the dangers of adding to the functions of government
  as it is at present, what I am endeavoring to point out is the urgent necessity
  of simplifying and improving government, that it may safely assume the additional
  functions that social development forces upon it. It is not merely necessary
  to prevent government from getting more corrupt and more inefficient, though
  we can no more do that by a negative policy than the seaman can lay to in a
  gale without drifting; it is necessary to make government much more efficient
  and much less corrupt. The dangers that menace us are not accidental. They
  spring from a universal law which we cannot escape. That law is the one I pointed
  out in the first chapter of this book &#8212; that every advance brings new
  dangers and requires higher and more alert intelligence. As the more highly
  organized
  animal cannot live unless it have a more fully developed brain than those of
  lower animal organizations, so the more highly organized society must perish
  unless it bring to the management of social affairs greater intelligence and
  higher moral sense. The great material advances which modern invention has
  enabled us to make, necessitate corresponding social and political advances.
  Nature knows no &quot;Baby Act.&quot; We must live up to her conditions or
  not live at all.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[29] </font>My purpose here is to show how important it is that we simplify government,
  purify politics and improve social conditions, as a preliminary to showing
  how much in all these directions may be accomplished by one single great reform.
  But although I shall be obliged to do so briefly, it may be worth while, even
  if briefly, to call attention to some principles that should not be forgotten
  in thinking of the assumption by the state of such functions as the running
  of railroads.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[30]</font> In the first place, I think it may be accepted as a principle proved
  by experience, that any considerable interest having necessary relations with
  government is more corruptive of government when acting upon government from
  without than when assumed by government. Let a ship in mid-ocean drop her anchor
  and pay out her cable, and though she would be relieved of some weight, since
  part of the weight of anchor and cable would be supported by the water, not
  only would her progress be retarded, but she would refuse to answer her helm,
  and become utterly unmanageable. Yet, assumed as part of the ship, and properly
  stowed on board, anchor and cable no longer perceptibly interfere with her
  movements.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[31]</font> A standing army is a corrupting influence, and a danger to popular liberties;
  but who would maintain that on this ground it were wiser, if a standing army
  must be kept, that it should be enlisted and paid by private parties, and hired
  of them by the state? Such an army would be far more corrupting and far more
  dangerous than one maintained directly by the state, and would soon make its
  leaders masters of the state.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[32]</font> I do not think the postal department of the government, with its extensive
  ramifications and its numerous employees, begins to be as important a factor
  in our politics, or exerts so corrupting an influence, as would a private corporation
  carrying on this business, and which would be constantly tempted or forced
  into politics to procure favorable or prevent unfavorable legislation. Where
  individual States and the General Government have substituted public printing-offices
  for Public Printers, who themselves furnished material and hired labor, I think
  the result has been to lessen, not to increase, corruptive influences; and
  speaking generally, I think experience shows that in all departments of government
  the system of contracting for work and supplies has, on the whole, led to more
  corruption than the system of direct employment. The reason I take to be, that
  there is in one case a much greater concentration of corruptive interests and
  power than in the other.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[33]</font> The inefficiency, extravagance and corruption which we commonly attribute
  to governmental management are mostly in those departments which do not come
  under the public eye, and little concern, if they concern at all, public convenience.
  Whether the six new steel cruisers which the persistent lobbying of contractors
  has induced Congress to order, are well or ill built the American people will
  never know, except as they learn through the newspapers, and the fact will
  no more affect their comfort and convenience than does the fitting of the Sultan's
  new breeches, or the latest changes in officers' uniforms which it has pleased
  the Secretary of the Navy to order. But let the mails go astray or the postman
  fail in his rounds, and there is at once an outcry. The post-office department
  is managed with greater efficiency than any other department of the National
  Government, because it comes close to the people. To say the very least, it
  is managed as efficiently as any private company could manage such a vast business,
  and I think, on the whole, as economically. And the scandals and abuses that
  have arisen in it have been, for the most part, as to out-of-the-way places,
  and things of which there was little or no public consciousness. So in England,
  the telegraph and parcel-carrying and savings-bank businesses are managed by
  government more efficiently and economically than before by private corporations.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[34]</font> Like these businesses &#8212; perhaps even more
  so &#8212; the railroad business comes directly under the notice of the people.
  It so immediately concerns the
  interests, the convenience and the safety of the great body, that under public
  management it would compel that close and quick attention that secures efficiency.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[35]</font> It seems to me that in regard to public affairs
  we too easily accept the dictum that faithful and efficient work can be secured
  only by the hopes
  of pecuniary profit, or the fear of pecuniary loss. We get faithful and efficient
  work in our colleges and similar institutions without this not to speak of
  the army and navy, or of the postal and educational departments of government;
  and be this as it may, our railroads are really run by men who, from switch-tender
  to general superintendent, have no pecuniary interest in the business other
  than to get their pay &#8212; in most cases paltry and insufficient &#8212;  and
  hold their positions. Under governmental ownership they would have, at the
  very
  least, all the incentives to faithfulness and efficiency that they have now,
  for that governmental management of railroads must involve the principles of
  civil service reform goes without the saying. The most determined supporter
  of the spoils system would not care to resign the safety of limb and life to
  engineers and brakemen appointed for political services.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[36] </font>Look, moreover, at the railroad system as it exists now. That it is not
  managed in the interests of the public is clear; but is it managed in the interests
  of its owners? Is it managed with that economy, efficiency and intelligence
  that are presumed to be the results of private ownership and control? On the
  contrary, while the public interests are utterly disregarded, the interests
  of the stockholders are in most cases little better considered. Our railroads
  are really managed in the interests of unscrupulous adventurers, whose purpose
  is to bull and bear the stock-market; by men who make the interests of the
  property they manage subservient to their personal interests in other railroads
  or in other businesses; who speculate in lands and town sites, who give themselves
  or their friends contracts for supplies and special rates for transportation,
  and who often deliberately wreck the corporation they control and rob stockholders
  to the last cent. From one end to the other, the management of our railroad
  system, as it now exists, reeks with jobbery and fraud.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[37] </font>That ordinary roads, bridges, etc., should not be maintained for profit,
  either public or private, is an accepted principle, and the State of New York
  has recently gone so far as to abolish all tolls on the Erie Canal. Our postal
  service we merely aim to make self-sustaining, and no one would now think of
  proposing that the rates of postage should be increased in order to furnish
  public revenues; still less would any one think of proposing to abandon the
  government postal service, and turn the business over to individuals or corporations.
  In the beginning the postal service was carried on by individuals with a view
  to profits. Had that system been continued to the present day, it is certain
  that we should not begin to have such extensive and regular postal facilities
  as we have now, nor such cheap rates; and all the objections that are now urged
  against the government assumption of the railroad business would be urged against
  government carriage of letters. We never can enjoy the full benefits of the
  invention of the railroad until we make the railroads public property, managed
  by public servants in the public interests. And thus will a great cause of
  the corruption of government, and a great cause of monstrous fortunes, be destroyed.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[38] </font>All I have said of the railroad applies, of course, to the telegraph,
  the telephone, the supplying of cities with gas, water, heat and electricity,
  &#8212; in short to all businesses which are in their nature monopolies. I
  speak of the railroad only because the magnitude of the business makes its
  assumption
  by the state the most formidable of such undertakings.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[39]</font> Businesses that are in their nature monopolies are properly functions
  of the state. The state must control or assume them, in self-defense, and for
  the protection of the equal rights of citizens. But beyond this, the field
  in which the state may operate beneficially as the executive of the great co&brvbar;perative
  association, into which it is the tendency of true civilization to blend society,
  will widen with the improvement of government and the growth of public spirit.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[40] </font>We have already made an important step in this
  direction in our public-school system. Our public schools are not maintained
  for the poor, as are the English
  board schools &#8212; where, moreover, payment is required from all who can
  pay nor yet is their main motive the protection of the state against ignorance.
  These are subsidiary motives. But the main motive for the maintenance of our
  public schools is, that by far the greater part of our people find them the
  best and most economical means of educating their children. American society
  is, in fact, organized by the operation of government into co&brvbar;perative
  educational associations, and with such happy results that in no State where
  the public-school system has obtained would any proposition to abolish it get
  respectful consideration. In spite of the corruption of our politics, our public
  schools are, on the whole, much better than private schools; while by their
  association of the children of rich and poor, of Jew and Gentile, of Protestant
  and Catholic, of Republican and Democrat, they are of inestimable value in
  breaking down prejudice and checking the growth of class feeling. It is likewise
  to be remarked as to our public-school system, that corruptive influences seem
  to spring rather from our not having gone far enough than from our having gone
  too far in the direction of state action. In some of our States the books used
  by the children are supplied at public expense, being considered school property,
  which the pupil receives on entering the school or class, and returns when
  leaving. In most of them, however, the pupils, unless their parents cannot
  afford the outlay, are required to furnish their own books. Experience has
  shown the former system to be much the better, not only because, when books
  are furnished to all, there is no temptation of those who can afford to purchase
  books falsely to plead indigence, and no humiliation on the part of those who
  cannot; but because the number of books required is much less, and they can
  be purchased at cheaper rates. This not only effects a large economy in the
  aggregate expenditure, but lessens an important corruptive influence. For the
  strife of the great school-book publishers to get their books adopted in the
  public schools, in which most of them make no scruple of resorting to bribery
  wherever they can, has done much to degrade the character of school boards.
  This corruptive influence can only be fully done away with by manufacturing
  school-books at public expense, as has been in a number of the States proposed.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[41] </font>The public-library system, which, beginning in the public-spirited city
  of Boston, is steadily making its way over the country, and under which both
  reading and lending libraries are maintained at public expense for the free
  use of the public, is another instance of the successful extension of the co&brvbar;perative
  functions of government. So are the public parks and recreation grounds which
  we are beginning to establish.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[42]</font> Not only is it possible to go much further in the direction of thus providing,
  at public expense, for the public health, education and recreation, and for
  public encouragement of science and invention, but if we can simplify and purify
  government it will become possible for society in its various sub-divisions
  to obtain in many other ways, but in much larger degree, those advantages for
  its members that voluntary co&brvbar;perative societies seek to obtain. Not
  only could the most enormous economies thus be obtained, but the growing tendency
  to adulteration and dishonesty, as fatal to morals as to health, would be checked,*
  and at least such an organization of industry be reached as would very greatly
  reduce the appropriative power of aggregated capital, and prevent those strifes
  that may be likened to wars. The natural progress of social development is
  unmistakably toward cooperation, or, if the word be preferred, toward
  socialism, though I dislike to use a word to which such various and vague meanings
  are attached. Civilization is the art of living together in closer relations.
  That mankind should dwell together in unity is the evident intent of the Divine
  mind, &#8212; of that Will expressed in the immutable laws of the physical
  and moral universe which reward obedience and punish disobedience. The dangers
  which
  menace modern society are but the reverse of blessings which modern society
  may grasp. The concentration that is going on in all branches of industry is
  a necessary tendency of our advance in the material arts. It is not in itself
  an evil. If in anything its results are evil, it is simply because of our bad
  social adjustments. The construction of this world in which we find ourselves
  is such that a thousand men working together can produce many times more than
  the same thousand men working singly. But this does not make it necessary that
  the nine hundred and ninety-nine must be the virtual slaves of the one.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>*There are many manufactured articles for which the producer now receives
    only a third of the price paid by the consumer, while adulteration has gone
    far beyond detection by the individual purchaser. Not to speak of the compounding
    of liquors, of oleomargarine and glucose, a single instance will show how far
    adulteration is carried. The adulterations in ground coffee have driven many
    people to purchase their coffee in the bean and grind it themselves. To meet
    this, at least one firm of large coffee-roasters, and I presume most of them,
    have adopted an invention by means of which imitation coffee-beans, exactly
    resembling in appearance the genuine article, are stamped out of a paste. These
  they mix in large quantities with real coffee. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="-2">[43]</font> Let me repeat it, though again and again, for it is, it seems to me,
  the great lesson which existing social facts impress upon him who studies them,
  and that it is all important that we should heed: The natural laws which permit
  of social advance, require that advance to be intellectual and moral as well
  as material. The natural laws which give us the steamship, the locomotive,
  the telegraph, the printing-press, and all the thousand inventions by which
  our mastery over matter and material conditions is increased, require greater
  social intelligence and a higher standard of social morals. Especially do they
  make more and more imperative that justice between man and man which demands
  the recognition of the equality of natural rights.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[44]<em> </em></font><em>&quot;Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness [right or just
  doing] and all these things shall be added unto you.&quot;</em> The first step toward
  a natural and healthy organization of society is to secure to all men their
  natural, equal and unalienable rights in the material universe. To do this
  is not to do everything that may be necessary but it is to make all else easier.
  And unless we do this nothing else will avail.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[45]</font> I have in this chapter touched briefly upon subjects that for thorough
  treatment would require much more space. My purpose has been to show that the
  simplification and purification of government are rendered the more necessary,
  on account of functions which industrial development is forcing upon government,
  and the further functions which it is becoming more and more evident that it
  would be advantageous for government to assume. In succeeding chapters 1 propose
  to show how, by recognizing in practicable method the equal and unalienable
  rights of men to the soil of their country, government may be greatly simplified,
  and corrupting influences destroyed. For it is indeed true, as the French Assembly
  declared, that public misfortunes and corruptions of government spring from
  ignorance, neglect or contempt of human rights.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[46]</font> Of course in this chapter and elsewhere in speaking of government, the
  state, the community, etc., I use these terms in a general sense, without reference
  to existing political divisions. What should properly belong to the township
  or ward, what to the county or State, what to the nation, and what to such
  federations of nations as it is in the manifest line of civilization to evolve,
  is a matter into which I have not entered. As to the proper organization of
  government, and the distribution of powers, there is much need for thought.</p>
