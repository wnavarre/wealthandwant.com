<p align="center"><strong>II. CONDITION OF ENGLISH AGRICULTURAL LABORERS.<br>
  Appendix to Henry George's <em>Social Problems </em></strong></p>
<p> THE following communication, from Mr. William Saunders, of London, was called
  forth by a letter signed &quot;A Free-born Englishman,&quot; in which some
  of the statements made in <a href="SP10_The_Rights_of_Man.htm">Chapter X</a>. of this book were in general terms denied.</p>
<p> NEW YORK, July 24,1883.<br />
  To the Editor of <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em></p>
<p> SIR &#8212; &quot;A Free-born Englishman,&quot; who &quot;emphatically denies&quot; the
  accuracy of Mr. George's statements, is at a loss to conceive from what source
  he obtained his information. On this point I may enlighten him, as I can state
  from experience that Mr. George gained his knowledge by personal investigation
  in the location to which he refers. I wish that I could sustain the rose-colored
  view which &quot;A Free-born Englishman&quot; takes of the condition of the
  agricultural laborer in England. For fifty years I have been intimately acquainted
  with the state of agriculture in the southern part of the country, and during
  that time the standard wages have varied from one and a half to three and a
  half dollars per week. In Wiltshire, at the present time, the wages are from
  two and a quarter to three dollars per week. It must be noted that these are
  the wages not of boys but of married men, and that they are the total wages;
  no food is given, and, as a rule, the laborers pay rent for a cottage, and
  always a very high rent for garden land, if they have any. Even the highest
  rate named is quite inadequate to provide a family with sufficient food of
  the plainest kind. It costs four dollars per week to provide food for five
  persons in the poorhouses of Wiltshire. Thus, if a man with a wife and three
  children spend all his wages for food he would still be short of the poorhouse
  allowance, which is calculated at a very low rate.</p>
<p> The statement of &quot;A Free-born Englishman&quot; that it is a rare thing
  for the aged of the industrial classes to go to the workhouse is entirely contrary
  to my experience, and I may ask how is it possible for a man to save for old
  age when the laborer has to maintain himself and his family upon a sum with
  which economical poor-law guardians cannot support paupers?</p>
<p> As to commons, they not only have been, but are being inclosed by the owners
  of land. This is also the case with spaces on the roadside, so that the working-classes
  have lost the means they formerly had for maintaining cows, donkeys or geese,
  and children have been deprived of their ancient playgrounds. As to foot-paths,
  these are often closed; but your correspondent is right when he says that interrupting
  an ancient highway excites the indignation of the people, and sometimes they
  tear down the obstruction. They did so recently in a case where Mr. E. P. Bouverie
  shut up a path near Devizes, in Wiltshire. Legal proceedings were taken, and,
  although it was proved that the public had enjoyed the use of the footway for
  over a century, yet the landlord was enabled to show that during this period
  the estate had been entailed, so that no owner had the power to give the public
  a right of way, and thus the path was closed. By these and similar provisions
  in laws enacted by landlords, it is possible for a landlord to make constant
  encroachments upon the public; for, if he maintains a claim for twenty years
  it is established in his favor, but no length of time can legalize the possession
  by the public against a claim raised by the owners of a family estate. Thus,
  all the time family estates are growing and the public are losing.</p>
<p> In referring to a case near London, &quot;A Free-born Englishman&quot; is
  misleading your readers. The people of London insisted upon exempting an area
  of fifteen miles around that city from the operation of Commons Inclosure Acts,
  and, therefore, the instance to which he refers does not apply to England generally.</p>
<p> It must be puzzling to Americans to meet with such different statements respecting
  English laborers, and as your correspondent does not give the public his name
  or address, it may be allowable to test his assertions by the internal evidence
  which his letter affords on the subject of his accuracy. He boldly asserts
  that &quot;an equal distribution of property is the general principle that
  underlies &quot; Mr. George's article. I challenge him to refer to a single
  paragraph in any of the voluminous writings of Mr. George which justifies the
  idea that he advocates an equal distribution of property. Mr. George's writings
  are a protest against the confiscation by landlords of property created by
  industry, and the statement that he advocates an equal distribution of property
  is entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>Neither is your correspondent more happy in the assertion of his own principles
  than in his misrepresentation of Mr. George's views. He tells us that &quot;a
  man obtains in England, as in America and elsewhere, just so much for his labor
  as his labor is worth, according to the law of supply and demand.&quot; One
  illustration from each side of the Atlantic will disprove this assertion. In
  Wiltshire, England, thousands of acres of excellent land are uncultivated,
  while thousands of half-starved but willing workmen demand an opportunity for
  growing food for themselves and families. The land remains out of cultivation,
  and the laborers remain without work, solely because a landlord stands upon
  the land, and says to every farmer who wants to cultivate it,&quot; You shall
  not do so unless you pay me six dollars an acre per annum, with an increase
  in future if I choose to demand it at the expiration of any year.&quot; If
  a working-man comes to the landlord and says to him, &quot;Please let me have
  five acres of that land, upon which I will work and grow food for my own family
  and others,&quot; the landlord replies, &quot;You shall not have that land
  unless you pay me fifteen dollars an acre per annum;&quot; and when the working-man
  asks why it is proposed to charge him so much more than is charged the farmer,
  the landlord tells him, &quot;We do not want working-men to have land, lest
  the farmers should be unable to obtain laborers.&quot; Thus the land remains
  out of cultivation, and the laborer without work and without food, because
  the landlord stands between demand and supply.</p>
<p> In New Jersey, not far from where I am writing, thousands of acres of land
  are producing miasma and mosquitos. Thousands of willing hands would drain
  this land and cover it with houses and manufactories, but in the meantime a
  landlord's agent stands upon the marsh and demands, in the name of a man who
  has done nothing, a payment of one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars
  an acre before he will allow the mosquitos to be suppressed and houses and
  factories to be erected.</p>
<p> Under these circumstances your correspondent may well say,&quot;I should
  be glad to learn where in this country, or in any other country on the globe,
  does a man who has not capital obtain the 'full fruits of his labor'?&quot; True
  it is that those who have capital and those who can avail themselves of the
  unjust privileges which law allows to capital, in connection with the possession
  of land, are the only persons who can obtain the full fruits of their own or
  other persons' labor; and if the universality of injustice is a sound reason
  for upholding it, then undoubtedly Mr. George is in the wrong.</p>
<p> I am willing to admit, as &quot;A Free-born Englishman&quot; contends, that
  in some respects the agricultural laborer is better off than his brother laborer
  in the crowded cities of Europe and America; but, gracious heaven! is this
  a matter for thankfulness? I have had to spend the summer in New York, and
  with every alleviation that can be provided, my fate has been hard enough;
  but what must be the condition of families crowded into tenement-houses during
  the summer heat? No man ought to think of it without a determination to do
  all in his power to lessen such terrible suffering. And this suffering, in
  New York and other cities, is the direct and immediate result of landlordism.
  In London, landlords demand and receive thirty millions of dollars annually
  from the workingclasses, and they are constantly raising their demands.</p>
<p> This is the cause of overcrowding. Every month landlords kill more children
  than Herod destroyed in his lifetime; and yet, as your correspondent reminds
  us, they are men of excellent character. That they are all honorable men, I
  do not dispute; but the circumstance does not lessen the fearful consequences
  of the system of which they are the agents. It is not of abuses that we complain,
  but of the necessary consequences of landlordism, which, like a huge vise,
  crushes the masses of the people with more horrible effect at every turn of
  the screw. Industry, intelligence and invention hold out promises of improvement
  which seem to be almost within our reach, but before they are obtained the
  landlord advances his claims and the result is disappointment and misery. If
  this state of things continues, it will be the fault, not of the landlords,
  but of working-men who have the power, and should have the determination, to
  deliver themselves and their children from a fatal influence. I am, </p>
<p> Yours respectfully,</p>
<p> WILLIAM SAUNDERS.</p>
