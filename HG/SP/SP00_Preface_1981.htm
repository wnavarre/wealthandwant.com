  <span class="style3">by Henry George <br />
  1883<br />
Preface to the 1981 Edition</span></div>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> <em>SOCIAL PROBLEMS</em>, when written in 1883 by Henry George, was more than
  a perceptive account of the problems of society which afflicted not only the
  nation but the world of his time. It was a harbinger of things to come. We
  in the latter half of the twentieth century know only too well how accurately
  his predictions have turned out.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> He warned that unless our system of land tenure was reformed, and unless
  the individual's freedom of action was enhanced, even graver ecological, economic,
  moral and ethical problems would plague us than his generation faced.</p>
<p><font size="-1">[03]</font> He noted the despoiling of nature which today even the dullest can see
  and warned of &quot;the destructive character of our agriculture which is year
  by year decreasing the productiveness of our soil, and virtually lessening
  the area of land available for the support of our increasing millions.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04]</font> &quot;We have made,&quot; he said, &quot;and still are making, enormous
  advances on material lines.&quot; But he added, &quot;it is necessary that
  we commensurately advance on moral lines. Civilization, as it progresses, requires
  a higher conscience, a keener sense of justice, a warmer brotherhood, a wider,
  loftier, truer public spirit. Failing these, civilization must pass into destruction.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> That ethically we have been retrogressing instead of advancing is obvious
  from the physical and spiritual degradation so evident in our great cities,
  and from the moral degeneracy of our permissive society.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06]</font> George recognized that the solution of our problems can be found in studying
  the laws of nature. &quot;The domain of law is not confined to physical nature,&quot; he
  said. &quot;It just as certainly embraces the mental and moral universe, and
  social growth and social life have their laws as fixed as those of matter and
  motion. Would we make social life healthy and happy, we must discover those
  laws, and seek our ends in accordance with them.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> Though &quot;the social and political problems that confront us are darker
  than they realize who have not given thought to them; yet their solution is
  a mere matter of the proper adjustment of social forces.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>His advice on how to help spread knowledge about ways to improve society
  is as valid today as when he gave it. He noted, &quot;the great work of the
  present for every man, and every organization of men, who would improve social
  conditions, is the work of education &#8212; the propagation of ideas. It
  is only as it aids this that anything else can avail. And in this work every
  one who
  can think may aid &#8212; first by forming clear ideas himself, and then by
  endeavoring to arouse the thought of those with whom he comes in contact.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09]</font> He was in advance of his times in urging the equality of women with men,
  for he argued that &quot;we could in no way so increase the attention, the
  intelligence and the devotion which may be brought to the solution of social
  problems as by enfranchising our women.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10]</font> George is best known for his unique program for land reform as set forth
  in <a href="../../George_P&P.html"><em>Progress and Poverty</em></a>, one of America's great classics. In the twenty-two
  essays of <em>Social Problems</em> he expounded thought-provoking ideas for dealing
  with many of the ills which plagued his generation and which still persist
  in our day. If we would but take to heart the advice of this discerning man
  and put his ideas into action the probability is great that many of these problems
  would be satisfactorily solved.</p>
