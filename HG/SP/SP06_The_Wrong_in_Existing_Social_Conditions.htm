<p align="center"><strong>The Wrong in Existing Social Conditions</strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter 5 of <strong><em>Social Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George
(1883) </p>
<p><font size="-2">[01]</font> THE comfortable theory that it is in the nature of things that some should
  be poor and some should be rich, and that the gross and constantly increasing
  inequalities in the distribution of wealth imply no fault in our institutions,
  pervades our literature, and is taught in the press, in the church, in school
  and in college.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02] </font>This is a free country, we are told &#8212; 
  every man has a vote and every man has a chance. The laborer's son may become
  President;
  poor boys of today
  will be millionaires thirty or forty years from now, and the millionaire's
  grandchildren will probably be poor. What more can be asked? If a man has energy,
  industry, prudence and foresight, he may win his way to great wealth. If he
  has not the ability to do this he must not complain of those who have. If some
  enjoy much and do little, it is because they, or their parents, possessed superior
  qualities which enabled them to &quot;acquire property&quot; or &quot;make
  money.&quot; If others must work hard and get little, it is because they have
  not yet got their start, because they are ignorant, shiftless, unwilling to
  practise that economy necessary for the first accumulation of capital; or because
  their fathers were wanting in these respects. The inequalities in condition
  result from the inequalities of human nature, from the difference in the powers
  and capacities of different men. If one has to toil ten or twelve hours a day
  for a few hundred dollars a year, while another, doing little or no hard work,
  gets an income of many thousands, it is because all that the former contributes
  to the augmentation of the common stock of wealth is little more than the mere
  force of his muscles. He can expect little more than the animal, because he
  brings into play little more than animal powers. He is but a private in the
  ranks of the great army of industry, who has but to stand still or march, as
  he is bid. The other is the organizer, the general, who guides and wields the
  whole great machine, who must think, plan and provide; and his larger income
  is only commensurate with the far higher and rarer powers which he exercises,
  and the far greater importance of the function he fulfils. Shall not education
  have its reward, and skill its payment? What incentive would there be to the
  toil needed to learn to do anything well were great prizes not to be gained
  by those who learn to excel? It would not merely be gross injustice to refuse
  a Raphael or a Rubens more than a house-painter, but it would prevent the development
  of great painters. To destroy inequalities in condition would be to destroy
  the incentive to progress. To quarrel with them is to quarrel with the laws
  of nature. We might as well rail against the length of the days or the phases
  of the moon; complain that there are valleys and mountains; zones of tropical
  heat and regions of eternal ice. And were we by violent measures to divide
  wealth equally, we should accomplish nothing but harm; in a little while there
  would be inequalities as great as before.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03] </font>This, in substance, is the teaching which we constantly hear. It is accepted
  by some because it is flattering to their vanity, in accordance with their
  interests or pleasing to their hope; by others, because it is dinned into their
  ears. Like all false theories that obtain wide acceptance, it contains much
  truth. But it is truth isolated from other truth or alloyed with falsehood.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04] </font>To try to pump out a ship with a hole in her hull
  would be hopeless; but that is not to say that leaks may not be stopped and
  ships pumped dry.
  It is undeniable that. under present conditions, inequalities in fortune would
  tend to reassert themselves even if arbitrarily leveled for a moment; but that
  does not prove that the conditions from which this tendency to inequality springs
  may not be altered. Nor because there are differences in human qualities and
  powers does it follow that existing inequalities of fortune are thus accounted
  for. I have seen very fast compositors and very slow compositors, but the fastest
  I ever saw could not set twice as much type as the slowest, and I doubt if
  in other trades the variations are greater. Between normal men the difference
  of a sixth or seventh is a great difference in height &#8212;  the tallest
  giant ever known was scarcely more than four times as tall as the smallest
  dwarf
  ever known, and I doubt if any good observer will say that the mental differences
  of men are greater than the physical differences. Yet we already have men hundreds
  of millions of times richer than other men.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05] </font>That he who produces should have, that he who saves should enjoy, is
  consistent with human reason and with the natural order. But existing inequalities
  of wealth cannot be justified on this ground. As a matter of fact, how many
  great fortunes can be truthfully said to have been fairly earned? How many
  of them represent wealth produced by their possessors or those from whom their
  present possessors derived them? Did there not go to the formation of all of
  them something more than superior industry and skill? Such qualities may give
  the first start, but when fortunes begin to roll up into millions there will
  always be found some element of monopoly, some appropriation of wealth produced
  by others. Often there is a total absence of superior industry, skill or self-denial,
  and merely better luck or greater unscrupulousness.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06] </font>An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco
  recently, leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in England.
  I have known many men more
  industrious, more skilful, more temperate than he &#8212;  men who did not
  or who will not leave a cent. This man did not get his wealth by his industry,
  skill
  or temperance. He no more produced it than did those lucky relations in England
  who may now do nothing for the rest of their lives. He became rich by getting
  hold of a piece of land in the early days, which, as San Francisco grew, became
  very valuable. His wealth represented not what he had earned, but what the
  monopoly of this bit of the earth's surface enabled him to appropriate of the
  earnings of others.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07] </font>A man died in Pittsburgh, the other day, leaving $3,000,000. He may or
  may not have been particularly industrious, skilful and economical, but it
  was not by virtue of these qualities that he got so rich. It was because he
  went to Washington and helped lobby through a bill which, by way of &quot;protecting
  American workmen against the pauper labor of Europe,&quot; gave him the advantage
  of a sixty-percent tariff. To the day of his death he was a stanch protectionist,
  and said free trade would ruin our ''infant industries.&quot; Evidently the
  $3,000,000 which he was enabled to lay by from his own little cherub of an &quot;infant
  industry&quot; did not represent what he had added to production. It was the
  advantage given him by the tariff that enabled him to scoop it up from other
  people's earnings.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08] </font>This element of monopoly, of appropriation and spoliation will, when
  we come to analyze them, be found largely to account for all great fortunes.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[09] </font>There are two classes of men who are always talking
  as though great fortunes resulted from the power of increase belonging to capital &#8212; 
  those who declare that present social adjustments are all right; and those
  who denounce capital
  and insist that interest should be abolished. The typical rich man of the one
  set is he who, saving his earnings, devotes the surplus to aiding production,
  and becomes rich by the natural growth of his capital. The other set make calculations
  of the enormous sum a dollar put out at six per cent. compound interest will
  amount to in a hundred years, and say we must abolish interest if we would
  prevent the growth of great fortunes.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10] </font>But I think it difficult to instance any great fortune really due to
  the legitimate growth of capital obtained by industry.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11] </font>The great fortune of the Rothschilds springs from the treasure secured
  by the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel by selling his people to England to fight
  against our forefathers in their struggle for independence. It began in the
  blood-money received by this petty tyrant from greater tyrants as the price
  of the lives of his subjects. It has grown to its present enormous dimensions
  by the jobbing of loans raised by European kings for holding in subjection
  the people and waging destructive wars upon each other. It no more represents
  the earnings of industry or of capital than do the sums now being wrung by
  England from the poverty-stricken fellahs of Egypt to pay for the enormous
  profits on loans to the Khedive, which he wasted on palaces, yachts, harems,
  ballet-dancers, and cart-loads of diamonds, such as he gave to the Shermans.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12] </font>The great fortune of the Duke of Westminster, the richest of the rich
  men of England, is purely the result of appropriation. It no more springs from
  the earnings of the present Duke of Westminster or any of his ancestors than
  did the great fortunes bestowed by Russian monarchs on their favorites when
  they gave them thousands of the Russian people as their serfs. An English king,
  long since dead, gave to an ancestor of the present Duke of Westminster a piece
  of land over which the city of London has now extended &#8212; that is to
  say, he gave him the privilege, still recognized by the stupid English people,
  which
  enables the present duke to appropriate so much of the earnings of so many
  thousands of the present generation of Englishmen.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13] </font>So, too, the great fortunes of the English brewers and distillers have
  been largely built up by the operation of the excise in fostering monopoly
  and concentrating the business.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14] </font>Or, turning again to the United States, take the great fortune of the
  Astors. It represents for the most part a similar appropriation of the earnings
  of others, as does the income of the Duke of Westminster and other English
  landlords. The first Astor made an arrangement with certain people living in
  his time by virtue of which his children are now allowed to tax other people's
  children &#8212; to demand a very large part of their earnings from many thousands
  of the present population of New York. Its main element is not production or
  saving. No human being can produce land or lay up land. If the Astors had all
  remained in Germany, or if there had never been any Astors, the land of Manhattan
  Island would have been here all the same.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>Take the great Vanderbilt fortune. The first Vanderbilt was a boatman
  who earned money by hard work and saved it. But it was not working and saving
  that enabled him to leave such an enormous fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly.
  As soon as he got money enough he used it as a club to extort from others their
  earnings. He ran off opposition lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel.
  Then he went into railroads, pursuing the same tactics. The Vanderbilt fortune
  no more comes from working and saving than did the fortune that Captain Kidd
  buried.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>Or take the great Gould fortune. Mr. Gould might have got his first little
  start by superior industry and superior self-denial. But it is not that which
  has made him the master of a hundred millions. It was by wrecking rail roads,
  buying judges, corrupting legislatures, getting up rings and pools and combinations
  to raise or depress stock values and transportation rates.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17] </font>So, likewise, of the great fortunes which the Pacific railroads have
  created. They have been made by lobbying through profligate donations of lands,
  bonds and subsidies, by the operations of Cr&eacute;dit Mobilier and Contract
  and Finance Companies, by monopolizing and gouging. And so of fortunes made
  by such combinations as the Standard Oil Company, the Bessemer Steel Ring,
  the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and the various rings for the &quot;protection
  of the American workman from the pauper labor of Europe.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18] </font>Or take the fortunes made out of successful patents. Like that element
  in so many fortunes that comes from the increased value of land, these result
  from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I am not now discussing the expediency
  of patent laws, it may be observed, in passing, that in the vast majority of
  cases the men who make fortunes out of patents are not the men who make the
  inventions.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19] </font>Through all great fortunes, and, in fact, through nearly all acquisitions
  that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes, these elements of monopoly,
  of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one of the largest manufacturing
  firms in the United States said to me recently, &quot;It is not on our ordinary
  business that we make our money; it is where we can get a monopoly.&quot; And
  this, I think, is generally true.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20] </font>Consider the important part in building up fortunes
  which the increase of land values has had, and is having, in the United States.
  This is, of course,
  monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in value it does not mean that
  its owner has added to the general wealth. The owner may never have seen the
  land or done aught to improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant
  city or in another country. Increase of land values simply means that the owners,
  by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed before man was,
  have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth produced by other people's
  labor. Consider how much the monopolies created and the advantages given to
  the unscrupulous by the tariff and by our system of internal taxation &#8212;  how
  much the railroad (a business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water
  and other similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
  rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and stock-gambling, the
  destructive use of wealth in driving off or buying off opposition which the
  public must finally pay for, and many other things which these will suggest,
  have operated to build up large fortunes, and it will at least appear that
  the unequal distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
  that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many who work
  little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the earnings of the one
  class are, in one way or another, filched away from them to swell the incomes
  of the other.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>That individuals are constantly making their way from the ranks of those
  who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those who get more than their
  earnings, no more proves this state of things right than the fact that merchant
  sailors were constantly becoming pirates and participating in the profits of
  piracy, would prove that piracy was right and that no effort should be made
  to suppress it.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[22] </font>I am not denouncing the rich, nor seeking, by speaking of these things,
  to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear understanding of social
  problems, we must recognize the fact that it is due to monopolies which we
  permit and create, to advantages which we give one man over another, to methods
  of extortion sanctioned by law and by public opinion, that some men are enabled
  to get so enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. If we look
  around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation which
  go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see on the one hand
  how disingenuous are those who preach to us that there is nothing wrong in
  social relations and that the inequalities in the distribution of wealth spring
  from the inequalities of human nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild
  are those who talk as though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans
  for arbitrarily restricting the acquisition of wealth. Capital is a good; the
  capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely let any
  one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in doing so.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[23] </font>There are deep wrongs in the present constitution of society, but they
  are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in those social laws
  which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are the laws of the physical
  universe. They are wrongs resulting from bad adjustments which it is within
  our power to amend. The ideal social state is not that in which each gets an
  equal amount of wealth, but in which each gets in proportion to his contribution
  to the general stock. And in such a social state there would not be less incentive
  to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive. Men will be more industrious
  and more moral, better workmen and better citizens, if each takes his earnings
  and carries them home to his family, than where they put their earnings in
  a &quot;pot&quot; and gamble for them until some have far more than they could
  have earned, and others have little or nothing. </p>
