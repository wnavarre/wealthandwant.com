<p align="center"><strong>The Increasing Importance of Social Questions </strong></p>
<p align="center" class="style1">Chapter 1 of <strong><em>Social
  Problems</em></strong>, by Henry George (1883)</p>
<p align="left"><font size="-2">[01]</font> THERE come moments in our lives
  that summon all our powers &#8212; when we feel that, casting away illusions,
  we must decide and act with our utmost intelligence
  and energy. So in the lives of peoples come periods specially calling for earnestness
  and intelligence.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[02]</font> We seem to have entered one of these periods.
  Over and again have nations and civilizations been confronted with problems
  which, like the riddle of the
  Sphinx, not to answer was to be destroyed; but never before have problems
  so vast and intricate been presented. This is not strange. That the closing
  years
  of this century must bring up momentous social questions follows from the material
  and intellectual progress that has marked its course.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[03]</font> Between the development of society and the development of species there
  is a close analogy. In the lowest forms of animal life there is little difference
  of parts; both wants and powers are few and simple; movement seems automatic;
  and instincts are scarcely distinguishable from those of the vegetable. So
  homogeneous are some of these living things, that if cut in pieces, each piece
  still lives. But as life rises into higher manifestations, simplicity gives
  way to complexity, the parts develop into organs having separate functions
  and reciprocal relations, new wants and powers arise, and a greater and greater
  degree of intelligence is needed to secure food and avoid danger. Did fish,
  bird or beast possess no higher intelligence than the polyp, nature could bring
  them forth only to die.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[04]</font> This law &#8212; that the increasing complexity
  and delicacy of organization which give higher capacity and increased power
  are accompanied by increased
  wants and dangers, and require, therefore, increased intelligence &#8212;  runs
  through nature. In the ascending scale of life at last comes man, the most
  highly and
  delicately organized of animals. Yet not only do his higher powers require
  for their use a higher intelligence than exists in other animals, but without
  higher intelligence he could not live. His skin is too thin; his nails too
  brittle; he is too poorly adapted for running, climbing, swimming or burrowing.
  Were he not gifted with intelligence greater than that of any beast, he would
  perish from cold, starve from inability to get food, or be exterminated by
  animals better equipped for the struggle in which brute instinct suffices.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[05]</font> In man, however, the intelligence which increases all through nature's
  rising scale passes at one bound into an intelligence so superior, that the
  difference seems of kind rather than degree. In him, that narrow and seemingly
  unconscious intelligence that we call instinct becomes conscious reason, and
  the godlike power of adaptation and invention makes feeble man nature's king.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[06]</font> But with man the ascending line stops. Animal life assumes no higher
  form; nor can we affirm that, in all his generations, man, as an animal, has
  a whit improved. But progression in another line begins. Where the development
  of species ends, social development commences, and that advance of society
  that we call civilization so increases human powers, that between savage and
  civilized man there is a gulf so vast as to suggest the gulf between the highly
  organized animal and the oyster glued to the rocks. And with every advance
  upon this line new vistas open. When we try to think what knowledge and power
  progressive civilization may give to the men of the future, imagination fails.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[07]</font> In this progression which begins with man, as in that which leads up
  to him, the same law holds. Each advance makes a demand for higher and higher
  intelligence. With the beginnings of society arises the need for social intelligence
  &#8212; for that consensus of individual intelligence which forms a public
  opinion, a public conscience, a public will, and is manifested in law, institutions
  and administration. As society develops, a higher and higher degree of this
  social intelligence is required, for the relation of individuals to each other
  becomes more intimate and important, and the increasing complexity of the social
  organization brings liability to new dangers.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[08]</font> In the rude beginning, each family produces its
  own food, makes its own clothes, builds its own house, and, when it moves,
  furnishes its own transportation.
  Compare with this independence the intricate interdependence of the denizens
  of a modern city. They may supply themselves with greater certainty, and in
  much greater variety and abundance, than the savage; but it is by the cooperation
  of thousands. Even the water they drink, and the artificial light they use,
  are brought to them by elaborate machinery, requiring the constant labor and
  watchfulness of many men. They may travel at a speed incredible to the savage;
  but in doing so resign life and limb to the care of others. A broken rail,
  a drunken engineer, a careless switchman, may hurl them to eternity. And the
  power of applying labor to the satisfaction of desire passes, in the same way,
  beyond the direct control of the individual. The laborer becomes but part of
  a great machine, which may at any time be paralyzed by causes beyond his power,
  or even his foresight. Thus does the well-being of each become more and more
  dependent upon the well-being of all &#8212; the individual more and more
  subordinate to society.</p>
<p align="justify"><font size="-2">[09]</font> And so come new dangers. The rude society resembles the creatures that
  though cut into pieces will live; the highly civilized society is like a highly
  organized animal: a stab in a vital part, the suppression of a single function,
  is death. A savage village may be burned and its people driven off &#8212;  but,
  used to direct recourse to nature, they can maintain themselves. Highly civilized
  man, however, accustomed to capital, to machinery, to the minute division of
  labor, becomes helpless when suddenly deprived of these and thrown upon nature.
  Under the factory system, some sixty persons, with the aid of much costly machinery,
  cooperate to the making of a pair of shoes. But, of the sixty, not one could
  make a whole shoe. This is the tendency in all branches of production, even
  in agriculture. How many farmers of the new generation can use the flail? How
  many farmers' wives can now make a coat from the wool? Many of our farmers
  do not even make their own butter or raise their own vegetables! There is an
  enormous gain in productive power from this division of labor, which assigns
  to the individual the production of but a few of the things, or even but a
  small part of one of the things, he needs, and makes each dependent upon others
  with whom he never comes in contact; but the social organization becomes more
  sensitive. A primitive village community may pursue the even tenor of its life
  without feeling disasters which overtake other villages but a few miles off;
  but in the closely knit civilization to which we have attained, a war, a scarcity,
  a commercial crisis, in one hemisphere produces powerful effects in the other,
  while shocks and jars from which a primitive community easily recovers would
  to a highly civilized community mean wreck.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[10]</font> It is startling to think how destructive in a civilization like ours
  would be such fierce conflicts as fill the history of the past. The wars of
  highly civilized countries, since the opening of the era of steam and machinery,
  have been duels of armies rather than conflicts of peoples or classes. Our
  only glimpse of what might happen, wore passion fully aroused, was in the struggle
  of the Paris Commune. And, since 1870, to the knowledge of petroleum has been
  added that of even more destructive agents. The explosion of a little nitro-glycerin
  under a few water-mains would make a great city uninhabitable; the blowing
  up of a few railroad bridges and tunnels would bring famine quicker than the
  wall of circumvallation that Titus drew around Jerusalem; the pumping of atmospheric
  air into the gas-mains, and the application of a match, would tear up every
  street and level every house. The Thirty Years' War set back civilization in
  Germany; so fierce a war now would all but destroy it. Not merely have destructive
  powers vastly increased, but the whole social organization has become vastly
  more delicate.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[11]</font> In a simpler state master and man, neighbor and neighbor, know each other,
  and there is that touch of the elbow which, in times of danger, enables society
  to rally. But present tendencies are to the loss of this. In London, dwellers
  in one house do not know those in the next; the tenants of adjoining rooms
  are utter strangers to each other. Let civil conflict break or paralyze the
  authority that preserves order and the vast population would become a terror-stricken
  mob, without point of rally or principle of cohesion, and your London would
  be sacked and burned by an army of thieves. London is only the greatest of
  great cities. What is true of London is true of New York, and in the same measure
  true of the many cities whose hundreds of thousands are steadily growing toward
  millions. These vast aggregations of humanity, where he who seeks isolation
  may find it more truly than in the desert; where wealth and poverty touch and
  jostle; where one revels and another starves within a few feet of each other,
  yet separated by as great a gulf as that fixed between Dives in Hell and Lazarus
  in Abraham's bosom &#8212; they are centers and types of our civilization.
  Let jar or shock dislocate the complex and delicate organization, let the policeman's
  club be thrown down or wrested from him, and the fountains of the great deep
  are opened, and quicker than ever before chaos comes again. Strong as it may
  seem, our civilization is evolving destructive forces. Not desert and forest,
  but city slums and country roadsides are nursing the barbarians who may be
  to the new what Hun and Vandal were to the old.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[12]</font> Nor should we forget that in civilized man still lurks the savage. The
  men who, in past times, oppressed or revolted, who fought to the death in petty
  quarrels and drunk fury with blood, who burned cities and rent empires, were
  men essentially such as those we daily meet. Social progress has accumulated
  knowledge, softened manners, refined tastes and extended sympathies, but man
  is yet capable of as blind a rage as when, clothed in skins, he fought wild
  beasts with a flint. And present tendencies, in some respects at least, threaten
  to kindle passions that have so often before flamed in destructive fury.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[13]</font> There is in all the past nothing to compare with the rapid changes now
  going on in the civilized world. It seems as though in the European race, and
  in the nineteenth century, man was just beginning to live &#8212; just grasping
  his tools and becoming conscious of his powers. The snail's pace of crawling
  ages has suddenly become the headlong rush of the locomotive, speeding faster
  and faster. This rapid progress is primarily in industrial methods and material
  powers. But industrial changes imply social changes and necessitate political
  changes. Progressive societies outgrow institutions as children outgrow clothes.
  Social progress always requires greater intelligence in the management of public
  affairs; but this the more as progress is rapid and change quicker.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[14]</font> And that the rapid changes now going on are bringing up problems that
  demand most earnest attention may be seen on every hand. Symptoms of danger,
  premonitions of violence, are appearing all over the civilized world. Creeds
  are dying, beliefs are changing; the old forces of conservatism are melting
  away. Political institutions are failing, as clearly in democratic America
  as in monarchical Europe. There is growing unrest and bitterness among the
  masses, whatever be the form of government, a blind groping for escape from
  conditions becoming intolerable. To attribute all this to the teachings of
  demagogues is like attributing the fever to the quickened pulse. It is the
  new wine beginning to ferment in old bottles. To put into a sailing-ship the
  powerful engines of a first-class ocean steamer would be to tear her to pieces
  with their play. So the new powers rapidly changing all the relations of society
  must shatter social and political organizations not adapted to meet their strain.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[15] </font>To adjust our institutions to growing needs and changing conditions is
  the task which devolves upon us. Prudence, patriotism, human sympathy, and
  religious sentiment, alike call upon us to undertake it. There is danger in
  reckless change; but greater danger in blind conservatism. The problems beginning
  to confront us are grave &#8212; so grave that there is fear they may not
  be solved in time to prevent great catastrophes. But their gravity comes from
  indisposition
  to recognize frankly and grapple boldly with them.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[16] </font>These dangers, which menace not one country alone,
  but modern civilization itself, do but show that a higher civilization is struggling
  to be born &#8212;  that the needs and the aspirations of men have outgrown
  conditions and institutions that before sufficed.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[17]</font> A civilization which tends to concentrate wealth and power in the hands
  of a fortunate few, and to make of others mere human machines, must inevitably
  evolve anarchy and bring destruction. But a civilization is possible in which
  the poorest could have all the comforts and conveniences now enjoyed by the
  rich; in which prisons and almshouses would be needless, and charitable societies
  unthought of. Such a civilization waits only for the social intelligence that
  will adapt means to ends. Powers that might give plenty to all are already
  in our hands. Though there is poverty and want, there is, yet, seeming embarrassment
  from the very excess of wealth-producing forces. &quot;Give us but a market,&quot; say
  manufacturers, &quot;and we will supply goods without end!&quot; &quot;Give
  us but work!&quot; cry idle men.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[18]</font> The evils that begin to appear spring from the fact that the application
  of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application of
  intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science strides
  forward, but political science lags. With all our progress in the arts which
  produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing its equitable distribution.
  Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and commerce have been revolutionized;
  but whether free trade or protection is best for a nation we are not yet agreed.
  We have brought machinery to a pitch of perfection that, fifty years ago, could
  not have been imagined; but, in the presence of political corruption, we seem
  as helpless as idiots. The East River bridge is a crowning triumph of mechanical
  skill; but to get it built a leading citizen of Brooklyn had to carry to New
  York sixty thousand dollars in a carpet bag to bribe New York aldermen. The
  human soul that thought out the great bridge is prisoned in a crazed and broken
  body that lies bedfast, and could watch it grow only by peering through a telescope.
  Nevertheless, the weight of the immense mass is estimated and adjusted for
  every inch. But the skill of the engineer could not prevent condemned wire
  being smuggled into the cable.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[19]</font> The progress of civilization requires that more and more intelligence
  be devoted to social affairs, and this not the intelligence of the few, but
  that of the many. We cannot safely leave politics to politicians, or political
  economy to college professors. The people themselves must think, because the
  people alone can act.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[20]</font> In a &quot;journal of civilization&quot; a professed
  teacher declares the saving word for society to be that each shall mind his
  own business. This
  is the gospel of selfishness, soothing as soft flutes to those who, having
  fared well themselves, think everybody should be satisfied. But the salvation
  of society, the hope for the free, full development of humanity, is in the
  gospel of brotherhood &#8212; the gospel of Christ. Social progress makes
  the well-being of all more and more the business of each; it binds all closer
  and closer together
  in bonds from which none can escape. He who observes the law and the proprieties,
  and cares for his family, yet takes no interest in the general weal, and gives
  no thought to those who are trodden under foot, save now and then to bestow
  aims, is not a true Christian. Nor is he a good citizen. The duty of the citizen
  is more and harder than this.</p>
<p><font size="-2">[21] </font>The intelligence required for the solving of social problems is not a
  thing of the mere intellect. It must be animated with the religious sentiment
  and warm with sympathy for human suffering. It must stretch out beyond self-interest,
  whether it be the self-interest of the few or of the many. It must seek justice.
  For at the bottom of every social problem we will find a social wrong. </p>
