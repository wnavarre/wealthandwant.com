<b>Thy Kingdom Come</b> <br>
</center>
<center>by Henry George <br>
</center>
<center>An address delivered on 28 April 1889 in the City Hall,
Glasgow, Scotland<br>
<em>A sermon delivered in the City Hall, Glasgow, Scotland, Sunday<br>
April 28, 1889, under the auspices of the Henry George Institute,<br>
and afterwards circulated extensively in tract form by the<br>
Scottish Land Restoration League.</em><br>
</center>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>Just as society grows, so do the common needs grow, and
so grows this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which
they can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without
impairing the right of property, without taking anything from the
producer, without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We have just joined in the most solemn, the most sacred, the most
catholic of all prayers: &#8220;Our Father which art in Heaven!&#8221;
To all of us who have learned it in our infancy, it oft calls up the
sweetest and most tender emotions. Sometimes with feeling, sometimes
as a matter of course, how often have we repeated it? For centuries,
daily, hourly, has that prayer gone up. </p>
<p> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Has it come? Let this Christian
city of Glasgow answer &#8212; Glasgow, that was to &#8220;Flourish by
the preaching of the word&#8221;. </p>
<p> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; Day after day, Sunday after
Sunday, week after week, century after century, has that prayer gone
up; and today, in this so-called Christian city of Glasgow, 125,000
human beings &#8212; so your medical officer says &#8212; 125,000
children of God are living whole families in a single room. </p>
<p> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; We have been praying for it and
praying for it, yet it has not come. So long has it tarried that many
think it will never come. Here is the vital point in which what we
are accustomed to call the Christianity of the present day differs so
much from that Christianity which overran the ancient world &#8212;
that Christianity which, beneath a rotten old civilisation, planted
the seeds of a newer and a higher. </p>
<p> We have become accustomed to think that God&#8217;s kingdom, is
not intended for this world; that, virtually, this is the
devil&#8217;s world, and that God&#8217;s kingdom is in some other
sphere, to which He is to take good people when they die &#8212; as
good Americans are said when they die to go to Paris. If that be so,
what is the use of praying for the coming of the kingdom? Is God the
loving Father of whom Christ told &#8212; is He a God of that kind; a
God who looks on this world, sees its sufferings and its miseries,
sees high faculties aborted, lives stunted, innocence turned to vice
and crime, and heartstrings strained and broken, yet, having it in
His power, will not bring that kingdom of peace, and love, and plenty
and happiness? Is God indeed a self-willed despot, whom we must coax
to do the good He might? </p>
<p> Think of it. The Almighty &#8212; and I say it with reverence
&#8212; the Almighty could not bring that kingdom of Himself. For,
what is the kingdom of God; the kingdom that Christ taught us to pray
for? Is it not in the doing of God&#8217;s will, not by automata, not
by animals who are compelled, but by intelligent beings clothed with
free will, intelligent beings knowing good from evil? </p>
<p> Swedenborg never said a deeper nor a truer thing, nor a thing
more compatible with the philosophy of Christianity, than when he
said God had never put anyone into hell; that the devils went to hell
because they would rather go to hell than go to heaven. The spirits
of evil would be unhappy in a place where the spirit of good reigned;
wedded to injustice, and loving injustice, they would be miserable
where justice was the law. And, correlatively, God could not put
intelligent beings having free will into conditions where they must
do right without destroying that free will. Nay! Nay! </p>
<p> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; When Christ taught that prayer He
did not mean that humans should idly phrase these words, but that for
the coming of that kingdom humanity must work as well as pray! </p>
<p> Prayer! Consider what prayer is. How true is the old fable! The
wagoner whose wagon was stuck in the rut knelt down and prayed to
Jove to get it out. He might have prayed till the crack of doom, and
the wagon would have stood there. This world &#8212; God&#8217;s world
&#8212; is not a world in which the repeating of words will get wagons
out of mire or poverty out of slums. We who would pray with effect
must work! </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Divine and human intelligence</span>
</p>
<p> &#8220;Our Father which art in Heaven.&#8221; Not a despot, ruling
by His arbitrary fiats, but a Father, a loving Father, Our Father; a
Father for us all &#8212; that was Christ&#8217;s message. He is Our
Father, and we are His children. </p>
<p> But there are people, who, looking around on the suffering and
injustice with which, even in so-called Christian countries, human
life is full, say there is no Father in Heaven, there can be no God,
or He would not permit this. How superficial is that thought! </p>
<p> What would we as fathers do for our children? Is there any man
who, having a knowledge of the world and the laws of human life,
would so surround his boy with safeguards that he could do no evil
and could suffer no pain? What would he make by that course of
education? A pampered animal, not a self-reliant man! </p>
<p> We are, indeed, His children. Yet, let one of us fall into the
water, and if we have not learned to swim we will drown. And if we
are a good distance from land and near no boat or anything on which
we may get, we will drown anyhow, whether we can swim or not. </p>
<p> God the Creator might have made us so that we could swim like
the fishes, but how could He have made us so that we could swim like
the fishes and yet have adapted this wonderful frame of ours to all
the purposes for which the intelligence that is lodged within it
requires it to be used? God can make a fish; He can make a bird; but
does He, His laws being what they are, make an animal that might at
once swim as well as a fish and fly as well as a bird? </p>
<p> That the intelligence which we must recognise behind nature is
almighty does not mean that it can contradict itself and stultify its
own laws. No; we are the children of God. But what God is, who shall
say? But everyone is conscious of this, that behind what one sees
there must have been a power to bring that forth; that behind what
one knows there is an intelligence far greater than that which is
lodged in the human mind, but which human intelligence does in some
infinitely less degree resemble. </p>
<p> Yes; we are His children. We in some sort have that power of
adapting things which we know must have been exerted to bring this
universe into being. Consider those great ships for which this port
of Glasgow is famous all over the world. Consider one of those great
ocean steamers, such as the Umbria, or the Etruria, or the City of
New York, or the City of Paris. There, in the ocean which such ships
cleave, are the porpoises, there are the whales, there are the
dolphins, there are all manner of fish. They are today just as they
were when Caesar crossed to this island, just as they were before the
first ancient Briton launched his leather-covered boat. </p>
<p> Humanity today can swim no better than humanity could swim then,
but consider how, by our intelligence, we have advanced higher and
higher, how our power of making things has developed, until now we
cross the great ocean quicker than any fish. Consider one of these
great steamers forcing her way across the Atlantic Ocean, 400 miles a
day, against a living gale. Is she not in some sort a product of a
God-like power &#8212; a machine of some sort like the very fishes
that swim underneath. </p>
<p> Here is the distinguishing thing between humankind and the
animals; here is the broad and impassable gulf. We among all the
animals are the only maker; we among all the animals are the only
ones that possess that God-like power of adapting means to ends. And
is it possible that we who possess the power of so adapting means to
ends that we can cross the Atlantic in six days do not possess the
power of abolishing the conditions that crowd thousands of families
into houses of one room? </p>
<p> When we consider the achievements of humanity and then look upon
the misery that exists today in the very centres of wealth; upon the
ignorance, the weakness, the injustice, that characterise our highest
civilisation, we may know of a surety that it is not the fault of
God; it is the fault of humanity. May we not know that in that very
power that God has given to His children here, in that power of
rising higher, there is involved &#8212; and necessarily involved
&#8212; the power of falling lower. </p>
<p> &#8220;Our Father!&#8221; &#8220;Our Father!&#8221; Whose? Not <span
 style="font-style: italic;">my
</span>Father &#8212; that is not the prayer. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Our </span>Father&#8221; &#8212;
not the father of any sect, or any class, but the Father of all
humanity. The All-Father, the equal Father, the loving Father. He it
is we ask to bring the kingdom. Aye, we ask it with our lips! We call
Him &#8220;Our Father,&#8221; the All, the Universal Father, when we
kneel down to pray to Him. </p>
<p> But that He is the All-Father &#8212; that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labor! If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few! </p>
<p> There was a little dialogue published in the United States, in
the west, some time ago. Possibly you may have seen it. It is between
a boy and his father when visiting a brickyard. The boy looks at the
men making bricks, and he asks who those dirty men are, why they are
making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and
then he asks about the owner of the brickyard. &#8220;He does not make
any bricks; he gets his income from letting the other men make
bricks.&#8221; </p>
<p> Then the boy wants to know how the man who owns the brickyard
gets his title to the brickyard &#8212; whether he made it. &#8220;No,
he did not make it,&#8221; the father replies: &#8220;God made
it.&#8221; The boy asks, &#8220;Did God make it for him?&#8221; Whereat
his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but
that anyhow it is all right, and it is all in accordance with
God&#8217;s law. The boy, who of course was a Sunday school boy, and
had been to church, goes off mumbling to himself &#8220;that God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for all
men&#8221;; but that He so loved the owner of this brickyard that He
gave him the brickyard too.</p>
<p> This has a blasphemous sound. But I do not refer to it lightly.
I do not like to speak lightly of sacred subjects. Yet it is well
sometimes that we should be fairly shocked into thinking. </p>
<p> Think of what Christianity teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. </p>
<p> Better to me, higher to me, is the atheist, who says there is no
God, than the professed Christian who, prating of the goodness and
the Fatherhood of God, tells us in words as some do, or tells us
indirectly as others do, that millions and millions of human
creatures &#8212; [at this point a child was heard crying]
&#8212; don&#8217;t take the little thing out &#8212; that millions and
millions of human beings, like that little baby, are being brought
into the world daily by the creative fiat, and no place in this world
provided for them. </p>
<p> Aye! Tells us that, by the laws of God, the poor are created in
order that the rich may have the unctuous satisfaction of dealing out
charity to them, and attributes to the laws of God the state of
things which exists in this city of Glasgow, as in other great cities
on both sides of the Atlantic, where little children are dying every
day, dying by hundreds of thousands, because having come into this
world &#8212; those children of God, with His fiat, by His decree
&#8212; they find that there is not space on the earth sufficient for
them to live; and are driven out of God&#8217;s world because they
cannot get room enough, cannot get air enough, cannot get sustenance
enough. </p>
<p> I believe in no such god. If I did, though I might bend before
him in fear, I would hate him in my heart. Not room for the little
children here! Look around any country in the civilized world; is
there not room enough and to spare? Not food enough? Look at the
unemployed labor, look at the idle acres, look through every country
and see natural opportunities going to waste. Aye! That Christianity
puts on the Creator the evil, the injustice, the degradation that are
due to humanity&#8217;s injustice is worse, far worse, than atheism.
That is the blasphemy, and if there be a sin against the Holy Ghost,
that is the unpardonable sin! </p>
<p> Why, consider: &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; I
stopped in a hotel last week &#8212; a hydropathic establishment. A
hundred or more guests sat down to table together. Before they ate
anything, a man stood up, and, thanking God, asked Him to make us all
grateful for His bounty. And it is so at every mealtime &#8212; such
an acknowledgement is made over well-filled boards. What do we mean
by it? </p>
<p> If Adam, when he got out of Eden, had sat down and commenced to
pray, he might have prayed till this time without getting anything to
eat unless he went to work for it. Yet food is God&#8217;s bounty. He
does not bring meat and vegetables all prepared. What He gives are
the opportunities of producing these things &#8212; of bringing them
forth by labor. His mandate is &#8212; it is written in the Holy
Word, it is graven on every fact in nature &#8212; that by labor we
shall bring forth these things. Nature gives to labor and to nothing
else. </p>
<p> What God gives are the natural elements that are indispensable
to labor. He gives them, not to one, not to some, not to one
generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
human race. And yet in all our civilized countries what do we see?
That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
their labor to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the
Creator&#8217;s bounty. </p>
<p> Thus it happens that all over the civilized world that class
that is called peculiarly &#8216;the laboring class&#8217; is the poor
class, and that people who do no labor, who pride themselves on
never having done honest labor, and on being descended from fathers
and grandfathers who never did a stroke of honest labor in their
lives, revel in a superabundance of the things that labor brings
forth. </p>
<p> Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a strict orthodox Presbyterian
&#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212;wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </p>
<p> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;But there are a lot of
tramp angels here now." </p>
<p> &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; asked Mr Thomas. &#8220;I thought
everybody had plenty in heaven.&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;It used to be that way some time ago,&#8221; said the
warden: &#8220;And if you wanted to get your harp polished or your
wings combed, you had to do it yourself. But matters have changed
since we adopted the same kind of property regulations in heaven as
you have in civilized countries on earth, and we find it a great
improvement, at least for the better class.&#8221; </p>
<p> Then the warden told the newcomer that he had better decide
where he was going to board.</p>
<p> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to board anywhere,&#8221; said Thomas:
&#8220;I would much rather go over to that beautiful green knoll and
lie down.&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;I would not advise you to do so,&#8221; said the warden:
&#8220;The angel who owns that knoll does not like to encourage
trespassing. Some centuries ago, as I told you, we introduced the
system of private property into the soil of heaven. So we divided the
land up. It is all private property now.&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;I hope I was considered in that division?&#8221; said
Thomas. </p>
<p> &#8220;No,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;You were not; but if you
go to work, and are saving, you can easily earn enough in a couple of
centuries to buy yourself a nice piece. You get a pair of wings free
as you come in, and you will have no difficulty in hypothecating them
for a few days board until you find work. But I should advise you to
be quick about it, as our population is constantly increasing, and
there is a great surplus of labor. Tramp angels are, in fact,
becoming quite a nuisance.&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;What shall I go to work at?&#8221; asked Thomas. </p>
<p> &#8220;Our principal industries are the making of harps and
crowns and the growing of flowers,&#8221; responded the warden:
&#8220;But there any many opportunities for employment in personal
service.&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;I love flowers,&#8221; said Thomas. &#8220;I will go to work
growing them, There is a beautiful piece of land over there that
nobody seems to be using. I will go to work on that.&#8221; </p>
<p> &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said the warden. &#8220;That
property belongs to one of our most far-sighted angels who has got
very rich by the advance of land values, and who is holding that
piece for a rise. You will have to buy it or rent it before you can
work on it, and you can&#8217;t do that yet.&#8221; </p>
<p> The story goes on to describe how the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </p>
<p> You laugh, and it is ridiculous. But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven? </p>
<p> Really, if we could imagine it, it is impossible to think of
heaven treated as we treat this earth, without seeing that, no matter
how salubrious were its air, no matter how bright the light that
filled it, no matter how magnificent its vegetable growth, there
would be poverty, and suffering, and a division of classes in heaven
itself, if heaven were parcelled out as we have parceled out the
earth. And, conversely, if people were to act towards each other as
we must suppose the inhabitants of heaven to do, would not this earth
be a very heaven? </p>
<p> &#8220;Thy kingdom come.&#8221; No one can think of the kingdom
for which the prayer asks without feeling that it must be a kingdom
of justice and equality &#8212; not necessarily of equality in
condition, but of equality in opportunity. And no one can think of it
without seeing that a very kingdom of God might be brought on this
earth if people would but seek to do justice &#8212; if people would
but acknowledge the essential principle of Christianity, that of
doing to others as we would have others do to us, and of recognising
that we are all here equally the children of the one Father, equally
entitled to share His bounty, equally entitled to live our lives and
develop our faculties, and to apply our labor to the raw material
that He has provided. </p>
<p> Aye! When a person sees that, then there arises that hope of the
coming of the kingdom that carried the gospel through the streets of
Rome, that carried it into pagan lands, that made it, against the
most ferocious persecution, the dominant religion of the world. </p>
<p> Early Christianity did not mean, in its prayer for the coming of
Christ&#8217;s kingdom, a kingdom in heaven, but a kingdom on earth.
If Christ had simply preached of the other world, the high priests
and the Pharisees would not have persecuted Him, the Roman soldiery
would not have nailed His hands to the cross. Why was Christianity
persecuted? Why were its first professors thrown to wild beasts,
burned to light a tyrant&#8217;s gardens, hounded, tortured, put to
death by all the cruel devices that a devilish ingenuity could
suggest? Not that it was a new religion, referring only to the
future. Rome was tolerant of all religions. It was the boast of Rome
that all gods were sheltered in her Pantheon; it was the boast of
Rome that she made no interference with the religions of peoples she
conquered. </p>
<p> What was persecuted was a great movement for social reform
&#8212; the gospel of justice &#8212; heard by common fishermen with
gladness, carried by laborers and slaves into the imperial city of
Rome. The Christian revelation was the doctrine of human equality, of
the fatherhood of God, of the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity.
It struck at the very basis of that monstrous tyranny that then
oppressed the civilized world; it struck at the fetters of the
captive, and at the bonds of the slave, at that monstrous injustice
which allowed a class to revel on the proceeds of labor, while those
who did the labor fared scantily. </p>
<p> That is the reason why early Christianity was persecuted. And
when they could no longer hold it down, then the privileged classes
adopted and perverted the new faith, and it became, in its very
triumph, not the pure Christianity of the early days, but a
Christianity that, to a very great extent, was the servitor of the
privileged classes. </p>
<p> And, instead of preaching the essential Fatherhood of God, the
essential brotherhood and sisterhood of humankind, its high priests
grafted onto the pure truths of the gospel the blasphemous doctrine
that the All-Father is a respecter of persons, and that by His will
and on His mandate is founded that monstrous injustice which condemns
the great mass of humanity to unrequited hard toil. There has been no
failure of Christianity. The failure has been in the sort of
Christianity that has been preached. </p>
<p> Nothing is clearer than that if we are all children of the
universal Father, we are all entitled to the use of His bounty. No
one dare deny that proposition. But the people who set their faces
against its carrying out say, virtually: &#8220;Oh, yes! that is true;
but it is impracticable to carry it into effect!&#8221; Just think of
what this means. This is God&#8217;s world, and yet such people say
that it is a world in which God&#8217;s justice, God&#8217;s will,
cannot be carried into effect. What a monstrous absurdity, what a
monstrous blasphemy! </p>
<p> If the loving God does reign, if His laws are the laws not
merely of the physical, but of the moral universe, there must be a
way of carrying His will into effect, there must be a way of doing
equal justice to all of His creatures. </p>
<p> There is. The people who deny that there is any practical way of
carrying into effect the perception that all human beings are equally
children of the Creator shut their eyes to the plain and obvious way.
It is, of course, impossible in a civilisation like this of ours to
divide land up into equal pieces. Such a system might have done in a
primitive state of society. We have progressed in civilisation beyond
such rude devices, but we have not, nor can we, progress beyond
God&#8217;s providence. </p>
<p> There is a way of securing the equal rights of all, not by
dividing land up into equal pieces, but by taking for the use of all
that value which attaches to land, not as the result of individual
labor upon it, but as the result of the increase in population, and
the improvement of society. In that way everyone would be equally
interested in the land of one&#8217;s native country. Here is the
simple way. It is a way that impresses the person who really sees its
beauty with a more vivid idea of the beneficence of the providence of
the All-Father than, it seems to me, does anything else. </p>
<p> One cannot look, it seems to me, through nature &#8212; whether
one looks at the stars through a telescope, or have the microscope
reveal to one those worlds that we find in drops of water. Whether
one considers the human frame, the adjustments of the animal kingdom,
or any department of physical nature, one must see that there has
been a contriver and adjuster, that there has been an intent. So
strong is that feeling, so natural is it to our minds, that even
people who deny the Creative Intelligence are forced, in spite of
themselves, to talk of intent; the claws on one animal were intended,
we say, to climb with, the fins of another to propel it through the
water. </p>
<p> Yet, while in looking through the laws of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </p>
<p> Why, consider what it means! It means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labor. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labor takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want. </p>
<p> Just as society grows, so do the common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without impairing
the right of property, without taking anything from the producer,
without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. Nay,
here is a value that <span style="font-style: italic;">must </span>be
taken if we would prevent the most
monstrous of all monopolies. What does all this mean? It means that
in the creative plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an
advance to a greater and greater equality instead of to a more and
more monstrous inequality. </p>
<p> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; It may be that we shall never see
it. But to those people who realise that it may come, to those who
realise that it is given to them to work for the coming of God&#8217;s
kingdom on earth, there is for them, though they never see that
kingdom here, an exceedingly great reward &#8212; the reward of
feeling that they, little and insignificant though they may be, are
doing something to help the coming of that kingdom, doing something
on the side of that Good Power that shows all through the universe,
doing something to tear this world from the devil&#8217;s grasp and
make it the kingdom of righteousness. </p>
<p> Aye, and though it should never come, yet those who struggle for
it know in the depths of their hearts that it must exist somewhere
&#8212; they know that, somewhere, sometime, those who strive their
best for the coming of the kingdom will be welcomed into the kingdom,
and that to them, even to them, sometime, somewhere, the King shall
say: &#8220;Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into
the joy of thy Lord.&#8221;</p>
