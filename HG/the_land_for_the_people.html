<b>The Land for the People</b>
</center>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br>
By Henry George
</div>
<center>An Address Delivered on July 11, 1889, <br>
in Toomebridge, County
Derry, Ireland</center>
<p>THE Land Question is not merely a question between farmers and the
owners of agricultural land. It is a question that affects every man,
every woman, and every child. The Land Question is simply another
name for the great labor question, and the people who think of the
Land Question as having importance simply for farmers forget what
land is.</p>
<p>If you would realize what land is, think of what men would be
without land. If there were no land, where would be the people? Land
is not merely a place to graze cows or sheep upon, to raise corn or
raise cabbage. It is the indispensable element necessary to the life
of every human being. We are all land animals; our very bodies come
from the land, and to the land they return again.</p>
<p>Whether a man dwells in the city or in the country, whether he be
a farmer, a laborer, a mechanic, a manufacturer, or a soldier, land
is absolutely necessary to his life. No matter what his occupation
may by, if he is engaged in productive labor, that productive labor,
if you analyze it, is simply the application of human exertion to
land, the changing in place or in form of the matter of the
universe.</p>
WE speak of productive work. What is productive work? We make
things. How do we make them? Man does not create them. Man cannot
create something out of nothing. All the things that we call making
are producing; bringing forth, not creating.
<ul>
  <li>Men produce coal by going down under the ground, hewing out the
coal, and bringing it to the surface of the earth;</li>
  <li>they produce fish
by going to the lough, or river, or ocean and pulling the fish out;  </li>
  <li>they produce houses by bringing together timber and stones and
iron
into the shape and form of a house;  </li>
  <li>they produce cloth by taking the
wool of a sheep or the fibers of a plant and bringing them together
in a certain connection;  </li>
  <li>they produce crops by opening the ground and
putting in seed and leaving it there for the germinating influences
of nature</li>
</ul>
&#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;">always a bringing forth, never a
creation</span>, so that human
exertion &#8212; that is to say labor upon land, is the only way that man
has of bringing forth those things which his needs require and which
are necessary to enable him to sustain life. Land and labor &#8212; these
are the two necessary and indispensable factors to the production of
wealth.<br>
<br>
NOW, as to the rights of ownership &#8212; as to that principle which
enables a man to say of any certain thing &#8212;"This is mine; it is my
property" &#8212; where does that come from? If you look you will see that
it comes from the right of the producer to the thing which he
produces. What a man makes he can justly claim to be his. Whatever
any individual, by the exercise of his powers, takes from the
reservoirs of nature, molds into shapes fitted to satisfy human
needs, that is his; to that a just and sacred right of property
attaches. That is a right based on the right of the individual to
improvement, the right to the enjoyment of his own powers, to the
possession of the fruits of his exertions. That is a sacred right, to
violate which is to violate the sacred command, "Thou shalt not
steal." There is the right of ownership. Now that right, which gives
by natural and Divine laws, the thing produced to him whose exertion
has produced it, which gives to the man who builds a house the right
to that house, to the man who raises a crop the right to that crop,
to the man who raises a domestic animal a right to that domestic
animal-how can that right attach to the reservoirs of nature? How can
that right attach to the earth itself? <br>
<br>
<b>WE start out with these two principles, which I think are clear
and self-evident:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>that which a man makes belongs to him and can by
him be given or sold to anyone that he pleases. 
    </b></li>
  <li><b>But that which existed
before man came upon the earth, that which was not produced by man,
but which was created by God &#8212; that belongs equally to all men.&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
As
no man made the land, so no man can claim a right of ownership in the
land. As God made the land, and as we know both from natural
perception and from revealed religion, that God the Creator is no
respecter of persons, that in His eyes all men are equal, so also do
we know that He made this earth equally for all the human creatures
that He has called to dwell upon it. We start out with this clear
principle that as all men are here by the equal permission of the
Creator, as they are all here under His laws equally requiring the
use of land, as they are all here with equal right to live, so they
are all here with equal right to the enjoyment of His bounty.
<p>We claim that the land of Ireland, like the land of every country,
cannot justly belong to any class, whether that class be large or
small; but that the land of Ireland, like the land of every other
country, justly belongs in usufruct to the whole people of that
country equally, and that no man and no class of men can have any
just right in the land that is not equally shared by all others.</p>
<p>We say that all the social difficulties we see here, all the
social difficulties that exist in England or Scotland, all the social
difficulties that are growing up in the United States&#8212;</p>
<ul>
  <li>the lowness
of wages,  </li>
  <li>the scarcity of employment,  </li>
  <li>the fact that though labor is
the producer of wealth, yet everywhere the laboring class is the poor
class</li>
</ul>
&#8212;are all due to one great primary wrong, that wrong which makes
the natural element necessary to all, the natural element that was
made by the Creator for the use of all, the property of some of the
people, that great wrong that in every civilized country disinherited
the mass of men of the bounty of their Creator. What we aim at is not
the increase in the number of a privileged class, not making some
thousands of earth owners into some more thousands. No, no; what we
aim at is to secure the natural and God-given right to the humblest
in the community&#8212;to secure to every child born in Ireland, or in any
other country, his natural right to the equal use of his native
land.
<p>How can we secure that? We cannot secure it by dividing the land
up equally, by giving each man or each family an equal piece. That is
a device that might suit a rude community, provided that, as under
the Mosaic code, those equal pieces be made unalienable, so that they
could never be sold away from the family. But under our modern
civilization where industry is complex, where land in some places is
very valuable and in other places of but little value, where it is
constantly changing in relative value, the equal division of the land
could not secure equality.</p>
<br>
<b>THE way to secure equality is plain. It is not by dividing the
land; it is by calling upon those who are allowed possession of
pieces of land giving special advantage to pay to the whole
community, the rest of the people, aye, and including themselves&#8212;to
the whole people, a fair rent or premium for that privilege, and
using the fund so obtained for the benefit of the whole people.
</b>What we would do would be to make the whole people the general
landlord, to have whatever rent is paid for the use of land to go,
not into the pockets of individual landlords, but into the treasury
of the general community, where it could be used for the common
benefit.
<p>Now, rent is a natural and just thing. For instance, if we in this
room were to go together to a new country and we were to agree that
we should settle in that new country on equal terms, how could we
divide the land up in such a way as to insure and to continue
equality? If it were proposed that we should divide it up into equal
pieces, there would be in the first place this objection, that in our
division we would not fully know the character of the land; one man
would get a more valuable piece than the other. Then as time passed
the value of different pieces of land would change, and further than
that if we were once to make a division and then allow full and
absolute ownership of the land, inequality would come up in the
succeeding generation. One man would be thriftless, another man, on
the contrary, would be extremely keen in saving and pushing; one man
would be unfortunate and another man more fortunate; and so on. In a
little while many of these people would have parted with their land
to others, so that their children coming after them into the world
would have no land. The only fair way would be this&#8212; that any man
among us should be at liberty to take up any piece of land, and use
it, that no one else wanted to use; that where more than one man
wanted to use the same piece of land, the man who did use it should
pay a premium which, going into a common fund and being used for the
benefit of all, would put everybody upon a plane of equality. That
would be the ideal way of dividing up the land of a new country.</p>
THE problem is how to apply that to an old country. True we are
confronted with this fact all over the civilized world that a certain
class have got possession of the land, and want to hold it. Now one
of your distinguished leaders, Mr. Parnell in his Drogheda speech
some years ago, said there were only two ways of getting the land for
the people. One way was to buy it; the other was to fight for it. I
do not think that is true. I think that Mr. Parnell overlooked at
that time a most important <b>third way</b>, and that is the way we
advocate.
<p><b>That is what we propose by what we call the single tax. We
propose to abolish all taxes for revenue. In place of all the taxes
that are now levied, to impose one single tax, and that a tax upon
the value of land.</b> Mark me, upon the value of land alone &#8212; not
upon the value of improvements, not upon the value of what the
exercise of labor has done to make land valuable, that belongs to the
individual; but upon the value of the land itself, irrespective of
the improvements, so that an acre of land that has not been improved
will pay as much tax as an acre of like land that has been improved.
So that in a town a house site on which there is no building shall be
called upon to pay just as much tax as a house site on which there is
a house.</p>
<p>I said that rent is a natural thing. So it is. Where one man, all
rights being equal, has a piece of land of better quality than
another man, it is only fair to all that he should pay the
difference. Where one man has a piece of land and others have none,
it gives him a special advantage; it is only fair that he should pay
into the common fund the value of that special privilege granted him
by the community. That is what is called <b>economic rent</b>.</p>
<br>
BUT over and above the economic rent there is the power that comes
by monopoly, there is the power to extract a rent, which may be
called <b>monopoly rent</b>. On this island that I have supposed we
go and settle on, under the plan we have proposed each man should pay
annually to the special fund in accordance with the special privilege
the peculiar value of the piece of land he held, and those who had
land of no peculiar value should pay nothing. That rent that would be
payable by the individual to the community would only amount to the
value of the special privilege that he enjoyed from the community.
But <span style="font-weight: bold;">if one man owned the island, and
if we went there and you people
were fools enough to allow me to lay claim to the ownership of the
island and say it belonged to me, then I could charge a monopoly
rent; I could make you pay me every penny that you earned, save just
enough for you to live; and the reason I could not make you pay more
is simply this, that if you would pay more you would die.&nbsp; </span><br>
<br>
THE power to exact that monopoly rent comes from the power to hold
land idle &#8212; comes from the power to keep labor off the land. Tax up
land to its full value and that power would be gone; the richest
landowners could not afford to hold valuable land idle. Everywhere
that simple plan would compel the landowner either to use his land or
to sell out to some one who would; and the rent of land would then
fall to its true economic rate&#8212;the value of the special privilege it
gave would go not to individuals, but to the general community, to be
used for the benefit of the whole community.
<p>I cannot pass on without mentioning the name of one of the
distinguished Irishmen who have declared for the principle long
before they heard of me. I refer to only one name. Many of you know,
and doubtless all of you have heard, of Dr. Nulty, the Bishop of
Meath.</p>
<p>IN 1881, before I had ever been in Ireland or Dr. Nulty had ever
heard of me, he wrote <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Nulty_BttL.html">a
letter on the Land Question to the clergy and laity of the diocese of
Meath</a>. Dr. Nulty lays down precisely the principle that I have
endeavored to lay down here before you briefly, that there is a right
of ownership that comes from work, from production; that it is the
law of nature, the law of God, </p>
<ul>
  <li>that all men should work; </li>
  <li>that what a man produces by his labor belongs to him; </li>
  <li>that the reservoir from which everything must come &#8212; the land
itself &#8212; can belong to no man, and </li>
  <li>that its proper treatment is just as I have proposed to let there
be security of possession and to let those who have special privileges
pay into the common fund for those privileges, and to use that fund for
the benefit of all. </li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Nulty goes on to say what every man who has studied this
subject will cordially endorse, that the natural law of rent &#8212; that
law by which population increases the value of land in certain places
and makes it grow higher and higher &#8212; that principle by which, as
the city grows, land becomes more valuable &#8212; that that is to his
mind <span style="font-weight: bold;">the clearest and best proof, not
merely of the intelligence but
of the beneficence of the Creator</span>. For he shows clearly that
that is
the natural provision by virtue of which, if men would only obey
God's law of justice, if men would only obey the fundamental maxim of
Christianity to do to others as they would be done to them: that by
virtue of that provision, as the advance of civilization went on, it
would be towards a greater and greater equality among men &#8212; not a nod
to a more and more monstrous inequality.</p>
<p>  <b>THESE are the plain, simple principles for which we contend,
  and our practical measure for restoring to all men of any country
  their equal rights in the land of that country is simply to abolish
  other taxes, to put a tax upon the value of land, irrespective of the
  improvements, to carry that tax up as fast as we can, until we absorb
  the full value of the land, and we say that that would utterly
  destroy the monopoly of land and create a fund for the benefit of the
  entire community. </b>How easy a way that is to go from an unjust
  situation like the present to an ideally just situation may be seen
  among other things in this. Where you propose to take land for the
  benefit of the whole people you are at once met by the demands of the
  landlords for compensation. Now, if you tax them, no one ever heard
  of such an idea as to compensate a people for imposing tax.</p>
<p>In that easy way the land can again be made the property in
usufruct of the whole people, by a gentle and gradual process.</p>
<p> WHAT I ask you here tonight is as far as you can to join in this
  general movement and push on the cause. It is not a local matter, it
  is a worldwide matter. It is not a matter than interests merely the
  people of Ireland, the people of England and Scotland or of any other
  country in particular, but it is a matter that interests the whole
  world. What we are battling for is the freedom of mankind; what we
  are struggling for is for the abolition of that industrial slavery
  which as mud enslaves men as did chattel slavery. It will not take
  the sword to win it. There is a power far stronger than the sword and
  that is the power of public opinion. When the masses of men know what
  hurts them and how it can be cured when they know what to demand, and
  to make their demand heard and felt, they will have it and no power
  on earth can prevent them. What enslaves men everywhere is ignorance
  and prejudice.</p>
<p>If we were to go to that island that we imagined, and if you were
fools enough to admit that the land belonged to me, I would be your
master, and you would be my slaves just as thoroughly, just as
completely, as if I owned your bodies, for all I would have to do to
send you out of existence would be to say to you "get off my
property." That is the cause of the industrial slavery that exists
all over the world, that is the cause of the low wages, that is the
cause of the unemployed labor.</p>
<p>HOW can you remedy it? Only by going to first principles. only by
asserting the natural rights of man. You cannot do it by any such
scheme as is proposed here of buying out the landlords and selling
again to the tenant farmers. What good is that going to do to the
laborers? What benefit is it to be to the artisans of the city? And
what benefit is it going to be to the farming class in the long run?
For just as certain as you do that, just as certain will you see
going on here what we have seen going on in the United States, and by
the vicissitudes of life, by the changes of fortune, by the
differences among men &#8212; some men selling and mortgaging, some men
acquiring wealth and others becoming poorer &#8212; in a little while you
will have the reestablishment of the old system. But it is not just
in any consideration. What better right has an agricultural tenant to
receive any special advantage from the community than any other man?
If farms are to be bought for the agricultural tenant, why should not
boots for the artisans, shops for the clerks, boats for the fishermen
&#8212; why should not the Government step in to furnish everyone with
capital? And consider this with regard to the buying out of the
landlords. Why, in Heaven's name, should they be bought out? Bought
out of what? Bought out of the privilege on imposing a tax upon their
fellow-citizens? Bought out of the privilege of appropriating what
belongs to all? That is not justice. If, when the people regain their
rights, compensation is due to anybody it is due to those who have
suffered injustice not to those who have caused it and profited by
it.</p>
