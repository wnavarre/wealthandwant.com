      <p><strong>Chapter V &#8212; Mr. Spencer's Task </strong>
          </p>
    </div>
    <p> THE first eight chapters of <em>Justice</em>, as we have seen, bring
      Mr. Spencer by a different route to the same &quot;first principle&quot; which
      he had laid down forty years before in Social Statics, and from which he
      had deduced the
  equal right of all men to the use of land and the ethical invalidity of private
  property in land &#8212; &quot;all deeds, customs, and laws notwithstanding.&quot;</p>
    <p> We are not concerned now with <em>Social Statics</em>. We are not concerned with any
  of Mr. Spencer's changes in opinion, teleological, metaphysical, or of any
  other kind. We have here merely the Synthetic philosopher, who from grounds
  based on the doctrine of evolution lays down as the fundamental formula of
  justice, the axiomatic principle from which all the rights of men in their
  relations with each other are to be deduced: that all men have freedom to do
  as they will, provided they infringe not the equal freedom of all others.17</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">17 From Appendix A of <em>Justice</em>, it seems that Mr. Spencer
          has hitherto supposed that his statement of this &quot;first principle&quot; of <em>Social
          Statics</em> was the first time it had been thus put. In 1883 Professor
          Maitland had, however, pointed out that &quot;Kant had already enunciated
          in other words a similar doctrine.&quot; Mr. Spencer tells us that, &quot;Not
          being able to read the German quotation given by Mr. Maitland,&quot; he
          was unable to test the statement until, in the preparation of Justice,
          he reached
          Chapter VI, when he discovered in a re-cent English translation of
          Kant certain passages which he gives, that &quot;make it clear that
          Kant had arrived at a conclusion, which, if not the same as my own,
          is closely
          allied
          to it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">          I mention this as showing the importance Mr.
          Spencer yet attaches to the &quot;first
            principle,&quot; from which he deduced the condemnation of private
            property in land. Otherwise the matter is of no interest. His statement
            of this
            principle or formula was a good one, and doubtless original with
            him. Who has stated it before made no more difference than who first
            stated that
            one and one equal two. There are some things which to the human mind
            are self-evident &#8212; that is to say which may be seen by whoever
            chooses to look &#8212; and this is one of them.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> What follows, with regard to the use of land, from this fundamental principle
  of the evolutionary philosophy? Is it not, unavoidably and irresistibly, what
  Mr. Spencer stated years before? &#8212;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <font size="-1">Given a race of beings having like claims to pursue
          the objects of their desires &#8212; given a world adapted to the gratification
          of those desires &#8212; a
      world into which such beings are similarly born, and it unavoidably follows
      that they have equal rights to the use of this world. For if each of them &quot;has
      freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom
      of any other,&quot; then each of them is free to use the earth for the
      satisfaction of his wants, provided he allows all others the same liberty.
      And conversely,
      it is manifest that no one, or part of them, may use the earth in such
      a way as to prevent the rest from similarly using it; seeing that to do
      this is to
      assume greater freedom than the rest, and consequently to break the law.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> Is there one single deduction in Chapter IX of <em>Social Statics</em> that
      does not as clearly follow from this reasoning of <em>Justice</em> &#8212; one single
      word that requires alteration to fit it for a place in the deductions to
      be drawn from
  this formula, except the single word &quot;God&quot;? And the substitution
  of &quot;The Unknowable&quot; or &quot;Evolution&quot; for &quot;God&quot; would
  in no wise alter or lessen the force of the reasoning.</p>
<p> How, then, shall Mr. Spencer justify private property in land, which in his
  letters to The <em>Times</em> he had bound himself to do? How shall he deduce the rights
  of land-owners to compensation for their land or in any way assert for them
  rights that will lessen or modify, or in any way condition, the equal right
  of all their fellows to the use of land?</p>
<p> To men like Professor Huxley there is a short and easy way of doing this.
  It is simply to deny the existence of natural rights; that is to say, rights
  having any higher or more permanent sanction than municipal regulation. To
  be sure this opens a most awkward dilemma, for if power, or if you please legislative
  enactment, be the only sanction of right, what remains for the House of Have,
  when the House of Want shall muster its more numerous forces, either on the
  field of brute strength or in legislatures already controlled by popular suffrage?
  But, &quot;after us, the deluge!&quot; and such considerations do not much
  trouble those who take this short and easy way. Mr. Spencer, however, is debarred
  from taking it; not by what he has before said on the land question, for that
  could be unsaid, but by his philosophy. If there is no right but might, what
  does that philosophy mean and what is it for? If there is no law but that of
  the state, why does he write books to tell us what the state ought and ought
  not to do? And, furthermore, he has just deduced as his formula of justice,
  having, he says, the highest imaginable warrant &#8212; the same first principle
  from which in <em>Social Statics</em> he deduced the invalidity of private property
  in land.</p>
<p> The short and easy way of justifying private property in land, because it
  exists, or because it is sanctioned by the state, is therefore not open to
  Mr. Spencer, unless he is ready to abandon the last shred and figment of philosophic
  claim. His is a more difficult task. What he has to do, is to prove that the
  disinheritance of nineteen-twentieths of his countrymen accords with his &quot;ultimate
  ethical principle having an authority transcending every other&quot; &#8212; his
  formula of justice, that &quot;Every man is free to do that which he will,
  provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.&quot; To show
  that the so-called rights of existing landowners to monopolize the land on
  which all must live are real rights, he must, on his own statement, show that
  they are deducible from the law of equal freedom.</p>
<p> Knowing, then, from Mr. Spencer's more recent utterances that he is determined
  at any cost to get on the comfortable side of the land question, we may be
  certain in advance that Justice will afford a spectacle both interesting and
  instructive. Interesting as the effort of a man of ability to accomplish a
  feat of intellectual legerdemain equivalent, not to swallowing a sword, but
  to swallowing himself. Instructive as showing how far a man so able that many
  people think him the greatest philosopher that has ever yet appeared; a man
  who has the advantage of knowing what can be said on the other side, can, on
  grounds which admit the equal right of men to be in the world, succeed in justifying
  that existing social arrangement which gives to a few the exclusive ownership
  of the world, and denies to the many any right to its use, save as they purchase
  the privilege of these few world-owners.</p>
<p> A Lord Bramwell or a Professor Huxley or a Duke of Argyll would rush in boldly
  and proceed frankly. But Mr. Spencer knows that to accomplish his task the
  attention of the reader must be confused and the real issue avoided. The effort
  to do this is to be seen at a glance the moment we come to the vital part of
  Justice.</p>
<p> In <em>Social Statics</em> the discussion of &quot;The Rights of Life and
  Personal Liberty&quot; occupies hardly more than a single page, being treated
  as &quot;such
  self-evident corollaries from our first principle as hardly to need a separate
  statement.&quot; In <em>Justice</em> it is padded out into two chapters &#8212; &quot;The
  Right to Personal Integrity&quot; and &quot;The Rights to Free Motion and Locomotion,&quot; which,
  by references to the Fijians, the Wends, the Herculeans, the Homeric Greeks,
  and so on, are made to occupy some twelve or thirteen times as much space.
  But although Mr. Spencer also refers to the Abors, the Nagas, the Lepchas,
  the Jakuns, and other far-off people, he takes no notice of such infractions
  of the right of free motion and locomotion by landowning dukes as in 1850 excited
  his indignation.</p>
<p> In place of the chapter on &quot;The Right to the Use of the Earth,&quot; which
  stands out so clearly and so prominently in <em>Social Statics</em>, we find in <em>Justice</em>  a chapter on &quot;The Rights to the Uses of Natural Media,&quot; of which
  only a part is devoted to the right to the use of land, though a short note,
  having something of the same relation to it that the traditional lady's postscript
  has to her letter, is inserted in the Appendix.</p>
<p> This treatment of land, or the surface of the earth, as but one of the natural
  media is in the highest degree unphilosophic, and could be adopted only for
  the purpose of confusion. For so far as man is concerned all natural media
  are appurtenant to land; and the term &quot;land&quot; in political economy
  and law comprises all natural substances and powers. To treat land as one of
  such natural media as light and air is therefore as unphilosophic as it would
  be to treat it as one of such sub-divisions of itself as water, rock, gravel
  or sand. The clearest and only philosophic terminology is that adopted in <em>Social
  Statics</em> &#8212; the right to the use of the earth, or the right to the use
  of land. For the right to the use of all natural elements comes from and with,
  and is inseparably involved in and annexed to, the right to the use of land.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer's reasons for thus treating land as but one of the natural media
  appear as we read. Not merely is the burning question thus minimized and confused,
  but it becomes easier by means of analogy to slide over the injustice of the
  present treatment of land &#8212; an injustice which, as Mr. Spencer had himself
  previously seen, is inferior only to murder or slavery &#8212; and to bring
  private property in land into the category of things with which we need not
  concern
  ourselves.</p>
