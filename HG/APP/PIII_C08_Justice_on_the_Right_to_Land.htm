    </div>
    <p> At last, however, as all men must, even after the flying-machine becomes
      practicable, Mr. Spencer is forced to come down from light and air to solid
      earth.</p>
<p> But observe how reluctantly, how tenderly, he approaches the main question,
  the subject he would evidently like to ignore altogether. Land &#8212; to us
  the one solid, natural element; our all-producing, all-supporting mother, from
  whose bosom our very frames are drawn, and to which they return again; our
  standing-place; our workshop; our granary; our reservoir and substratum and
  nexus of media and forces; the element from which all we can produce must be
  drawn; without which we cannot breathe the air or enjoy the light; the element
  prerequisite to all human life and action &#8212; he speaks of as &quot;that
  remaining portion of the environment, hardly to be called a medium,&quot; which &quot;<em>by
  an unusual extension of meaning</em>&quot; is included in the things to which the
  equal liberty of all extends.</p>
<p> Yet, at last, and thus tenderly, after having shown to his own satisfaction
  that with regard to personal rights and the liberty of movement, &quot;things
  as they are&quot; in such countries as England do not differ from &quot;things
  as they ought to be,&quot; except, perhaps, that there is too much smoking
  in railway carriages, Mr. Spencer <em>does</em> at last get to the burning question
  of the land. And no sooner does he get there than the power by virtue of which
  a truth once recognized can never be entirely forgotten or utterly ignored,
  forces from him this recognition:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">If, while possessing those ethical sentiments which social discipline has
      now produced, men stood in the possession of a territory not yet individually
      portioned out, they would no more hesitate to assert equality of their claims
      to the land than they would hesitate to assert equality of their claims to
      light and air.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <em>&quot;If, while possessing those ethical sentiments which social discipline
  has now produced.&quot;</em> This &quot;if&quot; is the assumption of the Spencerian
  philosophy, that our moral sentiments have been evolved by pressure of conditions,
  survival of the fittest and hereditary transmission, since the time when, according
  to it, primitive men wore accustomed to eat each other. Having told us that
  social evolution has brought mankind in the Victorian era to the recognition
  of equal rights to air and light, Mr. Spencer now assumes that the idea of
  equal rights to the use of land is the product of a similar development instead
  of being a primary perception of mankind.</p>
<p> Now this assumption is not merely opposed to all the facts; it is inconsistent
  with the Spencerian philosophy.</p>
<p> To consider the philosophy first: It holds that man is an evolution from
  the animal. He comes to be man by gradual development from the monkey or from
  some form of life from which the monkeys have also sprung. In the course of
  this evolutionary process, continued since he became man, he has acquired his
  present instincts, habits and powers.</p>
<p> Now I will not ask how, since the highest animals that habitually eat their
  own kind are on the synthetic genealogical tree far below any of the animals,
  existing or extinct, from which man can have descended, the oft-repeated assumption
  that primitive men were habitual cannibals can be reconciled with the assumption
  that they derived their habits from their animal ancestors.</p>
<p> But I will make bold to ask how the assumption that men have only now arrived
  at the perception of the equality of rights to the use of the natural media,
  and especially land, can be reconciled with the assumption that our moral perceptions
  are derived from animals. Animals fight with their own kind, as men fight;
  or at least some of them do occasionally, though none fight so frequently and
  so wantonly. But is there an animal, from the monkey to the jellyfish, that
  does not, with animals of its own kind, and when at peace, fail to claim for
  itself and accord to others the liberty to use natural media, bounded only
  by the equal liberty of all? If there is not, how can the assumption that it
  has taken man all these ages to recognize the equality of rights to the use
  of natural media be made to harmonize with the assumption that he primarily
  derives his perception from the animal?</p>
<p> I ask this question to emphasize the fact that, in his effort to smooth away
  the monstrous injustice of private property in land, Mr. Spencer does violence
  to his own theories &#8212; not alone to the theories which he held when he
  wrote <em>Social Statics</em>, but to the theories of his Synthetic Philosophy &#8212; the
  theories set forth in <em>Justice</em>; that he stands ready to sacrifice to
  his new masters
  not only his moral honesty, but even what the morally depraved often cling
  to&#8212;the pretence of intellectual honesty. In order to ignore the gist
  of the land question while pretending to explain it, he is endeavoring to
  create the impression that the present treatment of land, if not indeed the
  best, is at least the highest form which the progressive development of the
  idea of the equality of rights to the use of natural media has assumed. But
  to say that the idea of equal rights to land is the product of advancing social
  discipline is to say that it has proceeded from the contrary idea &#8212; that
  of unequal rights, or private property in land. Since the animals show no trace
  of this idea, this assumption is inconsistent with the doctrine that primitive
  man came closest to the animals. And to assume, as Mr. Spencer does in this
  chapter, that men start with the idea of unequal rights to land, and have been
  working up through social discipline the idea of equal rights, is likewise
  with all the points in the elaborate derivation of the idea of justice, which
  occupy the first eight chapters of this very book.</p>
<p> The assumption that the idea of equal rights to land is the product of social
  discipline is at both ends contradicted by the facts. In America, Australia
  and New Zealand, men of English speech, possessing &quot;those ethical sentiments
  which social discipline has now produced,&quot; have stood in possession of
  territory not yet individually portioned out; but, instead of asserting the
  equality of claims to land, they have proceeded to portion out individually
  this territory as fast as they could. Thus the effect upon their ethical sentiments
  of the social discipline to which they have been subjected has been the precise
  opposite of what Mr. Spencer asserts. Instead of leading them from non-perception
  to a perception of the equality of rights to land, social discipline, dominated
  by landowners, and continued steadily and rigorously, had, within comparatively
  recent times, almost entirely crushed out the idea of natural rights in land
  among the English people, and taught them to look on private property in land
  as in no wise differing from property in other things.</p>
<p> Or, try Mr. Spencer's assumption from the other end.</p>
<p> Among the aboriginal races in the countries we modern English have overrun,
  the idea of equal rights to land, and of course to other natural media has
  been so clearly perceived that they were unable to comprehend the artificial
  notion of private property in land&#8212;could no more see than could Mr. Spencer
  in 1850 how land could equitably become private property. To this very day,
  and in spite of the pressure of the national government and of the surrounding
  whites, the Cherokees, the Choctaws, and other civilized remnants of the aboriginal
  tribes of the United States, though recognizing fully the right of property
  in things produced by labor, and recognizing also the right of private <em>possession</em>  of land, refuse to recognize land as the <em>property</em> of the individual; and no
  man can hold land among them except while putting it to use. The idea that
  land itself can become subject to such individual ownership as attaches to
  things that man produces by labor, is as repugnant to the human mind, undisciplined
  by generations of cruel repression and undistorted by persistent misteachings,
  as the idea that air or sunlight may be so owned.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer himself, while stating that the perception of the equality of
  natural rights to land is the product of the social advance that has brought
  men of the highest civilization to their present ethical condition, goes on
  in the next paragraph to show at length that &quot;in early stages private
  ownership of land is unknown,&quot; and that private property in land has arisen
  from &quot;the exercise of direct or indirect force, sometimes internal but
  chiefly external.&quot;21</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">21 It may be worth noting that here Mr. Spencer again confuses
      equal rights with joint rights. The primitive idea is not that of deeming
      land the property
      of the tribe, and the relation of individuals to the soil one of joint
      ownership. Although within generally vague territorial limits each tribe
      may claim the
      right to exclude other tribes, yet the idea is not that of property in
      the land, but of that sort of separation which took place between Lot and
      Abraham,
      and the relation of the members to the land is not that of joint ownership
      but of equal right to use  &#8212; such regulations as in the earlier stages
      become necessary, being merely those which secure this equality in use.
      Among
      no primitive people would it be thought that a member of the tribe required
      the consent
      of the whole to make use of land no one else was using. He would do that
      without question, as a matter of individual right.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> What Mr. Spencer thus admits is that private property in land has no derivation
  from perceptions of justice, whether these be original or acquired by evolution,
  but that its only genesis is force. And then comes his supreme effort. In the
  reference to the feudal system and the assumption that the rights of the monarch,
  as representative of the whole people, are still exercised by the people's
  representatives, lies the pivotal point of his whole argument.</p>
<p> To return to my illustration of the tunnel. This is the way he gets there:</p>
<p> We are told that when private property in land did arise, it was habitually
  incomplete, since it was subject to the claims of the over-lord, the implication
  being that the ownership was subordinate to that of the head of the community;
  and that this conception survives alike in theory and in practice to the present
  time, since the state now takes land for public purposes after making due compensation
  to existing holders. The supreme power of the monarch having been replaced
  by the supreme power of the people, the people are now the supreme owners of
  the land, and may take it, if they please, on payment of full compensation.
  Thus, individual freedom has been reacquired with regard to land, and to-day,
  in the existing theory and practice of English law, and like their equal rights
  to light and air, the equal rights of all to the use of land are fully recognized.</p>
<p> All that has gone before is the by-play of the juggler to distract attention.
  In this the transmogrification is worked.</p>
<p> Here, with one flash of synthetic logic, the horse-chestnut becomes a chestnut
  horse! Here is the explanation of what was averred in Mr. Spencer's letter
  to The <em>Times</em> &#8212; that the view of landownership he has taken all along
  is &quot;congruous
  with existing legal theory and practice.&quot; Here is his reconciliation of
  his formula of justice &#8212; that &quot;each is at liberty to do all that
  he wills, provided that he infringes not the equal liberty of any other man&quot;  &#8212; with
  the views of that august body, the Liberty and Property Defence League, &quot;on
  which sit several Peers and two judges.&quot; Both are harmonized in the assumption
  that the equal rights of all to the use of land are to-day recognized in the
  right of Parliament to take land for public purposes on paying for it.</p>
<p> What, it may be asked, has become of the nineteen-twentieths of the people
  of England who, as Social Statics told us, were being robbed of their birthright &#8212; their
  heritage in the earth &#8212; by a gigantic injustice inferior only in wickedness
  to murder and enslavement? Why, having the privilege of voting for members
  of one branch of the Legislature, which Mr. Spencer has, in this very book,
  page 49, described as &quot;a motley assemblage of nominees of caucuses, ruled
  by ignorant and fanatical wire-pullers,&quot; they have been transmogrified
  into supreme owners of the land.</p>
<p> What, it still may be asked, has become of that part of them that do not
  have even the poor privilege of voting for this motley assemblage of nominees
  of caucuses?</p>
<p> There is no answer. We may search Chapter IV of the &quot;Principles of Ethics&#8212;The
  Ethics of Social Life: Justice,&quot; in vain. They have incontinently dropped out
  of sight.</p>
<p>It may be worth while to examine that part of Mr. Spencer's logical process
  where it is assumed that the legal theory and practice by which the British
  Legislature, on the payment of compensation, now takes land for public purposes
  is identical with the theory and practice by which the feudal monarch, as representing
  the whole people, was the supreme owner of land. This is all that he ventures
  specifically to assert, and the question raised by it is much narrower than
  the real question, whether the present legal theory and practice does adequately
  recognize the equal rights of all to land. Yet, even here, Mr. Spencer clearly
  suppresses the vital fact.</p>
<p> The taking of land for public purposes on payment of compensation &#8212; or
  by process of condemnation, as it is termed &#8212; is neither an exercise
  nor recognition of the supreme ownership of land. In the American States where
  the ownership of land is by their constitutions declared allodial, the same
  powers of condemning land are exerted, and more freely exerted than in England.
  If pictures are bought for the national galleries, not condemned, it is merely
  because there is no need for condemnation. The same legal power exists to take
  pictures for public use as to take land. In case of necessity, such as war,
  the power of taking any-thing is habitually exercised, and ships, horses, railways,
  provisions, and even men are taken for public uses. The power to do this is
  a power incident to the supreme authority and at times necessary to society.</p>
<p> When, in 1889, Johnstown, Pa., was cut off from the rest of the world by
  the flood that destroyed pre-existing organization, a British subject, Arthur
  J. Moxham, was placed in charge by what a Quaker would call &quot;the sense
  of the meeting.&quot; His first acts were to seize all food, to destroy all
  liquor, and to put every able-bodied man at work, leaving the matter of compensation
  to be determined afterwards. He voiced the will of the society, driven by crushing
  disaster into a supreme effort for self-preservation, and the man who had resisted
  his orders would, if need be, have been shot.</p>
<p> But the theory of English law that the crown is the only owner of English
  land, and that the highest estate an individual can hold is that of tenancy,
  though often confused with the right of eminent domain, has in reality a different
  origin. Now a mere fiction, it had in feudal times expression in practice.
  When William the Conqueror divided England, he conditioned his grants on the
  payment of rent in dues or services. This was the essence of the feudal principle.
  In a rough and partial but still substantial way, it recognized the right of
  the community to rent. It was a rude attempt to carry out that system of land
  nationalization which Mr. Spencer in <em>Social Statics</em> declares the only
  equitable system of land tenure. Under it the holding of valuable land entailed
  payment
  or service. The crown lands maintained the sovereign and the civil list. From
  the church lands the expenses of public worship, and of education, the care
  of the sick and the relief of wayfarers were provided; the holders of military
  tenures had to maintain the army and do the fighting, and on occasions, such
  as the ransom of the king, the knighting of his eldest son, the marriage of
  his eldest daughter, etc., were called on for extra payments; while the right
  of all Englishmen to the use of some portion at least of English soil was recognized
  in the numerous public commons. This spirit of the feudal system was the origin
  of primogeniture, of wardships and liveries and other feudal incidents, which,
  where they remain on the law books of today, are but meaningless and useless
  survivals.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer, in his &quot;glance at some past phases of land tenure,&quot; has
  told us of the Sumatrans, the Don Cossacks, the Russians, the Suanetians, and
  the Dahomeans, but he has failed to tell us how we of the English speech have
  lost those fragments of the equal right to the use of land that we retained
  long after the last conquest of England. I do not charge him with ignorance.
  If he does not tell us, it is not because he does not know, for <em>Political
  Institutions</em>  shows that he does know.<font size="-1"><strong><em>22</em></strong></font> But
  he does not tell us, because the facts are inconsistent with the juggle by
  which he is trying to impose on the reader. It was in reality
  by a gigantic series of no-rent declarations on the part of the class that
  had got possession of English land on condition of paying rent for it. The
  crown lands were given away by profligate sovereigns without any stipulation
  of return in rent to the community. Henry VIII made over the greater part of
  the church lands to his favorites, and the people were robbed of the services
  and benefits that they had received from the former holders. Finally, by act
  of the Long Parliament, confirmed after the Restoration by a close majority,
  the military dues were abolished; and, growing in power by what they fed on,
  the landholders, now actually land-owners, appropriated to themselves, by the
  simple process of inclosure, nearly all the common lands.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">22 In the chapter on Political Differentiation, page 297,
      Principles of Sociology, Volume 11, he quotes from Hallam:&#8212;<br>
&quot;William the Conqueror &#8230; divided this kingdom into about 60,000 parcels,
      of nearly equal value [partly left in the hands of those who previously
held it, and partly made over to his followers as either owners or suzerains],
      from each of which the service of a soldier was due.&quot;<br>
      And again, in the chapter on Property, page 553 of the same book, occurs
      the passage once before quoted:&#8212;<br>
&quot;In our case the definite ending of these tenures took place in 1660;
      when for feudal obligations (a burden on landowners) was substituted a
beer-exise (a
      burden on the community).&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The essence and meaning of the supreme ownership of the land of England by
  the crown is thus gone. What remains is but a legal fiction, a mere survival
  of form, of no more validity than was in the time of George III the form by
  which he styled himself King of France. Yet in this empty phrase, and in the
  taking of land for public use on payment of full compensation, Mr. Spencer
  tells his disinherited countrymen that their equal rights are actually recognized.</p>
<p> Thus the equal right of Englishmen to the use of English land amounts to
  the privilege of buying it at its full value! What, then, has the Englishman
  as Englishman? A Russian or a Turk, a Winans or a Carnegie, may use land in
  England by paying for it.</p>
<p> If we put the conclusion as to the right to the use of land to which Mr.
  Spencer thus comes in Justice in the same form which he uses in Social Statics,
  we have this:</p>
<p> Given a race of beings having like claims to pursue the objects of their
  desires &#8212; given a world adapted to the gratification of those desires&#8212;a
  world into which such beings are similarly born, and it unavoidably follows
  that they have the right to use this world as soon as they have paid the full
  value of it to those of their number who call themselves its owners.</p>
<p> But this telling the disinherited masses that their equal rights to land
  are already acknowledged seems hardly satisfactory to Mr. Spencer himself,
  for he at once proceeds to reinforce it, by the plea that for them to claim
  any more than the right of buying land at its full value would be ethically
  wrong. This is a putting of the cart before the horse. For a wrong is only
  the violation of a right. Rights, as Mr. Spencer has just before told us, are
  the particular freedoms deducible from the law of equal freedom, and to assert
  wrong he must show violation of that law. Let us, however, follow his reasoning.</p>
<p> The first proposition is that&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"> Since equity and daily custom alike imply that existing holders of particular
          portions of land may not be dispossessed without giving them in return its
          fairly estimated value, it is also implied that the wholesale resumption of
          the land by the community can be justly effected only by the wholesale purchase
        of it.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Is it? By equity and custom when the state takes any part of the wealth of
  a particular person it compensates him. But when it takes part of the wealth
  of all persons, or of all persons of a special class, as it is constantly doing
  by taxation, does it compensate them?</p>
<p> The reason for compensation, when land is taken from particular owners, is
  that otherwise a discrimination would be made between them and other landowners.
  Equity, as Mr. Spencer once told us, means equalness. It would not be equitable
  for the community to resume possession of the land of this or that particular
  landowner without compensation, while leaving to other landowners their land,
  for while this would be to leave unredressed the unequalness between landholders
  and others, it would be to treat landowners unequally as between themselves.
  But if all land were resumed equity would require no compensation, for while
  landowners would be treated equally as between themselves, the inequality between
  them and other members of the community would be removed, and all would be
  treated with equalness. And since they, too, are members of the community,
  the resumption of all land by the community would place all in a condition
  of equalness with respect to the land.</p>
<p> But, continues Mr. Spencer &#8212; herein admitting that the community may
  in equity take the <em>land</em> &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Were the direct exercise of ownership to be resumed by the community without
      purchase, the community would take, along with something which is its own,
      an immensely greater amount of something which is not its own.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> How so? The proposition is only to take the land, not to take anything else.</p>
<p> Because, Mr. Spencer continues&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Even if we ignore those multitudinous complications which,
      in the course of century after century, have inextricably entangled men's
      claims, theoretically
      considered &#8212; even if we reduce the case to its simplest theoretical
      form &#8212;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Well, all classes of land-resumptionists would quickly reply, we are quite
  willing to do so. Since, as laid down in Social Statics, men derive their equal
  rights to the use of the world from their equal presence in the world, there
  can be no complications that can entangle their equal claims to the use of
  land, either considered theoretically or in any other way.</p>
<p> But without heeding this, Mr. Spencer goes on to say, that even if we ignore
  what no one proposes to consider, and even if we reduce the case to simple
  theoretical form &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">We must admit that all which can be claimed for the community
      is the surface of the country in its original unsubdued state. To all that
      value given to
      it by clearing, breaking up, prolonged culture, fencing, draining, making
      roads, farm-buildings, etc., constituting nearly all its value, the community
      has no
      claim. This value has been given either by personal labor, or by labor
      paid for, or by ancestral labor; or else the value given to it in such
      ways has
      been purchased by legitimately earned money. All this value artificially
      given vests in existing owners, and cannot without a gigantic robbery be
      taken from
      them. If, during the many transactions which have brought about existing
      landownership, there have been much violence and much fraud, these have
      been small compared
      with the violence and the fraud which the community would be guilty of
      did it take possession, without paying for it, of that artificial value,
      which
      the labor of nearly two thousand years has given to the land.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> What does Mr. Spencer mean? If he means that all that can be claimed by the
  community is the land itself, and that landowners should retain the value of
  their improvements, and of all things else that they may possess, we admit
  it not entirely as a matter of strict justice, for much of things other than
  the land itself, which existing landowners now possess, they have obtained
  by their unjust appropriation of land. But we wish to be within our right,
  and to let bygones be bygones, and so all that we propose is just what Mr.
  Spencer in Social Statics proposed &#8212; the resumption of equal rights in
  land, leaving to existing landowners, without question as to how it was obtained,
  the whole value of their improvements in or on land, and all their other property.</p>
<p> But what, then, does Mr. Spencer mean by talking of &quot;the surface of
  the country in its original unsubdued state,&quot; as all the community can
  claim? What does he mean by talking of that &quot;artificial value which the
  labor of nearly two thousand years has given to the land&quot;? Vague as are
  his notions of value, can it be that he means that, even if their natural rights
  are admitted, the people of England are entitled only to what value the land
  had before there were any people? and that they must pay the landowners for
  the value of all the labor that has been expended on that land since C&aelig;sar
  landed?</p>
<p> What the people of England are entitled to by natural right, and what we
  propose by the single tax to take for their use, is the value of land <em>as
  it is</em>, exclusive of the value of improvements <em>as they are</em> in or on the land privately
  owned. What would thus be left to the landowners would be their personal or
  movable property, the value of all existing improvements in or on their land,
  and their equal share with all other citizens in the land value resumed. This
  is perfectly clear, and if not perfectly fair, is only so because it would
  leave to the landowners in their personal property and the value of their improvements
  much not due to any exertion of labor by themselves or their ancestors, but
  which has come to them through the unjust appropriation of the proceeds of
  others' labor.</p>
<p> The value of the land when the country was in its original unsubdued state
  has nothing to do with the matter; what we have to deal with is the value of
  the land as it is. Nor has the labor expended since C&aelig;sar's time anything
  to do with it; the value of improvements to be left to landowners is the value
  of existing improvements. Surely if Mr. Spencer were to try to formulate his
  notions it would be too preposterous even for him to contend that in resuming
  our rights in the land &#8212; not the rights of the ancient Britons, nor the
  rights of primitive man, nor the rights of the animals that existed before
  man was &#8212; we should credit the existing landowners with the value which
  attaches to the land from our presence, and charge them only with what value
  the land might have if we did not exist. And surely he would not contend that
  the landowners are alone entitled to the value which the existing social environment
  gives to land &#8212; to the sole benefit of the introduction of Christianity,
  the extirpation of wolves, the beating off or civilizing of the Danes, the
  defeat of the Spanish Armada, the building of public roads and the lighting
  of public streets, the introduction of vegetables and fruits and the improvement
  of domestic animals, the utilization of steam and electricity and labor-saving
  appliances, the discoveries of science and the progress of the arts!</p>
<p> Nor yet would he formally assert the notion that in addition to the present
  value of their improvements the landowners must be credited with the value
  of all such improvements when they were new, and with the cost of all the draining,
  hedging, fencing, digging, manuring, building, etc., that have gone on for
  two thousand years &#8212; that the owner of land in the city of London, for
  instance, must be credited, not only with the present value of his houses,
  but with the value of the houses that existed before the great fire, and from
  the time of the first Roman camp! This would be equally preposterous.</p>
<p> It is hard to say what Mr. Spencer really does mean. But he is evidently
  trying to get some sort of vague excuse for assuming that it would not pay
  the disinherited to claim their rights in land, since to compensate landowners
  would take more than the land is worth. Let us, therefore, try to form some
  idea of what would be the present value of the land of England in its &quot;original,
  unsubdued state,&quot; population and social environment, and the existing
  buildings, which we propose to leave to the landowners, remaining as they are.</p>
<p> If, whenever a house was pulled down, or destroyed by fire, in Threadneedle
  Street or Lombard Street, in Cheapside or at Charing Cross, the ground on which
  it stood were to spring into its original condition, how much less would be
  its value to those who, in renting or buying it, seek not so much soil or rock
  or sand, but so many square feet of standing-place in those centers of population
  and trade? How much less would be the value of the land that around London
  and Manchester and Liverpool and Birmingham and Leeds and all the growing English
  towns is being turned from agricultural uses into house-sites, were it to revert
  to its condition in Roman times? While as for the country outside the cities
  and towns, would it not, could such a miracle be worked, become more rather
  than less valuable? Something of draining, hedging, walling, manuring and digging
  would be lost; but would not the accumulated richness of virgin soil, the great
  forests that in England now would have enormous value, the stores of coal and
  iron and other minerals that have now been exhausted or can be worked only
  at great depths, much more than make up?</p>
<p> If Mr. Spencer would go to the greater Englands growing up in Australia and
  the American West, he would cease thinking of Romans or Saxons or Normans as
  having anything to do with the present value of English land; for he would
  see that it is not what has been done in the past, but the population and activity
  of the present, that give value to land. He would see from Chicago or Johnstown
  that London might be swept by fire or flood, and yet, if the causes that concentrate
  population and trade there still remained, land, instead of being less valuable,
  would really become more valuable, from the better improvements that the clearing
  would bring about. He would see that, if the population and business of London
  could be transported to a newly risen island in the antipodes, land there would
  become as valuable as land in London now; and that, though all improvements
  were to be left behind, the value of land in London would disappear.</p>
<p> What the new countries will show us is, that as man lives in the present
  so he lives by the labor of the present and the immediate past, truly from
  hand to mouth; and what we get from our ancestors is little more than language,
  traditions, laws, habits, and the store of transmitted knowledge, including
  also prejudices and superstitions. And thus rich and poor, learned and ignorant,
  we are alike &quot;the heirs of all the ages.&quot; While if some of us are
  richer than we ought to be, and more of us are poorer than we ought to be,
  it is not because of the wrongful appropriations of wealth that took place
  in a dead and gone past, but from the wrongful appropriations of wealth that
  are taking place now.</p>
<p> Barring the appendix, which is yet to be considered, we have now gone through
  Mr. Spencer's defense of existing landlordism &#8212; his answer, in his maturest
  years, to the arraignment of private property in land which he made in <em>Social
  Statics</em>. Stripped of its padding it amounts simply to the assumption (1)
  that the equal rights of all to the use of land are recognized in the right
  of the
  state to take land for public purposes on paying compensation; which is backed
  by the assumption (2) that equity requires that existing owners shall be paid
  the full value of the land they hold before equal rights to land can be acknowledged.</p>
<p> Of the first assumption, the only attempt at support is in the last paragraph,
  the reasoning of which on analysis will be found to be this:</p>
<p> The equal right of all electors to the use of land is recognized by implication
  in the right asserted by Parliament to take land for public use on paying full
  compensation for its value; <em>because</em> &#8212;</p>
<p> If it is not, there is no equitable warrant for the state so taking land
  for public uses, since the only right by which the landowners can be superseded
  is the right of the community at large: <em>hence</em> &#8212;</p>
<p> As the state has this right, which it can get only as the sum of the individual
  rights of its members; <em>therefore</em>, by its exercise, the individual rights of
  members of the state to the use of land are now recognized.</p>
<p> Of the second assumption, the only attempt at support is another obviously
  false assumption &#8212; that the value of land cannot be distinguished from
  the value of improvements.</p>
<p> This is the argument of the lauded Synthetic Philosophy in the most important
  part of the most important book of its most important sub-division.</p>
<p> I commend the study of such logical processes to those who on authority of
  Herbert Spencer's philosophy believe that man is an evoluted monkey, who got
  the idea of God from observing his own shadow.</p>
<p> As for anything deserving the name of reasoning, anything on which may be
  founded either a denial of the equal right of all to the use of land, or an
  affirmation of the exclusive right of existing landowners, there is nothing
  whatever. It is not merely that the reasoning of <em>Social Statics</em> is not impugned:
  it is that the reasoning of <em>Justice</em> itself is utterly ignored. No connection
  whatever is made between the conclusions here assumed and the formula of justice,
  the law of equal freedom, which in preceding chapters of this very book has
  been declared the ultimate ethical principle.</p>
<p> The reader has just been told that rights are the particular freedoms deducible
  from the law of equal freedom; that what are truly called rights are deducible
  from it, and that what are falsely called rights are not deducible from it.
  But where does Mr. Spencer, or how can he, deduce the right which he asserts
  for landowners, the right to the exclusive use of land until they are paid
  its full value, from the law of equal freedom? Or, if we go back through all
  the links of his derivation of the formula of justice can we find any connection
  between what he now asserts as right, and what he has just asserted as justice
  in any of its evolutionary stages?</p>
<p> Does not the ownership by some to the exclusion of others, of elements essential
  to all life, the legal giving of the products of labor to those who do no labor,
  by taking it away from those who do labor, violate what he declares to be the
  principle of animal ethics&#8212;that the ill-fitted must suffer the evils
  of unfitness, and the well-fitted prove their fitness?</p>
<p> Does it not violate what he declares to be the principle of sub-human justice,
  that each individual shall receive the benefits and evils of its own nature
  and consequent conduct?</p>
<p> Does it not violate what he declares to be the principle of human justice,
  that no one should be prevented from having whatever good his actions normally
  bring to him, nor allowed to shoulder off on other persons whatever evil they
  bring?</p>
<p> Does it not violate what he declares to be the sentiment of justice, the
  feeling that we ourselves ought to have freedom to receive the results of our
  own nature and consequent actions, and which prompts the maintenance of this
  sphere of free play for others?</p>
<p> Does it not violate what he declares to be the idea of justice, the equality
  as to mutually limited spheres of action, the inequality in the results which
  each may achieve within these mutual limits? Does it not establish inequality
  by authority &#8212; an inequality referring not to the natural achievement
  of greater rewards by greater merits, but to the artificial apportionment of
  rewards
  to no merits at all? Does it not violate what he declares to be the formula
  of justice, that every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he infringes
  not the equal freedom of any other man?</p>
<p> Does it not set at defiance what he declares to be the authority of this
  formula, the relation between conduct and consequence, which he bases on his
  compound law?</p>
<p> Private property in land, which Herbert Spencer in <em>Justice</em> defends
  by the darkening of counsel and baseless assumptions! Does it not openly, notoriously,
  flagrantly, deny to men the equal use of natural opportunities to live their
  lives, develop their powers, and reap the rewards of their conduct? Does it
  not give to the idle, the stupid, the profligate, the vicious, through the
  accidents of birth or luck, or successful forestalling, the natural rewards
  of industry, energy, temperance and thrift? Does it not proportionately, and
  far more than proportionately (for it involves enormous wastes), deny these
  rewards to those who have really earned them? Does it not give wealth, honor,
  the command of everything that labor in a high civilization can produce, to
  idlers, idiots, gamesters, profligates? Does it not, on the other hand, condemn
  toil to penury, and honest labor to contempt and grinding want? Does it not,
  wherever our civilization extends, make the mere opportunity to work a boon?
  keep men in idleness whose strongest desire is to earn a living? fill prisons
  and almshouses? condemn to ignorance minds that might enlighten and bless mankind?
  debase and embrute great masses of men and women? rob little children of the
  grace and sweetness and glory of life, and force them before their time out
  of a world in which monopoly denies them room?</p>
<p> Try Herbert Spencer by the ideas that he once held &#8212; the idea of a
  Living God, whose creatures we are, and the idea of a divine order, to which
  we are
  bound to conform. Or try him by what he now professes &#8212; the idea that
  we are but the evolutionary results of the integrations of matter and motion.
  Try him by the principles of Social Statics, or try him by the principles of
  Justice. In this chapter he proves himself alike a traitor to all that he once
  held and to all that he now holds&#8212;a conscious and deliberate traitor,
  who assumes the place of the philosopher, the office of the judge, only to
  darken truth and to deny justice; to sell out the right of the wronged and
  to prostitute his powers in the defense of the wronger.</p>
<p> Is it a wonder that intellectually, as morally, this chapter is beneath contempt?</p>
