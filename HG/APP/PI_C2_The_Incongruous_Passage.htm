    Part I: Declaration (continued)</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Chapter II &#8212; The Incongruous Passage</strong></p>
</div>
<p> ALTHOUGH this chapter shows that Mr. Spencer had not fully thought out the
  question, and saw no way to secure equality in the use of land, save the clumsy
  one of having the state formally resume land and let it out in lots to suit,
  the argument is clear and logical, except in one place. This one weak and confusing
  spot is the beginning of Section 9:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">&quot;No doubt great difficulties must attend the resumption, by mankind
    at large, of their rights to the soil. The question of compensation to existing
    proprietors is a complicated one &#8212; one that perhaps cannot be settled
    in a strictly equitable manner. Had we to deal with the parties who originally
    robbed the human race of its heritage, we might make short work of the matter.
    But, unfortunately, most of our present landowners are men who have, either
    mediately or immediately &#8212; either by their own acts, or by the acts
    of their ancestors &#8212; given for their estates equivalents of honestly
    earned wealth, believing that they were investing their savings in a legitimate
    manner. To justly estimate and liquidate the claims of such, is one of the
    most intricate
    problems society will one day have to solve.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Taken by itself, this passage seems to admit that existing landowners should
  be compensated for the land they hold whenever society shall resume land for
  the benefit of all. Though this is diametrically opposed to all that has gone
  before and all that follows after, it is the sense in which it has been generally
  understood. It is the sense in which I understood it when, in quoting from
  <em>Social Statics</em> in <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, I spoke of it as a careless
  concession, which Mr. Spencer on reflection would undoubtedly reconsider. For
  after even
  such a man as John Stuart Mill could say, &quot;The land of every country belongs
  to the people of that country; the individuals called landowners have no right
  in morality and justice to anything but the rent, or compensation for its saleable
  value,&quot; the English writers had seemed to me afflicted with a sort of
  colorblindness on the subject of compensation. And that this affliction had
  suddenly befallen Mr. Spencer also was the only explanation of this passage
  that then occurred to me. Nor, if it means compensation for land, is there
  any other explanation; for all along Mr. Spencer has been insisting on the
  natural, inalienable and equal right of all men to the use of land. He has
  not only denied the validity of all existing claims to the private ownership
  of land, but has declared that there is no possible way in which land can become
  private property. He has mercilessly and scornfully exposed the fallacy on
  which the notion of compensation to landowners is based &#8212; the idea that
  change of hands and lapse of time can turn wrong into right, make valid claims
  originally invalid, and deprive the human race of what in the nature of things
  is, not at any one time, but at all times, their inalienable heritage. Nothing
  but moral color-blindness can explain how a writer who has just asserted all
  this can in the same breath propose to compensate landlords.</p>
<p> But a more careful reading of this chapter leads me now to think that the
  apparent inconsistency of these sentences may arise from careless statement,
  and that what Mr. Spencer was really thinking of was the compensation of landowners,
  not for their land, but for their improvements.</p>
<p> In the context Mr. Spencer has scouted the idea of force, or acquiescence,
  or voluntary partition, or unopposed appropriation, or cultivation, or improvement,
  or sale or bequest, or lapse of time, giving any title to private property
  in land. But he realizes, as we all do (see especially the last two paragraphs
  of Section 4), that should the community resume for all the inalienable right
  to the use of land, there would remain to holders of improvements made in good
  faith an equitable claim for those improvements.</p>
<p> It is evident throughout <em>Social Statics</em> that no idea of the possibility of
  securing equal rights to land in any other way than that of the state taking
  possession of the land and renting it out had dawned on Mr. Spencer. And since
  in all settled countries the land thus taken possession of by the state would
  be land to which in large part improvements of various kinds had in good faith
  been inseparably attached, the matter of determining what equitable compensation
  should be paid to owners on account of these improvements naturally seemed
  to him a delicate and difficult task &#8212; one, in fact, incapable of more
  than an approximation to justice.</p>
<p> Keeping this in mind, it is clear that a few interpolations, justified by
  the context, and indeed made necessary by it, will remove all difficulty. Let
  me print these sentences again with such interpolations, which I will distinguish
  by italics: &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;The question of compensation to existing proprietors <em>for their
      improvements</em>    is a complicated one &#8212; one that perhaps cannot
      be settled in a strictly equitable manner. Had we to deal with the parties
      who originally robbed the
    human race of its heritage, we might make short work of the matter, <em>for
    their improvements we should be under no obligation to regard</em>. But unfortunately,
    most of our present landowners are men who have, either mediately or immediately &#8212; either
    by their own acts, or by the acts of their ancestors &#8212; given for their
    estates, <em>which include many inseparable improvements</em>, equivalents
    of honestly earned wealth, believing that they were investing their savings
    in a legitimate
    manner. To justly estimate and liquidate the claims of such <em>for these
    improvements</em>,
    is one of the most intricate problems society will one day have to solve.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Thus understood, these sentences become coherent with their context. And
  that this was what Mr. Spencer had in mind is supported by his more recent
  utterances; for while he has allowed these sentences to be understood as meaning
  compensation to landowners for their land, yet in the only places where he
  has stated in terms what the compensation he has proposed is to be for, he
  has, as will hereafter be seen, spoken of it as &quot;compensation for the
  artificial value given by cultivation,&quot; or by some similar phrase showed
  that what was in his mind was merely compensation for improvements. I therefore
  gladly make what honorable amend I can for having so misunderstood him as
  to imagine that in <em>Social Statics</em> he intended to give any countenance to the
  idea that it was incumbent on men, when taking possession of their heritage,
  to pay any compensation to existing landowners for the value of that heritage.</p>
