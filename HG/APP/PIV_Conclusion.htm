      <p>The Moral Of This Examination</p>
      <p> I HAVE laid before the reader enough to show what weight is due to Mr. Spencer's
  recantation of his earlier declarations on the land question.</p>
<p> But even his high reputation and great influence would not have led me to
  make so elaborate an examination, did it relate only to him. My purpose has
  been more than this.</p>
<p> In abandoning his earlier opinions Mr. Spencer has adopted those which have
  the stamp of the recognized authorities of our time. In seeking for excuses
  to justify his change he has taken the best he could find; and the confusions
  and fallacies and subterfuges to which he resorts are such as pass for argument
  with the many men of reputation and ability, who have undertaken to defend
  the existing system. Examination will show that no better defense of that system
  has been made or can be made.</p>
<p> Taking Mr. Spencer as the foremost representative of those who deny the justice
  and expediency of recognizing the equal right to land &#8212; a pre-eminence
  given him by his great reputation, his accorded ability, and the fact that
  he once avowed the opinions he now seeks to discredit &#8212; I have set forth
  his utterances on the land question, from his first book to his last, printing
  them in full in order to do him the amplest justice, and subjecting them to
  an examination which any one of ordinary ability and information is competent
  to test. I have thus given the best example to be found in the writings of
  one man, of what may be said for and what may be said against the equal right
  to land.</p>
<p> It is not the example of intellectual prostitution thus disclosed that I
  would dwell upon. It is the lesson that prompts to intellectual self-reliance.
  It is not merely the authority of Mr. Spencer as a teacher on social subjects
  that I would discredit; but the blind reliance upon authority. For on such
  subjects the masses of men cannot safely trust authority. Given a wrong which
  affects the distribution of wealth and differentiates society into the rich
  and the poor, and the recognized organs of opinion and education, since they
  are dominated by the wealthy class, must necessarily represent the views and
  wishes of those who profit or imagine they profit by the wrong.</p>
<p> That thought on social questions is so confused and perplexed, that the aspirations
  of great bodies of men, deeply though vaguely conscious of injustice, are in
  all civilized countries being diverted to futile and dangerous remedies, is
  largely due to the fact that those who assume and are credited with superior
  knowledge of social and economic laws have devoted their powers, not to showing
  where the injustice lies but to hiding it; not to clearing common thought but
  to confusing it.</p>
<p> It is idle to quarrel with this fact, for it is of the nature of things,
  and is shown in the history of every great movement against social wrong, from
  that which startled the House of Have in the Roman world by its proclamation
  of the equal fatherhood of God and the equal brotherhood of men, to that which
  in our own time broke the shackles of the chattel slave. But it is well to
  recognize it, that those who would know the truth on social and economic subjects
  may not blindly accept what at the time passes for authority, but may think
  for themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not, however, in regard to social problems only that I trust this examination
    may do something to enforce the need of intellectual self-reliance. It is in
    regard to those larger and deeper problems of man's nature and destiny which
    are, it seems to me, closely related to social questions.</p>
<p> Stepping out of their proper sphere and arrogating to themselves an authority
  to which they have no claim, professed teachers of spiritual truths long presumed
  to deny the truths of the natural sciences. But now professed teachers of the
  natural sciences, stepping in turn out of <em>their</em> proper sphere and arrogating
  to themselves an authority to which <em>they</em> have no claim, presume to deny spiritual
  truths. And there are many, who having discarded an authority often perverted
  by the influence of dominant wrong, have in its place accepted another authority
  which in its blank materialism affords as efficient a means for stilling conscience
  and defending selfish greed as any perversion of religious truth.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer is the foremost representative of this authority. Widely regarded
  as <em>the</em> scientific philosopher; eulogized by his admirers as the greatest
  of all philosophers &#8212; as the man who has cleared and illuminated the
  field of philosophy by bringing into it the exact methods of science &#8212; he
  carries to the common mind the weight of the marvelous scientific achievements
  of
  our time as applied to the most momentous of problems. The effect is to impress
  it with a vague belief that modern science has proved the idea of God to be
  an ignorant superstition and the hope of a future life a vain delusion.</p>
<p> Now, the great respect which in our day has attached to professed scientific
  teachers, and which has in large degree given to them the same influence that
  once attached to the teachers of religion, arises from the belief in the truthfulness
  of science &#8212; from the belief that in the pure, clear atmosphere in which
  its votaries are supposed to dwell they are exempt from temptations to pervert
  and distort. And this has been largely attributed to them where they have passed
  the boundaries of what is properly the domain of the natural sciences and assumed
  the teaching of politics and religion. It is his reputation as an honest, fearless
  thinker, bent only on discovering and proclaiming the truth, a reputation which
  he derives from his reputation as a scientific philosopher, that gives to Mr.
  Spencer the powerful influence which, having been exerted to deny all hope
  of a world to come, is now exerted to deny the right of the masses to the essentials
  of life in this world &#8212; to maintain the wrong, wider than that of chattel
  slavery, which condemns so many not merely to physical, but to mental and moral
  privation and want, to undeveloped and distorted lives and to untimely death.</p>
<p> While the examination we have made has only incidentally touched the larger
  phases of Mr. Spencer's philosophy, it has afforded an opportunity to judge
  of the very things on which his popular reputation is based &#8212; his intellectual
  honesty and his capacity for careful, logical reasoning. It has, so to speak,
  brought the alleged philosopher out of what to the ordinary man is a jungle
  of sounding phrases and big words, and placed him on open ground where he may
  be easily understood and measured. In his first book, written when he believed
  in God, in a divine order, in a moral sense, and which he has now emasculated,
  he does appear as an honest and fearless, though somewhat too careless a thinker.
  But that part of our examination which crosses what is now his distinctive
  philosophy shows him to be, as a philosopher ridiculous, as a man contemptible &#8212; a
  fawning Vicar of Bray, clothing in pompous phraseology and arrogant assumption
  logical confusions so absurd as to be comical.</p>
<p> If the result be to shatter an idol, I trust it may also be to promote freedom
  of thought.</p>
<p> As there are many to whom the beauty and harmony of economic laws are hidden,
  and to whom the inspiring thought of a social order in which there should be
  work for all, leisure for all, and abundance for all &#8212; in which all might
  be at least as true, as generous and as manful as they wish to be &#8212; is
  shut out by the deference paid to economic authorities who have as it were
  given bonds not to find that for which they profess to seek, so there are many
  today to whom any belief in the spiritual element, in the existence of God
  and in a future life, is darkened or destroyed, not so much by difficulties
  they themselves find, but by what they take to be the teachings of science.
  Conscious of their own ignorance, distrustful of their own powers, stumbling
  over scientific technicalities and awed by metaphysical terminology, they are
  disposed to accept on faith the teachings of such a man as Mr. Spencer, as
  those of one who on all things knows more and sees further than they can, and
  to accord to what they take to be intellectual pre-eminence the moral pre-eminence
  that they feel ought to accompany it. I know the feeling of such men, for I
  remember the years when it was my own.</p>
<p> To these it is my hope that this examination may be useful, by putting them
  on inquiry. In its course we have tested, in matters where ordinary intelligence
  and knowledge are competent to judge, the logical methods and intellectual
  honesty of the foremost of those who in the name of science eliminate God and
  degrade man, taking from human life its highest dignity and deepest hope. Now,
  if in simple matters we find such confusion, such credulity, such violation
  of every canon of sound reasoning as we have found here, shall we blindly trust
  in deeper matters &#8212; in those matters which always have and always must
  perplex the intellect of man?</p>
<p> Let us rather, as I said in the beginning, not too much under-rate our own
  powers in what is concerned with common facts and general relations. While
  we may not be scientists or philosophers we too are men. And as to things which
  the telescope cannot resolve, nor the microscope reveal, nor the spectrum analysis
  throw light on, nor the tests of the chemist discover, it is as irrational
  to accept blindly the dictum of those who say, &quot;Thus saith science!&quot; as
  it is in things that are the proper field of the natural sciences to bow before
  the dictum of those who say, &quot;Thus saith religion!&quot;</p>
<p> I care nothing for creeds. I am not concerned with any one's religious belief.
  But I would have men think for themselves. If we do not, we can only abandon
  one superstition to take up another, and it may be a worse one. It is as bad
  for a man to think that he can know nothing as to think he knows all. There
  are things which it is given to all possessing reason to know, if they will
  but use that reason. And some things it may be there are, that &#8212; as was
  said by one whom the learning of the time sneered at, and the high priests
  persecuted, and polite society, speaking through the voice of those who knew
  not what they did, crucified &#8212; are hidden from the wise and prudent and
  revealed unto babes.</p>
