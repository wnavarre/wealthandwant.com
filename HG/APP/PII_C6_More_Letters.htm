  <p><strong><font size="-1">Henry George &#8212; A Perplexed
        Philosopher<br />
    </font></strong><strong><font size="-1">Part II&#8212;Repudiation (continued)</font></strong></p>
  <p>    <strong>Chapter VI &#8212; More Letters </strong></p>
</div>
<p> WITH this Mr. Spencer endeavored to withdraw, and no wonder. But letters
  from Mr. Greenwood, Professor Huxley, and a number of new participants, including
  Auberon Herbert for the defense, continued to appear in the <em>Times</em> for
  some time longer, and Messrs. Greenwood and Huxley succeeded in dragging from
  him
  another brief confession.</p>
<p> Professor Huxley made him give up his illustration from physiological principles,
  and Mr. Greenwood, pressing him as to whether, as averred by Mr. Laidler, he
  had ever said that to right one wrong it takes another, first made him declare
  that he did not remember to have said it, and then, pressing him still further,
  made him declare he had not said it and to repudiate it if he had.</p>
<p> Although this is a mere side-issue, perhaps it may be worthwhile, even at
  this late date, to vindicate Mr. Laidler and refresh Mr. Spencer's memory.
  In <em>Social Statics</em>, Chapter XXI, 'The Duty of the State,' Section 8,
  may be found the doctrine which Mr. Laidler referred to, when, in citing Mr.
  Spencer
  against Mr. Morley's objection to land nationalization, he said, as reported
  by the <em>Times</em> &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Mr. Spencer has said that the land had been taken by force and fraud. That
      gentleman had also said that to right one wrong it takes another.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> This in effect, if not in exact words, Mr. Spencer certainly does say in
  Chapter XXI, Section 8, in combating the doctrine of non-resistance. He declares
  all coercion immoral in itself, but (using the same terms in the same sense
  as Mr. Laidler) justifies government when &quot;it uses wrong to put down wrong.&quot; He
  adds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">The principle of non-resistance is not ethically true,
      but only that of non-aggression&#8230;.
      We may not carelessly abandon our rights. We may not give away our birthright
      for the sake of peace. &#8230; We may not be passive under aggression. In due
      maintenance of our claim is involved the practicability of all our duties. &#8230; If
      we allow ourselves to be deprived of that without which we cannot fulfil
      the Divine will, we virtually negative that will.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> I thus take the trouble to refresh Mr. Spencer's memory and vindicate Mr.
  Laidler, for, although the latter gentleman was allowed one letter in the
  <em>Times</em>, it was afterwards that the question was raised by Mr. Greenwood,
  and I do not
  suppose that Mr. Laidler got another chance, the <em>Times</em> speaking of him contemptuously,
  as a Mr. Laidler, and printing his letter in smaller type, although it was
  he who first brought out Mr. Spencer, and provoked the whole discussion.</p>
<p> Mr. Laidler's letter, of which neither party to the controversy seemed to
  care to take notice, was published by the <em>Times</em> on the same day as Mr. Spencer's
  second letter. He said&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><font size="-1">To the Editor of The Times.</font></em></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> SIR: As one of the deputation of members of the Newcastle
      Labor Electoral Organization who recently waited upon Mr. John Morley,
      M.P., to ascertain
    his opinion on certain political and social topics, I was entrusted by my
    fellow-members
      of the deputation with the question of the nationalization of the land,
    and this subject I discussed with Mr. Morley. In doing so, I sought to back
    up
      my position by quoting the ninth chapter of <em>Social Statics</em>, by Mr. Herbert
      Spencer, and I certainly thought I had a good case when I found on my side
      the most distinguished authority of our time. To my great surprise, I now
    find that in the letters which he has addressed to you, Mr. Herbert Spencer
    appears
      to be very anxious to repudiate the doctrines which he preached so eloquently
      in 1850. Now, although it is a common thing for the politician of to-day
    to repudiate principles and deductions which he formerly warmly espoused
    and to
      adopt others which he once energetically condemned, one does not expect
    the same vacillation on the part of a distinguished philosopher like Mr.
    Herbert
      Spencer. I find it difficult to understand his position, which seems to
    be this&#8212;that while adhering to his general principles he abandons certain
      deductions therefrom. Now, to my mind, the ninth chapter of <em>Social
      Statics</em>,
      which deals with 'The Right to the Use of the Earth,' seems as true, as
    logical, and as unanswerable an argument in favor of the nationalization
    of the land
      as it doubtless appeared to Mr. Herbert Spencer on the day it was written.
      Let us trace the course of his argument through the ten sections of which
    the chapter is composed.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Giving a short abstract of these ten sections of Chapter IX Mr. Laidler continued&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">In the foregoing digest, beyond one or two connecting words,
      the language is that of Mr. Herbert Spencer himself. Does it not constitute
      an unanswerable
      argument in favor of the nationalization of the land? If the author would
      permit it to be reprinted, what an admirable tract the ninth chapter of
      Social Statics would be for the propagation of socialistic11 principles!
      But he now
      seems to repudiate the offspring of his own genius! We have, however, a
      right to ask that, instead of a vague repudiation in general terms, Mr.
      Herbert Spencer
      should tell us specifically what deductions he has abandoned and why he
      has abandoned them. We might then endeavor to answer his answers to his
      own propositions.
      Yours,</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> JOHN LAIDLER, Bricklayer.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">11 Mr. Laidler uses the word &quot;socialistic&quot; in the vague way in which it is
    so commonly used in England, and doubtless means land nationalization principles.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How far Mr. Spencer has tried to answer his own propositions, we shall see
    in <em>Justice</em>.</p>
