</font></strong><strong><font size="-1">Part II&#8212;Repudiation (continued)</font></strong></p>
<p align="center">Chapter III &#8212; Letter To The <em>Times</em></p>
<p> No one can boldly utter a great truth, and then, when the times have become
  ripe for it, and his utterance voices what is burning in hearts and consciences,
  whisper it away. So despite his apology to landlords in the <em>St. James's
  Gazette</em>,
  and the pains he had taken to make his peace with them in &quot;The Man <em>versus</em> the
  State,&quot; what he had said on the land question in <em>Social Statics</em> came
  up again to trouble Mr. Spencer.</p>
<p> But for a long time his position on the land question was almost as dual
  as that of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In his personal circle it was doubtless
  assumed that he was a stanch supporter of private property in land, and if
  his earlier opinions were known there it was understood that he was sorry for
  them. And he had become, if not an active member, at least a valued ally of
  the Liberty and Property Defence League. But in a wider circle what he had
  written against private property in land was telling with increasing force.
  For to this wider circle his St. James's apology had hardly reached, and even
  when known was not deemed a recantation of the opinions deliberately expressed
  in <em>Social Statics</em>, which he still, through D. Appleton &amp; Co., continued
  to publish, without any modification whatever. The steady growth of the movement
  that began with the publication of <em>Progress and Poverty</em> everywhere enlisted
  active men in the propagation of the idea of the equality of rights to land
  and called wide attention to what he had said on that subject. They naturally
  seized on the argument against the justice of private property in land in Chapter
  IX of <em>Social Statics</em>, and spread it broadcast, as the utterance of one now
  widely esteemed the greatest of philosophers. Of all else that Mr. Spencer
  has written, there is nothing that has had such a circulation as has thus been
  given to this chapter. It was printed and is still being printed by many American
  newspapers<em><strong>8</strong></em>, and was issued in tract form for free distribution in the United
  States, Canada and Australia; editions of hundreds of thousands being issued
  at a time<em><strong>9</strong></em>, many of which must have reached Great Britain, even if it was not
  reprinted there.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>8.</strong> Even as I write I am constantly receiving, especially from the West, copies
      of papers which contain Chapter IX. of &quot;Social Statics&quot; and which
      in ignorance of all he has since said, continue to speak of Mr. Spencer
      as an advocate of
      equal rights to land.<br>
      <strong>9.</strong> About the time I ran for Mayor of New York (1886) on a platform which attracted
      great attention to the idea of equal rights to land, one enthusiastic advocate
      of the idea, Mr. W. J. Atkinson, himself printed some 500,000 copies.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> This wide circulation of his condemnation of private property in land did
  not, it is probable, much trouble Mr. Spencer, since it did not reach his
  London circle. But in November, 1889 &#8212; six years after his letter to
  the <em>St. James's Gazette</em> &#8212; some echoes of it made their way into
  <em>The Times</em>, the very journalistic center of high English respectability.</p>
<p> The matter thus got into the <em>Times</em>: Mr. John Morley, Member of Parliament
  for Newcastle, being in that city, was interviewed by some of his constituents,
  representing a labor organization. Among other questions land nationalization
  was brought up; Mr. John Laidler, a bricklayer, speaking for it. Mr. Morley
  expressing dissent, Mr. Laidler cited the authority of Mr. Spencer in support
  of the ideas that land had been made private property by force and fraud, and
  should be appropriated by the community for the benefit of all. The<em> Times</em> of
  November 5, contained a report of this interview.</p>
<p> This report in the <em>Times</em> aroused Mr. Spencer at once. For although
  he had no objection to the circulation of his radical utterances in America,
  where
        through D. Appleton &amp; Co. he was still publishing and advertising <em>Social
        Statics</em>, it was evidently quite a different matter to him that they should
        be known in the pleasant circle wherein with Sir John and his Grace and
        the peers and judges of the Liberty and Property Defence League he was
        personally
        dwelling. He promptly sent this letter to the <em>Times</em>. It appeared on the
        7th.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <em><font size="-1">To the Editor of The Times</font></em><font size="-1">.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Sir: During the interview between Mr. Morley and some of his constituents,
      reported in your issue of the 5th inst., I was referred to as having set forth
      certain opinions respecting landownership. Fearing that, if I remain silent,
      many will suppose I have said things which I have not said, I find it needful
      to say something in explanation.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Already within these few years I have twice pointed out that these opinions
      (made to appear by those who have circulated them widely different from what
      they really are, by the omission of accompanying opinions) were set forth in
      my first work, published forty years ago; and that, for the last twelve or
      fifteen years, I have refrained from issuing new editions of that work and
      have interdicted translations, because, though I still adhere to its general
      principles, I dissent from some of the deductions.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> The work referred to &#8212; <em>Social Statics</em> &#8212; was
      intended to be a system of political ethics &#8212; absolute political
      ethics, or that which ought to be, as distinguished from relative political
      ethics, or that
      which is at
      present
      the nearest practicable approach to it. The conclusion reached concerning
      landownership was reached while seeking a valid basis for the right of
      property, the basis
      assigned by Locke appearing to me invalid. It was argued that a satisfactory
      ethical warrant for private ownership could arise only by contract between
      the community, as original owner of the inhabited area, and individual
      members, who became tenants, agreeing to pay certain portions of the produce,
      or its
      equivalent in money, in consideration of recognized claims to the rest.
      And in the course of the argument it was pointed out that such a view of
      landownership
      is congruous with existing legal theory and practice; since in law every
      landowner is held to be a tenant of the Crown &#8212; that is, of the community,
      and since, in practice, the supreme right of the community is asserted
      by every
      Act of
      Parliament which, with a view to public advantage, directly or by proxy
      takes possession of land after making due compensation.</font></p>
  <p> <font size="-1">All this was said in the belief that the questions raised
      were not likely to come to the front in our time or for many generations;
      but, assuming that
    they would sometime come to the front, it was said that, supposing the community
    should assert overtly the supreme right which is now tacitly asserted, the
    business of compensation of landowners would be a complicated one &#8212;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;One that perhaps cannot be settled in a strictly equitable manner. &#8230; Most
    of our present landowners are men who have, either mediately or immediately,
    either by their own acts or by the acts of their ancestors, given for their
    estates equivalents of honestly earned wealth, believing that they were investing
    their savings in a legitimate manner. To justly estimate and liquidate the
    claims of such is one of the most intricate problems society will one day
    have to solve.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> To make the position I then took quite clear, it is needful
      to add that, as shown in a succeeding chapter, the insistence on this doctrine,
      in virtue
    of which &quot;the right of property obtains a legitimate foundation,&quot; had
    for one of its motives the exclusion of Socialism and Communism, to which
    I was then as profoundly averse as I am now.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Investigations made during recent years into the various forms of social
    organization, while writing the <em>Principles of Sociology</em>, have in part confirmed
    and in part changed the views published in 1850. Perhaps I may be allowed space
    for quoting from <em>Political Institutions</em> a paragraph showing the revised conclusions
    arrived at:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;At first sight it seems fairly inferable that the
          absolute ownership of land by private persons must be the ultimate state
          which industrialism brings
          about. But though industrialism has thus far tended to individualize possession
          of land while individualizing all other possession, it may be doubted
          whether the final stage is at present reached. Ownership established by
          force does
          not stand on the same footing as ownership established by contract; and
          though multiplied sales and purchases, treating the two ownerships in the
          same way,
          have tacitly assimilated them, the assimilation may eventually be denied.
          The analogy furnished by assumed rights of possession over human beings
          helps us
          to recognize this possibility. For, while prisoners of war, taken by force
          and held as property in a vague way (being at first much on a footing with
          other members of a household), were reduced more definitely to the form
          of property when the buying and selling of slaves became general; and,
          while it
          might centuries ago have been thence inferred that the ownership of man
          by man was an ownership in course of being permanently established, yet
          we see
          that a later stage of civilization, reversing this process, has destroyed
          ownership of man by man. Similarly, at a stage still more advanced, it
          may be that private
          ownership of land will disappear. As that primitive freedom of the individual
          which existed before war established coercive institutions and personal
          slavery comes to be reestablished as militancy declines, so it seems possible
          that
          the primitive ownership of land by the community, which, with the development
          of coercive institutions, lapsed in large measure or wholly into private
          ownership. will be revived as industrialism further develops. The <em>regime</em>      of contract,
          at present so far extended that the right of property in movables is recognized
          only as having arisen by exchange of services or products under agreements,
          or by gift from those who had acquired it under such agreements, may be
          further extended so far that the products of the soil will be recognized
          as property
          only by virtue of agreements between individuals as tenants and the community
          as landowner. Even now, among ourselves, private ownership of land is not
          absolute. In legal theory landowners are directly or indirectly tenants
          of the Crown
          (which in our day is equivalent to the state, or, in other words, the community);
          and the community from time to time resumes possession after making due
          compensation. Perhaps the right of the community to the land, thus tacitly
          asserted, will
          in time to come be overtly asserted and acted upon after making full allowance
          for the accumulated value artificially given. &#8230; There is reason to
          suspect that, while private possession of things produced by labor will
          grow even more
          definite and sacred than at present, the inhabited area, which cannot be
          produced by labor, will eventually be distinguished as something which
          may not be privately
          possessed. As the individual, primitively owner of himself, partially or
          wholly loses ownership of himself during the militant regime, but gradually
          resumes
          it as the industrial regime develops, so possibly the communal proprietorship
          of land, partially or wholly merged in the ownership of dominant men during
          evolution of the militant type, will be resumed as the industrial type
          becomes fully evolved&quot; (pp. 643-646).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">The use of the words &quot;possible ... &#8230; possibly,&quot; and &quot;perhaps,&quot; in
    the above extracts shows that I have no positive opinion as to what may hereafter
    take place. The reason for this state of hesitancy is that I cannot see my
    way toward reconciliation of the ethical requirements with the politico-economical
    requirements. On the one hand, a condition of things under which the owner
    of, say, the Scilly Isles might make tenancy of his land conditional upon professing
    a certain creed or adopting prescribed habits of life, giving notice to quit
    to any who did not submit, is ethically indefensible. On the other hand, &quot;nationalization
    of the land,&quot; effected after compensation for the artificial value given
    by cultivation, amounting to the greater part of its value, would entail,
    in the shape of interest on the required purchase money, as great a sum as
    is
    now paid in rent, and indeed a greater, considering the respective rates
    of interest on landed property and other property. Add to which, there is
    no reason
    to think that the substituted form of administration would be better than
    the existing form of administration. The belief that land would be better
    managed
    by public officials than it is by private owners is a very wild belief.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> What the remote future may bring forth there is no saying; but with a humanity
    anything like that we now know, the implied reorganization would be disastrous.</font></p>
