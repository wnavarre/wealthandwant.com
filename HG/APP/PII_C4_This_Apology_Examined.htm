Part II&#8212;Repudiation (continued)</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><br />
  Chapter IV &#8212; This Apology Examined.</strong> </p>
<p> To drop into one of Mr. Spencer's favorite methods of illustration:</p>
<p> &quot;I am told,&quot; said the respectable grandmother, with a big stick
  in her hand, &quot;that you are the boy who broke down my fence and told all
  the other boys that they were at liberty to go into my orchard and take my
  apples.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;It is not true,&quot; replied the trembling small boy; &quot;I didn't
  do it. And I didn't mean to do it. And when I did it I was only trying to mend
  your fence, which I found was weak. And the reason I did it was to keep bad
  boys out. And I have always said you ought to be paid for your apples. And
  I won't do it again! And I am certain your apples would give boys stomach-ache.&quot;</p>
<p> This letter to the <em>Times</em> repeats the same line of excuse made six years
  before in the <em>St. James's Gazette</em>. Emboldened by the success of that apology,
  for
  no one seems to have thought it worth while to point out its misstatements,
  Mr. Spencer undertakes to face down the Newcastle bricklayer in the same way,
  and with even bolder crookedness.</p>
<p> The question in issue is a question of fact &#8212; whether, as asserted
  by Mr. Laidler, Mr. Spencer had in <em>Social Statics</em> advocated land nationalization,
  and incidentally, whether he had declared that the land had been made private
  property by force and fraud. Without venturing specifically to deny this, Mr.
  Spencer denies it by implication, and gives an impression thus expressed editorially
  by the <em>Times</em> on the 9th of November:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">So without denying that he did once say something of the sort, he [Mr. Spencer]
      explains that it was forty years ago, and that for the last fifteen years he
      has been doing all that he can to suppress the book in which he said it, and
      that he never meant his words to have any bearing upon practical questions.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Put into straightforward English, what Mr. Spencer says in this letter to
  the <em>Times</em> is &#8212;</p>
<ul>
  <li> That he had not favored land nationalization.</li>
  <li> That he had been made to appear to have done so by quotations from <em>Social
      Statics</em> divested of their qualifying context.</li>
  <li> That for the last twelve or fifteen years he had stopped the publication
      of that work.</li>
  <li> That <em>Social Statics</em> was not intended to suggest practical political action.</li>
  <li> That what was said therein of landownership was said in the effort to
    find a valid basis for the right of property, and to exclude socialism and
    communism;
      that it involved no departure from the existing legal theory and practice;
      was said in the belief that the land question would not come to the front
    for many generations, and admitted the right of the landowners to compensation.</li>
  <li> That his present conclusions are, that while possibly the community may
    sometime resume land after due compensation to landowners, he has no positive
    opinion
      as to whether it will or not.</li>
  <li> That as to this he cannot harmonize ethics with political economy, for
    while a condition may be imagined under which private landownership might
    be injurious,
      its abolition would require the payment to landowners of as great and indeed
      a greater sum than is now paid in rent; would involve the management of
    land by public officials, and that with humanity anything like that we now
    know,
      this would be disastrous.</li>
</ul>
<p> All this, so far as it relates to the question in issue, is simply not true.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer, in <em>Social Statics</em>, <em>did</em> condemn private property in land, <em>did</em>  advocate the resumption of land by the community, <em>did</em> unequivocally and unreservedly,
  and with all his force, declare for what is now called land nationalization.
  That he did so does not rest on any forcing of words, any wresting of sentences
  from their context. It is the burden of all he says on the subject, and of
  the most vital part of the book. In the whole volume there is no word in modification
  of the opinions so strongly and clearly expressed in the full quotations I
  have made.</p>
<p> Nor is it true that the conclusion of <em>Social Statics</em> concerning landownership &quot;was
  reached while seeking a valid basis for the right of property.&quot; It was
  reached as a primary corollary of the first principle: the freedom of every
  man to do all that he wills provided he infringes not the equal freedom of
  any other man, and was deduced directly from the facts of human existence:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Given a race of beings having like claims to pursue the
      objects of their desires &#8212; given a world adapted to the gratification
      of those desires &#8212; a
      world into which such beings are similarly born, and it unavoidably follows
      that they have equal rights to the use of this world.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Mr. Spencer's questioning of Locke's derivation of the right of property,
  so far from being the cause of his denial of the validity of private property
  in land, grows, as we have seen, out of his idea that the only right to land
  is that of the community. What he has to say against socialism and communism,
  instead of being a motive for his advocacy of land nationalization, is brought
  in to strengthen land nationalization by showing that it does not involve either.
  And so, what Mr. Spencer gives the <em>Times</em> to understand as to the congruity
  of the view of landownership taken in <em>Social Statics</em> with existing legal theory
  and practice, is so flagrantly untrue that one wonders at its audacity.</p>
<p> As to what Mr. Spencer says of the intent of <em>Social Statics</em>, the
  only intelligible meaning that can be put on it is that which the editor of
  the <em>Times</em> put, &quot;That
  he never meant his words to have any bearing upon practical questions.&quot;</p>
<p> The exact phraseology is &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">The work referred to &#8212; <em>Social Statics</em> &#8212; was
      intended to be a system of political ethics &#8212; absolute political
      ethics, or that which ought to be, as distinguished from relative political
      ethics,
    or that
    which
    is
      at present
      the nearest practicable approach to it.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> If this means anything, it means that <em>Social Statics</em> was written to set forth
  a system of political ethics that cannot be carried into conduct now, and that
  no one is under any obligation to try to carry into conduct.</p>
<p> The applications of ethics, like the applications of mechanics, or chemistry,
  or any other science or body of laws, must always be relative, in the sense
  that one principle or law is to be taken in consideration with other principles
  or laws: so that conduct that would have the sanction of ethics where one is
  beset by robbers or murderers might be very different from the conduct that
  ethics would sanction under normal and peaceful conditions. In <em>The Data
  of Ethics</em>, one of the more recent of the works which set forth the Spencerian
  philosophy, written long after <em>Social Statics</em>, this distinction between pure
  ethics and applied ethics is, by one of the confusions that in that philosophy
  pass for definitions, converted into a distinction between absolute ethics
  and relative ethics. Yet, if there be any sort of ethics that has no relation
  to conduct here and now, the best term for it is Pickwickian ethics.</p>
<p> But the question here is not a question of definition. It is a question of
  fact.</p>
<p> Now, however Mr. Spencer's opinions and wishes may have changed since <em>Social
  Statics</em> was written, that book still shows that, <em>when</em> he wrote it, his intention
  in exposing the iniquity of private property in land was to arouse public opinion
  to demand its abolition. In <em>Social Statics</em> he denounced not only private property
  in land: he denounced slavery, then in the United States and other countries,
  a still-living thing; he denounced protection; he denounced restrictions on
  the right of free speech, the denial to women of equal rights, the coercive
  education of children, the then existing restrictions on the franchise, the
  cost and delays of legal proceedings, the maintenance of poor laws, the establishment
  of state schools, government colonization, etc. Were all these pleas for reforms,
  some of which Mr. Spencer has lived to see accomplished, and others of which
  he is still advocating, Pickwickian also?</p>
<p> If Mr. Spencer, in what he had to say on the land question in <em>Social
    Statics</em>,
  was talking mere abstract political ethics &#8212; something totally different
  from practical ethics &#8212; what did he mean by declaring that &quot;Equity
  does not permit property in land&quot;? What did he mean by saying that pure
  equity enjoins a protest against every existing pretension to the individual
  possession of the soil, and dictates the assertion that the right of mankind
  at large to the earth's surface is still valid &#8212; &quot;all deeds, customs,
  and laws notwithstanding&quot;? What did he mean by scornfully sneering at
  those who &quot;are continually trying to reconcile yes and no,&quot; and who
  delight &quot;in ifs, buts, and excepts&quot;? What did he mean by saying, &quot;In
  this matter of land tenure the verdict of morality must be either yea or nay.
  Either men have a right to make the soil private property or they have not.
  There is no medium&quot;? What did he mean in pointing out that what is now
  called land nationalization &quot;need cause no very serious revolution in
  existing arrangements,&quot; and that &quot;Equity sternly commands it to be
  done&quot;? What did he mean by putting, &quot;as the first item on the list
  of the injuries which government at the time he wrote was doing, that gigantic
  injustice inflicted on nineteen-twentieths of the community by the usurpation
  of the soil by the breach of their rights to the use of the earth&quot;? What
  did he mean by saying that the only plausible defense of the poor laws was
  the wrong done to people at large by robbing them of their birthright &#8212; their
  heritage in the earth &#8212; by asking, &quot;Why organize a diseased state?&quot; &#8212; by
  declaring, &quot;Sometime or other this morbid constitution of things, under
  which the greater part of the body politic is cut off from direct access to
  the source of life, must be changed.&quot;</p>
<p> Did it all relate to the sort of ethics that has no bearing on practical
  questions?</p>
<p> Whatever may be the ethical views of Mr. Spencer now that his eyes have been
  put out, and he has been set to grind in the house of the lords of the Philistines,
  the young Samson of <em>Social Statics</em> with locks as yet unshorn by the
  social Delilah knew nothing of any such ethics. Not merely in what I have quoted,
  but throughout the book, from first page to last, the burden of <em>Social
  Statics</em>  is the necessity, the sacred duty of destroying abuses that fetter
  the equal liberty of men. He sees, indeed &#8212; as who does not? &#8212; that
  before liberty can truly reign men must be fit for liberty; and he realizes
  that there
  may
  be social conditions in which liberty might temporarily work ill; but he insists
  again and again that wherever there is any yearning for liberty, any perception
  of the wrong done by its denial, there the time has come for the struggle against
  injustice to be made, and that the way to fit men for the enjoyment of rights
  is to destroy wrongs. The central thought of the book, that permeates all its
  parts, is that of a divinely appointed order, which men are bound to obey &#8212; a
  God-given law, as true in the social sphere as the laws of physics are true
  in the physical sphere, to which all human regulations must be made to conform;
  and that this law is the law of equal freedom &#8212; the law from which is
  deduced the condemnation of private property in land. For those who palter
  with expediency;
  for those who would dally with wrong; for those who say that a thing is right
  in the abstract, but that practical considerations forbid its being carried
  into effect &#8212; Mr. Spencer, from the first page of <em>Social Statics</em> to
  the last, has nothing but the utmost contempt and scorn.</p>
<p> Here is one extract from the close of the introduction to <em>Social Statics</em>  (pp.
  51, 56, 60-65) which will show how widely different were the ethics taught
  in <em>Social Statics</em> from what the author of the Spencerian philosophy,
  in 1889, told the <em>Times</em> they were:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">And yet, unable as the imperfect man may be to fulfil the
      perfect law, there is no other law for him. One right course only is open;
      and he must
    either
      follow that or take the consequences. The conditions of existence will
    not bend before his perversity; nor relax in consideration of his weakness.
    Neither,
      when they are broken, may any exception from penalties be hoped for. &quot;Obey
      or suffer,&quot; are the ever-repeated alternatives. Disobedience is sure
      to be convicted. And there are no reprieves. &#8230;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Our social edifice may be constructed with all possible labor and ingenuity,
      and be strongly cramped together with cunningly devised enactments, but if
      there be no <em>rectitude</em> in its component parts, if it is not built on <em>upright</em>      principles, it will assuredly tumble to pieces. As well might we seek to light
      a fire with ice, feed cattle with stones, hang our hats on cobwebs, or otherwise
      disregard the physical laws of the world, as go contrary to its equally imperative
      ethical laws.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Yes, but there are exceptions, say you. We cannot always be strictly guided
      by abstract principles. Prudential considerations must have some weight. It
      is necessary to use a little policy.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Very specious, no doubt, are your reasons for advocating
      this or the other exception. But if there be any truth in the foregoing
      argument, no infraction
      of the law can be made with impunity. Those cherished schemes by which
    you propose to attain some desired good by a little politic disobedience,
    are all
      delusive. &#8230;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> The reasons for thus specially insisting on implicit obedience
      will become apparent as the reader proceeds. Amongst the conclusions inevitably
      following
      from an admitted principle, he will most likely find several for which
    he is hardly prepared. Some of these will seem strange; others impracticable;
    and
      it maybe one or two wholly at variance with his ideas of duty. Nevertheless,
      should he find them logically derived from a fundamental truth, he will
    have no alternative but to adopt them as rules of conduct, which ought to
    be followed
      without exception. If there be any weight in the considerations above set
    forth, then, no matter how seemingly inexpedient, dangerous, injurious even,
    may be
      the course which morality points out as &quot;abstractedly right,&quot; the
      highest wisdom is in perfect and fearless submission.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> And these are the paragraphs with which (pp. 517, 518) <em>Social Statics</em> closes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Not as adventitious, therefore, will the wise man regard
      the faith that is in him, not as something which may be slighted, and made
      subordinate to
    calculations
      of policy; but as the supreme authority to which all his actions should
    bend. The highest truth conceivable by him he will fearlessly utter; and
    will endeavor
      to vet embodied in fact his purest idealisms: knowing that, let what may
    come of it, he is thus playing his appointed part in the world knowing that,
    if
      he can get done the thing he aims at &#8212; well: if not &#8212; well
      also; though not so well.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> And thus, in teaching a uniform, unquestioning obedience,
      does an entirely abstract philosophy become one with all true religion.
      Fidelity to conscience &#8212; this
      is the essential precept inculcated by both. No hesitation, no paltering
      about probable results, but an implicit submission to what is believed
      to be the
      law laid down for us. We are not to pay lip-homage to principles which
      our conduct willfully transgresses. We are not to follow the example of
      those who,
      taking &quot;<em>Domine dirige nos</em>&quot; for their motto, yet disregard
      the directions given, and prefer to direct themselves. We are not to be
      guilty
      of that practical
      atheism, which, seeing no guidance for human affairs but its own limited
      foresight, endeavors itself to play the god, and decide what will be good
      for mankind,
      and what bad. But, on the contrary, we are to search out with a genuine
      humility the rules ordained for us &#8212; are to do unfalteringly, without
      speculating as to consequences, whatsoever these require; and we are to
      do this in the
      belief that then, when there is perfect sincerity when each man is true
      to himself &#8212; when everyone strives to realize what he thinks the
      highest rectitude &#8212; then
      must all things prosper.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Could there be any sadder commentary upon the Herbert Spencer who in 1889
  wrote this letter to the <em>Times</em>?</p>
<p> I am not objecting that Mr. Spencer has changed his opinions. Such change
  might be for the better or might be for the worse, but it would at least be
  within his right. What I point out is that in this letter to the <em>Times</em>, as
  in his previous letter to the <em>St. James's Gazette</em>, Mr. Spencer does what is
  not within his right, what a straight man could not do &#8212; misstates what
  he previously did say.</p>
<p> And while Mr. Spencer, in this letter to the <em>Times</em>, is thus untruthful
  in regard to what he had taught in <em>Social Statics</em>, he is equally untruthful
  in
  regard to his suppression of that book. His words are &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">For the last twelve or fifteen years I have refrained from issuing new editions
      of that work, and have interdicted translations.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The plain meaning of this is, that for twelve or fifteen years prior to 1889
  Mr. Spencer had stopped the publication of <em>Social Statics</em>. There is no other
  honest construction. And this is the way in which it was understood. The <em>Times</em>,
  in its editorial comment on Mr. Spencer's letter, taking it to mean that &quot;for
  the last fifteen years he had been doing all he could to suppress the book;&quot; and
  Mr. Frederick Greenwood, who also commented on the letter, taking it to mean
  that &quot;for the last fifteen years he had not allowed it to appear in any
  language.&quot;</p>
<p> As a matter of fact, this is not true. <em>Social Statics</em> was still being printed
  by Mr. Spencer's authorized publishers, D. Appleton &amp; Co. of New York.
  The only scintilla of truth in this denial is that, as he has since (in 1892)
  stated, he had seven years before this resolved that he would import no more
  copies into England. As for the &quot;interdiction of translations,&quot; I
  suppose this means that the book bore originally the usual English formula &quot;Rights
  of translation reserved;&quot; for, judging from its going out of print in
  England, and its never having been pirated in the United States, it is not
  likely that any further interdiction was needed to prevent its translation.</p>
<p> That Mr. Spencer should have continued the publication of <em>Social Statics</em>  for
  years after he had told the readers of the <em>St.
    James's</em> and the <em>Times</em> that
  he had suppressed it, I can only account for on the ground that he did not
  care to deprive himself of what revenue he was drawing from its sale, and had
  really no objection to the circulation of his attacks on landlordism, so long
  as his London friends did not hear of it. Certain it is, that he could have
  withdrawn it at any time. D. Appleton &amp; Co. are not book pirates, but honorable
  gentlemen, who publish Mr. Spencer's works under arrangement with their author,
  and even in the absence of a copyright law would certainly have ceased printing
  <em>Social Statics</em>, if he had requested. To any one who knows them this
  needs no proof. But as a matter of fact, in 1885, when the controversy between
  Mr. Spencer
  and Mr. Frederic Harrison appeared in the <em>Nineteenth Century</em>, the
  Messrs. Appleton, thinking there would be a large American sale for it in book
  form, made plates
  and printed an edition.<font size="-1"><em><strong>10 </strong></em></font>They
  had barely published this when they suppressed it, as was understood, on a
  cabled request from Mr. Spencer. Not another copy
  went out. The copies printed were destroyed and the plates melted, although
  a rival firm did publish the controversy, and sell a considerable number. Or,
  if he had preferred that, D. Appleton &amp; Co. would at any time have printed
  in <em>Social Statics</em> any retraction or modification of its expressions
  on the land question he had wished. But, while the preface prefixed to the
  book in
  1864, and the note to Chapter IV. &#8212; a reply to Professor Sidgwick, inserted
  in 1875 &#8212; and the additional preface added in 1877, did set forth the
  modifications of Mr. Spencer's opinions about various other matters, they contain
  nothing
  to show any change of his opinions on the land question; and the book has continued
  to be published up to 1892 without any such modification.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>10</strong> &quot;The Nature and Reality of Religion. Controversy between Frederic Harrison
      and Herbert Spencer. With an Introduction, Notes and an Appendix on the Religious
      Value of the Unknowable, by Count D'Alviella.&quot; New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co.,
      1, 3 and 5 Bond Street. 1885.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is, of course, not for me to object that Mr. Spencer did not withdraw
    <em>Social Statics</em> in the only place where it was being published, or
    that he did not insert a retraction or modification of its utterances on
    the land question &#8212; although
    to me the wonder is that when, on his return to England in 1882, he seems
    to have definitely made up his mind to take the side of landlordism if pressed
    to it, he did not melt every plate and buy up every copy he could. I am only
    comparing Mr. Spencer's statements in the <em>Times</em> with the facts, because of
    the evidence the comparison gives of the character of the man, and because
    of the light it throws on the change in his opinions on the land question.</p>
<p> For this letter to the <em>Times</em> not only shows Mr. Spencer's intense
  desire to be counted on the side of &quot;vested interests&quot; in the struggle
  over the land question that was beginning, but it also shows how he was intending
  to join formally the ranks of the defenders of private property in land without
  the humiliation of an open recantation of what he had said in <em>Social Statics</em>.
  By aid of double-barreled ethics and philosophic legerdemain Mr. Spencer evidently
  hopes to keep some reputation for consistency and yet uphold private property
  in land. As compared with the apology in the <em>St. James's Gazette</em>,
  the new matter in this apology in the <em>Times</em> consists in the conversion of
  what he said in
  <em>Social Statics</em> (Section 7, Chapter IX) as illustrating that &quot;after all
  nobody does implicitly believe in landlordism,&quot; into a conformity with &quot;existing
  legal theory <em>and practice</em>;&quot; in the assumption that the compensation of
  which he had spoken (Section 9) meant compensation satisfactory to landlords;
  and boldest of all (for this in Chapter X., Section 3, he had expressly denied),
  in the assumption that the recognition of equal rights to land means the administration
  and management of land by public officials.</p>
<p> I should like also to call the attention of those who put faith in Mr. Spencer's
  philosophic acumen to the manner in which in this letter he withdraws to the
  Scilly Isles, and to the conditioning of the tenancy of land upon &quot;professing
  a certain creed or adopting prescribed habits of life,&quot; his condemnation
  of private property in land, as ethically indefensible. They have their choice
  between intellectual incapacity and intellectual dishonesty. What local difference
  is there between a small island and a large island? between the exaction of
  rent in personal services and the exaction of rent in money? Is it ethically
  defensible to deny to men their birthright, to permit them to live on the earth
  only on condition that they shall give up for the privilege all that their
  labor can produce save the barest living, to reduce them to straits that compel
  their children to grow up in squalor and vice and degradation worse than any
  heathenism, and to pass out of life in thousands before they are fairly in
  it; yet ethically indefensible to compel them to profess a certain creed or
  adopt prescribed habits of living? Ought it not be clear even to a philosopher's
  apprentice that if English landlords to-day do not prescribe the creed or habits
  of their tenants, it is only because they do not care to, but prefer generally
  to exercise their power in taking money rent? If the Duke of Westminster wanted
  to have a thousand retainers, clad in his livery, follow him to St. James's;
  if the Duke of Norfolk cared to permit no one but Catholics to live on his
  estates; if the Duke of Argyll chose to have a buffoon at his elbow in cap
  and bells, they could have any of these things as readily, in fact even more
  readily, than could any Earl or Duke of the olden time. And so indeed could
  any of our great American landowners. Did Mr. Spencer never see in London newspapers
  offers of employment, conditioned on the profession of a certain creed? Did
  he never, in passing to and from the Athen&aelig;um Club, see coachmen and
  footmen dressed in fantastic liveries and &quot;sandwich men&quot; clad ridiculously
  and shamefully? Does he not know that in the British Isles in his own time
  men are driven off the land to give place to wild beasts or cattle? And does
  he not know that the power of forbidding the use of his land gives to every
  landowner the same powers of prescribing the conditions under which he will
  permit its use as any owner of the Scilly Isles possibly could have?</p>
<p> The view we thus get of Mr. Spencer's mental progress and processes is interesting
  both philosophically and psychologically. As, however, we shall find the lines
  of escape thus indicated amplified in <em>Justice</em>, there is no need of
  examining them now. But what he here says on the matter of compensation has
  a special
  interest, as throwing light on what he really meant in that incongruous passage
  in Section 9, Chapter IX., of <em>Social Statics</em>, of which I have spoken.
  In this letter to the <em>Times</em> the only passage from Social Statics that
  is quoted, or
  indeed more than vaguely alluded to, is this, That Mr. Spencer intends the
  <em>Times</em> and its readers to understand this as a recognition in <em>Social
  Statics</em>  of the justice of the claim of landowners to compensation for their land is
  clear, for he carefully leaves out all mention of the closely linked sentences
  that immediately follow the passage he quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">But with this perplexity and our extrication from it, abstract morality has
      no concern. Men having got themselves into the dilemma by disobedience to the
      law, must get out of it as well as they can; and with as little injury to the
      landed class as may be.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Meanwhile, we shall do well to recollect, that there are
      others besides the landed class to be considered. In our tender regard
      for the vested interests
      of the few, let us not forget that the rights of the many are in abeyance;
      and must remain so, as long as the earth is monopolized by individuals.
    Let
      us remember, too, that the injustice thus inflicted on the mass of mankind,
      is an injustice of the gravest in nature &#8230; inferior only in wickedness
      to the crime of taking away their lives or personal liberties.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> But while it is clear that Mr. Spencer wishes the <em>Times</em> and its readers
  to understand that he not only is, but always was, as good a compensationist
  as
  landlords could desire, he falls later on into an expression that again shows,
  as does the passage in <em>Political Institutions</em>, that the explanation I have
  put upon that seemingly <a href="PI_C2_The_Incongruous_Passage.htm">incongruous
  passage</a> in <em>Social Statics</em> is the one really
  intended. In the last part of the letter he speaks of &quot;<em>compensation
  for the artificial value given by cultivation</em> amounting to the <em>greater
  part</em> of
  its value.&quot; Not compensation for <em>land</em>, but compensation only for improvements.
  But this would never satisfy landowners, and so, without respect for the axiom
  that the whole is greater than its part, he proceeds to assert that compensation
  for this part will equal, and indeed exceed, the value of all they now get.</p>
<p> Thus we see both what the question of compensation had really been in Mr.
  Spencer's own mind, and how he now proposes to settle it, so that he may henceforward
  take the side of existing landlordism.</p>
