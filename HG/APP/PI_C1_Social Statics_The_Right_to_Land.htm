  <p>Our social edifice may be constructed with all possible labor and ingenuity,

    on <em>upright</em>    principles, it will assuredly tumble to pieces. &#8230; Not
    as adventitious, therefore, will the wise man regard the faith that is in
    him, not as something
    which may be slighted, and made subordinate to calculations of policy; but
    as the supreme authority to which all his actions should bend. The highest
    truth conceivable by him he will fearlessly utter; and will endeavor to
    get embodied in fact his purest idealisms: knowing that, let what may come
    of it,
    he is thus playing his appointed part in the world-knowing that, if he can
    get done the thing he aims at &#8212; well: if not &#8212; well also; though
    not so well. &#8212;</p>
  <p align="right"> &#8212; <em>Herbert Spencer, 1850</em>.<br />
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong>Chapter I &#8212;  <em>Social Statics</em> &#8212;The Right
    To Land</strong></p>
<p> In his first book, <em>Social Statics</em>, published in 1850, Mr. Spencer essayed
  to discover some fixed principle that might serve as a starting-point in political
  ethics and afford a surer guide than shifting notions of expediency or the
  vague formula of the greatest good to the greatest number. He found it in the
  principle that &quot;every man may claim the fullest liberty to exercise his
  faculties compatible with the possession of like liberty by every other man&quot;.
  Or, as he otherwise puts it, that &quot;every man has freedom to do all that
  he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.&quot;</p>
<p> The first deduction he makes from this &quot;first principle&quot; is the
  equal right to life and personal liberty, and the second, the equal right to
  the use of the earth.</p>
<p> This first deduction he treats briefly in Chapter VIII, &quot;The Rights
  of Life and Personal Liberty,&quot; saying, &quot;These are such evident corollaries
  from our first principle as scarcely to need a separate statement.&quot;</p>
<p> The second deduction, only next in importance to the rights to life and personal
  liberty, and indeed involved in them, he treats at length in a chapter which
  I give in full:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Chapter IX &#8212; The Right to the Use of the Earth</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 1. Given a race of beings having like claims to
      pursue the objects of their desires; given a world adapted to the gratification
      of those desires &#8212; a
    world into which such beings are similarly born &#8212; and it unavoidably
    follows that they have equal rights to the use of this world. For if each
    of them &quot;has
    freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom
    of any other,&quot; then each of them is free to use the earth for the satisfaction
    of his wants, provided he allows all others the same liberty. And conversely,
    it is manifest that no one, or part of them, may use the earth in such a
    way as to prevent the rest from similarly using it; seeing that to do this
    is to
    assume greater freedom than the rest, and consequently to break the law.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 2. Equity, therefore, does not permit property in
      land. For if one portion of the earth's surface may justly become the possession
      of an individual
    and may be held by him for his sole use and benefit as a thing to which he
    has an exclusive right, then other portions of the earth's surface may be
      so held; and eventually the whole of the earth's surface may be so held,
      and our
    planet may thus lapse altogether into private hands. Observe now the dilemma
    to which this leads. Supposing the entire habitable globe to be so enclosed,
    it follows that if the landowners have a valid right to its surface, all
      who are not landowners have no right at all to its surface. Hence, such
      can exist
    on the earth by sufferance only. They are all trespassers. Save by the permission
    of the lords of the soil, they can have no room for the soles of their feet.
    Nay, should the others think fit to deny them a resting place, these landless
    men might equitably be expelled from the earth altogether. If, then, the
      assumption that land can be held as property involves that the whole globe
      may become
    the private domain of a part of its inhabitants; and if, by consequence,
      the rest of its inhabitants can then exercise their faculties &#8211; can
      then exist even &#8211; only by consent of the landowners, it is manifest
      that an exclusive possession of the soil necessitates an infringement of
      the law of equal freedom.
    For men who cannot &quot;live and move and have their being&quot; without
    the leave of others cannot be equally free with those others.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 3. Passing from the consideration of the possible
      to that of the actual, we find yet further reason to deny the rectitude
      of property in land. It can
    never be pretended that the existing titles to such property are legitimate.
    Should anyone think so, let him look in the chronicles. Violence, fraud,
      the prerogative of force, the claims of superior cunning &#8211; these
      are the sources to which those titles may be traced. The original deeds
      were
      written
    with the
    sword rather than with the pen: not lawyers, but soldiers, were the conveyancers;
    blows were the current coin given in payment; and for seals, blood was used
    in preference to wax. Could valid claims be thus constituted? Hardly. And
    if not, what becomes of the pretensions of all subsequent holders of estates
    so
    obtained? Does sale or bequest generate a right where it did not previously
    exist? Would the original claimants be nonsuited at the bar of reason because
    the thing stolen from them had changed hands? Certainly not. And if one act
    of transfer can give no title, can many? No; though nothing be multiplied
    forever, it will not produce one. Even the law recognizes this principle.
    An existing
    holder must, if called upon, substantiate the claims of those from whom he
    purchased or inherited his property; and any flaw in the original parchment,
    even though the property should have had a score of intermediate owners,
    quashes his right.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;But Time,&quot; say some, &quot;is a great legalizer.
      Immemorial possession must be taken to constitute a legitimate claim. That
      which has been held from
    age to age as private property, and has been bought and sold as such, must
    now be considered as irrevocably belonging to individuals.&quot; To which
    proposition a willing assent shall be given when its propounders can assign
    it a definite
    meaning. To do this, however, they must find satisfactory answers to such
    questions as: How long does it take for what was originally a wrong to grow
    into a right?
    At what rate per annum do invalid claims become valid? If a title gets perfect
    in a thousand years, how much more than perfect will it be in two thousand
    years? &#8211; and so forth. For the solution of which they will require
    a new calculus.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Whether it may be expedient to admit claims of certain standing is not the
    point. We have here nothing to do with considerations of conventional privilege
    or legislative convenience. We have simply to inquire what is the verdict given
    by pure equity in the matter. And this verdict enjoins a protest against every
    existing pretension to the individual possession of the soil, and dictates
    the assertion that the right of mankind at large to the earth's surface is
    still valid, all deeds, customs, and laws notwithstanding.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 4. Not only have present land tenures an indefensible
      origin, but it is impossible to discover any mode in which land can become
      private
    property. Cultivation is commonly considered to give a legitimate title.
    He who has reclaimed
      a tract of land from its primitive wildness is supposed to have thereby
    made it his own. But if his right is disputed, by what system of logic can
    he vindicate
      it? Let us listen a moment to his pleadings.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Hallo, you, sir,&quot; cries the cosmopolite to some backwoodsman smoking
    at the door of his shanty, &quot;by what authority do you take possession
    of these acres that you have cleared, round which you have put up a snake
    fence
    and on which you have built this log house?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;By what authority? I squatted here because there
      was no one to say nay &#8211; because I was as much at liberty to do so
      as any other man. Besides, now that I have cut down the wood and plowed
      and cropped the ground, this
    farm is more mine than yours or anybody's, and I mean to keep it.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Ay, so you all say. But I do not yet see how you
      have substantiated your claim. When you came here you found the land producing
      trees &#8211; sugar
    maples, perhaps; or maybe it was covered with prairie grass and wild strawberries.
    Well, instead of these you made it yield wheat, or maize, or tobacco. Now
    I want to understand how, by exterminating one set of plants and making the
    soil
    bear another set in their place, you have constituted yourself lord of this
    soil for all succeeding time.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Oh, those natural products which I destroyed were
      of little or no use; whereas I caused the earth to bring forth things good
      for food &#8211; things
    that help to give life and happiness.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Still you have not shown why such a process makes
      the portion of earth you have so modified yours. What is it that you have
      done? You have
    turned
      over the soil to a few inches in depth with a spade or a plow; you have
    scattered over this prepared surface a few seeds; and you have gathered the
    fruits which
      the sun, rain, and air helped the soil to produce. Just tell me, if you
    please, by what magic have these acts made you sole owner of that vast mass
    of matter,
      having for its base the surface of your estate and for its apex the center
      of the globe? All of which it appears you would monopolize to yourself
    and your descendants forever.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Well, if it isn't mine, whose is it? I have dispossessed
      nobody. When I crossed the Mississippi yonder I found nothing but the silent
      woods. If someone
    else had settled here and made this clearing, he would have had as good a
      right to the location as I have. I have done nothing but what any other
      person was
    at liberty to do had he come before me. While they were unreclaimed, these
    lands belonged to all men &#8211; as much to one as to another &#8211; and
    they are now mine simply because I was the first to discover and improve
    them.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;You say truly when you say that 'while they were
      unreclaimed these lands belonged to all men.' And it is my duty to tell
      you that they belong
    to all men still, and that your 'improvements,' as you call them, cannot
      vitiate the claim of all men. You may plow and harrow, and sow and reap;
      you may turn
    over the soil as often as you like; but all your manipulations will fail
      to make that soil yours, which was not yours to begin with. Let me put
      a case.
    Suppose now that in the course of your wanderings you come upon an empty
      house, which in spite of its dilapidated state takes your fancy; suppose
      that with
    the intention of making it your abode you expend much time and trouble in
      repairing it &#8211; that you paint and paper and whitewash, and at considerable
      cost bring it into a habitable state. Suppose further that on some fatal
      day a
    stranger
    is announced who turns out to be the heir to whom this house has been bequeathed,
    and that this professed heir is prepared with all the necessary proofs of
    his identity; what becomes of your improvements? Do they give you a valid
    title
    to the house? Do they quash the title of the original claimant?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;No.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Neither, then, do your pioneering operations give
      you a valid title to this land. Neither do they quash the title of its
      original claimants &#8211; the
    human race. The world is God's bequest to mankind. All men are joint heirs
    to it; you among the number. And because you have taken up your residence
      on a certain part of it and have subdued, cultivated, beautified that part &#8211; improved
    it, as you say &#8211; you are not therefore warranted in appropriating it
    as entirely private property. At least if you do so, you may at any moment
    be
    justly expelled by the lawful owner &#8211; Society.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Well, but surely you would not eject me without making
      some recompense for the great additional value I have given to this tract,
      by reducing
    what was a wilderness into fertile fields. You would not turn me adrift and
    deprive
      me of all the benefit of those years of toil it has cost me to bring this
    spot into its present state.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Of course not; just as in the case of the house,
      you would have an equitable title to compensation from the proprietor for
      repairs and new
    fittings, so the community cannot justly take possession of this estate without
    paying
      for all that you have done to it. This extra worth which your labor has
    imparted to it is fairly yours; and although you have, without leave, busied
    yourself
      in bettering what belongs to the community, yet no doubt the community
    will duly discharge your claim. But admitting this is quite a different thing
    from
      recognizing your right to the land itself. It may be true that you are
    entitled to compensation for the improvements this enclosure has received
    at your hands;
      and at the same time it may be equally true that no act, form, proceeding,
      or ceremony can make this enclosure your private property.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 5. It does indeed at first sight seem possible for the earth to become
    the exclusive possession of individuals by some process of equitable distribution. &quot;Why,&quot; it
    may be asked, &quot;should not men agree to a fair subdivision? If all are
    co-heirs, why may not the estate be equally apportioned and each be afterward
    perfect master of his own share?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> To this question it may in the first place be replied that
      such a division is vetoed by the difficulty of fixing the values of respective
      tracts of
    land. Variations in productiveness, different degrees of accessibility, advantages
      of climate, proximity to the centers of civilization &#8211; these and
      other such considerations remove the problem out of the sphere of mere
      mensuration
      into the region of impossibility.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> But, waiving this, let us inquire who are to be the allottees.
      Shall adult males and all who have reached twenty-one on a specified day
      be the fortunate
    individuals? If so, what is to be done with those who come of age on the
    morrow? Is it proposed that each man, woman, and child shall have a section?
    If so,
    what becomes of all who are to be born next year? And what will be the fate
    of those whose fathers sell their estates and squander the proceeds? These
    portionless ones must constitute a class already described as having no right
    to a resting place on earth &#8211; as living by the sufferance of their
    fellow men &#8211; as being practically serfs. And the existence of such
    a class is wholly at variance with the law of equal freedom.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Until, therefore, we can produce a valid commission authorizing us to make
    this distribution, until it can be proved that God has given one charter of
    privileges to one generation and another to the next, until we can demonstrate
    that men born after a certain date are doomed to slavery, we must consider
    that no such allotment is permissible.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 6. Probably some will regard the difficulties inseparable
      from individual ownership of the soil as caused by pushing to excess a
      doctrine applicable
    only within rational limits. This is a very favorite style of thinking with
    some. There are people who hate anything in the shape of exact conclusions,
    and these are of them. According to such, the right is never in either extreme,
    but always halfway between the extremes. They are continually trying to reconcile
    Yes and No. Ifs and buts and excepts are their delight. They have so great
    a faith in &quot;the judicious mean&quot; that they would scarcely believe
    an oracle if it uttered a full-length principle. Were you to inquire of them
    whether the earth turns on its axis from east to west or from west to east,
    you might almost expect the reply, &quot;A little of both,&quot; or &quot;Not
    exactly either.&quot; It is doubtful whether they would assent to the axiom
    that the whole is greater than its part, without making some qualification.
    They have a passion for compromises. To meet their taste, Truth must always
    be spiced with a little Error. They cannot conceive of a pure, definite,
    entire, and unlimited law. And hence, in discussions like the present, they
    are constantly
    petitioning for limitations &#8211; always wishing to Abate and modify and
    moderate &#8211; ever
    protesting against doctrines being pursued to their ultimate consequences.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> But it behooves such to recollect that ethical truth is as exact and as peremptory
    as physical truth, and that in this matter of land tenure the verdict of morality
    must be distinctly yea or nay. Either men have a right to make the soil private
    property or they have not. There is no medium. We must choose one of the two
    positions. There can be no half-and-half opinion. In the nature of things the
    fact must be either one way or the other.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> If men have not such a right, we are at once delivered
      from the several predicaments already pointed out. If they have such a
      right, then is that
    right absolute,
    sacred, not on any pretense to be violated. If they have such a right, then
    is his Grace of Leeds justified in warning off tourists from Ben Mac Dhui,
    the Duke of Atholl in closing Glen Tilt, the Duke of Buccleugh in denying
    sites to the Free Church, and the Duke of Sutherland in banishing the Highlanders
    to make room for sheep walks. If they have such a right, then it would be
    proper
    for the sole proprietor of any kingdom &#8211; a Jersey or Guernsey, for
    example to impose just what regulations he might choose on its inhabitants &#8211; to
    tell them that they should not live on his property unless they professed
    a certain religion, spoke a particular language, paid him a specified reverence,
    adopted an authorized dress, and conformed to all other conditions he might
    see fit to make. If they have such a right, then is there truth in that tenet
    of the ultra-Tory school, that the landowners are the only legitimate rulers
    of a country &#8211; that the people at large remain in it only by the landowner's
    permission and ought consequently to submit to the landowners' rule and respect
    whatever institutions the landowners set up. There is no escape from these
    inferences. They are necessary corollaries to the theory that the earth can
    become individual property. And they can be repudiated only by denying that
    theory.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 7. After all, nobody does implicitly believe in
      landlordism. We hear of estates being held under the king &#8211; that
      is, the State &#8211; or of their
    being kept in trust for the public benefit; and not that they are the inalienable
    possessions of their nominal owners. Moreover, we daily deny landlordism
      by our legislation. Is a canal, a railway, or a turnpike road to be made,
      we do
    not scruple to seize just as many acres as may be requisite, allowing the
      holders compensation for the capital invested. We do not wait for consent.
      An act of
    Parliament supersedes the authority of title deeds and serves proprietors
      with notices to quit, whether they will or not. Either this is equitable
      or it is
    not. Either the public are free to resume as much of the earth's surface
      as they think fit, or the titles of the landowners must be considered absolute,
    and all national works must be postponed until lords and squires please to
    part with the requisite slices of their estates. If we decide that the claims
    of individual ownership must give way, then we imply that the right of the
    nation at large to the soil is supreme; that the right of private possession
    exists only by general consent; that general consent being withdrawn, it
      ceases &#8211; or,
    in other words, that it is no right at all.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 8. &quot;But to what does this doctrine, that men
      are equally entitled to the use of the earth, lead? Must we return to the
      times of unenclosed wilds
    and subsist on roots, berries, and game? Or are we to be left to the management
    of Messrs. Fourrier, Owen, Louis Blanc, and Co.?&quot; Neither. Such a doctrine
    is consistent with the highest state of civilization; may be carried out
    without involving a community of goods; and need cause no very serious revolution
    in
    existing arrangements. The change required would simply be a change of landlords.
    Separate ownerships would merge into the joint-stock ownership of the public.
    Instead of being in the possession of individuals, the country would be held
    by the great corporate body &#8211; Society. Instead of leasing his acres
    from an isolated proprietor, the farmer would lease them from the nation.
    Instead
    of paying his rent to the agent of Sir John or His Grace, he would pay it
    to an agent or deputy agent of the community. Stewards would be public officials
    instead of private ones, and tenancy the only land tenure.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> A state of things so ordered would be in perfect harmony
      with the moral law. Under it all men would be equally landlords; all men
      would be alike
    free to
    become tenants. A, B, C, and the rest might compete for a vacant farm as
    now, and one of them might take that farm, without in any way violating the
    principles
    of pure equity. All would be equally free to bid; all would be equally free
    to refrain. And when the farm had been let to A, B, or C, all parties would
    have done that which they willed &#8211; the one in choosing to pay a given
    sum to his fellow men for the use of certain lands&#8211;the others in refusing
    to pay that sum. Clearly, therefore, on such a system, the earth might be
    enclosed, occupied, and cultivated in entire subordination to the law of
    equal freedom.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 9. No doubt great difficulties must attend the resumption,
      by mankind at large, of their rights to the soil. The question of compensation
      to existing
    proprietors is a complicated one &#8211; one that perhaps cannot be settled
    in a strictly equitable manner. Had we to deal with the parties who originally
    robbed the human race of its heritage, we might make short work of the matter.
    But, unfortunately, most of our present landowners are men who have, either
    mediately or immediately &#8211; either by their own acts or by the acts
    of their ancestors &#8211; given for their estates equivalents of honestly
    earned wealth, believing that they were investing their savings in a legitimate
    manner.
    To estimate justly and liquidate the claims of such is one of the most intricate
    problems society will one day have to solve. But with this perplexity and
    our
    extrication from it, abstract morality has no concern. Men, having got themselves
    into the dilemma by disobedience to the law, must get out of it as well as
    they can, and with as little injury to the landed class as may be.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Meanwhile, we shall do well to recollect that there are
      others besides the landed class to be considered. In our tender regard
      for the vested interests
    of the few, let us not forget that the rights of the many are in abeyance,
    and must remain so, as long as the earth is monopolized by individuals. Let
    us remember, too, that the injustice thus inflicted on the mass of mankind
    is an injustice of the gravest nature. The fact that it is not so regarded
    proves nothing. In early phases of civilization even homicide is thought
    lightly
    of. The suttees of India, together with the practice elsewhere followed of
    sacrificing a hecatomb of human victims at the burial of a chief, shows this;
    and probably cannibals consider the slaughter of those whom &quot;the fortune
    of war&quot; has made their prisoners perfectly justifiable. It was once
    also universally supposed that slavery was a natural and quite legitimate
    institution &#8211; a
    condition into which some were born and to which they ought to submit as
    to a Divine ordination; nay, indeed, a great proportion of mankind hold this
    opinion
    still. A higher social development, however, has generated in us a better
    faith, and we now to a considerable extent recognize the claims of humanity.
    But our
    civilization is only initial. It may by and by be perceived that Equity utters
    dictates to which we have not yet listened; and men may then learn that to
    deprive others of their rights to the use of the earth is to commit a crime
    inferior only in wickedness to the crime of taking away their lives or personal
    liberties.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 10. Briefly reviewing the argument, we see that
      the right of each man to the use of the earth, limited only by the like
      rights of his fellow
      men, is immediately deducible from the law of equal freedom. We see that
    the maintenance of this right necessarily forbids private property in land.
    On
      examination, all existing titles to such property turn out to be invalid;
    those founded on reclamation, inclusive. It appears that not even an apportionment
      of the earth among its inhabitants could generate a legitimate proprietorship.
      We find that if pushed to its ultimate consequences a claim to exclusive
    possession
      of the soil involves a landowning despotism. We further find that such
    a claim is constantly denied by the enactments of our legislature. And we
    find lastly
      that the theory of the co-heirship of all men to the soil is consistent
    with the highest civilization, and that, however difficult it may be to embody
    that
      theory in fact, Equity sternly commands it to be done.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Briefly stated, the argument of this chapter is &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 1. The equal right of all men to the use of land springs from the fact of
    their existence in a world adapted to their needs, and into which they are
    similarly born.</p>
  <p> 2. Equity, therefore, does not permit private property in land, since that
    would involve the right of some to deny to others the use of land.</p>
  <p> 3. Private property in land, as at present existing, can show no original
    title valid in justice, and such validity cannot be gained either by sale or
    bequest, or by peaceable possession during any length of time.</p>
  <p> 4. Nor is there any mode by which land can justly become private property.
    Cultivation and improvement can give title only to their results, not to the
    land itself.</p>
  <p> 5. Nor could an equitable division of land with the consent of all, even
    if it were not impossible that such a division could be made, give valid title
    to private property in land. For the equal right to the use of land would attach
    to all those thereafter born, irrespective of any agreement made by their predecessors.</p>
  <p> 6. There can be no modification of this dictate of equity. Either all men
    have equal rights to the use of the land, or some men have the just right to
    enslave others and deprive them of life.</p>
  <p> 7. As a matter of fact, nobody does really believe in private property in
    land. An Act of Parliament, even now, supersedes title-deeds. That is to say,
    the right of private ownership in land exists only by general consent; that
    being withdrawn, it ceases.</p>
  <p> 8. But the doctrine that all men are equally entitled to the use of land
    does not involve communism or socialism, and need cause no serious change in
    existing arrangements. It is not necessary that the state should manage land:
    it is only necessary that rent, instead of going, as now, to individuals, should
    be taken by society for common purposes.</p>
  <p> 9. There may be difficulty in justly liquidating the claims of existing landowners,
    but men having got themselves into a dilemma must get out of it as well as
    they can. The landed class are not alone to be considered. So long as the treatment
    of land as private property continues, the masses suffer from an injustice
    only inferior in wickedness to depriving them of life or personal liberty.</p>
  <p> 10. However difficult it may be to embody in fact the theory of the co-heirship
    of all men to the soil, equity sternly demands it to be done.</p>
