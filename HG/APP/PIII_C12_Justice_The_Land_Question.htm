      <p><strong>Chapter XII &#8212; <em>Justice</em>&#8212;&quot;The Land Question&quot;</strong>
          </p>
    </div>
    <p> While <em>Justice</em> shows no decadence of intellectual power, and those who have
  seen the utterances of a great thinker in preceding volumes of the Synthetic
  Philosophy will doubtless have as high an opinion of this, there is in it everywhere,
  as compared with <em>Social Statics</em>, the evidence of moral decadence, and of that
  perplexity which is the penalty of deliberate sacrifice of intellectual honesty.
  But it were wearying, and for our purpose needless, to review the subsequent
  chapters of <em>Justice</em>, and to show the contradictions and confusions into which
  Mr. Spencer falls at every turn,25 and the manner in which he recants his previously
  expressed opinions on such subjects as the political rights of women, and even
  the equal political rights of men. To complete the examination of that cross-section
  of his teachings which in the beginning I proposed, let us proceed to the consideration
  of his very last word on the land question, the note to which he refers the
  reader at the close of the chapter on 'The Rights to the Uses of Natural Media.'</p>
<p> This note is to be found among the appendices to <em>Justice</em>, which consist of
  Appendix A, &quot;The Kantian Idea of Rights,&quot; before referred to (-Chapter
  IX-); Appendix B, &quot;The Land Question&quot;; Appendix C, &quot;The Moral
  Motive,&quot; a reply to a criticism by the Rev. J. Llewellyn Davis; and Appendix
  D, &quot;Conscience in Animals,&quot; which is a collection of dog stories.</p>
<p> The idea that for the genesis of all there is in man, even his moral perceptions,
  we must look down, not up, permeates the Synthetic Philosophy, seeking to obliterate
  the gulf between man and other animals by greedily swallowing every traveler's
  tale that tends to degrade man and every wonder-monger's story that ascribes
  human faculties to brutes. Thus <em>Justice</em> begins with &quot;Animal Ethics&quot; and
  ends with dog stories, the appendix devoted to them being twice as large as
  that devoted to &quot;The Land Question&quot; and illustrated with diagrams.<font size="-1"><strong><em>26</em></strong></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">26 The dog stories which close this crowning book of the Synthetic Philosophy
      are sent to Mr. Spencer by Mr. T. Mann Jones, of Devon, with this introduction:<br>
&quot;DEAR Sir: The following careful observations on animals other than man,
may be of interest to you as supporting your idea that the idea of 'duty' or
'ought'
      (owe it) may be of 'non-supernatural' origin. 'Supernatural' is used in
the usual sense, without committing the writer to any opinion.&quot;<br>
These &quot;careful observations&quot; are indorsed by Mr. Spencer as highly
      remarkable and instructive, and as supporting his own conclusion, and he
      tells us, apparently on the faith of them, that Mr. Jones is a careful,
      critical
      and trustworthy observer. To give a sample, here is one of the observations,
      which as it has no diagrams, I may quote as printed:<br>
&quot;The 'ought' may be established as an obligation to a higher mind in opposition
      to the promptings of the strongest feelings of the animal; e.g.&#8212;<br>
&quot;A bitch I had many years ago showed great pleasure at the attentions of
male dogs, when in season. I checked her repeatedly, by voice only. This set
up
      the 'ought' so thoroughly, that though never tied up at such times, she
died a virgin at thirteen and a half years old.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> These dog stories are, however, fit companions to the savage stories with
  which, by the assistance of a corps of readers, the volumes of the Synthetic
  Philosophy are profusely embellished. The wooden literalness with which, to
  suit himself, Mr. Spencer interprets the imagery and metaphor of which the
  language of all peoples who come close to nature is full, is perhaps the most
  comical thing in this unconsciously comic collection. I hesitate to give an
  instance, such is the embarrassment of riches; but here, to quote at random,
  is one. It is from the chapter on 'The Religious Idea' in Principles of Sociology.
  Mr. Spencer has been showing to his own satisfaction, and doubtless to that
  of the gentlemen who regard him as greater than Aristotle, how from the adoption
  of such family names as Wolf, and the habit of speaking of a strong man as &quot;a
  bear,&quot; the less civilized peoples, whom he generically lumps as &quot;savages,&quot; have
  come to believe that their ancestors passed into animals. He goes on to show &quot;how
  naturally the identification of stars with persons may occur.&quot; Recalling
  first, what he declares to be &quot;the belief of some North Americans that
  the brighter stars in the Milky Way are camp-fires made by the dead on their
  way to the other world,&quot; this is the fashion in which he does it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">When a sportsman, hearing a shot in the adjacent wood,
      exclaims, &quot;That's
      Jones!&quot; he is not supposed to mean that Jones is the sound; he is known
      to mean that Jones made the sound. But when a savage, pointing to a particular
      star originally thought of as the camp-fire of such or such a departed man,
      says, &quot;There he is,&quot; the children he is instructing naturally suppose
      him to mean that the star itself is the departed man; especially when receiving
      the statement through an undeveloped language.&#8212;Principles of Sociology,
      Vol. II, p. 685.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> &quot;Lo, the poor Indian!&quot;</p>
<p> What would happen to the beliefs of savage children if their undeveloped
  language enabled them to receive such information as is often conveyed through
  our developed language &#8212; such, for instance, as &quot;She's a daisy!&quot; or &quot;He's
  a brick!&quot; or &quot;You would have to use a pickaxe to get a joke through
  his head&quot;?</p>
<p> But I am keeping the reader from &quot;The Land Question.&quot; This is,
  for our purpose at least, the most important utterance of what its author deems
  the most important book of the great Synthetic Evolutionary Philosophy &#8212; a
  book that begins with &quot;Animal Ethics,&quot; and ends with dog stories.
  I quote this appendix in full:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">APPENDIX B &#8212; THE LAND QUESTION</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> The course of Nature, &quot;red in tooth and claw,&quot; has been, on a higher
      plane, the course of civilization. Through &quot;blood and iron&quot; small
      clusters of men have been consolidated into larger ones, and these again
      into still larger ones, until nations have been formed. This process, carried
      on
      everywhere and always by brute force, has resulted in a history of wrongs
      upon wrongs: savage tribes have been slowly welded together by savage means.
      We
      could not, if we tried, trace back the acts of unscrupulous violence committed
      during these thousands of years; and could we trace them back we could
      not rectify their evil results.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Landownership was established during this process; and
      if the genesis of landownership was full of iniquities, they were iniquities
      committed not by
      the ancestors of any one class of existing men but by the ancestors of
      all existing men. The remote forefathers of living Englishmen were robbers,
      who
      stole the lands of men who were themselves robbers, who behaved in like
      manner to the robbers who preceded them. The usurpation by the Normans,
      here complete
      and there partial, was of lands which, centuries before, had been seized,
      some by piratical Danes and Norsemen, and some at an earlier time by hordes
      of invading
      Frisians or old English. And then the Celtic owners, expelled or enslaved
      by these had in bygone ages themselves expropriated the people who lived
      in the
      underground houses here and there still traceable. What would happen if
      we tried to restore lands inequitably taken if Normans had to give them
      back to
      Danes and Norse and Frisians, and these again to Celts, and these again
      to the men who lived in caves and used flint implements? The only imaginable
      form
      of the transaction would be a restoration of Great Britain bodily to the
      Welsh and the Highlanders; and if the Welsh and the Highlanders did not
      make a kindred
      restoration, it could only be on the ground that, having not only taken
      the land of the aborigines but killed them, they had thus justified their
      ownership!</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> The wish now expressed by many that landownership should
      be conformed to the requirements of pure equity, is in itself commendable;
      and is in some men
      prompted by conscientious feeling. One would, however, like to hear from
      such the demand that not only here but in the various regions we are peopling,
      the
      requirements of pure equity should be conformed to. As it is, the indignation
      against wrongful appropriations of land, made in the past at home, is not
      accompanied by any indignation against the more wrongful appropriations
      made at present
      abroad. Alike as holders of the predominant political power and as furnishing
      the rank and file of our armies, the masses of the people are responsible
      for those nefarious doings all over the world which end in the seizing
      of new territories
      and expropriation of their inhabitants. </font><font size="-1">The filibustering
      expeditions of the old English are repeated, on a vastly larger scale,
      in the filibustering expeditions of the new English.
      Yet
    those who execrate ancient usurpations utter no word of protest against these
    far
      greater modern usurpations &#8212; nay, are aiders and abetters in them.
      Remaining as they do passive and silent while there is going on this universal
      land-grabbing
      which their votes could stop; and supplying as they do the soldiers who
      effect it; they are responsible for it. By deputy they are committing in
      this matter
      grosser and more numerous injustices than were committed against their
      forefathers.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> That the masses of landless men should regard private landownership
      as having been wrongfully established, is natural and, as we have seen,
      they
    are not
      without warrant. But if we entertain the thought of rectification, there
    arises in the first place the question &#8212; Which are the wronged and
    which are the wrongers? Passing over the primary fact that the ancestors
    of existing
    Englishmen,
      landed and landless, were, as a body, men who took the land by violence
    from previous owners; and thinking only of the force and fraud by which certain
      of these ancestors obtained possession of the land while others of them
    lost
      possession; the preliminary question is &#8212; Which are the descendants
      of the one and of the other? It is tacitly assumed that those who now own
      lands
      are the posterity of the usurpers, and that those who now have no lands
      are the posterity of those who lands were usurped. But this is far from
      being the
      case. The fact that among the nobility there are very few whose titles
      go back to the days when the last usurpations took place, and none to the
      days when
      there took place the original usurpations; joined with the fact that among
      existing landowners there are many whose names imply artisan ancestors;
      show that we have not now to deal with descendants of those who unjustly
      appropriated
      the land. While, conversely, the numbers of the landless whose names prove
      that their forefathers belonged to the higher ranks (numbers which must
      be doubled to take account of intermarriages with female descendents) show
      that
      among those who are now without land, many inherit the blood of the land-usurpers.
      Hence, that bitter feeling toward the landed which contemplation of the
      past generates in many of the landless, is in great measure misplaced.
      They are
      themselves to a considerable extent descendants of the sinners; while those
      they scowl at are to a considerable extent descendants of the sinned-against.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> But granting all that is said about past iniquities, and
      leaving aside all other obstacles in the way of an equitable arrangement,
      there is an obstacle
      which seems to have been overlooked. Even supposing that the English as
    a race
      gained possession of the land equitably, which they did not; and even supposing
      that existing landowners are the posterity of those who spoiled their fellows,
      which in large part they are not; and even supposing that the existing
    landless are the posterity of the despoiled, which in large part they are
    not; there
      would still have to be recognized a transaction that goes far to prevent
    rectification of injustices. If we are to go back upon the past at all, we
    must go back upon
      the past wholly, and take account not only of that which the people at
    large have lost by private appropriation of land, but also that which they
    have received
      in the form of a share of the returns &#8212; we must take account, that
      is, of Poor-Law relief. Mr. T. Mackay, author of The English Poor, has
      kindly furnished
      me with the following memoranda, showing something like the total amount
      of this since the 43d Elizabeth (1601) in England and Wales.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Sir G. Nicholls (History of Poor Law, appendix to
      Vol. II) ventures no estimate till 1688. At that date he puts the poor
      rate at nearly &pound;700,000
      a year. Till the beginning of this century the amounts are based more or
      less on estimate.<br />
        <br />
        1601-1630. say 3 millions.<br />
        1631-1700. (1688 Nicholls puts at 700,000.) 30 &quot;<br />
        1701-1720. (1701 Nicholls puts at 900,000.) 20 &quot;<br />
        1721-1760. 1760 Nicholls says 11 millions.) 40 &quot;<br />
        1761-1775. (17 75 put at 11 millions.) 22 &quot;<br />
        1776-1800. (1784 2 millions.) 50 &quot;<br />
        1801-1812. (1803 4 millions; 1813 6 millions.) 65 &quot;<br />
        1813-1840. (based on exact figures given by Sir G. Nicholls.) 170 &quot;<br />
        1841-1890. (based on Mulhall's Diet. of Statistics and Statistical Abstract.)
        334 &quot;<br />
        734 millions&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> The above represents the amount expended in relief of the
      poor. Under the general term &quot;poor-rate,&quot; moneys have always
      been collected for other purposes &#8212; county, borough, police rates,
      etc. The following table shows the annual amounts of these in connection
      with the annual amounts
      expended

      <br />
        </font><font size="-1">In addition, therefore, to sums set out in the first table, there is a further
      sum, rising during the century from 11 to 71 millions per annum, 'for other
      purposes.'</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Mulhall, on whom I relied for figures between 1853
      and 1875, does not give 'other expenditure'.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Of course of the &pound;734,000,000 given to the poorer
      members of the landless class during three centuries, a part has arisen
      from rates on houses; only
      such portion of which as is chargeable against ground-rents, being rightly
      included in the sum the land has contributed. From a landowner, who is
      at the same time a Queen's Counsel, frequently employed professionally
      to arbitrate
      in questions of local taxation, I have received the opinion that if, out
      of the total sum received by the poor, &pound;500,000,000 is credited to
      the land, this will be an underestimate. Thus even if we ignore the fact
      that this amount,
      gradually contributed, would, if otherwise gradually invested, have yielded
      in returns of one or other kind a far larger sum, it is manifest that against
      the claim of the landless may be set off a large claim of the landed &#8212; perhaps
      a larger claim.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> For now observe that the landless have not an equitable
      claim to the land in its present state cleared, drained, fenced, fertilized,
      and furnished
    with farm-buildings, etc. &#8212; but only to the land in its primitive state,
    here stony and there marshy, covered with forest, gorse, heather, etc.; this
    only,
      it is, which belongs to the community. Hence, therefore, the question arises &#8212; What
      is the relation between the original &quot;prairie value&quot; of the land,
      and the amount which the poorer among the landless have received during
      these three centuries? Probably the landowners would contend that for the
      land in
      its primitive, unsubdued state, furnishing nothing but wild animals and
      wild fruits, &pound;500,000,000 would be a high price.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> When, in <em>Social Statics</em>, published in 1850, I
      drew from the law of equal freedom the corollary that the land could not
      equitably
      be alienated from
    the community, and argued that, after compensating its existing holders,
    it should
      be reappropriated by the community, I overlooked the foregoing considerations.
      Moreover, I did not clearly see what would be implied by the giving of
    compensation for all that value which the labor of ages has given to the
    land. While, as
      shown in Chapter Xl, I adhere to the inference originally drawn, that the
    aggregate of men forming the community are the supreme owners of the land &#8212; an
    inference harmonizing with legal doctrine and daily acted upon in legislation &#8212; a
      fuller consideration of the matter has led me to the conclusion that individual
      ownership, subject to state suzerainty, should be maintained.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Even were it possible to rectify the inequitable doings which have gone on
      during past thousands of years, and by some balancing of claims and counter-claims,
      past and present, to make a rearrangement equitable in the abstract, the resulting
      state of things would be a less desirable one than the present. Setting aside
      all financial objections to nationalization (which of themselves negative the
      transaction, since, if equitably effected, it would be a losing one), it suffices
      to remember the inferiority of public administration to private administration,
      to see that ownership by the state would work ill. Under the existing system
      of ownership, those who manage the land, experience a direct connection between
      effort and benefit; while, were it under state ownership, those who managed
      it would experience no such direct connection. The vices of officialism would
      inevitably entail immense evils.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Was ever philosopher so perplexed before?</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer started out in 1850 to tell us what are our rights to land. And,
  excepting that he fell into some confusion by carelessly transforming equal
  rights into joint rights, he clearly did so. But now, in 1892, and in the climax
  of the Spencerian Synthetic Philosophy, he has got himself into a maze, in
  which the living and the dead &#8212; Normans, Danes, Norsemen, Frisians, Celts,
  Saxons, Welsh, and Highlanders; old English and new English; plebeians with
  aristocratic names, and aristocrats with plebeian names, and female descendants
  who have changed their names; ancient filibusters and modern filibusters &#8212; are
  all so whirling round that, in sheer despair, he springs for guidance to &quot;a
  landowner who is at the same time a Queen's Counsel,&quot; and is led by him
  plump into the English poor law and a long array of figures.</p>
<p> Yet, in the mad whirl he still pretends to consistency. &quot;I adhere,&quot; he
  says, &quot;to the inference originally drawn, that the aggregate of men forming
  the community are the supreme owners of the land.&quot;</p>
<p> Here is that inference in his own words &#8212; the inference originally
  drawn in <em>Social Statics</em>:</p>
<p> Given a race of beings having like claims to pursue the objects of their
  desires &#8212; given a world adapted to the gratification of those desires &#8212; a
  world into which such beings are similarly born, and it unavoidably follows
  that they have equal rights to the use of this world &#8230; Equity, therefore,
  does not permit property in land &#8230; The right of mankind at large to the
  earth's surface is still valid; all deeds, customs, and laws notwithstanding.</p>
<p> What is it that Mr. Spencer here asserts? Not that men derive their rights
  to the use of the earth by gift, bequest or inheritance, from their ancestors,
  or from any previous men, but that they derive them from the fact of their
  own existence. Who lived on the earth before them, or what such predecessors
  did, has nothing whatever to do with the matter. The equal right to the use
  of land belongs to each man as man. It begins with his birth; it continues
  till his death. It can be destroyed or superseded by no human action whatever.</p>
<p> And this is the ground on which, without exception, stand all who demand
  the resumption of equal rights to land. Where there has been any reference
  on their part to the wrongfulness of past appropriations of land, it has merely
  been &#8212; as in the case of Mr. Spencer himself in <em>Social Statics </em>&#8212; by
  way of illustrating the origin of private property in land, not by way of basing
  the demand for the rights of living men on the proof of wrongs done to dead
  men.27 Neither Mr. Spencer in his &quot;straight&quot; days, nor any one else
  who has stood for equal rights in land, ever dreamed of such a stultifying
  proposition as that the right to the use of land must be drawn from some dispossessed
  generation, for this would be to assert what he so ridiculed, that &quot;God
  has given one charter of privilege to one generation and another to the next.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="-1"><strong>27</strong> I, for instance, have uniformly asserted that it made no difference whatever
            whether land has been made private property by force or by consent; that the
            equal right to its use is a natural and inalienable right of the living, and
            that this is the ground, and the only ground, on which the resumption of those
        rights should be demanded. Thus in <em>The Irish Land Question</em>, in 1881, I said:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The indictment which really lies against the Irish landlords is not that
      their ancestors or the ancestors of their grantors robbed the ancestors of the
      Irish
                people. That makes no difference. 'Let the dead bury their dead.' The
      indictment that truly lies is, that here and now, they rob the Irish people &#8230; The
                greatest enemy of the people's cause is he who appeals to national
      passions and excites old hatreds. He is its best friend who does his utmost
      to bury
            them out of sight.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> Yet, now, this same Herbert Spencer actually assumes that the only question
  of moral right as to land is, who robbed whom, in days whereof the very memory
  has perished, and when, according to him, everybody was engaged in robbing
  everybody else. He not only eats his own words, denies his own perceptions,
  and endeavors to confuse the truth he once bore witness to, but he assumes
  that the whole great movement for the recognition of equal rights to land,
  that is beginning to show its force wherever the English tongue is spoken,
  has for its object only rectification of past injustices &#8212; the ridiculous
  search, in which he pretends to engage, as to what ancestor robbed what ancestor &#8212; and
  that until that is discovered, those who now hold as their private property
  the inalienable heritage of all may hold it still. And in the course of this &quot;argument,&quot; this
  advocate of the rich against the poor, of the strong against the weak, declares
  that the toiling masses of England, made ignorant and brutal and powerless
  by their disinheritance, have lost their natural rights by serving as food
  for powder and payers of taxes in foreign wars waged by the ruling classes.</p>
<p> This is bad enough; but more follows. Mr. Spencer discovers a new meaning
  in the English poor laws.</p>
<p> In <em>Social Statics</em>, be it remembered, he declared that the equal right to
  the use of land is the natural, direct, inalienable right of all men, having
  its derivation in the fact of their existence, and of which they can in no
  possible way be equitably deprived. He declared, that equity does not permit
  private property in land, and that it is impossible to discover any mode by
  which land can become private property. He scouted the idea that force can
  give right, or that sale or bequest or prescription can make invalid claims
  valid; saying that, &quot;though nothing be multiplied forever, it will not
  produce one&quot;; asking, &quot;How long does it take for what was originally
  wrong to grow into a right? and at what rate per annum do invalid claims become
  valid?&quot; He declared that neither use nor improvement, nor even the free
  consent of all existing men, could give private ownership in land, or bar the
  equal right of the next child born. And he, moreover, proved that land nationalization,
  which he then proposed as the only equitable treatment of land, did not involve
  state administration.</p>
<p> Not one of the arguments of <em>Social Statics</em> is answered in <em>Justice</em> &#8212; not
  even the showing that land nationalization merely involves a change in the
  receivers of rent, and not the governmental occupation and use of land. There
  are two things, and two things only, that Mr. Spencer admits that he overlooked &#8212; the
  relation of the poor law to the claims of landowners, and the amount of compensation
  which the landless must give to the landed &quot;for all that value which the
  labor of ages has given to the land.&quot;</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer has discussed the poor law before. One of the longest of the
  chapters of <em>Social Statics</em>, from which I have already quoted,<font size="-1"><strong><em>28</em></strong></font> is
  devoted to it; and in recent writings he has again referred to it. In <em>Social
  Statics</em>  he declares that the excuse made for a poor law &#8212; that
  it is a compensation to the disinherited for the deprivation of their birthright &#8212; has
  much plausibility; but he objects, not only that the true remedy is to restore
  equal
  rights to land, but that the poor law does not give compensation, insisting
  that poor-rates are in the main paid by non-landowners, and that it is only
  here and there that one of those kept out of their inheritance gets any part
  of them.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">28 pp. 64-65.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> In 1884, in &quot;The Coming Slavery,&quot; he repeats the assertion that
  non-landowners get no benefit from the poor law, saying &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">The amount which under the old poor law the half-pauperised laborer received
      from the parish to eke out his weekly income was not really, as it appeared,
      a bonus, for it was accompanied by a substantially equivalent decrease of his
      wages, as was quickly proved when the system was abolished and the wages rose.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> In &quot;The Sins of Legislators,&quot; he repeats that instead of being
  paid by landowners, the poor-rates really fall on nonlandowners, saying &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">As, under the old poor law, the diligent and provident
      laborer had to pay that the good-for-nothings might not suffer, until frequently,
      under this
    extra burden, he broke down and himself took refuge in the workhouse &#8212; as,
    at present, it is admitted that the total rates levied in large towns for
    all
      public purposes, have now reached such a height that they &quot;cannot
      be exceeded without inflicting great hardship on the small shopkeepers
      and artisans, who
      already find it difficult enough to keep themselves free from pauper taint.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> But in Appendix B Mr. Spencer ignores all this. He assumes that landowners
  have been the real payers and the disinherited the real receivers of the poor-rates;
  and, adding together all that the landowners have paid in poor-rates since
  the time of Queen Elizabeth, he puts the whole sum to their credit in a ledger
  account between existing landlords and existing landless.</p>
<p> He begins this account at 1601. He credits the landlords and charges the
  landless with all that has been collected from land for poor-rates between
  1601 and 1890. Now, if this is done, what is to be put on the other side of
  the ledger? We must take the same date, the ordinary book-keeper would say,
  and charge the landlords and credit the landless with all the ground-rents
  the landowners have received from 1601 to 1890. To this we must add all that
  the landowners have received from the produce of general taxes between 1601
  and 1890, by virtue of their political power as landlords.<font size="-1"><strong><em>29</em></strong></font> And to this we
  must again add the selling value in 1890 of the land of England, exclusive
  of improvements. The difference will show what, if we are to go back to 1601,
  and no further, existing landlords now owe to existing landless.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">29 The <em>Financial Reform Almanac</em> has given some idea of what enormous sums
      the British landowners have received from the offices, pensions and sinecures
      they have secured for them-selves and from their habit of providing for younger
      sons and poorer relatives in the army, navy, church and civil administration.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> This would be the way of ordinary, every-day bookkeeping if it were undertaken
  to make up such a debtor and creditor account from 1601 to 1890. But this is
  not the way of Spencerian synthetic book-keeping. What Mr. Spencer does, after
  crediting landlords and charging the landless with the amount collected from
  land for poor-rates between 1601 and 1890, is, omitting all reference to mesne
  profits, to credit the landless and charge the landlords with the value of
  the land of England, not as it is, but &quot;in its primitive, unsubdued state,
  furnishing nothing but wild animals and wild fruits&quot; &#8212; that is,
  before there were any men. This &#8212; though by what sort of synthetic calculus
  he gets at it he does not tell us &#8212; Mr. Spencer estimates at &pound;500,000,000,
  a sum that will about square the account, with some little balance on the side
  of the landlords!</p>
<p> Generous to the poor landless is Mr. Accountant Spencer! &#8212; so generous
  that he ought to make a note of it in writing Part VI of his Principles of
  Ethics &#8212; The Ethics of Social Life: Positive Beneficence. For is it not
  positive beneficence to those who are to be credited with it to say that &pound;500,000,000
  would be a high estimate of the value of England when there was nothing there
  but wild animals and wild fruit? To one of less wide magnificence two and threepence
  would seem to be rather more than a high estimate of the value of the land
  of England before man came.</p>
