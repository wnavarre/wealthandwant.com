      <p>          <strong>Chapter II &#8212;The Place Of <em>JUSTICE</em> In The Synthetic Philosophy </strong></p>
    </div>
    <p> <em>JUSTICE</em>, to which we are to look for Mr. Spencer's present opinions
      on the land question, is esteemed by its author his most important book.
      This volume,
  the full title of which is, <em>The Ethics of Social Life &#8212; Justice</em>,
  is also entitled Part IV of Ethics. It is the tenth of the ponderous volumes
  already
  published, which are advertised as &quot;Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy.&quot; The
  grand divisions of this Synthetic Philosophy, as now advertised, are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First
          Principles, </li>
      <li>          The Principles of Biology, </li>
      <li>The Principles of Psychology,            </li>
      <li>Principles of Sociology, and </li>
      <li>Principles of Morality. </li>
      </ul>
    <p>Of these five
            grand divisions,
              the Principles of Morality, as it is styled in the advertisements,
            or Principles of Ethics, as it is styled in the title-page of the
            book itself, is the grand
            division to which Justice belongs in the Spencerian scheme. The first
            volume of this grand division, The Data of Ethics, has been already
            published. Volume
            II, The Inductions of Ethics, and Volume III, The Ethics of Individual
            Life, have not yet appeared,<font size="-1"><strong><em>12</em></strong></font> Mr.
            Spencer, as he states in the preface to <em>Justice</em>,
            preferring to hasten this volume, as most important. After these
            two deferred volumes have been completed, there are, as he also tells
            us,
            two more volumes,
            <em>The Ethics of Social Life &#8212; Negative Benevolence</em>, and <em>The
            Ethics of Social Life &#8212; Positive Benevolence</em>, to which he will turn
            his attention, thus completing his full philosophical scheme.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">12. They have been published since this was put in plate.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> This scheme of &quot;Synthetic Philosophy&quot; is the most pretentious
      that ever mortal man undertook, since it embraces no less than an explanation
      to
  mankind, without recourse to the hypothesis of Originating Intelligence, of
  how the world and all that is in it contained, including we ourselves, our
  motives, feelings, powers, instincts, habits and customs, came to be. Of this
  large scheme, the ethical part is the most important, being, as Mr. Spencer
  tells us, &quot;that to which I regard all the preceding parts as subsidiary.&quot; And
  of this most important part, he also tells us that this volume, <em>The Ethics
  of Social Life &#8212; Justice</em>, is the most important.</p>
<p> Thus <em>Justice</em>, which so far as it treats of the land question we are about
  to consider, is by its author deemed the very summit and capstone of his whole
  philosophy.</p>
<p> And that, indeed, it must be, follows from the supreme importance of its
  subject matter. For it treats of right and wrong, of what should and what should
  not be, in those social relations of men from which spring the most fiercely
  debated practical questions of our time-questions that involve the happiness
  or misery, the physical, mental and moral development of vast populations,
  the advance of civilization or its retrogression. As to the principles of right
  and wrong in individual relations there is little if any dispute; and not merely
  through Christendom, but &quot;from Paris to Pekin&quot; mankind are substantially
  agreed as to what constitutes good or bad. It is when we come to the social
  relations of men &#8212; to those social adjustments which prescribe and control
  rights of ownership, which affect the production, distribution, accumulation
  and enjoyment of wealth, which are the main ground of legislation, and which
  over and above the injunctions of individual morality throw around men a perfect
  network of shalls and shall nots, that we reach the befogged and debatable
  land &#8212; the region of burning questions.</p>
<p> It is where the philosopher thus passes from the region of mere curious speculation
  into the arena where, for men living and men yet to come, the issues of want
  or plenty, of ignorance or enlightenment, of slavery or freedom, must be decided,
  that the ordinary apprehension may best apply to his teachings the tests of
  usefulness and sincerity. That the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and
  that the tree is best known by its fruit, are maxims not to be disregarded
  in philosophy. What matters the teaching of any philosophy as to the origin
  of things, compared with its teaching on matters that affect the fullness,
  happiness and nobleness of life? And how shall we tell whether the philosopher
  be an earnest man or a mere prater, so readily and so clearly as by noting
  whether he takes the side of wronger or of wronged, the undeservedly rich or
  the undeservedly poor? Thus, Justice is not merely the roof and crown of the
  Spencerian Synthetic Philosophy; it is its touchstone as well.</p>
