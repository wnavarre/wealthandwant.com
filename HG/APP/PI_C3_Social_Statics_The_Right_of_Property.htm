  <p><strong><font size="-1">    </font></strong><strong>Chapter
        III &#8212; <em>Social Statics</em> &#8212; The
          Right Of Property </strong>    </p>
</div>
<p> The chapter of <em>Social Statics</em> on &quot;The Right to the Use of the
  Earth&quot; is
  followed by a chapter on &quot;The Right of Property.&quot; For the reason
  that Mr. Spencer has since referred to this chapter as to be taken in connection
  with what was said in the preceding one, it is also worth while to reprint
  it in full: &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="center"> <font size="-1">CHAPTER X&#8212;THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 1. The moral law, being the law of the social state,
      is obliged wholly to ignore the ante-social state. Constituting, as the
      principles of
    pure morality
      do, a code of conduct for the perfect man, they cannot be made to adapt
    themselves to the actions of the uncivilized man, even under the most ingenious
    hypothetical
      conditions-cannot be made even to recognize those actions so as to pass
    any definite sentence upon them. Overlooking this fact, thinkers, in their
    attempts
      to prove some of the first theorems of ethics, have commonly fallen into
    the error of referring back to an imaginary state of savage wildness, instead
    of
      referring forward to an ideal civilization, as they should have done; and
    have, in consequence, entangled themselves in difficulties arising out of
    the discordance
      between ethical principles and the assumed premises. To this circumstance
    is attributable that vagueness by which the arguments used to establish the
    right
      of property in a logical manner are characterized. While possessed of a
    certain Plausibility, they yet cannot be considered conclusive, inasmuch
    as they suggest
      questions and objections that admit of no satisfactory answers. Let us
    take a sample of these arguments and examine its defects.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Though the earth and all inferior creatures,&quot; says Locke, &quot;be
    common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person: this nobody
    has a right to but himself. The labor of his body, and the work of his hands,
    we may say are properly his. Whatever, then, he removes out of the state
    that nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed his labor with, and
    joined
    to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. It being
    by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by
    this labor something annexed to it that excludes the common right of other
    men.
    For this labor being the unquestionable property of the laborer, no man but
    he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least when there is
    enough and as good left in common for others.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> If inclined to cavil, one might in reply to this observe
      that as, according to the premises, &quot;the earth and all inferior creatures&quot; &#8212; all
    things, in fact, that the earth produces &#8212; are &quot;common to all
    men,&quot; the
    consent of all men must be obtained before any article can be equitably &quot;removed
    from the common state nature hath placed it in.&quot; It might be argued
    that the real question is overlooked, when it is said that, by gathering
    any natural
    product, a man &quot;hath mixed his labor with it, and joined to it something
    that is his own, and thereby made it his property&quot;; for that the point
    to be debated is whether he had any right to gather, or mix his labor with
    that which, by the hypothesis, previously belonged to mankind at large. The
    reasoning used in the last chapter to prove that no amount of labor, bestowed
    by an individual upon a part of the earth's surface, can nullify the title
    of society to that part might be similarly employed to show that no one can,
    by the mere act of appropriating to himself any wild unclaimed animal or
    fruit, supersede the joint claims of other men to it. It may be quite true
    that the
    labor a man expends in catching or gathering gives him a better right to
    the thing caught or gathered than any <em>one</em> other man; but the question at
    issue
    is whether by labor so expended he has made his right to the thing caught
    or gathered greater than the pre-existing rights of <em>all</em> other men put together.
    And unless he can prove that he has done this, his title to possession cannot
    be admitted as a matter of <em>right</em>, but can be conceded only on the ground
    of
    convenience.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Further difficulties are suggested by the qualification
      that the claim to any article of property thus obtained is valid only &quot;when there is enough
    and as good left in common for others.&quot; A condition like this gives birth
    to such a host of queries, doubts, and limitations as practically to neutralize
    the general proposition entirely. It may be asked, for example: How is it to
    be known that enough is &quot;left in common for others&quot;? Who can determine
    whether what remains is &quot;as good&quot; as what is taken? How if the remnant
    is less accessible? If there is not enough &quot;left in common for others,&quot; how
    must the right of appropriation be exercised? Why, in such case, does the mixing
    of labor with the acquired object cease to &quot;exclude the common right of
    other men&quot;? Supposing <em>enough</em> to be attainable, but not all equally <em>good</em>,
    by what rule must each man choose? Out of which inquisition it seems impossible
    to liberate the alleged right, without such mutilations as to render it,
    in an ethical point of view, entirely valueless.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Thus, as already hinted, we find that the circumstances of savage life render
    the principles of abstract morality inapplicable; for it is impossible, under
    ante-social conditions, to determine the rightness or wrongness of certain
    actions by an exact measurement of the amount of freedom assumed by the parties
    concerned. We must not expect, therefore, that the right of property can be
    satisfactorily based upon the premises afforded by such a state of existence.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 2. But under the system of land tenure pointed out
      in the last chapter as the only one that is consistent with the equal claims
      of all men to the
    use of the earth, these difficulties disappear, and the right of property
      obtains a legitimate foundation. We have seen that, without any infraction
      of the law
    of equal freedom, an individual may lease from society a given surface of
      soil, by agreeing to pay in return a stated amount of the produce he obtains
      from
    that soil. We found that, in doing this, he does no more than what every
      other man is equally free with himself to do; that each has the same power
      with himself
    to become the tenant; and that the rent he pays accrues alike to all. Having
    thus hired a tract of land from his fellow men, for a given period, for understood
    purposes, and on specified terms &#8212; having thus obtained, for a time,
    the exclusive use of that land by a definite agreement with its owners, it
    is manifest
    that an individual may, without any infringement of the rights of others,
    appropriate to himself that portion of produce which remains after he has
    paid to mankind
    the promised rent. He has now, to use Locke's expression, &quot;mixed his
    labor with&quot; certain products of the earth; and his claim to them is
    in this case valid, because he obtained the <em>consent</em> of society before so
    expending
    his labor; and having fulfilled the condition which society imposed in giving
    that consent &#8212; the payment of rent &#8211; society, to fulfill its
    part of the agreement, must acknowledge his title to that surplus which remains
    after
    the rent has been paid. &quot;Provided you deliver to us a stated share of
    the produce which by cultivation you can obtain from this piece of land,
    we give you the exclusive use of the remainder of that produce&quot;: these
    are the words of the contract; and in virtue of this contract, the tenant
    may equitably
    claim the supplementary share as his private property; may so claim it without
    any disobedience to the law of equal freedom; and has therefore a <em>right</em> so
    to claim it.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Any doubt that may be felt as to the fact that this is
      a logical deduction from our first principle, that every man has freedom
      to do all that he
    wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man, may
    be readily
      cleared up by comparing the respective degrees of freedom assumed in such
    a case by the occupier and the members of society with whom he bargains.
    As was
      shown in the preceding chapter, if the public altogether deprive any individual
      of the use of the earth, they allow him <em>less</em> liberty than they
      themselves claim; and by so breaking the law of equal freedom commit a
      wrong. If, conversely,
      an individual usurps a given portion of the earth, to which, as we have
    seen,
      all other men have as good a title as himself, he breaks the law by assuming
      <em>more</em> liberty than the rest. But when an individual holds land
      as a tenant of society, a balance is maintained between these extremes,
      and the claims
    of
      both parties are respected. A price is paid by the one for a certain privilege
      granted by the other. By the fact of the agreement being made, it is shown
      that such price and privilege are considered. to be equivalents. The lessor
      and the lessee have both, within the prescribed limits, done that which
    they willed: the one in letting a certain holding for a specified sum, the
    other
      in agreeing to give that sum. And so long as this contract remains intact,
      the law of equal freedom is duly observed. If, however, any of the prescribed
      conditions be not fulfilled, the law is necessarily broken, and the parties
      are involved in one of the predicaments above named. If the tenant refuses
      to pay the rent, then he tacitly lays claim to the exclusive use and benefit
      of the land he occupies &#8212; practically asserts that he is the sole
      owner of its produce, and consequently violates the law by assuming a greater
      share of freedom than the rest of mankind. If, on the other hand, society
      take from
      the tenant that portion of the fruits obtained by the culture of his farm,
      which remains with him after the payment of rent, they virtually deny him
      the use of the earth entirely (for by the use of the earth we mean the
      use of its
      products), and in so doing claim for themselves a greater share of liberty
      than they allow him. Clearly, therefore, this surplus produce equitably
      remains with the tenant; society <em>cannot</em> take it without trespassing upon
      his freedom;
      he <em>can</em> take it without trespassing on the freedom of society. And as, according
      to the law, he is free to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not
      the equal freedom of any other, he is free to take possession of such surplus
      as
      his property.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 3. The doctrine that all men have equal rights to
      the use of the earth does indeed, at first sight, seem to countenance a
      species of social
    organization
      at variance with that from which the right of property has just been deduced;
      an organization, namely, in which the public, instead of letting out the
    land to individual members of their body, shall retain it in their own hands,
    cultivate
      it by joint-stock agency, and share the produce: in fact, what is usually
    termed Socialism or Communism.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Plausible though it may be, such a scheme is not capable of realization in
    strict conformity with the moral law. Of the two forms under which it may be
    presented, the one is ethically imperfect; and the other, although correct
    in theory, is impracticable.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Thus, if an equal portion of the earth's produce is awarded
      to every man, irrespective of the amount or quality of the labor he has
      contributed toward
    the obtainment of that produce, a breach of equity is committed. Our first
    principle requires, not that all shall have like shares of the things which
    minister to the gratification of the faculties, but that all shall have like
    freedom to pursue those things &#8212; shall have like scope. It is one thing
    to give to each an opportunity of acquiring the objects he desires; it is
    another, and quite a different thing, to give the objects themselves, no
    matter whether
    due endeavor has or has not been made to obtain them. The one we have seen
    to be the primary law of the Divine scheme; the other, by interfering with
    the ordained connection between desire and gratification, shows its disagreement
    with that scheme. Nay, more, it necessitates an absolute violation of the
    principle of equal freedom. For when we assert the entire liberty of each,
    bounded only
    by the like liberty of all, we assert that each is free to do whatever his
    desires dictate, within the prescribed limits  &#8211; that each is free, therefore,
    to claim for himself all those gratifications and sources of gratification
    attainable by him within those limits &#8211; all those gratifications and
    sources of gratification which he can procure without trespassing upon the
    spheres
    of action of his neighbors. If, therefore, out of many starting with like
    fields of activity, one obtains by his greater strength, greater ingenuity,
    or greater
    application more gratifications and sources of gratification than the rest,
    and does this without in any way trenching upon the equal freedom of the
    rest, the moral law assigns him an exclusive right to all those extra gratifications
    and sources of gratification; nor can the rest take from him without claiming
    for themselves greater liberty of action than he claims, and thereby violating
    that law. Whence it follows that an equal apportionment of the fruits of
    the
    earth among all is not consistent with pure justice.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> If, on the other hand, each is to have allotted to him a share of produce
    proportionate to the degree in which he has aided production, the proposal,
    while it is abstractedly just, is no longer practicable. Were all men cultivators
    of the soil, it would perhaps be possible to form an approximate estimate of
    their several claims. But to ascertain the respective amounts of help given
    by different kinds of mental and bodily laborers toward procuring the general
    stock of the necessaries of life is an utter impossibility. We have no means
    of making such a division save that afforded by the law of supply and demand,
    and this means the hypothesis excludes.<strong><em>1</em></strong></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-2"><strong>1. </strong>These inferences do not at all militate against joint-stock
          systems of production and living, which are in all probability what Socialism
          prophesizes.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 4. An argument fatal to the communist theory is
      suggested by the fact that a desire for property is one of the elements
      of our nature. Repeated allusion
    has been made to the admitted truth, that acquisitiveness is an unreasoning
    impulse quite distinct from the desires whose gratifications property secures &#8212; an
    impulse that is often obeyed at the expense of those desires. And if a propensity
    to personal acquisition be really a component of man's constitution, then
    that cannot be a right form of society which affords it no scope. Socialists
    do
    indeed allege that private appropriation is an abuse of this propensity,
    whose normal function, they say, is to impel us to accumulate for the benefit
    of
    the public at large. But in thus attempting to escape from one difficulty,
    they do but entangle themselves in another. Such an explanation overlooks
    the fact that the <em>use</em> and <em>abuse</em> of a faculty (whatever the etymology of the
    words
    may imply) differ only in <em>degree</em>; whereas their assumption is that they differ
    in <em>kind</em>. Gluttony is an abuse of the desire for food; timidity, an abuse
    of the feeling which in moderation produces prudence; servility, an abuse
    of the
    sentiment that generates respect; obstinacy, of that from which firmness
    springs: in all of which cases we find that the legitimate manifestations
    differ from
    the illegitimate ones merely in quantity and not in quality. So also with
    the instinct of accumulation. It may be quite true that its dictates have
    been
    and still are followed to an absurd excess, but it is also true that no change
    in the state of society will alter its nature and its office. To whatever
    extent moderated, it must still be a desire for personal acquisition. Whence
    it follows
    that a system affording opportunity for its exercise must ever be retained;
    which means that the system of private property must be retained, and this
    presupposes a <em>right</em> of private property, for by right we mean that which
    harmonizes with the human constitution as divinely ordained.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 5. There is, however, a still more awkward dilemma
      into which M. Proudhon and his party betray themselves. For if, as they
      assert, &quot;all property
    is robbery&quot; &#8212; if no one can equitably become the exclusive possessor
    of any article, or, as we say, obtain a right to it &#8212; then, among other
    consequences, it follows that a man can have no right to the things he consumes
    for food. And if these are not his before eating them, how can they become
    his at all? As Locke asks, &quot;When do they begin to be his? When he digests?
    Or when he eats? Or when he boils? Or when he brings them home?&quot; If
    no previous acts can make them his property, neither can any process of assimilation
    do it; not even their absorption into the tissues. Wherefore, pursuing the
    idea, we arrive at the curious conclusion that as the whole of his bones,
    muscles,
    skin, etc., have been thus built up from nutriment not belonging to him,
    a man has no property in his own flesh and blood, can have no valid title
    to
    himself, has no more claim to his own limbs than he has to the limbs of another,
    and has as good a right to his neighbor's body as to his own! Did we exist
    after the same fashion as those compound polyps, in which a number of individuals
    are based upon a living trunk common to them all, such a theory would be
    rational enough. But until Communism can be carried to that extent, it will
    he best
    to stand by the old doctrine.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &sect; 6. Further argument appears to be unnecessary. We
      have seen that the right of property is deducible from the law of freedom,
      that it is presupposed
      by the human constitution, and that its denial involves absurdities.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Were it not that we shall frequently have to refer to the
      fact hereafter, it would be scarcely needful to show that the taking away
      another's property
    is an infringement of the law of equal freedom and is therefore wrong. If
      A appropriates to himself something belonging to B, one of two things must
      take
    place: either B does the like to A, or he does not. If A has no property,
      or if his property is inaccessible to B, B has evidently no opportunity
      of exercising
    equal freedom with A by claiming from him something of like value, and A
      has therefore assumed a greater share of freedom than he allows B and has
      broken
    the law. If, again, A's property is open to B, and A permits B to use like
    freedom with himself by taking an equivalent, there is no violation of the
    law, and the affair practically becomes one of barter. But such a transaction
    will never take place save in theory, for A has no motive to appropriate
      B's property with the intention of letting B take an equivalent; seeing
      that if
    he really means to let B have what B thinks an equivalent, he will prefer
      to make the exchange by consent in the ordinary way. The
      only case simulating this is one in which A takes from B a thing that B
      does not wish to part with &#8212; that is, a thing for which A can give
      B nothing that B thinks an equivalent &#8212; and as the amount of gratification
    which B has in the possession of this thing is the measure of its value to
    him, it follows that if A cannot give B a thing which affords B equal gratification,
    or in other words what he thinks an equivalent, then A has taken from B what
    affords A satisfaction, but does not return to B what affords B satisfaction,
    and has therefore broken the law by assuming the greater share of freedom.
    Wherefore we find it to be a logical deduction from the law of equal freedom
    that no man can rightfully take property from another against his will.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p> There is in this, it will be observed, no modification whatever of the strenuous
  assertion in Chapter IX of the equal, natural and inalienable right of all
  men to the use of land. On the contrary, so strongly, so uncompromisingly,
  does Mr. Spencer insist on the ethical invalidity of private property in land
  that he makes the formal consent of the community and the payment of rent to
  it a condition precedent to the individual right of property in things produced
  by labor. And, since no formal consent of this kind can be given until society
  has been well organized, he even goes to the length of denying that there can
  be any full right of property, or, indeed, any application of the principles
  of abstract morality, in any social condition lower than the civilized.</p>
<p> In brief, the argument of this chapter is &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 1. That the right of the individual to his labor does not give individual
    property in the product of labor, because labor can produce only by using land,
    which does not belong to any individual, but to all.</p>
  <p> 2. But under the system of land tenure previously set forth as the only just
    one, in which the organized society assigns the use of a portion of land to
    an individual and collects rent from him for it, the conditions of the equal
    liberty of all are complied with, and the individual acquires a right of property
    in what remains of the product of his labor after paying rent.</p>
  <p> 3. This system, under which the social organization would let land to individuals
    and collect rent from them, does not countenance the system under which it
    would carry on production and divide the product among its members, since,
    the powers and application of men being different, this would give to some
    more than they are entitled to, and to others less.</p>
  <p> 4. This communistic or socialistic system is also condemned by the natural
    desire to acquire individual property.</p>
  <p> 5. The denial of individual property may be brought into the awkward dilemma
    of a denial of the right of the individual to himself.</p>
  <p>6. The right of property having thus been established, the appropriation
    by one of property belonging to another is a denial of the law of equal freedom.</p>
