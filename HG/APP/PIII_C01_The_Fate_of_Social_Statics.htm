<blockquote>
  <p> <em>Equity therefore does not permit property in land. &#8230; Not only have
      present land tenures an indefensible origin, but it is impossible to discover
      any mode in which land can become private property. &#8230; Ethical truth
      is as exact and as peremptory as physical truth; and that in this matter
      of land
      tenure the verdict of morality must be distinctly aye or nay. Either men
      have a right to make the soil private property, or they have not. There
      is no medium.
      We must choose one of the two positions. There can be no half-and-half
      opinion. In the nature of things the fact must be either one way or the
      other. </em></p>
  <p align="right"><em> &#8212; Herbert Spencer, 1850.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong><br />
  Chapter I &#8212; The Fate Of <em>Social Statics</em></strong></p>
<p> We now come to the purpose for which the preceding lengthy examination has
  been made: the consideration of Mr Spencer's present opinions on the land question,
  as set forth with all the weight of the &quot;Synthetic Philosophy&quot; in
  its author's most recent volume, <em>Justice</em>, which bears date of June, 1891, and
  was published somewhat later in that year.</p>
<p>But it will be best to break the chronological order, and record here the
  fate of <em>Social Statics</em>. Even after Mr Spencer had made The <em>Times</em> and
  Mr Greenwood believe that he had suppressed it years before, that book still
  continued to
  be published by Mr Spencer's authorized publishers, D. Appleton &amp; Co.,
  and their edition of <em>Justice</em>, published in October, 1891, contains
  an advertisement of it in its original form. But now, at last, it has been
  done for. It has
  not been killed outright; that would be mercy compared with its present fate.
  It has &#8212; and I cannot but feel that <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, the
  Edinburgh reviewer, and Mr John Laidler of Newcastle, have been innocent causes
  of its
  fate &#8212; it has been disemboweled, stuffed, mummified, and then set up
  in the gardens of the Spencerian philosophy, where it may be viewed with entire
  complacency by Sir John and his Grace.</p>
<p> Soberly, the original volume has with this year been withdrawn from publication,
  to give place to a new <em>Social Statics</em>, dated January, 1892, and published in
  February. This volume, which is, of course, now to pass in the publisher's
  lists as <em>Social Statics</em>, has for full title, <em>Social Statics, abridged
  and revised</em>,
  together with <em>The Man </em>versus<em> the State</em>. It consists of disjointed fragments
  of the old <em>Social Statics</em>, which, in order to make some approach to the bulk
  of the original, is padded out with the magazine articles before referred to.
  In the preface Mr. Spencer says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">My first intention was to call this volume, or, rather, part of a volume,
      <em>Fragments from Social Statics</em>, and afterwards, <em>Selections
      from Social Statics</em>.
      Both of these titles, however, seemed to indicate a much less coherent assemblage
      of parts than it contains. On the other hand, to call it an abridgement is
      somewhat misleading, since the word fails to imply that large and constructively
      important parts are omitted. No title, however, appears appropriate, and I
      have at length decided that <em>Social Statics, abridged and revised</em>, is the least
      inappropriate.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> If appropriateness was what Mr. Spencer sought, it does seem as if a title
  much less inappropriate might have been found. For the only discernible principle
  of revision is the chopping out of all that might imply a God or offend vested
  interests, in the same fashion that Russian censors revise distasteful works,
  the result being a Hamlet from which not only Hamlet himself, but the Ghost,
  the Queen Mother, and Ophelia, have gone. The &quot;First Principle&quot; is
  left, but everything large or small relating to land is omitted. The only allusion
  to land is in the cavilling at Locke, which is retained, and that what was
  originally Section 3, Chapter X, now converted into a chapter, headed &quot;Socialism,&quot; is
  left by careless editing to begin, as in the original:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">The doctrine that all men have equal rights to the use of the earth seems
      at first sight to countenance a species of social organization at variance
      with that from which the right of property has just been deduced.*</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The foot-note indicated by this asterisk is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">*Referring to an omitted part of the last chapter, the argument of which,
      with modifications, will now be found in Part IV of the Principles of Ethics.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Thus revised, <em>Social Statics</em> no further concerns us. All that Mr. Spencer
  originally said about the relation between men and the earth having now been
  definitely withdrawn, we are referred for his present opinions to the book
  we are about to consider.</p>
<p> But the advertising of the revised <em>Social Statics</em> is worth noting, as by
  some blunder it lays before the American reader what was originally intended
  for English circulation only, and brings to mind the fiction about the suppression
  of Social Statics, which did duty in the <em>St. James's Gazette</em> and the London
  <em>Times</em>. Here is the advertisement as published at the head of D. Appleton &amp; Co.'s
  announcements in May, 1892:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1"><strong>SOCIAL STATICS</strong>. BY HERBERT SPENCER. New and revised edition,
      including &quot;The
      Man versus the State,&quot; a series of essays on political tendencies
      heretofore published separately. 12mo. 420 pages. Cloth, $2.00.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Having been much annoyed by the persistent quotation from the old edition
    of <em>Social Statics</em>, in the face of repeated warnings, of views which he had
    abandoned, and by the misquotation of others which he still holds, Mr. Spencer
    some ten years ago stopped the sale of the book in England and prohibited its
    translation. But the rapid spread of communistic theories gave new life to
    these misrepresentations; hence Mr. Spencer decided to delay no longer a statement
    of his mature opinions on the rights of individuals and the duty of the State.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> This is a queer statement to come from D. Appleton &amp; Co., who have been
  publishing and advertising the old edition of <em>Social Statics</em> up to this year,
  without the slightest warning to purchasers that the author had changed his
  views otherwise than as stated in the prefaces and notes, which, as I have
  before said, made no reference to any change on the land question. It is strange
  to hear <em>from them</em>, that the annoyed Mr. Spencer ten years ago stopped the sale
  of his book <em>in England</em>, when it had not been in print for over twenty years,
  serenely leaving it to be sold in the only country where it was in print, and
  that he also at the same time prohibited its translation. Why is Mr. Spencer
  so careful of what Englishmen in the little home island and even the &quot;foreigner&quot; may
  read, yet so careless of what is read by Americans, Canadians and Australians?
  And why have D. Appleton &amp; Co., for nearly ten years, been passing off
  on their great constituency a book that its author would not allow to be sold
  in his own home or in foreign countries? These are questions this advertisement
  suggests but does not answer.</p>
