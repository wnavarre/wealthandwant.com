<p align="center"><strong>Chapter II &#8212; &quot;The Man <em>versus</em> The
    State&quot; </strong></p>
<p> MR. SPENCER'S letter to the <em>St. James's Gazette</em> seems to have produced the
  effect he intended, and though in the United States, D. Appleton &amp; Co.
  continued to advertise and sell <em>Social Statics</em>, and to send to Mr. Spencer
  his royalties upon it;<font size="-1"><strong><em>7</em></strong></font> in England, Sir John and His Grace were satisfied that
  he had been much maligned by garbled extracts from an early work that he had
  since suppressed.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>7 </strong>&quot;The American people have returned the compliment by purchasing
        more than a hundred thousand of his books reprinted in this country, and
        upon every volume
      of which he has been paid as if he had been an American author.&quot; &#8212; Professor
      E. L. Youmans, <em>Herbert Spencer on the Americans and the Americans on Herbert
      Spencer.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> But Mr. Spencer himself seems to have felt that to make his position among
  the adherents of the House of Have quite comfortable, he must do something
  positive as well as negative. So we find his next work to be one which the
  Liberty and Property Defense League, a society formed in London for defending
  private property in land, have ever since been active in pushing.</p>
<p> In 1884 Mr. Spencer issued four magazine articles, &quot;The New Toryism,&quot; &quot;The
  Coming Slavery,&quot; &quot;The Sins of Legislators,&quot; and &quot;The Great
  Political Superstition&quot; which were then published in a volume entitled &quot;The
  Man versus the State,&quot; and have since been used (1892) to fill out the
  revised edition of <em>Social Statics</em>.</p>
<p> These essays are strongly individualistic, condemning even bitterly any use
  of governmental powers or funds to regulate the conditions of labor or alleviate
  the evils of poverty. In this Mr. Spencer was continuing and accentuating a
  line begun in <em>Social Statics</em>, and, in the view of those who think as I do,
  was in the main right; for governmental interferences and regulations and bonuses
  are in their nature restrictions on freedom, and cannot cure evils that primarily
  flow from denials of freedom.</p>
<p> But what in these essays marks a new departure, what makes their individualism
  as short-sighted as socialism, and brutal as well, is that they assume that
  nothing at all is needed, in the nature either of palliative or remedy; that
  they utterly ignore the primary wrong from which proceed the evils that socialism
  blindly protests against. In them Mr. Spencer is like one who might insist
  that each should swim for himself in crossing a river, ignoring the fact that
  some had been artificially provided with corks and others artificially loaded
  with lead. He is like the preachers who thundered to slaves, &quot;Thou shalt
  not steal!&quot; but had no whisper against the theft involved in their enslavement.</p>
<p> The burden of these essays is, &quot;If any would not work, neither should
  he eat!&quot; This is declared to be a tenet of the Christian religion, justified
  by science, as indeed, though much ignored by Christians and by scientists,
  it is.</p>
<p> To whom does Mr. Spencer refer as the idlers who yet eat?</p>
<p> &quot;Why, of course,&quot; the reader of <em>Social Statics</em> would say, &quot;he
  refers to Sir John and his Grace, and to the landholding dukes to whom in<em> Social
  Statics</em> he refers by name &#8212; to them and their class, pre-eminently.
  For they never work, and take pride that their fathers and grandfathers and
  great-grandfathers
  never worked. Yet they eat, whoever else goes hungry, and that of the best.&quot;</p>
<p> But the reader of <em>Social Statics</em> would be wrong. Mr. Spencer does
  not refer to them, nor allude to them, nor seem to think of them. The people
  on whom
  he would enforce the command &quot;If any would not work, neither should he
  eat!&quot; are not the fashionable idlers, whose only occupation is to kill
  time and &quot;get an appetite,&quot; but the poor idlers who say they have
  no work. &quot;Say, rather, that they either refuse work or quickly turn themselves
  out of it!&quot; cries the indignant philosopher, regardless now of what he
  once insisted on &#8212; that these men are disinherited; robbed by unjust
  law of their birthright, of their rightful share in the element without which
  no
  man can work; dependent, therefore, on others for leave to work, and often
  not getting that leave.</p>
<p> In 1850, while condemning the socialistic palliatives for poverty, Mr. Spencer
  at the same time recognized the truth that prompts them. He was not content
  to show the futility of such attempts to assuage the evils of undeserved poverty
  without pointing out the giant wrong from which undeserved poverty springs.
  He began his enumeration of the evils of over-government, not as now, by merely
  denouncing what is done in kindly though misplaced efforts to help the downtrodden,
  but by recognizing the primary wrong. Beginning this enumeration (page 293,
  <em>Social Statics</em>) he says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">As the first item on the list there stands that gigantic
      injustice inflicted on nineteen-twentieths of the community by the usurpation
      of the soil &#8212; by
      the breach of their rights to the use of the earth. For this the civil
      power is responsible &#8212; has itself been a party to the aggression &#8212; has
      made it legal, and still defends it as right.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> And of the moral truth involved in theories that in &quot;The Man <em>versus</em>  the State&quot; he unreservedly denounces, he says (<em>Social
    Statics</em>, pp. 345-346):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Erroneous as are these poor-law and communist theories &#8212; these
      assertions of a man's right to a maintenance and of his right to have work
      provided
    for him &#8212; they are, nevertheless, nearly related to a truth. They are
    unsuccessful efforts to express the fact, that whoso is born on this planet
    of ours thereby
      obtains some interest in it &#8212; may not be summarily dismissed again &#8212; may
      not have his existence ignored by those in possession. In other words,
      they are attempts to embody that thought which finds its legitimate utterance
      in
      the law &#8212; all men have equal rights to the use of the Earth. The
      prevalence of these crude ideas is natural enough. A vague perception that
      there is
      something wrong about the relationship in which the great mass of mankind
      stand to the
      soil and to life, was sure eventually to grow up. After getting from under
      the grosser injustice of slavery men could not help beginning, in course
      of time, to feel what a monstrous thing it was that nine people out of
      ten should
      live in the world on sufferance, not having even standing room, save by
      allowance of those who claimed the earth's surface Could it be right that
      all these human
      beings should not only be without claim to the necessaries of life &#8212; should
      not only be denied the use of those elements from which such necessaries
      are obtainable &#8212; but should further be unable to exchange their labor
      for such necessaries, except by leave of their more fortunate fellows?
      Could it be that
      the majority had thus no better title to existence than one based upon
      the good will or convenience of the minority? Could it be that these landless
      men
      had &quot;been <em>mis</em>-sent to this earth, where all the seats were
      already taken&quot;?
      Surely not. And if not, how ought matters to stand? To all which questions,
      now forced upon men's minds in more or less definite shapes, there come,
      amongst other answers, these theories of a right to a maintenance and a
      right of labor.
      Whilst, therefore, they must be rejected as untenable, we may still recognize
      in them the imperfect utterance of the moral sense in its efforts to express
      equity.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> The wrong done to the people at large, by robbing them
      of their birthright &#8212; their
    heritage in the earth  &#8212; is, indeed, thought by some a sufficient excuse
    for a poor-law, which is regarded by such as an instrumentality for distributing
    compensation. There is much plausibility in this construction of the matter.
    But &#8230; why organize a diseased state? Sometime or other this morbid
    constitution of things, under which the greater part of the body politic
    is cut off from
    direct access to the source of life, must be changed.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Of anything like this there is in &quot;The Man <em>versus</em> the State&quot; no
  word. Mr. Spencer again takes up his parable against government interference;
  but he takes it up with every reference to the gigantic injustice inflicted
  upon nineteen-twentieths of his countrymen omitted; with everything excluded
  that might be offensive to the rich and powerful.</p>
<p> Nor does he shrink from misrepresenting those who stand for the truth he
  has now virtually, though not openly, abandoned. In his letter to the <em>St.
  James's Gazette</em> he declared that he had not read my work; but in &quot;The Coming Slavery&quot; occurs
  this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Communistic theories, partially indorsed by one Act of Parliament after another,
      and tacitly if not avowedly favored by numerous public men seeking supporters,
      are being advocated more and more vociferously by popular leaders, and urged
      on by organized societies. There is the movement for land nationalization which,
      aiming at a system of land tenure, equitable in the abstract, is, as all the
      world knows, pressed by Mr. George and his friends with avowed disregard for
      the just claims of existing owners, and as the basis of a scheme going more
      than half-way to state socialism.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> And in &quot;The Sins of Legislators&quot; this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">And now this doctrine [that society as a whole has an
      absolute right over the possessions of each member], which has been tacitly
      assumed,
      is being
    openly proclaimed. Mr. George and his friends, Mr. Hyndman and his supporters,
    are
      pushing the theory to its logical issue. They have been instructed by examples,
      yearly increasing in number, that the individual has no rights but what
    the community may equitably override; and they are now saying &#8212; &quot;It
    shall go hard, but we will better the instruction, and abolish individual
    rights
      altogether.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Charity requires the assumption that when Mr. Spencer wrote these passages
  he had not read anything I had written; and that up to the present time when
  he has again reprinted them he has not done so.</p>
<p> For in nothing I have ever written or spoken is there any justification for
  such a characterization. I am not even a land nationalizationist, as the English
  and German and Australian land nationalizationists well know. I have never
  advocated the taking of land by the state or the holding of land by the state,
  further than needed for public use; still less the working of land by the state.
  From my first word on the subject I have advocated what has come to be widely
  known as &quot;the single tax;&quot; i.e., the raising of public revenues by
  taxation on the value of land irrespective of the improvements on it &#8212; taxation
  which, as fast as possible and as far as practicable, should be made to absorb
  economic rent and take the place of all other taxes. And among the reasons
  I have always urged for this has been the simplification of government and
  the doing away of the injustice of which governments are guilty in taking from
  individuals property that rightfully belongs to the individual. I have not
  gone so far as Mr. Spencer in limiting the functions of government, for I believe
  that whatever becomes a necessary monopoly becomes a function of the state;
  and that the sphere of government begins where the freedom of competition ends,
  since in no other way can equal liberty be assured. But within this line I
  have always opposed governmental interference. I have been an active, consistent
  and absolute free trader, and an opponent of all schemes that would limit the
  freedom of the individual. I have been a stancher denier of the assumption
  of the right of society to the possessions of each member, and a clearer and
  more resolute upholder of the rights of property than has Mr. Spencer. I have
  opposed every proposition to help the poor at the expense of the rich. I have
  always insisted that no man should be taxed because of his wealth and that
  no matter how many millions a man might rightfully get, society should leave
  to him every penny of them.</p>
<p> All this would have been evident to Mr. Spencer if he had read any one of
  my books before writing about me. But he evidently prefers the easier method
  which Parson Wilbur, in Lowell's &quot;Biglow Papers,&quot; was accustomed
  to take with &quot;a print called the <em>Liberator</em>, whose heresies,&quot; he said, &quot;I
  take every proper opportunity of combating, and of which, I thank God, I have
  never read a single line.&quot;</p>
<p> To do him justice, I do not think Mr. Spencer had any desire to misrepresent
  me. He was prompted to it by the impulse that always drives men to abuse those
  who adhere to a cause they have betrayed, as the readiest way of assuring Sir
  John and his Grace that no proposal to disturb their rentals would in the future
  come from him.</p>
<p> Another thing, however, is to be noticed here &#8212; the admission that
  the movement for land nationalization is &quot;aiming at a system of land tenure
  equitable in the abstract.&quot; Mr. Spencer has not reached the point of utterly
  denying the truth he had seen. The abolition of private property in land he
  still admits is equitable in the abstract.</p>
<p> Now, what is meant by equitable in the abstract? Let <em>Social Statics</em>, page
  64, tell us:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">For what does a man really mean by saying of a thing that
      it is &quot;theoretically
      just,&quot; or &quot;true in principle,&quot; or &quot;abstractedly right&quot;?
      Simply that it accords with what he, in some way or other, perceives to be
      the established arrangements of Divine rule. When he admits that an act is &quot;theoretically
      just,&quot; he admits it to be that which, in strict duty, should be done.
      By &quot;true in principle,&quot; he means in harmony with the conduct decreed
      for us. The course which he calls &quot;abstractedly right,&quot; he believes
      to be the appointed way to human happiness. There is no escape. The expressions
      mean this, or they mean nothing.</font></p>
