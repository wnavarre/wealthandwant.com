          </p>
    </div>
    <p> REALLY, this final close of the most important discussion of the most important
  book of the most important grand division of the great Spencerian Synthetic
  Philosophy can only be fitly treated by calling on the imagination for an illustration:</p>
<p> Mr. J. D. Brown, for some time before our civil war a prominent citizen of
  Vicksburg, Miss., was a native of Connecticut, of Puritan stock and thrifty
  habits. Beginning life as a clock-maker, he emigrated when a young man to that
  part of Ohio, settled from New England, which is still in those regions known
  as the Western Reserve. There he went to school-teaching, joined a local literary
  society, and made some speeches which were highly applauded, and in which he
  did not hesitate to denounce slavery as the sum of all villainies, and to declare
  for immediate, unconditional emancipation. Somewhat later on, he went South
  and settled at Vicksburg, where he became professor of moral philosophy in
  a young ladies' seminary, and, finally, its principal. Being prudent in speaking
  of the peculiar institution, and gaining a reputation for profundity, he became
  popular in the best society, a favorite guest in the lavish hospitalities
  of the wealthier planters, and, in the Southern manner, was always spoken of
  to visitors with pride as &quot;Principal Brown, one of our most distinguished
  men, sir! a great educator, and a great authority on moral philosophy, sir!&quot;</p>
<p> The slavery question was in the meantime growing hotter and hotter. There
  were no abolitionists in Vicksburg or in the country about, for any one suspected
  of abolitionism was promptly lynched, or sent North in a coat of tar and feathers.
  But slaves were occasionally disappearing, among them some of especial value
  as mechanics; and even a very valuable yellow girl, whose beauty and accomplishments
  were such that her owner had refused $5,000 for her, had been spirited off
  by the underground railroad. And &quot;society&quot; in Vicksburg was becoming
  more and more excited. Though no one yet dreamed that it was destined ere long
  to redden the Mississippi, and light the skies of Vicksburg with bursting bombs,
  the cloud on the northern horizon was visibly swelling and darkening, and in &quot;bleeding
  Kansas&quot; a guerrilla war had already crimsoned the grass.</p>
<p> Still, the lines of Principal Brown were cast in pleasant places, and he
  received the hon ours due to a great philosopher, deemed all the greater by
  those who in their secret hearts did not find his moral philosophy quite intelligible;
  for he not only made a practice of using the longest words and of interlarding
  his discourses with references to people of whom his auditors had never heard,
  and of whom he could say anything he pleased, but he had taken Balzac's hint,
  and every now and again he strung together a series of words that sounded as
  though they might mean something, but really had no meaning at all. He had
  thus gained a reputation for great profundity with those who vainly puzzled
  over them, and who attributed their difficulty to an ignorance they were ashamed
  to admit.</p>
<p> But one woeful day there came to Vicksburg some echo of one of his debating-club
  speeches in the Western Reserve, and some of the leading citizens deemed fit
  to interrogate him. He had to lie a little, but succeeded in quieting them;
  and as not much was said about the matter, his standing in Vicksburg society
  was, in general unchanged.</p>
<p>Following this, however, something worse happened. The Rev. Dr. Sorely, one
  of the most eloquent divines of the Methodist Church South, made a trip to
  Ohio, and in the Western Reserve delivered a lecture on the biblical and patriarchal
  system of labor as practiced by our Southern brethren. Among the auditors was
  a man who remembered and quoted some of the eloquent utterances, on the other
  side, of the reverend doctor's friend, Principal Brown. The matter might have
  passed unheeded, but that the Vicksburg <em>Thunderbolt</em>, anticipating much glory
  to the South from the Northern visit of its eloquent defender, had sent a special
  correspondent with him; and a report of the lecture, including the reference
  to Principal Brown, duly appeared in its columns.</p>
<p> This was indeed a serious matter, and the Principal wrote immediately to
  the <em>Thunderbolt</em> with feeling and vehemence. He said that he feared that if
  he remained silent many would think he had said things he had not said; intimated
  that he had never been in Ohio, and what he had said when he was there he had
  said for the purpose of finding a secure basis for slavery; that he had only
  been talking of transcendental ethics, and not of sublunary ethics at all;
  that he had always insisted that the slave-owners of the South should be paid
  in full for their slaves; that he had never supposed that the question would
  come up for millions of years yet; and that the most he had said was that, &quot;It
  may be doubted, if it does not possibly seem inferable, that perhaps there
  may be reason to suspect that at some future time the slaves may be liberated,
  after paying to their owners more than they are worth; but I have no positive
  opinion as to what may hereafter take place, and am only sure that, if emancipation
  ever does take place, the negroes must pay to their owners far more in interest
  on their purchase money than they now pay in work.&quot;</p>
<p> To most of the citizens of Vicksburg this seemed entirely satisfactory, but
  there were some dissentients. Colonel F. E. Green strongly urged patriotic
  citizens not to think of such a thing as treating the Principal to a coat of
  tar and feathers and Professor Bullhead, of the leading young men's seminary,
  wrote to the <em>Thunderbolt</em>, requesting his respected colleague to give a categorical
  answer to the question &quot;whether, when A B went to the slave-pen and bought
  a negro, the negro was or was not his property, morally as well as legally.&quot; If
  yes, then Professor Bullhead wanted to know what his learned and respected
  friend meant by admitting the possibility of emancipation even some millions
  of years hence; and if no, then Professor Bullhead wanted Principal Brown to
  tell him why the slaves, before regaining their freedom, must pay their owners
  more than they were worth. And Professor Bullhead closed with some sarcastic
  references to transcendental ethics.</p>
<p> Principal Brown did not answer this plain question of his friend Professor
  Bullhead, but got rid of him as quickly as he could, telling him that there
  was no dispute between them, since they both insisted on the right of any citizen
  to work and whip his own negro, and then luring him off into a long discussion
  of transcendental ethics vs. sublunary ethics. But it was evident that something
  more had to be done, and the papers soon contained an announcement that Principal
  Brown proposed to forego for a time the publication of Volumes XXIV and XXV
  of his great work on Moral Philosophy, and immediately to bring out Volume
  XXVI, containing a chapter on the slavery question, which he proposed to read
  to the citizens of Vicksburg at a public meeting.</p>
<p> The lecture drew a large audience of the first citizens of Vicksburg. There
  was also a sprinkling of rougher citizens, some of whom before entering the
  hall deposited in a rear lot a long rail that they had brought with them, and
  some pails that smelled like tar, with a number of large but evidently light
  sacks. However, the lecture was a great success, and at the close, Principal
  Brown's hand was nearly shaken off, and he was escorted to his home by an enthusiastic
  and cheering crowd, who vowed that nothing like such a &quot;demolisher to
  the nigger-lovers&quot; had ever been heard in Vicksburg before.</p>
<p> But although the stately periods of the Principal are occasionally marred
  by what is evidently a reportorial tendency to the slang of the time, let me
  quote from the papers of the next day, which contained long reports of the
  speech, accompanied with glowing encomiums:&#8212;</p>
<p> (From the Vicksburg <em>Thunderbolt</em>, June 19, 1859)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">The wealth and beauty and fashion of Vicksburg turned out
      in full force last evening to listen to a lecture on the slavery question
      by our distinguished
      townsman, Principal J. D. Brown, the widely honored writer on moral philosophy.
      In the audience our reporter counted thirty-seven colonels, two majors,
      and thirty-two judges, besides the pastors of all the leading churches.
      It is a
      great pity, as many of the enthusiastic hearers said, while congratulating
      Principal Brown and each other at the conclusion, that William Lloyd Garrison
      and Wendell Phillips themselves could not have been there; for if their
      miserable nigger-loving hides could be penetrated by the solid blocks of
      learning, the
      unanswerable logic, and the mathematical demonstrations which Principal
      Brown poured into his audience, they would have sung exceedingly small;
      even if they
      had not seen the full wickedness of their efforts to rob the widow and
      the orphan by interfering with our beneficent domestic institution.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Much of Principal Brown's lecture it will be impossible
      to give to our readers this morning, for our reporter, not being well versed
      in moral philosophy,
      finds himself unable from his notes to make sense of some of the more profound
      passages and is uncertain as to how some of the authorities cited spell
    their
      names. There was some confusion, too, in the hall when Principal Brown
    touched on the subject of transcendental ethics, and said that he had always
    held,
      and always would hold, that in transcendental ethics all men were pretty
    much alike. But Colonel Johnson rose in his place and stilled the disturbance,
    asking
      the audience to keep their coats on till the Principal got through; and
    when Principal Brown explained the transcendental ethics related to the other
    side
      of the moon, while sublunary ethics related to this side of the moon, there
      was silence again. It was in the wind-up, however, that the professor got
    in his best work, and roused his audience to the highest pitch of delight
    and
      enthusiasm. He said:&#8212;</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;There are people who contend that these negro slaves
          of the South, after they have paid their owners in full the compensation
          due them, ought
          to be put back in their native land. But how are we to find who brought
        them here? Some were brought in Spanish vessels, some in Portuguese vessels,
        some
          in Dutch, some in English, and some in American vessels; and these
        vessels are all by this time sunk or destroyed, and their owners and
        crews are
        dead, and their descendants have got mixed. Besides, they only got the
        negroes from
          the barracoons on the African coast. Who is to tell where the ancestor
        of each one was taken from and who took him to the coast? Many of these
        slaves bear
          such names as Brown, Smith, Jones, and Simpson, names borne by the
        very men who brought their progenitors here. Then they have such given
        names as
        Caesar,
          Hannibal, Dick, Tom, Harry, Ephraim, Alexander, and Nebuchadnezzar,
        so that no one can tell from their names whether they originally came
        from Africa
        or
          England, Italy, Jerusalem, Greece, or Assyria. And what have these
        negroes ever done for freedom? Did any one ever hear of them expressing
        any sympathy
          for the independence of Greece, or protesting against the Russian invasion
          of Hungary, or even contributing for the conversion of the Jews, or
        for sending missionaries to the South Sea Islands, where only man is
        vile? Contrariwise,
          when British tyranny invaded our shores did not these negroes work
        just as
          readily for the hirelings of King George as they did for their own
        patriotic masters who were fighting the battles of liberty? And today
        when a nigger
          runs away, where does he head for? Does he not make a straight streak
        for Canada, a country groaning under the government of an effete monarchy,
        and
        with a full-fledged
          aristocrat for governor-general? One would like to know that these
        negro slaves, whom it is proposed to send back to their native land when
        they have
        compensated
          their owners, have some real love for free institutions, before thrusting
        freedom upon them.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;To think that slavery was wrongly established is
        natural, and not without warrant in transcendental ethics. But if we
        entertain the thought of rectification,
          there arises in the first place the question &#8212; who enslaved them?
          Their owners did not. They only bought them. These negroes were enslaved
          by negroes
          like themselves, &#8212; likely enough by their own mothers, cousins,
          and aunts. Now which are the descendants of the one and which of the
          other?
          and where
          are they to be found? But supposing that they could be found, there
          would still have to be recognized a transaction which goes far to prevent
          rectification.
          If we are to go back upon the past at all, we must go back upon the
          past wholly,
          and take account of what it has cost to feed and clothe and keep these
          negroes since they have been here.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;I have consulted one of our most eminent negro traders,
          a gentleman who has probably bought and sold more negroes than anyone in
          the Southwest,
          and after a close calculation, he informs me that taking men, women and
        children together, and considering the loss of their labor which their owners
        have to
          suffer in the rearing of children, sickness, and old age, and the cost
        of overseers, drivers, patrols, and an occasional pack of bloodhounds, the
        average negro
          costs the average owner a fraction over $267.57 per annum. But as I wish
        to be generous to the negro I have thrown off the 57 cents and a fraction,
        and
          will put their cost to their masters at only $267 a year.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Now, the first cargo of negro slaves was landed in
          Jamestown, Va., in the year 1620, and the external slave-trade was abolished
          in 1808. We
        may therefore assume the average time during which each negro has been in
        this
          country as one hundred and fifty years. Saying nothing whatever about interest,
          it is thus clear that each living negro owes to his owner as the cost of
        keeping him, $267 a year for one hundred and fifty years, which, excluding
        interest,
          amounts at the present time to just $40,050. (Great applause.)&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"> Here a man in a back seat rose, and in a decidedly Yankee
      accent asked Principal Brown if he included negro babies? The Principal
      replying in the
    affirmative,
      the intruder began: &quot;How can a negro baby just born owe any one forty
      thou &#8212;&quot; The rest of the sentence was lost by the sudden exit
      of the intruder from the hall, over the heads of the audience. There was
      quite an
      excitement for a few moments, but Colonel Johnson again rose and restored
      order by asking the young men in the rear not to escort the interrupter
      farther than
      the vacant lot adjoining until the close of the proceedings, as the audience
      were intent on enjoying the remainder of the logical feast which their
      distinguished townsman was laying before them. All being quiet again, Principal
      Brown resumed:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Observe that the negroes have not an equitable
        claim to themselves in their present condition&#8212;washed, clothed
        and fed, civilized, Christianized and taught how to work &#8212; but
        only to themselves in their primitive wild and uncivilized condition.
        Now,
        what is the relation between the original
          'wild
          nigger' value of each slave and what each one of them has received
        from his owner during one hundred and fifty years? We know that they
        were bought
          at
          the barracoons, delivered on board ship at prices ranging from a half-pound
          of beads to a bottle of rum or a Manchester musket, the owners, being
        at the cost of transporting them to America, including the heavy insurance
          caused
          by the necessarily great mortality, items which as you will observe
        I have
          not charged against the existing slaves. My friend the slave merchant
        estimates that on an average 15s. 9d. English money would be a high rate.
        Let us
          call it, however, $4 American money. Thus we see that an equitable
        rectification would require that each negro in the South should pay his
        owner a balance
          of
          $40,046! (Loud and long-continued applause.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Now, when in the Western Reserve many years ago,
        I drew from transcendental ethics the corollary that the ownership of
        a man could not be equitably alienated
          from the man himself, and argued that after the slaves had compensated
        their owners they should be freed, I had overlooked the foregoing considerations.
          Moreover, I did not clearly see what would be implied by the giving
        of compensation
          for all that during these one hundred and fifty years it has cost the
        owner to keep the slave. While, therefore, I adhere to the inference
        originally drawn &#8212; that
          is to say, as far as transcendental ethics is concerned &#8212; a fuller
          consideration of the matter has led me to the conclusion that slavery,
          subject to the right
          of the slave to buy himself on payment to his owner of what he has
          cost, say $40,046, should be maintained. But it may be readily seen
          that such
          a transaction
          would be a losing one to the slaves themselves, for at the present
          market price of negroes, they are not worth, big and little, more than
          $1,000
          each. And,
          whereas I have also said that I really did not know but that in the
          course of some millions of years it might possibly be that the slaves
          could be
          allowed their freedom on paying to their owners full compensation,
          I now see, since
          what is due from them to their masters is constantly increasing, that
          with humanity as it now is, the implied reorganization would become
          more and
          more unprofitable. (Still louder and longer applause, led by Professor
          Bullhead,
          who called for three times three cheers, which were given with a will,
          the audience rising and the ladies waving their handkerchiefs.)</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> &quot;I also wish to point out that all this talk about
          giving their freedom to the slaves is as foolish as it is wicked. Since
          under our laws the slave
          himself is the property of the master, the slaves already have their freedom
          in the freedom of the master. Thus the equal freedom of each to do all
        that he wills, provided that he interferes not with the equal freedom of
        all others,
          as taught by transcendental ethics, is already recognized by the laws of
        the South, and nothing more remains for us to do, except to keep abolitionist
        theories
          from spreading in this 'land of the free and home of the brave!' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"> The uproarious enthusiasm of the audience could no longer be restrained,
      and, led by Professor Bullhead, who rushed on the stage and embraced Principal
      Brown, our best citizens crowded round him. During this time the wretch who
      had interrupted the Principal was tarred and feathered in an adjoining lot,
      and ridden on a rail to a levee. Unfortunately all efforts of the police to
      discover the perpetrators of this reprehensible proceeding have failed. It
      is generally supposed to have been the work of some negroes who were listening
      through the open windows and whose feelings were hurt by the slight insinuation
      of the stranger as to the value of colored infants.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
<p> While thus calling attention to the similarity between Mr. Spencer's philosophic
        methods and those of Principal Brown, I do not wish to make any personal comparison
        between the two philosophers. Since he was under fear of tar and feathers,
        that would be unjust to Principal Brown.</p>
