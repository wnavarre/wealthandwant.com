  <p>      <strong>Chapter IV &#8212; The Idea Of Justice In The Synthetic Philosophy </strong>
    </p>
</div>
<p> As the culminating development of his evolutionary or Synthetic Philosophy,
  Mr. Spencer now comes to treat of those social-economic questions that involve
  the idea of justice, in a book which he entitles <em>Justice</em>.</p>
<p> But what is justice?</p>
<p> It is the rendering to each his due. It presupposes a moral law, and its
  corollaries, natural rights which are self-evident. But where in a philosophy
  that denies spirit, that ignores will, that derives all the qualities and attributes
  of man from the integration of matter and the dissipation of motion, can we
  find any basis for the idea of justice?</p>
<p> &quot;Justice,&quot; says Montesquieu, &quot;is a relation of congruity which
  really subsists between two things. This relation is always the same, whatever
  being considers it, whether it be God, or an angel, or lastly a man.&quot; This,
  too, in <em>Social Statics</em>, was Mr. Spencer's conception. Justice he tells us there
  means equalness &#8212; that is to say, a relation of congruity or equality
  which is always the same, and always apprehensible by men, no matter what be
  their
  condition of development or degree of knowledge. As the basis of all his reasoning
  he postulates an inherent moral sense, which &quot;none but those committed
  to a preconceived theory can fail to recognize&quot; &#8212; a perception that
  bears to morality the same relationship that the perception of the primary
  laws of quantity bears to mathematics; and which enables us to recognize an &quot;eternal
  law of things,&quot; a &quot;Divine order,&quot; in which, and not in any notions
  of what is expedient either for the individual or for all individuals, we may
  find a sure guide of conduct, the apprehension of right and wrong. And this
  it seems to me is necessarily and universally involved in the idea of <em>Justice</em>,
  so that when a man, whatever be his theories, thinks of right or wrong, just
  or unjust, he thinks of a relation, like that of odd and even, or more and
  less, which is always and everywhere to be seen by whoever will look.</p>
<p> But this self-evidence of natural rights the Synthetic Philosophy denies.
  It admits the existence of natural rights &#8212; that is to say, rights which
  pertain to the individual man as man, and are consequently equal; but it derives
  the genesis of these rights, or at least their apprehension by man, from this
  process of his gradual evolution, by virtue of which they evolve, or he becomes
  conscious of them, after a certain amount of &quot;social discipline,&quot; and
  not before. If such rights exist before, it must be potentially, or in some
  such way as the Platonic ideas. But as this would involve an appointed order;
  and hence intelligent will, to which we must attribute equity; and hence God;
  it seems inconsistent with Mr. Spencer's present view&#8212;not necessarily
  with that part which derives our physical constitutions from lower animals
  and primarily from the integrations of matter and motion for this is a mere
  matter of external form, and that our bodies come, somehow, &quot;from the
  dust of the earth&quot; as the Scriptures put it, is as clear as that ice comes
  from water but with that part which gives to the ego the same genesis, and
  accounts for our mental and moral qualities by variation, survival of the fittest,
  the pressure of conditions, social discipline and heredity of acquired characteristics.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer realizes this inconsistency, for, abandoning altogether his original
  derivation and explanation of justice, he proceeds in Justice to make another
  derivation and explanation in accordance with his new philosophy, devoting
  to this the first eight chapters, or something more than a fifth of the book.
  With its validity or invalidity, its coherency or incoherency, I am not here
  concerned; my object being merely to show how he arrives at the conception
  of justice and what it is, so that we may judge the teachings of <em>Justice</em> from
  its own avowed standpoint.</p>
<p> To present Mr. Spencer's argument as intelligibly as I can, I will make a
  synopsis of the first eight chapters of <em>Justice</em>, as far as possible in his
  own words, but without quotationmarks, employing smaller type where the exact
  words can be used at some length.</p>
<p> These chapters are</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <em><strong>1.&#8212;Animal Ethics.</strong></em></p>
  <p> During immaturity, benefits received must be inversely proportioned to capacities
      possessed. After maturity, benefits must vary directly as worth, measured by
      fitness for the conditions of existence. The ill-fitted must suffer the evils
      of unfitness, and the well-fitted prove their fitness.</p>
  <p> <em><strong>2.&#8212;Sub-Human Justice.</strong></em></p>
  <p> The law of sub-human justice is that each individual shall receive the benefits
      and the evils of its own nature and its consequent conduct.</p>
  <p> <em><strong>3.&#8212;Human Justice.</strong></em></p>
  <p> Each individual ought to receive the benefits and the evils of his own nature
      and consequent conduct, neither being prevented from having whatever good his
      actions normally bring him, nor allowed to shoulder off this evil on other
      persons.</p>
  <p> <em><strong>4.&#8212;The Sentiment of Justice.</strong></em></p>
  <p> Our feeling that we ourselves ought to have freedom to receive the results
      of our own nature and consequent actions, and which prompts maintenance of
      the sphere for this free play, results from inheritances of modifications produced
      by habit, or from more numerous survivals of individuals having nervous structures
      which have varied in fit ways, and from the tendency of groups formed of members
      having this adaptation to survive and spread. Recognition of the similar freedom
      of others is evolved from the fear of retaliation, from the punishment of interference
      prompted by the interests of the chief, from fear of the dead chief's ghost,
      and from fear of God, when dead-chief-ghost worship grows into God worship,
      and, finally, by the sympathy evolved by gregariousness.</p>
  <p> <em><strong>5.&#8212;The Idea of Justice.</strong></em></p>
  <p> It emerges and becomes definite from experiences, generation after generation,
    which provoke resentment and reactive pains, until finally there arises a conception
    of a limit to each kind of activity up to which there is freedom to act. But
    it is a long time before the general nature of the limit common to all cases
    can be conceived. On the one hand there is the positive element, implied by
    each man's recognition of his claims to unimpeded activities and the benefits
    they bring; on the other hand there is the negative element implied by the
    consciousness of limits which the presence of other men having like claims
    necessitates. Inequality is suggested by the one, for if each is to receive
    the benefits due his own nature and consequent conduct, then, since men differ
    in their powers, there must be differences in the results. Equality is suggested
    by the other, since bounds must be set to the doings of each to avoid quarrels,
    and experience shows that these bounds are on the average the same for all.
    Unbalanced appreciation of the one is fostered by war, and tends to social
    organization of the militant type, where inequality is established by authority,
    an inequality referring, not to the natural achievement of greater rewards
    by greater merits, but to the artificial apportionment of greater rewards to
    greater merits. Unbalanced appreciation of the other tends to such theories
    as Bentham's greatest happiness principle, and to communism and socialism.
    The true conception is to be obtained by noting that the equality concerns
    the mutually limited spheres of action which must be maintained if associated
    men are to co-operate harmoniously, while the inequality concerns the results
    which each may achieve by carrying on his actions within the implied limits.
    The two may be and must be simultaneously asserted.</p>
  <p> <em><strong>6.&#8212;The Formula Of Justice.</strong></em></p>
  <p> It must be positive in so far as it asserts for each that, since he is to
    receive and suffer the good and evil of his own actions, he must be allowed
    to act. And it must be negative in so far as, by asserting this of every one,
    it implies that each can be allowed to act only under the restraint imposed
    by the presence of others having like claims to act. Evidently, the positive
    element is that which expresses a prerequisite to life in general, and the
    negative element is that which qualifies this prerequisite in the way required,
    when, instead of one life carried on alone, there are many lives carried on
    together.</p>
  <p> Hence, that which we have to express in a precise way is the liberty of each
    limited only by the like liberties of all. This we do by saying, Every man
    is free to do what he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of
    any other man.</p>
  <p> <em><strong>7.&#8212;The Authority of this Formula.</strong></em></p>
  <p> The reigning school of politics and morals has a contempt for doctrines that
    imply restraint on the doings of immediate expediency. But if causation be
    universal, it must hold throughout the actions of incorporated men. Evolution
    implies that a distinct conception of justice can have arisen but gradually.
    It has gone on more rapidly under peaceful relations, and been held back by
    war. Nevertheless, where the conditions have allowed, it has evolved slowly
    to some extent, and formed for itself approximately true expressions, as shown
    in the Hebrew Commandments, and without distinction between generosity and
    Justice, in the Christian Golden Rule, and in modern forms in the rule of Kant.
    It is also shown on the legal side, in the maxims of lawyers as to natural
    law, admitted inferentially even by the despotically minded Austin.</p>
  <p> These, it will be objected, are a priori beliefs. The doctrine of evolution
    teaches that a priori beliefs entertained by men at large must have arisen,
    if not from the experiences of each individual, then from the experiences
    of the race. Fixed intuitions must have been established by that intercourse
    with
    things which throughout an enormous past has directly and indirectly determined
    the organization of the nervous system, and certain resulting necessities
    of thought. Thus had the law of equal freedom no other than a priori derivations,
    it would still be rational to regard it as an adumbration of a truth, if
    not
    still literally true. And the inductive school, including Bentham and Mill,
    are, on analysis, driven to the basis of a priori cognitions.</p>
  <p> But the principle of natural equity, expressed in the freedom of each, limited
    only by the like freedom of all, is not exclusively an a priori belief.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">Examination of the facts has shown it to be a fundamental law by conformity
        to which life has evolved from its lowest up to its highest forms, that each
        adult individual shall take the consequences of its own nature and actions:
        survival of the fittest being the result. And the necessary implication is
        an assertion of that full liberty to act which forms the positive element in
        the formula of justice; since, without full liberty to act, the relation between
        conduct and consequence cannot be maintained. Various examples have made clear
        the conclusion manifest in theory, that among gregarious creatures this freedom
        of each to act has to be restricted; since if it is unrestricted there must
        arise such clashing of actions as prevents the gregariousness. And the fact
        that, relatively unintelligent though they are, inferior gregarious creatures
        inflict penalties for breaches of the needful restrictions, shows how regard
        for them has come to be unconsciously established as a condition to persistent
        social life.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> These two laws, holding, the one of all creatures and the other of social
        creatures, and the display of which is clearer in proportion as the evolution
        is higher, find their last and fullest sphere of manifestation in human societies.
        We have recently seen that along with the growth of peaceful co-operation there
        has been an increasing conformity to this compound law under both its positive
        and negative aspects; and we have also seen that there has gone on simultaneously
        an increase of emotional regard for it, and intellectual apprehension of it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> So that we have not only the reasons above given for concluding that this
        a priori belief has its origin in the experiences of the race, but we are enabled
        to affiliate it on the experiences of living creatures at large, and to perceive
        that it is but a conscious response to certain necessary relations in the order
        of nature.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> No higher warrant can be imagined; and now, accepting the law of equal freedom
        as an ultimate ethical principle, having an authority transcending every other,
        we may proceed with our inquiry.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <em><strong>8.&#8212;Its Corollaries.</strong></em></p>
  <p> That the general formula of justice may serve for guidance, deductions must
    be drawn severally applicable to special classes of cases. The several particular
    freedoms deducible from the laws of equal freedom may fitly be called, as they
    commonly are called, rights. Rights truly so called are corollaries from the
    law of equal freedom, and what are falsely called rights are not deducible
    from it.</p>
  <p> It is not worth while to examine this argument. It is sufficient for our
    purpose to see that in <em>Justice</em> Mr. Spencer re-asserts the same principle from
    which in Social Statics he condemned private property in land.</p>
