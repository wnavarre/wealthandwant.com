  Introduction: 
  The reason for this examination</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="right">No consecrated absurdity would have stood its ground in this
    world <br>
    if the man had not silenced the objection of the child.<br />
&#8212; Michelet</p>
  </blockquote>
<p> ALTHOUGH he stands for much that is yet in dispute, there can be no question
  that at the present time 1892 &#8212; Herbert Spencer, of all his contemporaries,
  holds the foremost place in the intellectual world, and through a wider circle
  than any man now living, and perhaps than any man of our century, is regarded
  as a profound, original and authoritative thinker &#8212; by many indeed as
  the greatest thinker the world has ever yet seen.</p>
<p> So large is the field over which Mr. Spencer's writings have ranged, so many
  are the special branches of knowledge he has laid under contribution, so difficult
  to the ordinary mind are the abstractions in which he has dealt and the terminology
  in which they are couched, that this great reputation is with the large majority
  of the intelligent men who accept it more a matter of faith than of reason.
  But this rather adds to than detracts from the popular estimate; for what to
  us is vague often seems on that account the greater, and what we have no means
  of measuring, all the more profound. Nor does Mr. Spencer's standing as one
  of the greatest, to many the very greatest, of philosophers, lack substantial
  basis in the opinions of those deemed competent to gauge intellectual power.</p>
<p> John Stuart Mill styled him &quot;one of the acutest metaphysicians of recent
  times, one of the most vigorous as well as the boldest thinker that English
  speculation has yet produced.&quot; Professor Ray Lankester spoke of him as &quot;an
  acute observer and experimentalist versed in physics and chemistry, but above
  all, thoroughly instructed in scientific methods.&quot; Richard A. Proctor
  characterized him as the &quot;clearest of thinkers.&quot; G. H. Lewes said &quot;it
  is questionable whether any thinker of finer caliber has appeared in our century,&quot; and
  that &quot;he alone of all British thinkers has organized a philosophy.&quot; Professor
  David Masson deemed him &quot;the one of all our thinkers who has founded for
  himself the largest new scheme of a systematic philosophy.&quot; Dr. McCosh,
  who fundamentally differed from him, said &quot;his bold generalizations are
  always instructive, and some of them may in the end be established as the profoundest
  laws of the knowable universe.&quot; St. George Mivart, who as a Catholic is
  also at variance in important matters, says &quot;we cannot deny the title
  of philosopher to such a thinker as Mr. Spencer, who does genuinely bind together
  different and hitherto alien subjects, and that by a clear and wide though
  neither an all-comprehensive nor a spiritual hypothesis, the principle of evolution.&quot; Professor
  Tyndall calls him &quot;the apostle of the understanding.&quot; His &quot;profound
  and vigorous writings&quot; have been likened by Professor Huxley to &quot;the
  embodiment of the spirit of Descartes in the knowledge of our own day.&quot; Darwin
  spoke of him as &quot;our great philosopher,&quot; greeted him as &quot;the
  great expounder of the principle of evolution,&quot; and wrote to him that &quot;every
  one with eyes to see and ears to hear ought to bow their knee to you.&quot; Professor
  Stanley Jevons ranked his work with the &quot;Principia&quot; of Newton. John
  Fiske, representing unquestionably the opinion of large numbers of intelligent
  and influential men, declares it to be of the calibre of that of Aristotle
  and Newton, but &quot;as far surpassing their work in its vastness of performance
  as the railway surpasses the sedan-chair or as the telegraph surpasses the
  carrier pigeon.&quot; President Barnard in the same strain said, &quot;his
  philosophy is the only philosophy that satisfies an earnestly inquiring mind,&quot; adding
  that &quot;we have in Herbert Spencer not only the profoundest thinker of our
  time, but the most capacious and powerful intellect of all time. Aristotle
  and his master were not more beyond the pygmies who preceded them than he is
  beyond Aristole. Kant, Hegel, Fichte and Schelling are gropers in the dark
  by the side of him.&quot;</p>
<p> Such estimates are not unquestioned, and opinions of a different kind might
  be cited from men of high standing. But the current of general thought, swelled
  by the wonderful scientific achievements of our time, has run powerfully, almost
  irresistibly, in favor of ideas with which Mr. Spencer is identified, absorbing,
  intimidating and driving back opposition even where it seemed most firmly intrenched,
  until to question them has come largely to be looked upon as evidence not merely
  of unscientific beliefs, but of ignorance and superstition. Whatever may be
  the verdict of the future, the man who is regarded as the great philosopher
  of evolution has within his own time won an acceptance and renown such as no
  preceding philosopher ever personally enjoyed. Thus, these estimates represent
  the view that has had the largest currency and produced the greatest effect,
  and that gives the weight of high authority to any declaration of Mr. Spencer's
  on a subject that has engaged his attention. Such a declaration, made with
  the utmost deliberation, in his latest, and as he and his admirers deem, his
  ripest and most important work, I propose in what follows to examine.</p>
<p> I do not propose to discuss Mr. Spencer's philosophy or review his writings,
  except as embraced in or related to his teachings on one subject. That, while
  a subject of the first practical importance, is one where no special knowledge,
  no familiarity with metaphysical terminology, no wrestling with abstractions,
  is needed, and one where the validity of the reasoning may be judged for himself
  by anyone of ordinary powers and acquirements.</p>
<p> My primary object is to defend and advance a principle in which I see the
  only possible relief from much that enthralls and degrades and distorts, turning
  light to darkness and good to evil, rather than to gauge a philosopher or weigh
  a philosophy. Yet the examination I propose must lead to a decisive judgment
  upon both. As Mr. Spencer's treatment of this principle began with his first
  book and ends with his last, we have in it a cross section of his teachings,
  traversing the open plain of obvious facts and common perceptions, in which
  we who have no more than ordinary knowledge and powers may test for ourselves
  his intellectual ability, and, what is even more important, his intellectual
  honesty. For to whatever extent we may elsewhere separate ability and honesty,
  respecting the talent while distrusting the man, such separation cannot be
  made in the field of philosophy. Since philosophy is the search for truth,
  the philosopher who in his teachings is swerved by favor or by fear forfeits
  all esteem as a philosopher.</p>
<p> Nor is the connection between the practical problems that are forcing themselves
  on our civilization and the deepest questions with which speculative philosophy
  deals, merely personal or accidental. It belongs to the nature of the human
  mind, to our relations to the universe in which we awake to consciousness.
  And just as in <em>Progress and Poverty</em> the connection that developed as I went
  along carried me from an inquiry into economic phenomena to considerations
  that traversed Mr. Spencer's theory of social evolution and raised such supreme
  questions as the existence of God and the immortality of man, so now I find
  a similar connection asserting itself between Mr. Spencer's utterances on the
  most important of social questions and the views on wider and subjects that
  have given him such a great reputation.</p>
<p> It is this &#8212; that a question of the utmost practical importance thus
  leads to questions beside which in our deeper moments the practical sinks into
  insignificance; that the philosopher whose authority is now invoked to deny
  to the any right to the physical basis of life in this world is also the philosopher
  whose authority darkens to many all hope of life hereafter &#8212; that has
  made it seem to me worth while to enter into an examination which in its form
  must
  be personal, and that will lead me to treat at greater length than I would
  otherwise be inclined to those utterances of Mr. Spencer which I propose to
  discuss.</p>
<p> I shall not ask the reader to accept anything from me. All I ask of him is
  to judge for himself Mr. Spencer's own public declarations. The respect for
  authority, the presumption in favor of those who have won intellectual reputation,
  is within reasonable limits, both prudent and becoming. But it should not bc
  carried too far, and there are some things especially as to which it behooves
  us all to use our own judgment and maintain free minds. For not only does the
  history of the world show that undue deference to authority has been the potent
  agency through which errors have been enthroned and superstitions perpetuated,
  but there are regions of thought in which the largest powers and the greatest
  acquirements cannot guard against aberrations or assure deeper insight. One
  may stand on a box and look over the head of his fellows, but he no better
  sees the stars. The telescope and the microscope reveal depths which to the
  unassisted vision are closed. Yet not merely do they bring us no nearer to
  the cause of suns and animalcula, but in looking through them the observer
  must shut his eyes to what lies about him. That intension is at the expense
  of extension is seen in the mental as in the physical sphere. A man of special
  learning may be a fool as to common relations. And that he who passes for an
  intellectual prince may be a moral pauper there are examples enough to show.</p>
<p> As we must go to the shoemaker if we would be well shod and to the tailor
  if we would be well clad, so as to special branches of knowledge must we rely
  on those who have studied them. But while yielding to reputation the presumption
  in its favor, and to authority the respect that is its due, let us not too
  much underrate our own powers in what is concerned with common facts and general
  relations. While we may not be scientists or philosophers, we too are men.
  Let us remember that there is no religious superstition that has not been taught
  by professed teachers of religious truth; that there is no vulgar economic
  fallacy that may not be found in the writings of professors; no social vagary
  current among &quot;the ignorant&quot; whose roots may not be discovered among &quot;the
  educated and cultured.&quot; The power to reason correctly on general subjects
  is not to be learned in schools, nor does it come with special knowledge. It
  results from care in separating, from caution in combining, from the habit
  of asking ourselves the meaning of the words we use and making sure of one
  step before building another on it &#8212; and above all, from loyalty to truth.</p>
<p> Giving to Mr. Spencer, therefore, the presumption that is due to his great
  reputation, but at the same time using his own reason, let the reader consider
  the matter I shall lay before him.</p>
<p> Herbert Spencer's last volume, <em>Justice</em>, contains his latest word on the land
  question &#8212; the question in which, as I believe, lies the only solution
  of all the vexed and threatening social and political problems of our time.
  Accompanied, as it has been, by the withdrawal of earlier utterances, it places
  him definitely on the side of those who contend that the treatment of land
  as private property cannot equitably be interfered with, a position the reverse
  of that he once ably asserted.</p>
<p> While the opinions of a man of such wide reputation and large influence,
  on a question already passing into the domain of practical politics and soon
  to become the burning question of the time, are most worthy of attention, they
  derive additional importance from the fact of this change. For a change from
  a clearly reasoned opinion to its opposite carries the implication of fair
  and full consideration. And if the reasons the reason for such a change be
  sufficient and there be no suspicion of ulterior motive, the fact that a man
  now condemns opinions he once held adds to the admiration that previously we
  may have entertained for him the additional admiration we must feel for one
  who has shown that he would rather be right than be inconsistent.</p>
<p> What gives additional interest to the matter is that Mr. Spencer makes no
  change in his premises,  but only in his conclusion,
  and now, in sustaining private property in land, asserts the same principle
  of equal liberty from which he originally deduced its condemnation. How he
  has been led to this change becomes, therefore, a most interesting inquiry,
  not merely from the great importance of the subject itself, but the light it
  must throw on the logical processes of so eminent a philosopher.</p>
<p> Since no one else has attempted it, it seems incumbent on me to examine this
  change and its grounds. For not only do I hold the opinions which Mr. Spencer
  now controverts, but I have been directly and indirectly instrumental in giving
  to his earlier conclusions a much greater circulation than his own books would
  have given them. It is due, therefore, that I should make his rejection of
  these conclusions as widely known as I can, and thus correct the mistake of
  those who couple us together as holding views he now opposes.</p>
<p> To fairly weigh Mr. Spencer's present opinion on the land question, and to
  comprehend his reasons for the change, it is necessary to understand his previous
  position. Beginning, therefore, with his first declaration, I propose to trace
  his public expressions on this subject to the present time, and, that no injustice
  may be done him, to print them in full. In what follows the reader will find
  what Mr. Spencer has published on the land question from 1850 to 1892, and,
  by the difference in type, may readily distinguish his utterances from my comments.</p>
