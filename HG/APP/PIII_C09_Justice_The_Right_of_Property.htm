  <p>      <strong>CHAPTER IX &#8212; <em>JUSTICE</em>&#8212;THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY </strong>
    </p>
</div>
<p> In <em>Justice</em> as in <em>Social Statics</em>, the chapter on the right to land is followed
  by a chapter on the right of property. That in <em>Social Statics</em> I have reprinted
  in full, to meet Mr. Spencer's subsequent assertion that it modified the radical
  conclusions of the preceding chapter. But it is hardly necessary thus to treat
  the similar chapter of <em>Justice</em>. It begins (Section 54):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Since all material objects capable of being owned are in one way or other
      obtained from the earth, it results that the right of property is originally
      dependent on the right to the use of the earth. While there were yet no artificial
      products, and natural products were therefore the only things which could be
      appropriated, this was an obviously necessary connection. And though, in our
      developed form of society, there are multitudinous possessions, ranging from
      houses, furniture, clothes, works of art, to bank-notes, railway shares, mortgages,
      government bonds, etc., the origins of which have no manifest relation to use
      of the earth; yet it needs but to remember that they either are, or represent,
      products of labor, that labor is made possible by food, and that food is obtained
      from the soil, to see that the connection, though remote and entangled, still
      continues. Whence it follows that a complete ethical justification for the
      right of property is involved in the same difficulties as the ethical justification
      for the right to the use of the earth.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Since all material things capable of being owned consist either of land or
  products of land, the roundabout connection between such things as are here
  specified and the earth, through the food consumed by laborers, is a queer
  one, which indicates what in some parts of <em>Social Statics</em> may be suspected,
  that in speaking of land Mr. Spencer, as is often the case with English writers,
  is really thinking only of agricultural land.</p>
<p> The difficulties of which he speaks are the difficulties he raises in <em>Social
  Statics</em>, by confounding equal rights with joint rights, and he here again takes
  issue with Locke and assumes, as before, that for production to give title,
  the right of the producer to the use of material must be shown to be &quot;greater
  than the pre-existing rights of all other men put together.&quot; The forty-one
  years that have elapsed have left Mr. Spencer still entangled by this self-raised
  difficulty. But he now goes on to say that the difficulty arising from the
  question whether by labor &quot;a man has made his right to the thing greater
  than the pre-existing rights of all other men put together<font size="-1"><strong><em>23</em></strong></font> &#8230; may be
  avoided however. There are three ways in which, under savage, semi-civilized,
  and civilized conditions, men's several rights of property may be established
  with due regard to the equal rights of all other men.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>23</strong> Mr. Spencer speaks of such usages as that an unsuccessful
      hunter in passing might take a deer from a trap for food, leaving head,
      skin, and saddle
    for the owner, as implying the belief of the tribesmen that &quot;this prey
    was in part theirs before it was killed. &#8212; But it no more implies this
      than the custom by which, among the early California rancheros, any traveler
      might
      catch a fresh horse, transfer his saddle and leave the tired one implied
      common property in horses, or than the kindly customs of essentially the
      same kind
      that are to be found wherever the struggle for existence that has developed
      with our civilization has not become intense.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> In the savage condition, he says there is a tacit agreement that having equal
  opportunities of utilizing such products, appropriation achieved by one shall
  be passively assented to by the others.</p>
<p> As to the semi-civilized condition, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">We meet with usages having the same general implications. &#8230; It is perceived
      that the assent of the clan to ownership of food grown on an appropriated portion
      by any one, is implied in the assumptions of kindred ownership similarly established
      by all others &#8230; In this case then as in the first, the right of property
      arises in conformity with the law of equal freedom.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> So far then Mr. Spencer derives, and properly derives, the right of property
  from the exertion of labor under conditions in which all are equally free to
  make use of land. He now comes to his third division, where he is to show how
  in civilized conditions the right of property &quot;may be established with
  due regard to the equal rights of all other men.&quot; I will quote this in
  full:</p>
<p> Though we cannot say that ownership of property, thus arising, results from
  actual contract between each member of the community and the community as a
  whole, yet there is something like a potential contract; and such potential
  contract might grow into an actual contract if one part of the community devoted
  itself to other occupations, while the rest continued to farm: a share of the
  produce being in such case payable by agreement to those who had ceased to
  be farmers, for the use of their shares of the land.<font size="-1"><strong><em>24</em></strong></font> We have no evidence
  that such a relation between occupiers and the community, with consequent authorized
  rights of property in the produce which remained after payment of a portion
  equivalent to rent, has ever arisen; for, as we have seen, the original ownership
  by the community has habitually been usurped by internal or external aggressors,
  and the rent taking the shape, if not of produce, then of labor or military
  service, has been habitually paid to the usurper, a state of things under which
  equitable rights of property, in common with equitable rights of all kinds,
  are submerged. But out of such usurpations there has grown up, as we have seen,
  ownership by the state and tenancy under it; from which there may again arise
  a theoretically equitable right of property. In China where &quot;the land
  is all held directly from the Crown&quot; &quot;on payment of an annual tax,&quot; with
  composition for personal service to the government,&quot; the legitimate proprietorship
  of such produce as remains after payment of rent to the community, can be asserted
  only on the assumption that the emperor stands for the community. In India,
  where the government is supreme landowner, and where, until the zemindar system
  was established, it was the direct receiver of rents, the derivation of a right
  of property by contract between the individual and the community can be still
  less asserted without a strained interpretation. Nor at home, where the theory
  that each landowner is a tenant of the Crown is little more than a theory,
  is there any better fulfillment of the ethical requirement. Only here and there,
  where state ownership is not potential but actual, and ordinary rents are paid
  by occupiers to the Crown (which has now in such cases come to be identified
  with the community), has there been consequently established that kind of use
  of the earth which gives a theoretically valid basis to the right of private
  property.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">24 Here is another instance of the habit of thinking of
      land as only agricultural land. The assumption here is that farmers are
      the only users of land, whereas
      the obvious truth is that there is no occupation that can be carried on
      without the use of land, and that many other occupations require the use
      of much more
      valuable land than does farming. In the occupancy of his London apartments
      Mr. Spencer himself is more of a land-user, value considered, than many
      a small farmer.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Now what is it that Mr. Spencer here says? It is that a theoretically equitable
  right of property does not now exist in civilized conditions; but that it may
  arise if the now nominal and potential supreme ownership of land by the state
  is made real and actual by the taking for the use of the community, by the
  representatives of the community, of the rents that are (or should be) paid
  by occupiers of land.</p>
<p> Truly <em>Justice</em> is a surprising book. Here we have Mr. Spencer going back to
  the very principle he has just recanted.</p>
<p> In one sentence of this paragraph he says that we have no evidence that this
  equitable adjustment of the rights to land in conformity with the needs of
  the civilized state has ever arisen, since the original ownership of land by
  the community has been habitually usurped, and in another sentence he says
  vaguely that it has arisen only here and there. But that it may arise and ought
  to arise, and would give an even theoretically perfect basis to the right of
  property, this section states, if not as clearly, but yet on careful reading
  as unmistakably as does<em> Social Statics</em> itself.</p>
<p> The paragraph just quoted is followed by this recapitulatory paragraph, with
  which the section closes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">But admitting that the establishment of an ethically complete right of property
      is beset with difficulties like those which beset the establishment of an ethically
      complete right to the use of the earth, we are nevertheless shown by a survey
      of the facts which existing primitive societies present, and the facts traceable
      in the early histories of civilized societies, that the right of property is
      originally deducible from the law of equal freedom; and that it ceases to be
      so deducible only when the other corollaries from the law of equal freedom
      have been disregarded.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Or to put this statement of the propositions of this section in fuller form,
  they are: (1) That the establishment of the right of property is beset by the
  difficulties of showing that the right of a man to the material element from
  which property is obtained is greater than the rights of all existing men put
  together. (2) But in primitive societies and in the early history of civilized
  societies, where the use of land is open to all, this equality of access to
  land enables us to deduce the right of property in things produced by labor
  from the law of equal freedom; and (3) it ceases to be so deducible where equality
  in the use of land is denied, as in civilized societies at present; but would
  again become deducible from the law of equal freedom if the rent of land were
  taken for the use of the society.</p>
<p> If Mr. Spencer had written <em>Justice</em> under coercion; if imprisoned in the chambers
  of an Inquisition, and under fear of the rack, he had been forced against his
  will, like Galileo, to recant what he still held to be true, we might well
  believe that this Section 54 of <em>Justice</em> contained his sign to posterity that,
  in spite of the denials he had just been compelled to make, he in his heart
  held to the truth.</p>
<p> But though, unfortunately, the conditions do not admit of such a conclusion,
  this section is perhaps an even stronger testimony to the power of truth. In
  the preceding chapter Mr. Spencer has forced back his better nature, and defended
  landlordism as well as the man who had written <em>Social Statics </em>could. But when
  after an interval of over forty years he begins to rewrite his old chapter
  on &quot;The Right of Property,&quot; the truth he once held reasserts its
  sway, and though he cuts out all that might give open offence to his new clients,
  the perception of truth, as by &quot;unconscious cerebration,&quot; causes
  him in the very first section to relapse, and to tell us &#8212; unmistakably,
  if not clearly &#8212; that in the civilized state it is only the appropriation
  of rent to the use of the whole community that can give to property an ethical
  basis.</p>
<p> But Mr. Spencer soon recovers himself. Having in Section 54 shown that in
  rude societies there is a substantial basis for the right of property, but
  that in highly civilized countries, such as England, the equitable right of
  property has been submerged by the usurpation of landownership, he proceeds
  in Section 55 to assert, as he did in the preceding that the course of modern
  civilization has been more fully to establish this right.</p>
<p> Section 55 begins:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">This deduction [i.e., of the right of property from the law of equal freedom
      through the equal right to the use of land], early recognized in custom and
      afterwards formulated by legislators, has come to be elaborated and enforced
      more and more fully as society has developed.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Then comes something about primitive societies, the patriarchal group and
  the house community, in which occurs the reference to inherent value already
  quoted on page 51, and the section thus closes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">To trace the development of the right of property as established by rulers
      and administered by their agents, setting out with the interdict on theft in
      the Hebrew commandments, and continuing down to modern days, in which proprietorships
      of all kinds have been legally formulated in multitudinous detail and with
      great precision, would be no less out of place than it would be superfluous.
      It suffices for present purposes to note that this implication of the principle
      of justice, perceived from the first perhaps more clearly than any other, has
      gained in the course of social progress increased definiteness of recognition
      as well as increased extension and increased peremptoriness; so that now, breach
      of the right of property by unauthorized appropriation of a turnip or a few
      sticks, has become a punishable offence; and there is ownership of a song,
      of a pattern, of a trade-mark.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The principle of justice in the right of property perceived from the first,
  as Mr. Spencer has just explained, is equality in the use of natural opportunities.
  Has this principle gained by a social progress, which as exemplified in England,
  now denies nineteen-twentieths of the people of all right whatever in the land
  of their birth, punishes them if they take a handful of wild fruit or a few
  sticks from the abundant offerings of nature, creates private ownership in
  a salmon-fishery, a coal mine, an advowson or a hereditary pension, and condemns
  millions to chronic pauperism?</p>
<p> This is what Mr. Spencer's examination of the right of property in <em>Justice</em>  amounts to: First showing that the right of property in civilized societies
  has today no ethical basis, he goes on to make believe that it has, and from
  this basis of make-believe to assume the ethical validity of existing conditions.
  And then he virtuously turns on the communists. They are a feeble folk and
  have no friends.</p>
<p> In this he follows the order of <em>Social Statics</em>, but the spirit is that of
  <em>The Man versus the State</em>. He ignores what he once saw plainly, the incentive
  to communistic and socialistic schemes in the bitter wrong and widespread suffering
  of the existing order, declares their motive to be the desire to take from
  the worker the produce of his work, and assumes that between them and existing
  social conditions lies the only choice. Here is the section:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">&sect; 56. Supposing themselves to be justified, and indeed
      enjoined by moral principle, many in our days are seeking to override this
      right. They think
      it wrong that each man should receive benefits proportionate to his efforts&#8212;deny
      that he may properly keep possession of all which his labor has produced, leaving
      the less capable in possession of all which their labors have produced. Expressed
      in its briefest form, their doctrine is&#8212;Let unlike kinds and amounts
      of work bring like shares of produce&#8212;let there be &quot;equal division
      of unequal earnings.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> That communism implies violation of justice as defined
      in foregoing chapters, is manifest. When we assert the liberty of each
      bounded only by the like liberties
      of all, we assert that each is free to keep for himself all those gratifications
      and sources of gratification which he procures without trespassing on the
      spheres of action of his neighbors. If, therefore, one obtains by his greater
      strength,
      greater ingenuity, or greater application, more gratifications or sources
      of gratification than others, and does this without in any way trenching
      on the
      of action of others, the law of equal freedom assigns him exclusive possession
      of all such extra gratifications and of sources of gratification; nor can
      others take them from him without claiming for themselves greater liberty
      of action
      than he claims, and thereby violating the law.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> In past times the arrangements made were such that the few superior profited
      at the expense of the many inferior. It is now proposed to make arrangements
      such that the many inferior shall profit at the expense of the few superior.
      And just as the old social system was assumed by those who maintained it to
      be equitable, so is this new social system assumed to be by those who propose
      it. Being, as they think, undoubtedly right, this distribution may properly
      be established by force; for the employment of force, if not avowedly contemplated
      by implication. With a human nature such as has been known throughout the past
      and is known at present, one who, by higher power, bodily or mental, or greater
      endurance of work, gains more than others gain, will not voluntarily surrender
      the excess to such others: here and there may be found a man who would do this,
      but he is far from being the average man. And if the average superior man will
      not voluntarily surrender to others the excess of benefit gained by his superiority,
      the implication is that he must be obliged to do this, and that the use of
      force to oblige him is justifiable. That the many inferior are physically able
      thus to coerce the few superior is agreed on both sides, but the assumption
      of the communists is that the required coercion of the minority who are best
      by the majority who are worst would be equitable.</font></p>
  <p> <font size="-1">After what was said in the early chapter of this Part it scarcely needs pointing
    out that a system established in pursuance of this doctrine would entail degeneration
    of citizens and decay of the community formed by them. Suspension of that natural
    discipline by which every kind of creature is kept fit for the activities demanded
    by the conditions of life, would inevitably bring about unfitness for life
    and either prompt or slow disappearance.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> An old fable tells us that when the plague raged among the animals they concluded
  that among them was some great criminal, who must be sacrificed to the wrath
  of heaven, and agreed that to discover him all should confess their sins. The
  fox volunteered to act as judge. He listened with equanimity to the lion's
  recital of flocks devoured and men slaughtered, declaring his majesty blameless,
  and in the same way excused all that the tiger, the hyena, the wolf, and the
  bear confessed. At length came a poor ass, who told how when his master had
  forgotten to give him his breakfast, he had nibbled a few leaves from his load
  of cabbages. &quot;You impious rascal!&quot; cried the fox, &quot;it is you
  beyond doubt who have brought on us the anger of the gods!&quot; and applauding
  the decision and following his lead, the lordly animals threw themselves on
  the poor ass and tore him to pieces.</p>
<p> As the nibbling of a cabbage-leaf is to Herod's slaughter of the innocents,
  so is the dream of a few communists compared with what the monopoly of land
  is actually doing. In the highest civilization in other respects that the world
  has yet seen this monopoly is, even now, entailing the degradation of citizens
  and decay of the community, so that Mr. Spencer cannot look out of the windows
  of his club without seeing men turned into advertising signs; or get into a
  cab without having some miserable wretch officiously hasten to close the door
  in the hope of a penny; or travel through the three kingdoms without beholding
  the decay of population in the country and its congestion in the slums of towns.
  It is, even now, suspending &quot;that natural discipline by which every creature
  is kept fit for the activities demanded by the conditions of life,&quot; so
  that men are being destroyed, one the one side by repletion and debauchery,
  and on the other side by privation and the denial of opportunities for honest
  work. It is, even now, taking the produce of their work from superior worker
  and inferior worker alike, and is giving the gratifications and sources of
  gratification earned by work to those who do no work&#8212;is piling up wealth
  in the hands of those who do nothing to produce wealth, who as landowners are
  useless appropriators and worse than useless destroyers. To this giant wrong,
  this most monstrous of all denials of the law of equal freedom, Mr. Spencer
  is as complaisant as the fox was to the lion, while he vents his indignation
  on the poor ass of communism.</p>
<p> The next and final chapter shows how far Mr. Spencer really wishes to assert
  the right of property. It was, as he knows, by violating the right of property
  in putting taxes on the products of labor that the larger tenants of English
  land made themselves its virtual owners and that private property in land has
  come to be established in those wide regions to which English institutions
  have been extended. And it is on the line of abolishing this taxation of labor
  and the products of labor that, as is now evident, the struggle for the resumption
  of equal rights in land will in English-speaking countries be made&#8212;nay,
  is already beginning to be made. So in the next section Mr. Spencer brings
  out his double-barrelled ethics to break down the right of property to open
  the door for what is essentially socialism and communism in the interests of
  the rich:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">&sect; 57. While absolute ethics thus asserts the right
      of property, and while no such breach of it as is implied by the schemes
      of communists is
    warranted by that relative ethics which take account of transitional needs,
    relative
      ethics dictates such limitation of it as is necessitated for defraying
    the costs of protection, national and individual.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> The truth recognized at the outset, that the preservation of the species,
      or that variety of it constituting a nation, is an end which must take precedence
      of individual preservation has already been cited as justifying that subordination
      of the right to life which is implied by exposure to possible death in defensive
      war, and as also justifying that subordination of the right to liberty which
      military service and subjection necessitate. Here it must be again cited as
      affording a legitimate reason for appropriating such portions of the possessions
      and the earnings of individuals, as may be required for adequately resisting
      enemies. But while there is thus a quasi-ethical justification for whatever
      encroachment on the right of property is necessitated for the purposes of defensive
      war, there is no justification for any such encroachment for the purposes of
      offensive war.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> No less manifest is it that the right of property is legitimately
      subject to one further restriction. Property must be trenched upon for
      supporting those
      public administrations by which the right of property, and all other rights,
      are enforced. In society wholly composed of men who duly respected on another's
      claims, no such partial invasion of the right o property would be called
      for; but in existing societies and in such societies as are likely to exist
      for
      a long time to come, the nearest approach to fulfillment of the law of
      equal freedom is made when the various deduced rights are sacrificed to
      the extent
      needful for preservation of the remainders. Relative ethics, therefore,
      warrants such equitably distributed taxation as is required for maintaining
      order and
      safety.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Since the ethical commands, &quot;Thou shalt do no murder&quot; and &quot;Thou
  shalt not steal,&quot; mean also, thou shalt not permit thyself to be murdered
  or to be stolen from, the justification of defensive war needs no invention
  of relative ethics. Nor this needed to justify under extraordinary circumstance
  what under ordinary circumstances would be violations of the right of property.
  Take Johnstown, when the sun rose on wreck and ruin and death in their most
  awful forms, and on men and women half crazed with listening all night to the
  shrieks that came from the flaming mass of float-wood into which the flood
  was sweeping their nearest and dearest. In ordering the destruction of all
  liquor, the seizing of all food, and the impressment, should that be necessary,
  of all who could work, in a systematized effort to succor who still might
  be succored and to bury what remained to bury of the dead, was not Arthur
  Moxham acting, in the name of the reason and conscience of the community, on
  the same eternal principles of right and wrong that in ordinary conditions
  would have forbidden these things? What in form was a denial of the rights
  of property and person was in its essence respect for life and property.</p>
<p> But while changing conditions may change the application of ethical principles,
  it is only as the change in a ship's course turns the compass-card in her binnacle.
  The change is in the conditions, not in the principles. And if there be an
  ethical <em>right</em> of property, then, except under conditions of imminent danger
  and dire stress, a community cannot be justified in taking property by force
  from the individual.</p>
<p> What Mr. Spencer does in this section, in the name of his convenient fiction
  of relative ethics, is to justify the habitual violations of the right of property
  which are committed under the name of government in all civilized countries,
  and thus to make his philosophy of things as they ought to be, conform the
  better with things as the ruling classes desire to maintain them. And he does
  this effectually, for he leaves the right of property without defense, save
  in idle platitudes, against those forms of taxation which have everywhere proved
  so efficient in robbing the many and enriching the few.</p>
<p> To be sure Mr. Spencer justifies the taking of property by taxation only
  for purposes of defensive war and the maintenance of order and safety. But
  such limitations are practically no limitations. Neither an English jingo nor
  an American protectionist would quarrel with them. No invading foot has trod
  English soil, no hostile fleet has fired a shot at an English town, since the
  English national debt began to form. Yet what one of all the wars for which
  the English masses have paid in blood and privation and of which this great
  debt is the reminder, has not been advocated at the time as a defensive war?
  Is not our monstrous American tariff declared by its advocates to be necessary
  to the maintenance of order and safety? What has been the assigned reason for
  the maintenance of every fat English sinecure but order and safety?</p>
<p> Granted that Mr. Spencer would abolish the more flagrant abuses of taxation;
  or, as in the light of his changes on the land question we may more certainly
  say, granted that he is in favor of abolishing them so long as Sir John and
  Grace do not seriously object; yet in admitting that the right of property
  may justly be set aside by the state for ordinary public needs and uses, he
  opens the door for every abuse that the ruling power &#8212; the majority,
  if you please &#8212; may at any time choose to deem a use. He leaves no principle
  save the shifting one of expediency to guard the right of property against
  any interest or desire or whim the may gain control of the legislative power.</p>
<p> But the reign of relative ethics, like that of the fashioned devil, to which
  it bears some analogy, is not to be forever, for we are given to understand
  that when evolution has carried the descendants of what are now the human race
  to a point as far above us as it has carried us above the monkey, and brought
  on the agnostic millennium, relative ethics are to vanish in the unknowable
  pit. So Mr. Spencer tells us that &quot;in a society composed of men who duly
  respected one another's claims, no such partial invasion of the rights of property
  would be called for.&quot; But then, he continues, it is called for &quot;in
  existing societies and in such societies as are likely to exist for a long
  time to come.&quot; What ground does that give me to assert that I am robbed
  directly by the blackmail demanded in the name of duty at the American post-office
  every time a friend sends me a book from a foreign country, or even from Canada,
  and am robbed indirectly every day of my life in the purchases I make? The
  protectionist, if a Spencerian and disposed to argue, would simply reply, &quot;You
  are talking absolute ethics, whereas, Herbert Spencer has shown, we are now
  under the rule of relative ethics.&quot;</p>
<p> It is true, but in a sense that Mr. Spencer does not mean, that if men duly
  respected one another's claims, taking of individual property in taxation by
  the state would be necessary. For if men duly respected one another's claims
  to the use of land, all necessity for invading the right of property by taxation
  would disappear. Either by the single tax on land values or by the crude and
  clumsy scheme of land nationalization proposed by Mr. Spencer himself in Social
  Statics, enough revenue would accrue to the state to defray all needed expenses
  without taking a penny of any man's property. But if men are to continue to
  disregard each other's claims to the use of land, and to continue to treat
  that element as belonging to a few individuals &#8212; and this Mr. Spencer
  now insists on &#8212; then there is no possible improvement in society or
  in the race that could dispense with the taking of property by taxation.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer evidently entertains the innocent notion that could the soldier
  and the policeman be done away with, there would be no further need for public
  revenues, and all organized government could be dispensed with. But would not
  civilized societies still need revenues for building and keeping roads and
  bridges, for paving and cleaning streets, or establishing lighthouses and supporting
  a fire service, and doing the many things which become increasingly necessary
  to the public health, safety, comfort, and convenience, as social integration
  goes on? Or in the millennium of the Spencerians, as in the millennium of the
  anarchists, is each one to pave, clean and light the street before his door,
  when and how he pleases? are roads, bridges and public works, as to which competition
  is impossible, to be left to private individuals and companies, charging what
  they please and rendering what service they choose? and are all other public
  functions to be dependent on volunteer service or voluntary subscription? </p>
