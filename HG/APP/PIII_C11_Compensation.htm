      <p><strong>          Chapter XI &#8212; Compensation </strong>
          </p>
    </div>
    <p> While not needed in reply to Mr. Spencer, for his own scornful denial that
  there is any way in which land can equitably become private property remains
  unanswered by him, the wide prevalence of the idea that justice requires the
  compensation of land-owners if their exclusive ownership be abolished, makes
  it worth consideration; the more so as the same principle is involved in other
  questions, which are already, or may soon become, of practical importance.</p>
<p> That this idea will not bear examination Mr. Spencer himself shows, even
  when, as now, he is more than willing to be understood as accepting it. While
  anxious to find some ground, any ground, for assuming that land-owners are
  entitled to compensation <em>for something</em> equal or more than equal to
  the value of their land, he nowhere ventures to assert that they are entitled
  to compensation
  <em>for their land</em>. Such a notion is too preposterous to be stated by
  any one who has ever realized the relation of men to land.</p>
<p> Yet to those who have not, it seems at first most reasonable, for it accords
  with accustomed ideas. If it were ever customary for primitive man to eat his
  grandmother, as the Synthetic Philosophy would lead us to suppose, she must
  have been thought a wicked old woman who without compensation to the would-be
  eater tried to avoid that fate. In a community such as Edmond About pictured
  in his <em>King of the Mountain</em>, where brigandage was looked on as a most respectable
  business, the captive who tried to escape without ransom would be deemed a
  violator of his captors' rights. And many a man now living can appreciate Mark
  Twain's portrayal of the pangs of conscience felt by Huckleberry Finn as he
  thought that in not denouncing his negro companion he was helping to rob a
  poor widow.</p>
<p> The habitual confusion of thought where violations of property have long
  been treated by custom and law as property, requires time and effort to escape
  from, and while justice is yet struggling for recognition there is with many
  a desire to compromise between the right that ought to be and the wrong that
  is. Thus there are today, in England at least, even among those who to some
  extent have become conscious of the injustice of denying the equal right to
  the use of land, many who think that before this natural right can be equitably
  asserted present landowners must be compensated for their loss of legal rights.</p>
<p> This idea does not apply to the land question alone. It was carried out in
  England in the compensation paid to West India slave-owners on the abolition
  of slavery; in the compensation paid to the owners of rotten Irish boroughs
  at the time of the Union for the loss of their power to sell legislation; in
  the capitalization of hereditary pensions; and in the compensation paid to
  their holders when profitable sinecures are abolished.</p>
<p> Nor are we without examples of the same idea in the United States. It is
  often contended that it would be wrong to abolish protective duties where capital
  has been invested on the expectation of their continuance; and not many years
  since, even in the North, good, honest people, so far awake to the crime of
  slavery that they deemed the original enslavement of a man wickedness so atrocious
  as to merit death &#8212; which indeed was the penalty denounced by our laws
  against engaging in the external slave-trade &#8212; really believed that slave-owners
  must be compensated before existing slavery could be justly abolished. Even
  after the war had fairly begun, this idea was so strong that the nation compensated
  owners when, in 1862, slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia, and
  subsequent efforts to apply the same principle to the slave States that adhered
  to the Union were defeated only by the opposition to any national interference
  with slavery.</p>
<p> Let us see clearly what this question of compensation is:</p>
<p> It does not involve the validity of any contract or agreement or promise
  formally made by the state. This does not exist and is not pleaded by the advocates
  of compensation in the cases we are considering. If it did, the question would
  arise how far legislative power may bind legislative power, and one generation
  control the action of succeeding generations. But it is not necessary to discuss
  that here.</p>
<p> It is not a question of all right of compensation. That the state should
  compensate when it destroys a building to make way for a public improvement,
  or takes goods or provisions or horses or shipping for which it may have sudden
  need, or demands of some citizens services which it does not demand of others,
  is not a question. The right of compensation in such cases is not disputed.</p>
<p> That is to say it is not a question whether the state should pay for its
  destruction of property having moral sanction, for the assertion of moral sanction
  involves the right of compensation. Where the right of compensation itself
  becomes the issue is only where the want of moral sanction in the property
  in question is conceded.</p>
<p> Thus the belief in the rightfulness of compensation for the abolition of
  slavery bore no determining part in the minds of those who believed in the
  rightfulness of slavery. The pro-slavery men, who asserted that slavery was
  of God's ordinance, that it was the natural right and duty of the stronger
  to enslave the weaker so they might paternally care for them, who insisted
  not merely that slavery ought not to be abolished where it existed, but that
  it ought to be extended where it did not exist, were not affected by belief
  in the rightfulness of compensation. That slave-owners ought to be compensated
  if slavery was abolished followed from their assertion that slavery was right
  and ought not to be abolished. It was only in the minds of those who had come
  to think that slavery was wrong and ought to be abolished, that the idea that
  slaveholders must be compensated assumed importance, and became the pivotal
  question.</p>
<p> So as to land. The idea of compensation is raised and has importance only
  where it serves as a secondary defense of private property in land. If a man
  believes in private property in land it is needless to address to him any argument
  for the necessity of compensation on its abolition. He does not believe in
  its abolition, but in its continuance and extension; and as the greater includes
  the less, he already believes in the necessity of compensation if it be abolished.
  But if he has come to doubt its justice and to favor its abolition, then the
  raising of the question of compensation, as though it were a new and separate
  moral question, may serve the purpose of a second embankment or second ditch
  in military defense, and prevent him from advocating abolition, or at least
  abolition that would cause any loss to vested interests. And the intermediate
  character of this defense of vested wrong gives it of course great attractions
  for those timid and prudent souls who when moral right comes in conflict with
  powerful interests like to keep out of the battle.</p>
<p> Thus the idea of compensation with which we are concerned is the idea of
  compensation for the abolition of something in itself conceded to be wrong.
  Yet it is based on moral grounds, and raises what is purely a moral question.</p>
<p> Those who assert this necessity of compensation for the abolition of what
  in itself they concede to be wrong contend that the state has incurred a moral
  obligation by its previous acquiescence. They say that while it would be right
  for it to refuse such acquiescence in the first place &#8212; as to prohibit
  slavery where it does not yet exist; to refrain from making private property
  of new land; to refuse to grant new pensions or impose new protective duties
  or grant new special privileges &#8212; yet where it has already done such
  things the state is morally bound to those who have accepted its action; and
  for it
  to destroy the value of property already acquired under its sanction would
  be in the nature of a retroactive law.</p>
<p> But in this there is evident confusion. If it were proposed that the state
  should undo what has already been done under its sanction &#8212; as, for instance,
  that it should declare invalid titles to the proceeds of slave labor already
  rendered, and give the slaves legal claim for previous services; or if it should
  call on the beneficiaries of protective tariffs for profits they had already
  acquired &#8212; then this reasoning might have weight. But it is not retroactive
  to declare that for the future the labor of the slave shall belong to himself,
  nor that for the future trade shall be free. To demand compensation for action
  of this kind is to assert, not that the state must be bound by what it has
  already done, but that what it has already done it is morally bound to continue
  to do.</p>
<p> The loss for which compensation is in such cases asked is not the loss of
  a value in hand, but the loss of an expectation. The value of a bale of cotton
  is an actual existing value, based on work done. But the value of a slave is
  not actual, but prospective; it is not based
  on work done, but on the expectation that the state will continue to compel
  him to work for his owner. So the value of a house or other improvement represents
  the present value of the labor thus embodied. But the value of land itself
  represents merely the value of the expectation that the state will continue
  to permit the holder to appropriate a value belonging to all. Now, is the state
  called on to compensate men for the failure of their expectations as to its
  action, even where no moral element is involved? If it make peace, must it
  compensate those who have invested on the expectation of war? If it open a
  shorter highway, is it morally bound to compensate those who may lose by the
  diversion of travel from the old one? If it promote the discovery of a cheap
  means of producing electricity directly from heat, is it morally bound to compensate
  the owners of all the steam-engines thereby thrown out of use and all who are
  engaged in making them? If it develop the airship, must it compensate those
  whose business would be injured? Such a contention would be absurd. Yet the
  contention we are considering is worse. It is that the state must compensate
  for disappointing the expectations of those who have counted on its continuing
  to do wrong.</p>
<p> When the state abolishes slavery or hereditary pensions or protective duties
  or special privileges of any kind, does it really take from the individuals
  who thereby lose, anything they actually have? Clearly not. In the abolition
  of slavery it merely declines for the future to compel one man to work for
  another. In the abolition of hereditary pensions it merely declines for the
  future to take property by force from those to whom it rightfully belongs and
  hand it over to others. In the abolition of protective duties it merely declines
  for the future forcibly to interfere with the natural rights of all in order
  that a few may get an unnatural profit. In the abolition of special privileges
  it merely declines for the future to use its power to give some an advantage
  over others.</p>
<p> See, then, for what in such cases compensation is really asked. It is not
  for any attempt to right past wrongs; it is for refusing to do wrong in future.
  It is not for the unequal treatment of individuals; it is for refusal to continue
  unequal treatment. That there may be a loss of saleable value to individuals
  in this refusal is true. But it is not a loss of anything they now have; it
  is a loss of what they expected to get. It is not a loss for which these individuals
  can justly demand compensation or the state can justly make compensation. It
  is a loss of the kind that the silversmiths of Ephesus sustained from Paul's
  preaching; a loss of the kind that comes to liquor-sellers from the spread
  of a temperance movement; a loss of the kind that falls on some individuals
  with every beneficial invention and every public improvement. Such demand for
  compensation is a denial of any right of reform. It involves the idea that
  the state, having once done wrong, is morally bound to continue it &#8212; not
  merely that it must continue to do wrong or else compensate; but that it must
  continue to do wrong anyhow.</p>
<p> For compensation implies equivalence. To compensate for the discontinuance
  of a wrong is to give those who profit by the wrong the pecuniary equivalent
  of its continuance. Now the state has nothing that does not belong to the individuals
  who compose it. What it gives to some it must take from others. Abolition with
  compensation is therefore not really abolition, but continuance under a different
  form &#8212; on one side of unjust deprivation, and on the other side of unjust
  appropriation. When on the abolition of a hereditary pension the holder is
  compensated, he receives in money or bonds a sum calculated to yield him in
  interest the same power of annually commanding the labor of others that the
  pension gave. So compensation for the selling value of a slave, which disappears
  on the refusal of the community longer to force him to work for the master,
  means the giving to the master of what the power to take the property of the
  slave may be worth. What slave-owners lose is the power of taking the property
  of the slaves and their descendants; and what they get is an agreement that
  the government will take for their benefit and turn over to them an equivalent
  part of the property of all. The robbery is continued under another form. What
  it loses in intention it gains in extension. If some before enslaved are partially
  freed, others before free are partially enslaved.</p>
<p> That confusion alone gives plausibility to the idea of compensation for refusal
  to continue wrong, is seen in the fact that such claims are never put forward
  in behalf of the original beneficiaries of the wrong, but always in behalf
  of purchasers. Sometimes the confusion is that of direct substitution. Thus
  it is sometimes said, &quot;Here is a man who, presuming on the continued consent
  of the state, invests his earnings in property depending on that consent. If
  the state withdraws its consent, does it not, unless it compensates him, destroy
  the products of his hard labor?&quot;</p>
<p> The answer is clear: It does not. Let the property be, for instance, a slave.
  What the state destroys in abolishing slavery is not what may have been given
  for the slave, but the value of the slave. That the purchaser got by honest
  work what he exchanged for the slave is not in point. He is not injured as
  laborer, but as slave-owner. If he had not exchanged his earnings for the slave
  the abolition of slavery would have caused him no loss. When a man exchanges
  property of one kind for property of another kind he gives up the one with
  all its incidents and takes in its stead the other with its incidents. He cannot
  sell bricks and buy hay, and then complain because the hay burned when the
  bricks would not. The greater liability of the hay to burn is one of the incidents
  he accepted in buying it. Nor can he exchange property having moral sanction
  for property having only legal sanction, and claim that the moral sanction
  of the thing he sold attaches now to the thing he bought. That has gone with
  the thing to the other party in the exchange. Exchange transfers, it cannot
  create. Each party gives up what right he had and takes what right the other
  party had. The last holder obtains no moral right that the first holder did
  not have.</p>
<p> &quot;But,&quot; it may be said, &quot;the purchaser of what has been long
  treated as property stands in a different position from the original holder.
  In our administration of justice between man and man, this difference between
  the wrongful appropriator and the innocent purchaser is recognized, and long
  possession is hold to cure defects of original title. This principle ought
  to be recognized by the state in dealing with individuals, and hence when,
  even by omission, it deprives innocent purchasers of what has long been held
  as property it ought to compensate them.&quot;</p>
<p> Innocent purchasers of what involves wrong to others! Is not the phrase absurd?
  If in our legal tribunals, &quot;ignorance of the law excuseth no man,&quot; how
  much less can it do so in the tribunal of morals &#8212; and it is this to
  which compensationists appeal.</p>
<p> And innocence can only shield from the punishment due to conscious wrong;
  it cannot give right. If you innocently stand on my toes, you may fairly ask
  me not to be angry; but you gain no right to continue to stand on them. Now
  in merely abolishing property that involves wrong, the state imposes no penalty,
  it does not even demand recompense to those who have been wronged. In this
  it is more lenient than the principles on which we administer justice between
  man and man. For they would require the innocent purchaser of what belonged
  to another to make restitution, not only of the thing itself, but of all that
  had been received from it. Nor does the principle of market overt, which gives
  to the purchaser of certain things openly sold in certain places, possession
  even against the rightful owner unless he proves fraud; nor the principle of
  statutes of limitation, which refuses to question ownership after a certain
  lapse of time, deny this general principle.</p>
<p> The principle of &quot;market overt&quot; is, not that passage from hand
  to hand gives ownership, but that there are certain things so constantly passing
  from hand to hand by simple transfer that the interests of commerce and the
  general convenience are best served by assuming possession to be conclusive
  of ownership where wrongful intent cannot be proved. The principle of statutes
  of limitation is not that mere length of possession gives ownership, but that
  past a certain point it becomes impossible certainly to adjudicate disputes
  between man and man. This is one of the cases in which human law must admit
  its inadequacy more than roughly to enforce the dictates of the moral law.
  No scheme of religion and no theory of morals would hold him blameless who
  relied on a statute of limitations to keep what he knew belonged morally to
  another. But legal machinery cannot search into the conscience, it can inquire
  only into the evidence; and the evidence of things past is to human perceptions
  quickly dimmed and soon obliterated by the passage of time. So that as to things
  whose ownership must depend on what was done in the past, it is necessary,
  to avoid interminable disputes, that the state should set some limit beyond
  which it will not inquire, but will take possession as proof of ownership.</p>
<p> In our ordinary use of words everything subject to ownership and its incidental
  rights is accounted property. But there are two species of property, which,
  though often ignorantly or wantonly confounded, are essentially different and
  diametrically opposed. Both may be alike in having a selling value and being
  subject to transfer. But things of the one kind are true property, having the
  sanction of natural right and moral law independently of the action of the
  state, while things of the other kind are only spurious property, their maintenance
  as property requiring the continuous exertion of state power, the continuous
  exercise or threat of its force, and involving a continuous violation of natural
  right and moral law. To things of the one kind the reasonable principle of
  statutes of limitation properly applies; for, being in their nature property,
  any question of their ownership is not a question of general right, but only
  a question of transactions between man and man in the past. But to things of
  the other kind, and as between the individual and the state, this principle
  does not and cannot apply, for holding their character as property only from
  the action of the state, that character is gone the moment the state withdraws
  its support. The question whether this support shall or shall not be withdrawn
  is not a question of what was done in the past, but of what shall be done in
  the future &#8212; a question of general rights, not a question between individuals.
  Things which are brought into existence by the exertion of labor, and to which
  the character of property attaches from their origin as an extension of the
  right of the man to himself, are property of the first kind. Special privileges
  by which the state empowers and assists one man in taking the proceeds of another's
  labor, are property of the second kind.</p>
<p> A question of the ownership of a coat, a tool, a house, a bale of goods,
  is a question of the ownership of the concrete results of past labor. We know
  from the nature of the thing that it must be owned by somebody, but after lapse
  of time we cannot from the weakness of human powers undertake in case of dispute
  to determine who that may be; and hence, refusing to inquire so far back, we
  assume the right to be in the possessor, of which we have at least presumptive
  evidence. But a question of the maintenance or abolition of slavery or private
  property in land, of the continuance or non-continuance of a trade monopoly,
  a hereditary pension, or a protective duty, is a question whether the state
  shall or shall not in the future lend its power for the wrongful appropriation
  of the results of labor yet to be performed. There is in this no place for
  the principle of statutes of limitation. No indistinctness as to the past can
  affect the decision. It is not a question of what has been done in the past,
  but of what shall be (lone in the future. And so far from the presumption being
  that the possessor of this species of property is entitled to it, the moral
  certainty is the other way.</p>
<p> Again it is said, &quot;Here is a man who invests in a slave and another
  who invests in a building, both being alike recognized as property by the state.
  The state by refusing longer to give its former sanction destroys the value
  of one investment while the other continues profitable. Have not these two
  men been treated with inequality, which in justice should be remedied by compensation?
  If there was a wrong involved in the one species of property, was it not a
  wrong of which by state sanction all were guilty? Is it just therefore that
  those who have happened to invest in it should bear the whole loss?&quot;'</p>
<p> To other confusions there is here added confusion as to the relation between
  the state and its members. If the maintenance by the state of a species of
  property that involves wrong is to be considered as the action of all its members,
  even of those who suffer by it, so must the resolve of the state to do so no
  longer be considered as the resolve of all, even of those who relatively lose
  by it. If the one cannot demand recompense, how can the others demand compensation?</p>
<p> Passing this, the moral law appealed to in the demand for compensation must
  be the moral law that binds individuals. Now the moral law cannot sanction
  immorality. It must hold as void even a specific contract to do wrong. But
  in the cases we are considering there is no contract. The claim is merely that
  the state by its wrongful action having given rise to the expectation that
  it would continue such wrongful action, is morally bound, should it decline
  to do so, to compensate those who have invested in this expectation. Would
  such a claim hold as between individuals? If, for instance, I have been accustomed
  to spend my earnings in a gambling-house or rum-shop till the proprietor has
  come to count on me as a source of regular profit, am I morally bound to compensate
  him if I stop? Or if an innocent purchaser has bought the business on the expectation
  that I would continue, does that bind me to compensate him?</p>
<p> Consider further: If a moral right of property is created by the acquiescence
  of the state in a wrong, then it must be morally binding on all. If the state
  would violate the moral law in abolishing slavery without compensation, so
  would the slave violate the moral law in attempting to escape without first
  compensating his master, and so would every one who aided him, even with a
  cup of cold water. This was actually held and taught and enacted into law in
  the United States previous to the war, and with reference to the white slaves
  of Great Britain is held and taught by the foremost men and journals of that
  country, who declare that for the masses even by strictly legal forms to resume
  their natural rights in the land of their birth, without compensation to present
  legal owners, would be a violation of the Ten Commandments!</p>
<p> That the state is not an individual, but is composed of individual members
  all of whom must be affected by its action, is the reason why its legitimate
  sphere is that of securing to those members equal rights. This is the equality
  which it is bound to secure, not equality in the results of individual actions;
  and whoever chooses to invest on the presumption of its denial of equal rights
  does so at his own risk. He cannot ask that, to secure equality of profits
  between him and investors who did not take this risk, the state should continue
  to deny equality of rights. It is the duty of the state to secure equality
  of rights, not to secure equality of profits.</p>
<p> Of the investments of all kinds constantly being made under the equal sanction
  of the state some result in loss and some in gain. Supposing it to be asked, &quot;Why
  should not the state secure equality by compensating those who lose?&quot;</p>
<p> The answer would be quick and clear. It is not the business of the state
  to secure investors from loss, and it would be grossly unjust for it to attempt
  to do so. For this would be to compel those who had made good investments to
  make up the losses of those who had made bad ones. It would be to take from
  prudence and care their natural reward and make them bear the losses of recklessness
  and waste; to punish forethought, to put a premium on ignorance and extravagance,
  and quickly to impoverish the richest community.</p>
<p> But would it not be even more unjust and unwise for the state to compensate
  those who up to the last moment had held and bought property involving wrong,
  thus compelling those who had refrained from holding and buying it to make
  up their losses? Is it true that the acquiescence of the state in a wrong of
  this kind proves it equally the wrong of all? Did that part of the community
  consisting of slaves ever acquiesce in slavery? Did the men who were robbed
  of their natural rights in land ever really acquiesce? Are not such wrongs
  always instituted in the first place by those who by force or cunning gain
  control of the state? Are they not maintained by stifling liberty, by corrupting
  morals and confusing thought and buying or gagging the teachers of religion
  and of ethics? Is not any movement for the abolition of such wrongs always
  and of necessity preceded by a long agitation in which their injustice is so
  fully declared that whoever does not wilfully shut his eyes may see it?</p>
<p> &quot;Caveat emptor&quot; is the maxim of the law &#8212; &quot;Let the buyer
  beware!&quot; If a man buys a structure in which the law of gravity is disregarded
  or mechanical laws ignored he takes the risk of those laws asserting their
  sway. And so he takes the risk in buying property which contravenes the moral
  law. When he ignores the moral sense, when he gambles on the continuance of
  a wrong, and when at last the general conscience rises to the point of refusing
  to continue that wrong, can he then claim that those who have refrained from
  taking part in it, those who have suffered from it, those who have borne the
  burden and heat and contumely of first moving against it, shall share in his
  losses on the ground that its members of the same state they are equally responsible
  for it? And must not the acceptance of this impudent plea tend to prevent that
  gradual weakening and dying out of the wrong which would otherwise occur as
  the rise of the moral sense against it lessened the prospect of its continuance;
  and by promise of insurance to investors tend to maintain it in strength and
  energy till the last minute?</p>
<p> Take slavery. The confidence of American slave-holders, strengthened by the
  example of Great Britain, that abolition would not come without compensation,
  kept up to the highest point the market value of slaves, even after the guns
  that were to free them had begun to sound, whereas if there had been no paltering
  with the idea of compensation the growth of the sentiment against slavery would
  by reducing the selling value of slaves have gradually lessened the pecuniary
  interests concerned in supporting it.</p>
<p> Take private property in land. Where the expectation of future growth and
  improvement is in every advancing community a most important element in selling
  value, the effect of the idea of compensation will be to keep up speculation,
  and thus to prevent that lessening in the selling value of land, that gradual
  accommodation of individuals to the coming change, which is the natural effect
  of the growth of the demand for the recognition of equal rights to land.</p>
<p> The question we are discussing is necessarily a moral question. Those who
  contend that the state is the source of all rights may indeed object to any
  proposed state action that it would be inexpedient, but they cannot object
  that it would be wrong. Nevertheless, just as we find the materialistic evolutionists
  constantly dropping into expressions which imply purpose in nature, so do we
  find deniers of any higher law than that of the state vociferous in their declarations
  that it would be wrong, or unjust, or wicked, for the state to abolish property
  of this spurious kind without compensation. The only way we can meet them with
  any regard for their professions is to assume that they do not quite understand
  the language, and that by such expressions they mean that it would be inexpedient.
  Their argument, I take it, may be most fairly put in this way: Experience has
  shown respect for property rights to be greatly conducive to the progress and
  well-being of mankind, and all rights of property resting (as they assert)
  on the same basis, the recognition of the state, the destruction of a recognized
  right of property by action of the state would give a shock to and cast a doubt
  over all rights of property, and thus work injury.</p>
<p> But even if we ignore any moral basis, and assume that all rights of property
  are derived from the state, it is still clear that while some forms of property
  do conduce to the general wealth and prosperity, others may be recognized by
  the state that lessen the general wealth and impair the general prosperity.
  The right of piracy, which at times and places has been recognized by the state,
  does not stand on the same basis of expediency with the right of peaceful commerce.
  The right of hereditary jurisdiction, or &quot;the right of pit and gallows&quot; as
  it was called in Scotland, where it was actually bought out by the state as
  a piece of valuable property; the right, long having a saleable value in France,
  of administering justice; the right, at times recognized by the state as belonging
  to every petty lordling, of making private war, of collecting local dues and
  tolls and customs, and compelling services; the right of trampling down the
  fields of the husbandman in the pursuit of game; the monopolies which made
  valuable privileges of permissions to manufacture, to trade and to import,
  were certainly not promotive of the general prosperity. On the contrary the
  general wealth and prosperity have been greatly enhanced by their abolition.</p>
<p> Even if we grant that all rights of property have the same basis and sanction
  and eliminate all moral distinction, reason and experience still show that
  there is but one right of property that conduces to the prosperity of the whole
  community, and that this is the right which secures to the laborer the product
  of his labor. This promotes prosperity by stimulating production, and giving
  such security to accumulation as permits the use of capital and affords leisure
  for the development of the intellectual powers. It is respect for this, not
  respect for those forms of property which the perversion or folly of legislative
  power may at times sanction, and which consist in the power of appropriating
  the results of others' labor, that universal experience shows to be essential
  to the peace, prosperity and happiness of mankind.</p>
<p> So far from the destruction of those spurious and injurious rights of property
  which have wound around the useful rights of property, like choking weeds around
  a fruitful vine, being calculated to injure that respect for property on which
  wealth and prosperity and civilization depend, the reverse is the case. They
  are not merely directly destructive of what it promotes, but to class them
  with it and to insist that the respect due to it is also due to them is to
  give rise to the belief that all rights of property are injurious to the masses.
  The history of mankind shows that the respect for property which is essential
  to social well-being has never been threatened, save by the growth of these
  noxious parasites. And this today is the only thing that threatens it. Why
  are the socialists of today so hostile to capital? It is for no other reason
  than that they confuse with what is really capital legalized wrongs which enable
  the few to rob the many, by appropriating the products of labor and demanding
  a blackmail for the use of the opportunity to labor. To teach that the good
  and the bad in legal recognitions are indistinguishable that all that the state
  may choose to regard its property is property, is virtually to teach that property
  is robbery!</p>
<p> And what is this state, to whose control by selfishness or ignorance or dishonesty
  or corruption these deniers of moral distinctions would give the power of binding
  men in the most vitally important matter for all future time? Caligula was
  the state. Nero was the state. Louis XIV truly said, &quot;The state, it is
  I.&quot; And according to Herbert Spencer the state in England consists of &quot;a
  motley assemblage of nominees of caucuses, ruled by ignorant and fanatical
  wire-pullers.&quot; Practically, the state is always what man, what combination,
  what interest, may control its machinery. Hence the expediency of strictly
  limiting its power; and, if indeed there be no moral principle, no higher law,
  that will give us clear guidance as to what the state may or may not do, then
  it becomes all the more expedient that we carry the principle of state omnipotence
  over rights to its logical conclusion, and assert the power of the state in
  any present or any future time utterly to annul any stipulation, contract,
  regulation or institution of the state at any past time. If there be no moral
  right, no higher law, to cheek the action of the state, then is it all the
  more needful that it should be subject at least to the prospective cheek of
  sharp and complete reversal. For the more permanent and therefore the more
  valuable are the special privileges which the state has power to grant, the
  greater is the inducement to selfish interests to gain control of it. Nothing
  better calculated to corrupt government and to strengthen a most dangerous
  tendency of our time can well be imagined than the doctrine that state grants
  which enable one man to take the labor and property of others can never be
  abolished without compensation to those who may hold them.</p>
<p> Of different nature is the plea sometimes made, that compensation, by disarming
  opposition, is the easiest and quickest way of abolishing a vested wrong. As
  to this, no only is compensation not abolition, not only does it advocacy tend
  to keep in full strength the pecuniary interest which are the greatest obstacles
  to the reform, but it render it impossible to arouse that moral force which
  can alone overcome an intrenched wrong. For to say that men must be compensated
  if they are prevented from doing a thing is to say that they have a right to
  do that thing. And this those who intelligently advocate compensation know.
  Their purpose in advocating compensation is to prevent abolition.</p>
<p> It is sometimes said that it would have been cheaper for us to pay for the
  Southern slaves, as Great Britain did in the West Indies, than incur the civil
  war. But the assumption that American slavery might thus have been got rid
  of and the war avoided, is far from being true. An aristocratic government,
  such as that of Great Britain in 1832, may abolish slavery in a few small dependencies
  by imposing the burden on its own people, but in a popular government and on
  a great scale this cannot be done. Great Britain saved no war by paying compensation,
  for the West Indian planters could not have fought emancipation, and if the
  West Indian slaves were freed more quickly with compensation than they could
  have been without, it was solely because the class concerned in the maintenance
  of vested wrongs was overpoweringly strong in the British Parliament. With
  even such representation as the masses now have it would have been easier to
  abolish slavery in the West Indies without compensation than with it. In the
  United States abolition with compensation was never a practical question, nor
  could it have become a practical question until the sentiment against slavery
  had reached even a stronger pitch than that which led to war. The war came
  before more than a small minority had seriously thought of abolishing slavery,
  let alone of paying for it; before either section really dreamed of war. It
  came from the unstable equilibrium which legalized wrong begets, from the incidental
  issues and passions which it always arouses when the moral sense begins to
  revolt against it, even before the main question is reached. It came, not from
  a demand for compensation on one side and a refusal to give it on the other,
  but from the timidity with which the moral question had been treated by those
  who really saw the essential injustice of slavery, and which by concessions
  and compromises had so strengthened and emboldened the slavery interest that
  in revolt at measures far less threatening to it than the discussion of abolition
  with compensation could have been, it flung the nation into war.</p>
<p> And even if the alternative of compensation or war had been fairly presented
  to the American people, who shall say that it would have been really wiser
  and cheaper for them to surrender to such a demand? Could the Nemesis that
  follows national wrong have thus been placated? Might not the carrying out
  of such a measure as the compensation for three million slaves have given rise
  to political struggles involving an even more disastrous war? And would the
  precedent established in the conscious violation of the moral sense ultimately
  have cost nothing? The cost of the war, in blood, in wealth, in the bitterness
  aroused and the corruptions of government engendered, cannot well be estimated;
  yet who cannot but feel that the moral atmosphere is clearer and that the great
  problems which still beset the Republic are easier of solution than if with
  the alternative of compensation or war, like a pistol at its head, the nation
  had consciously and cravenly surrendered to wrong?</p>
<p> What this plea for compensation amounts to is, that it is cheaper to submit
  to wrong than to stand for right. Universal experience shows that whenever
  a nation accepts such a doctrine of submission it loses independence and liberty
  without even gaining peace. The peace it will secure is the peace that declining
  Rome bought of the barbarians, the peace of fellaheen and Bengalees.</p>
<p> Even in personal matters it is difficult to say what will be the result of
  action based on mere expediency; in the larger and more intricate scale of
  national affairs it is impossible. This is why, as contended by Mr. Spencer
  in Social Statics, the course of true wisdom in social affairs is to follow
  the dictate of principle &#8212; to ask, not what seems to be expedient, but
  what is right. If a law or institution is wrong, if its continuance involves
  the continuance of injustice, there is but one wise thing to do, as there is
  but one right thing, and that is to abolish it.</p>
<p> To come back to the main question:</p>
<p> All pleas for compensation on the abolition of unequal rights to land are
  excuses for avoiding right and continuing wrong; they all, as fully as the
  original wrong, deny that equalness which is the essential of justice. Where
  they have seemed plausible to any honestly minded man, he will, if he really
  examines his thought, see that this has been so because he has, though perhaps
  unconsciously, entertained a sympathy for those who seem to profit by injustice
  which he has refused to those who have been injured by it. He has been thinking
  of the few whose incomes would be cut off by the restoration of equal rights.
  He has forgotten the many who are being impoverished, degraded, and driven
  out of life by its denial. If he once breaks through the tyranny of accustomed
  ideas and truly realizes that all men are equally entitled to the use of the
  natural opportunities for the living of their lives and the development of
  their powers, he will see the injustice, the wickedness, of demanding compensation
  for the abolition of the monopoly of land. He will see that if any one is to
  be compensated on the abolition of a wrong, it is those who have suffered by
  the wrong, not those who have profited by it.</p>
<p> Private property in land &#8212; the subjecting of land to that exclusive
  ownership which rightfully attaches to the products of labor &#8212; is a denial
  of the true right of property, which gives to each the equal right to exert
  his labor
  and the exclusive right to its results. It differs from slavery only in its
  form, which is that of making property of the indispensable natural factor
  of production, while slavery makes property of the human factor; and it has
  the same purpose and effect, that of compelling some men to work for others.
  Its abolition therefore does not mean the destruction of any right but the
  cessation of a wrong &#8212; that for the future the municipal law shall conform
  to the moral law, and that each shall have his own.</p>
<p> I have gone over this question of compensation &#8212; this &quot;last ditch&quot; of
  the advocates of landlordism &#8212; because it is so persistently raised,
  not that it arises in anything I have advocated. We who propose that natural
  and
  therefore easy method of restoring their equal rights to men, which for the
  purpose of clearly differentiating it from all schemes of land nationalization
  we call the single tax, do not propose to take from landowners anything they
  now have. We propose to leave to landowners whatever they actually have, even
  though it be in their hands the fruits of injustice; we propose not even to
  change the forms of land tenure, and greatly to simplify instead of enlarging
  the machinery and functions of the state. We propose, in short, only so to
  change present methods of raising public revenues that they shall conform to
  the requirements of the right of property, taking for the rise of the state
  that which rightfully belongs to the state, leaving to individuals that which
  rightfully belongs to the individual.</p>
<p> But that clumsy mode of abolishing private property in land which is properly
  called land nationalization requires the taking of rightful property in the
  improvements that have been annexed to land. In this it calls for compensation
  in a way that confusion of thought may carry to the ownership of land itself.
  And even the taking of land it proposes would be in form a taking of property.
  The land would have to be formally appropriated by the state and then rented
  out. Now we are accustomed to the compensation of owners when particular portions
  of land are taken for the use of the state, and this indeed as I have before
  pointed out is rightful, so that it is easy for the superficial to think that
  when the state shall take all the land for the purpose of renting it out again
  it should compensate all owners. Thus the scheme of land nationalization gives
  to the idea of compensation a plausibility that does not properly belong to
  it.</p>
<p> This is the reason why in England, where there has been a good deal of talk
  of land nationalization, the notion of compensation is strong among certain
  classes, while in America, where the movement for the recognition of equal
  rights to the use of land has gone from the beginning on the lines of the single
  tax, there is almost nothing of it, except as a reflection of English thought.
  And this is the reason why, although even in England the advocates of land
  nationalization are few and weak as compared with the great body that is advancing
  on the unjust privileges of landlords by the way of taxation, the English advocates
  of landlordism always endeavor to discuss the land question as though the
  actual taking of land by the state were the only thing proposed. It will be
  observed for instance that Mr. Spencer, in <em>Justice</em>, never so much
  as alludes to the proposition to secure equal rights in land by taking land
  values, not
  land. Yet he cannot be so ignorant of what is going on about him as not to
  know that this is the line which the advance against landlordism is taking
  and must take. He ignores it because there is on that line no place for proposing
  or even suggesting compensation. Compensation to the ultimate payers of a tax
  is something unheard of and absurd.</p>
<p> The primary error of the advocates of land nationalization is in their confusion
  of equal rights with joint rights, and in their consequent failure to realize
  the nature and meaning of economic rent &#8212; errors which I have pointed
  out in commenting on Mr. Spencer's declarations in <em>Social Statics</em>.
  In truth the
  right to the use of land is not a joint or common right, but an equal right;
  the joint or common right is to rent, in the economic sense of the term. Therefore
  it is not necessary for the state to take land, it is only necessary for it
  to take rent. This taking by the commonalty of what is of common right, would
  of itself secure equality in what is of equal right &#8212; for since the holding
  of land could be profitable only to the user, there would be no inducement
  for any one to hold land that he could not adequately use, and monopolization
  being ended no one who wanted to use land would have any difficulty in finding
  it. And it would at the same time secure the individual right, for in taking
  what is of common right for its revenues the state could abolish all those
  taxes which now take from the individual what is of individual right.</p>
<p> The truth is that customs taxes, and improvement taxes, and income taxes,
  and taxes on business and occupations and on legacies and successions, are
  morally and economically no better than highway robbery or burglary, all the
  more disastrous and demoralizing because practiced by the state. There is no
  necessity for them. The seeming necessity arises only from the failure of the
  state to take its own natural and adequate source of revenue&#8212;a failure
  which entails a long train of evils of another kind by stimulating a forestalling
  and monopolization of land which creates an artificial scarcity of the primary
  element of life and labor, so that in the midst of illimitable natural resources
  the opportunity to work has come to be looked on as a boon, and in spite of
  the most enormous increase in the powers of production the great mass find
  life a hard struggle to maintain life, and millions die before their time,
  of overstrain and under-nurture.</p>
<p> When the matter is looked on in this way, the idea of compensation &#8212; the
  idea that justice demands that those who have engrossed the natural revenue
  of the state must be paid the capitalized value of all future engrossment before
  the state can resume those revenues &#8212; is too preposterous for serious
  statement.</p>
<p> And while in the nature of things any change from wrong-doing to right-doing
  must entail loss upon those who profit by the wrong-doing, and this can no
  more be prevented than can parallel lines be made to meet; yet it must also
  be remembered that in the nature of things the loss is merely relative, the
  gain absolute. Whoever will examine the subject will see that in the abandonment
  of the present unnatural and unjust method of raising public revenues and the
  adoption of the natural and just method even those who relatively lose will
  be enormous gainers.</p>
