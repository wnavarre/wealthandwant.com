  Chapter III &#8212; The Synthetic Philosophy </strong>
    </div>
    <p> I wish to keep close to the land question. But to understand fairly Mr. Spencer's
  views on the land question as expressed in <em>Justice</em>, and to discover what ground
  there may be for the changes they show, it is necessary to get some idea of
  the system of which it is the crown.</p>
<p> Justice is in fact the real revision of Social Statics in the new light of
  the system of philosophy which its author has since elaborated. Both books
  go over the same ground, that of social economics, and the title of one might
  serve for that of the other. This ground it was that first attracted Mr. Spencer,
  and he went over it forty-two years ago in the temper of a social reformer.
  He now returns to these living, burning questions of the time with the reputation
  of a great philosopher, after assiduous years spent in what purports to be
  a wider and deeper survey. For of the philosophy which he has in the meantime
  elaborated it is claimed not only that &quot;it is more logically complete
  than any other system,&quot; but that &quot;it is more practical than any other,
  because it bears immediately upon common experience, takes hold of the living
  questions of the time, throws light upon the course of human affairs, and gives
  knowledge that may serve both for public and individual guidance.&quot;<em><font size="-1"><strong>13</strong></font></em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>I speak of Herbert Spencer in <em>Social Statics</em> as a social reformer, to distinguish
    his attitude at that time from his present attitude. But he was not content
    in that book to advocate empirical remedies for the disorder, waste and wrong
    that he beheld about him. He saw that expediency offered no sure guide; that
    such was the infirmity of human powers, and such, in the complexity of social
    actions and reactions, was the impossibility of calculating results, that legislation
    based on mere policy was constantly bringing to naught the best-laid schemes,
    constantly entangling men in blind ways, constantly resulting in the unforeseen
    and unwished. The burden of <em>Social Statics</em> is that there is a better guide
    in social affairs than the calculations of expediency; that what men should
    look to is not results but principles; that the moral sense may be trusted
    where the intellect is certain to go astray. Its central idea is that the universe
    bespeaks to us its origin in an intelligence of which Justice must be an attribute;
    that there is in human affairs a divinely appointed order to which, if it would
    prosper, society must conform; that there is an eternal rule of right, by which,
    despite all perturbations of the intellect, social institutions may be safely
    measured.</p>
<p> This rule of right, as expressed in the first principle of <em>Social Statics </em>&#8212; this &quot;law
  of equal liberty,&quot; that &quot;each has freedom to do all that he wills
  provided that he infringes not the equal freedom of any other&quot; &#8212; what
  is it indeed but an expression in primary essential of the Golden Rule? What
  Mr. Spencer declared in <em>Social Statics</em> is in fact what the National
  Assembly of France declared in 1789, &quot;That ignorance, neglect or contempt
  of human rights are the sole causes of public misfortunes and corruptions of
  government.&quot; And
  with clearer vision than the French Assembly, he saw and did not hesitate to
  assert that the most important of human rights from the neglect and contempt
  of which society today suffers, is the natural and equal right to the use
  of the planet.</p>
<p> It is its protest against materialism, its assertion of the supremacy of
  the moral law, its declaration of God-given rights that are above all human
  enactments, that despite whatever it may contain of crudity and inconsistency
  make <em>Social Statics</em> a noble book, and in the deepest sense a religiously-minded
  book.</p>
<p> In the course Mr. Spencer thus entered in his early manhood there was work
  enough to have engaged the greatest powers for the longest lifetime; but work
  that would have involved a constant and bitter contest with the strongest forces &#8212; forces
  that have at their disposal not only the material things that make life pleasant,
  but present honor as well. Mr. Spencer did not continue the struggle that
  in <em>Social Statics</em> he began. He turned from the field of social reform to the
  field of speculative philosophy, in which he has won great reputation and authority.
  It is the scheme of philosophy thus developed that forms the basis of <em>Justice</em>,
  as the ideas of a living God, of a divinely appointed order, and of an eternal
  distinction between right and wrong, just and unjust, form the basis of <em>Social
  Statics</em>.</p>
<p> In its earlier volumes this philosophy was styled &quot;Spencer's Evolutionary
  Philosophy.&quot; This title has since been abandoned for the less definite
  but more ambitious one of &quot;Spencer's Synthetic Philosophy.&quot; Since
  synthesis is the opposite of analysis, the putting together, instead of taking
  apart &#8212; a synthetic philosophy is a philosophy which explains the world
  (a term which in the philosophic sense includes all of which we can become
  conscious), not by the process of taking things apart and seeing of what they
  are composed; but by assuming an original principle or principles, and from
  that starting-point mentally building up the world, thus showing how it came
  to be. The Book of Genesis embodies probably the oldest synthetic philosophy
  we have record of. Mr. Spencer's is the latest.</p>
<p> Spencer's &quot;Synthetic Philosophy&quot; is in the main a fusion and extension
  of two hypotheses &#8212; the nebular hypothesis of the formation of celestial
  bodies, and what is best known as the Darwinian hypothesis of the development
  of species, with a bridging over of such gulfs as the passage from the inorganic
  to the organic, and from matter and motion to mind, and some infusion of what
  I take to be Kantian metaphysics. Though Mr. Spencer objects to the characterization,
  I can only describe this philosophy as materialistic, since it accounts for
  the world and all it contains, including the human ego, by the interactions
  of matter and motion, without reference to any such thing as intelligence,
  purpose or will, except as derived from them. It does not, of course, any more
  than other materialistic philosophies, pretend to explain what matter and motion
  are, or how they came to be. That, for it, is the unknowable, while it deals
  only with what may be known by men. But within the region of the knowable,
  all things to it have come to be, or are coming to be, by the interactions
  of matter and motion, in a process which it terms &quot;evolution,&quot; and
  which it describes as &quot;an integration of matter, and concomitant dissipation
  of motion, during which the matter passes from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity
  to a definite, coherent heterogeneity, and during which the retained motion
  undergoes a parallel transformation.&quot;</p>
<p> After evolution has reached its limit and all the motion is dissipated, comes
  a temporary equilibrium, and then dissolution sets in, by the integration of
  motion and the dissipation of matter, so that, according to the Synthetic Philosophy,
  the universe goes on, so far as we can see, to infinity, like one of those
  disks boys play with, which by means of a twisted string is made to spin around
  one way, then to come to a momentary stop, and then spin back the other way,
  the process continuing so long as the boy will gently extend and then gently
  bring together his hands. What is it that supplies the force furnished in the
  case of the toy by the boy's hands? And has it, like the boy's hands conscious
  will behind it? This to the Spencerian Synthetic Philosophy is the unknowable.</p>
<p> This unknowable is not God, though Mr. Spencer presents it to the religious
  sentiment as something with which it may be satisfied, and some of his followers,
  and sometimes even he himself, speak of it in ways that suggest identity. In
  <em>Social Statics</em>, however, Mr. Spencer frequently uses the term &quot;God,&quot; but
  he certainly never thought that he knew God in the sense of comprehending him,
  or that it was possible for man so to know him. And if the unknowable of his
  philosophy means that &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Being above all beings! Mighty One,<br>
    Whom none can comprehend and none explore!<br>
    Who fill'st existence with thyself alone &#8212;<br>
    Embracing all, supporting, ruling o'er &#8212;<br>
    Being whom we call God, and know no more!'14</p>
</blockquote>
<p> &#8212; why should he with the development of his philosophy have abandoned
  the use of the old term for that which beneath the myths and fables and creeds
  by which men have endeavored to formulate spiritual perceptions has been always
  recognized as apparent to the human soul yet transcending human knowledge?</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">14 Derzhavin, Bowring's translation.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> This unknowable must be distinguished from the unknown. It is that which
  not only is not, but never can be known in any way; that which not merely we
  cannot comprehend, but of which we can know nothing at all, even of its intelligence
  or non-intelligence, its consciousness or non-consciousness, its nature or
  its attributes. It is difficult indeed to see how we may predicate even existence
  of it, as we may of an unknown person or unknown thing. For this requires at
  least some knowledge. But of the unknowable we lack the capacity of knowing
  anything whatever. Air is unknowable directly to our sense of sight; we cannot
  directly see air. But by its resistance, its weight, its chemical and other
  qualities, it is knowable by our other faculties; and it is indirectly knowable
  even to our sight, through the moving of leaves, the motion of watery surfaces,
  etc.; while if air were unknowable, we could not be conscious of it in any
  possible way. It would be precisely the same to us as no air.</p>
<p> By the constitution of the human mind it is impossible for us in attempting
  to trace back the line of causation to find any stopping-place until we reach
  that which thinks and wills &#8212; that to which the volition is akin which
  to our consciousness is an originating element in the trains of sequences that
  we ourselves set in motion, or at least modify and divert. Thus any materialistic
  or mechanical philosophy must either beg the question by assuming the eternity
  of matter and motion, or admit something behind them which it must take for
  granted and leave out of its explanation, simply denying that it can be recognized
  as intelligence or will apart from matter and motion, i.e., spirit. If the
  unknowable in the Spencerian philosophy means anything more than the vacuum
  that is thus left where a spiritual First Cause is denied, it seems to mean
  what by some metaphysicians is styled &quot;the thing in itself.&quot;</p>
<p> This &quot;thing in itself&quot; is in metaphysical language the noumenon
  as distinguished from the phenomenon: the thing as it really is, as distinguished
  from the thing as it is recognized in its qualities by the percipient being.
  But this, if not another name for spirit, really amounts to vacancy. Such idea
  of &quot;the thing in itself&quot; as opposed to the thing as known in phenomena,
  seems to come from the habit, to which our use of language leads, of associating
  independent existence with qualities to which we give independent names. Thus
  no man ever saw white except as a white thing. But as things have other colors
  we can readily separate the idea white from the idea thing. Forgetting, since
  we are dealing only with words, that the abstraction of one color implies its
  replacement by another color, and the abstraction of all colors would render
  the thing non-existent so far at least as our sight is concerned, we may mentally
  separate the idea of color, and imagine the thing in other respects as remaining.
  Extending the process of abstraction to all other qualities, we may fancy that
  we have still remaining the idea of the thing separated from all idea of its
  qualities. But what we have remaining is really only a verbal simulacrum, that
  sounds like something, and may be written or parsed, but which on analysis
  consists of negations, and means really no thing or nothing. This, as well
  as I can understand it, is that &quot;thing in itself,&quot; of which, in some
  part, or in some aspects, Mr. Spencer's unknowable seems to consist.</p>
<p> But if the Spencerian philosophy is thus indefinite as to what precedes or
  underlies matter and motion, it certainly shows no lack of definiteness from
  the appearance of matter and motion onward. With matter and motion begins its
  knowable, and from thenceforward, without pause or break, it builds up the
  whole universe by the integration of the one, and the dissipation of the other,
  in the mode described as evolution, without recourse to any other element.</p>
<p> In this elimination of any spiritual element lies, it seems to me, the essential
  characteristic of the Spencerian philosophy. It is not, as is largely supposed,
  the evolution philosophy, but an evolution philosophy; that is to say, its
  rejection of any spiritual element in its account of the genesis of things
  does not follow from its acceptance of the principle of evolution; but the
  peculiarity of its teachings as to evolution arises from its ignoring of the
  spiritual element, from its assumption that, matter and motion given, their
  interactions will account for all that we see, feel or know.</p>
<p> In reality the Spencerian idea of evolution differs as widely from that held
  by such evolutionists as Alfred Russel Wallace, St George Mivart, or Joseph
  Le Conte, as it differs from the idea of special and direct creation. It is
  only when this is recognized that the real point of issue raised by or perhaps
  rather around the doctrine of evolution is seen. We all see that the oak is
  evolved from the acorn, the man from the child. And that it is intended for
  the evolution of something is the only intelligible account that we can make
  for ourselves of the universe. Thus in some sense we all believe in evolution,
  and in some sense the vast majority of men always have. And even the evolution
  of man from the animal kingdom offers no real difficulty so long as this is
  understood as only the form or external of his genesis. To me, for instance,
  who, possibly from my ignorance of such branches, am unable to see the weight
  of the evidence of man's descent from other animals, which many specialists
  in natural science deem conclusive, it yet appears antecedently probable that
  externally such might have been his descent. For it seems better to accord
  with the economy manifested through nature, to think that when the soul of
  man first took incasement in physical body on this earth it should have taken
  the form nearest to its needs, rather than that inorganic matter should be
  built up. And while I cannot conceive how, even in illimitable time, the animal
  could of itself turn into the man, it is easy for me to think that if the spirit
  of man passed into the body of a brute the animal body would soon assume human
  shape.</p>
<p> Let me illustrate the distinction I wish to point out:</p>
<p> Here is a locomotive of the first class, or a great Corliss engine, capable
  on the pressure of a child's finger of exerting to definite ends a mighty force.
  How did it come to be?</p>
<p> &quot;It came to be,&quot; some one might answer, &quot;from the integrations
  of matter and motion. This matter existed not to go further back than is necessary,
  in ores of iron and copper and zinc, and in the wood of trees. By motion acting
  on matter these materials were transported, separated, combined and adjusted,
  until integrated into this definite, coherent heterogeneity that you see.&quot;</p>
<p> Such answer would not satisfy me. I would indeed see that it was quite true
  that from the first wresting of the ores from their beds, to the last touch
  of file or emerypaper, every step in this construction involved the action
  of motion on matter; but I would know that this was not all, and that what
  so ordered and directed the action of motion on matter as to bring this construction
  into being was the intelligence and volition of man. And I would reply, &quot;You
  do not go deep enough: what this construction really bespeaks is something
  you have omitted; something to which matter is but the material, and motion
  the tool &#8212; the intelligence, consciousness and freedom of human will.&quot;</p>
<p> Or, here is a picture. Let it be a reproduction of a Madonna of Raphael's,
  such as are made or might be made by self-feeding presses. Shall anyone explain
  the impression of grace and beauty and loving purity that it produces on him
  who contemplates it, by explaining on the undulatory theory of light how impressions
  of color are produced on the retina of the eye? Or shall he account for its
  genesis by telling me that by integrations of matter and motion certain pigments
  have become disposed on paper in a certain way? Should he attempt to do so
  I would say to him, &quot;You are telling me merely of the medium through which
  in this picture soul speaks to soul; you are merely telling me of the means
  by which the thought of the painter found expression in outward form.&quot;</p>
<p> But suppose he should answer &#8212;</p>
<p> &quot;You delude yourself. I have investigated the matter, and have been
  to the place where such pictures as this are brought forth. I saw no painter;
  I saw only a series of revolving cylinders, through which an endless roll of
  paper was drawn by steel fingers. By the automatic motion of this machinery
  one cylinder impressed on the paper some patches of one color, and another
  some patches of another color, till at last, by such successive actions of
  motion on matter, a picture like this came forth.&quot;</p>
<p> Would I be any more convinced that such a picture could have come to be without
  that power, essentially different from matter and motion, which we feel in
  ourselves and recognize in other men, which draws a deep gulf between man and
  all other animals; that power which plans, contrives, and by using matter and
  motion creates; that power in short which we call spirit? Would I not say to
  him, &quot;What you tell me of the way this picture was brought forth by no
  means lessens my certainty that it could primarily have originated only in
  the mind and soul of a painter, but only shows me in the automatic working
  of the presses of which you speak a higher expression of the same power of
  using tools to body forth thought that was shown in the use of palette and
  brush. In this reproduction, as in each and all of the various processes and
  machines by which it was brought to be, I see a manifestation of the same essential
  thing that the original picture would show to me originating will, adapting
  mind; in short, not matter and motion, but spirit, or soul.&quot;</p>
<p> And of what moment would be the question whether this picture came into existence
  by the direct action of human will upon the paper, or indirectly through its
  action upon automatic machinery, as compared with the question whether its
  existence involved human action or not?</p>
<p> It is on this vital point of the existence or non-existence of spirit as
  a prime motor that the real issue raised by theories of evolution comes. Such
  evolutionism as is represented by the men of whom I have spoken, sees in evolution
  only a mode in which the creative spirit works. Such evolutionism as is formulated
  in the Spencerian philosophy eliminates spirit from its hypothesis, and takes
  into account only matter and motion.</p>
<p> Here is where all materialistic or mechanical theories of the universe ultimately
  fail. The belief in God, that is to say, in a Spiritual Originator, has no
  such utterly inadequate and ridiculous genesis as that which we shall shortly
  see Mr. Spencer gives for it. It springs from the same primary ineradicable
  perception that universally leads men, whenever they see in a thing destitute
  of life the evidence of adaptation involving choice, to attribute it to man.
  No civilized man, after inspection, ever took the rudest huts raised by savages
  for the structures of lower animals. No savage who might at a distance have
  thought a ship a bird, or a steamer a marine monster, ever failed on closer
  view to know that it was a man's building. No wandering Bedouin ever attributed
  to natural forces ruins so vast that they transcended his ideas of man's ability.
  On the contrary, so clear is the impress and testimony of that creative power
  which so widely and unmistakably distinguishes man from all other animals,
  that rude peoples invariably attribute constructions which they deem beyond
  man's ability, to genii, fairies or demons &#8212; beings possessing powers
  of the same kind as man, but in larger degree. And they do this for the same
  reason
  that they attribute the bringing into being of the highest of adaptations,
  those that embody life, to a highest of spiritual beings &#8212; the Great
  Spirit, or God. And when our larger knowledge shows us no wavering or confusion
  in
  the line which marks conscious adaptation, so that to the specialist the chipping
  of a flint taken from a long-buried river-drift, or the scratching on a tusk
  of a preglacial animal, shows the same unmistakable evidence of man's work
  as does the engine or the picture, how shall we otherwise interpret the evidences
  of design similar in kind but infinitely higher in degree which nature on every
  hand reveals than as indicating the work of God?</p>
<p> But to return again to our illustration: If when, to him who contends that
  the engine or the picture has come to be by the integrations of matter and
  motion, I say that such structures unmistakably bespeak man's work, suppose
  he should reply to me:</p>
<p> &quot;What is man's work but the interaction of matter and motion? What is
  man's hand but a certain arrangement of matter? What is the force it exerts
  but a dissipation of motion? Did they, too, not exist in an indefinite, incoherent
  homogeneous shape in the primordial mass? Do they not come to man from unnumbered
  transmutations in the food he eats, the water he drinks, the air he breathes,
  to pass from him into other numberless mutations? If you think man is not included
  in matter and motion, shut off even for a little while his supplies of matter
  and motion, and where is your man?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Your explanation no better satisfies me than before,&quot; I would
  reply. &quot;While it may be true as far as it goes, it is inadequate and false
  in omitting an essential factor, and that a factor which is not last but first.
  Matter and motion acting to all eternity could not bring forth such a structure
  as this. I know, from all my experience of how things come to be, that this
  structure had its primary genesis in thought; that in all its parts, and as
  a combined whole, it was thought out before it was worked out. I grant you
  that, at least normally, our perceptions of thought in others are dependent
  on our perceptions of matter and motion. But I too think. And I know from perceptions
  that are even closer and truer than my perceptions of matter and motion, that
  thought is something different from matter and motion, and from any combination
  of them. I think when my body is still, when my eyes are shut, even when my
  senses are locked from the external world by sleep. And though I can only look
  out, not in; though I cannot tell you what I myself am, any more than you can
  tell me what matter and motion are; although I can no more tell you how I came
  to be than you can tell me how matter and motion came to be, nor in what way
  this, that I feel is I, is embodied in a material frame, I do feel directly,
  and know from its capacities, that it is something different from and superior
  to the matter and motion of that frame, and that it endures while they change.
  And so your explanation of the genesis of things that excludes everything but
  matter and motion, is to me as superficial as if you were to explain a Caesar
  or Shakespeare by the food he ate; an In Memoriam by pen and ink; or my recognition
  of my friend's voice, and our communication of thought through the telephone,
  by the copper wire and the current of electricity.</p>
<p> &quot;So clear, so certain, am I that what I can recognize, better than I
  can define, as spirit, is alone competent to produce things in which I see
  conscious, willing intelligence that if you were to show me a brush that seemed
  of itself to paint pictures, a pen that seemed of itself to write intelligible
  words, or even an animal that seemed to show that power which is the essential
  characteristic of man, I could only account for it as a manifestation of spirit
  acting in a way unfamiliar to me &#8212; if not spirit in a human body, playing
  a trick upon me, then spirit in some other form. And this would be the conclusion
  of all men.&quot;</p>
<p> While less acute thinkers profess to sneer at the evidence from design, Schopenhauer,
  whose great ability certainly entitles him to high rank among atheistic philosophers,
  is able to avoid the conclusion of an Originating Intelligence only by eliminating
  intelligence from will, and assuming that bare will, or desire unconjoined
  with intelligence, directly originates, just as the will to make a bodily movement
  brings about that movement without knowledge or consciousness of how it is
  brought about.15</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">15. Schopenhauer's explanation of the origin of species is in interesting
      contrast to that of the evolutionary hypothesis, and to my mind comes closer
      to the truth. According to him the numberless forms and adaptations of animated
      nature, instead of proceeding from slow modifications, by which various creatures
      have been adapted to their conditions, are the expression of the desire or
      collective volition of the animal. I quote from the chapter on Comparative
      Anatomy in &quot;The Will in Nature,&quot; Bohn translation:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Every animal form is a longing of the will to live
          which is roused by circumstances. For in-stance, the will is seized with
          a longing to live
        on
          trees, to hang on their branches, to devour their leaves, without contention
          with other animals and without over touching the ground. This longing presents
          itself throughout endless time in the form (or Platonic idea) of the sloth.
          It can hardly walk at all, being only adapted for climbing; helpless on
        the ground it is agile on trees and looks itself like a moss-clad bough in
        order
          to escape the notice of its pursuers. &#8230;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The universal fitness for their ends, the obviously
        intentional design of all the parts of the organism of the lower animals
        without exception proclaim
            too distinctly for it over to have been seriously questioned, that
  here no
            forces of Nature acting by chance and without plan have been at work,
  but a will &#8230; (That) no organ interferes with another, each rather assisting
            the others and none remaining unemployed; also that no subordinate
  organ would be better suited to an-other mode of existence, while the life
  which the animal
            really leads is determined by the principal organs alone, but on
  the contrary each part of the animal not only corresponds to every other part,
  but also
            to its mode of life: its claws for instance are invariably adapted
  for seizing the prey which its teeth are suited to tear and break, and its
  intestinal canal
            to digest; its limbs are constructed to convey it where that prey
  is to be found, and no organ ever remains unemployed&#8230; added to the circumstance
            that no organ required for its mode of life is ever wanting in any animal,
            and that all, oven the most heterogeneous, harmonize together and are as it
            were calculated for a quite specially determined way of life, for the element
            in which the prey dwells, for the pursuit, the overcoming, the crushing and
            digesting of that prey&#8212;all this, we say, proves that the animal's
            structure has been determined by the mode of life by which the animal
            desired to find
            its substance, and not vice versa. It also proves that the result
            is exactly the same as if a knowledge of that mode of life and of
            its outward conditions
            had preceded the structure, and as if therefore every animal had
            chosen its equipment before it assumed a body; just as a sports-man
            before starting
            chooses
            his whole equipment, gun, powder, shot, pouch, hunting-knife and
            dress, according to the game he intends chasing. He does not take
            aim at the wild
            boar because
            he happens to have a rifle; he took the rifle with him and not a
            fowling-piece, because he in-tended to hunt the wild boar. The ox
            does not butt because
            it happens to have horns; it has horns because it intends to butt.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Now to render this proof complete we have the additional
        circumstance that in many animals, during the time they are growing,
        the effort of the will
      to
            which a limb is destined to minister, manifests itself before the
        existence of the limb itself, its employment thus anticipating its existence.
        Young
            he-goats, rams, calves for instance butt with their bare polls before
        they have any horns; the young boar tries to gore on either side, before
        its
      tusks are fully developed which would respond to the intended effect, while
        on the
            other hand it neglects to use the smaller teeth it already has in
        its mouth and with which it might really bite. Thus its mode of defending
        itself
      does not adapt itself to the existing weapons, but vice versa.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;&#8230; 
            Behold the countless varieties of animal shapes. How entirely is each of them
            the mere image of its volition, the evident expression of the strivings of
            the will which constitute its character! Their difference in shape is only
            the portrait of their difference in character. &#8230; Each particular striving
            of the will presents itself in a particular modification of shape. The abode
            of the prey therefore has determined the shape of its pursuer &#8230; and no
            shape is rejected by the will to live as too grotesque to attain its ends. &#8230; As
            the will has equipped itself with every or-g an and every weapon,
            offensive as well as defensive, so has it likewise provided itself
            in every animal shape
            with an intellect, as a means of preservation for the individual
            and the species. &#8230; Beasts
            of prey do not hunt nor foxes thieve because they have more intelligence;
            on the contrary they have more intelligence, just as they have stronger
            tooth
            and clews, because they wished to live by hunting and thieving.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> But within the sphere in which we can trace origination does it anywhere
  appear that will without intelligence can accomplish anything? So far as we
  can see clearly, is it not always true that where volition without commensurate
  intelligence seems to result in accomplishment it is because the needed intelligence
  has been supplied by another will? Thus an engine-driver desires his train
  to move forward or backward, fast or slow, and by a motion that seems directly
  responsive to his will, his desire takes effect through the pulling of a lever.
  He may know nothing of the adjustments of the machine that in response to his
  will thus converts heat into motion, and utterly lack the intelligence needed
  to construct it. But that knowledge and intelligence were none the less necessary
  to this moving of the train. If not conjoined with his will they were conjoined
  with other wills &#8212; the wills that have constructed a machine by which
  a train may be moved on the pulling of a lever. The little intelligence needed
  in use proves the great intelligence exerted in construction.</p>
<p> So a lady at the opera puts her glass to her eyes and turns a screw as she
  wishes to make what she sees appear nearer. She may not know how many lenses
  her glass contains; still less their nature and properties; and is utterly
  without the knowledge required for making such glasses. But that she may accomplish
  at will results requiring such knowledge is because others possess it.</p>
<p> So, if we look through any part of the wide field in which human advance
  has brought volition nearer to result and lessened the knowledge and intelligence
  required by the will to use, we find its reason in the greater knowledge and
  intelligence shown in adaptation. If the ordinary shipmaster of today can with
  the aid of a quadrant, a nautical almanac and a table of logarithms learn from
  the heavens his position on the trackless ocean, it is because of the high
  intelligence and tireless studies of others. If girls who know only how to
  strike a key and interpret a click, or put a peg in a hole, can talk with each
  other hundreds of miles apart, it is because of discoverers, inventors and
  constructors.</p>
<p> If, then, in the only field in which we can see origination taking place,
  we find that the originator is always intelligent, conscious will, and if we
  find that where the will that uses an adaptation does not possess the knowledge
  or intelligence necessary to originate it, another will or wills conjoined
  with deeper knowledge and wider intelligence has done so, what is the reasonable
  inference as to adaptations of a higher kind, the genesis of which we cannot
  see, and which so far transcend the knowledge and intelligence of the creatures
  that through them are enabled to give their own wills effect?</p>
<p> What are our bodies but a more perfect adjustment of parts, such as we see
  in machines? What are our eyes but a more perfect adjustment of lenses, such
  as we see in operaglasses? If, then, my hand closes when I will to grasp, without
  any knowledge on my part of the correlated movements that must necessarily
  intervene; if when I merely will to look, the lenses of my eyes are by delicate
  and complex machinery directed to the position and adapted to the distance;
  if all through animal and even vegetable nature I may see utilizations of knowledge
  and adaptations of intelligence transcending, not merely the powers of their
  users, but the highest human knowledge and intelligence, shall I infer that
  these utilizations and adaptations come without knowledge and intelligence?
  Or shall I regard them as evidences of a deeper knowledge and wider intelligence,
  which, since we find intelligence and knowledge invariably associated with
  consciousness, must pertain to a higher consciousness?</p>
<p> But to come back to the Book of Genesis that is offered to us in Mr. Spencer's
  Synthetic Philosophy.</p>
<p> First &#8212; if we will insist upon a first &#8212; comes the unknowable;
  then force; then from force, matter and motion. Matter first appears, permeated
  with motion, in a state of indefinite, incoherent homogeneity, from which a
  principle which is styled &quot;the instability of the homogeneous&quot; starts
  the &quot;integration of matter and concomitant dissipation of motion,&quot; called
  evolution, &quot;during which the matter passes from an indefinite, incoherent
  homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity, and during which the retained
  motion undergoes a parallel transformation.&quot;</p>
<p> This is in brief the whole story:</p>
<p> Matter revolving in accordance with the nebular hypothesis gives rise to
  nebulous aggregations; these to suns, which throw off revolving satellites,
  that in the course of time cool into earths, on the crust of which continuing
  evolution separates gases and differentiates the strata of inorganic matter.
  By the multiplying effects of motion acting on matter, the earth becomes fitted
  for life; and from the differences in the physical mobilities and chemical
  activities in the segregations of matter produce in colloid or jelly-like substances,
  such as starch, the beginnings of life, which is defined as &quot;the definite
  combination of heterogeneous changes, both simultaneous and successive, in
  correspondence with external coexistences and sequences.&quot; And then by
  forces of various kinds, but all derived from motion, and being its mechanical
  equivalents, all the forms of life, vegetable and animal, proceed.</p>
<p> By this process of evolution man was finally developed from a lower animal&#8212;he
  himself, with all his attributes and social institutions, being like everything
  else an outcome of this process, which, acting through survival of the fittest,
  heredity and the pressure of conditions, has been and is molding him into
  harmony with those conditions.</p>
<p> Of primitive man we have much and very definite information from Mr. Spencer.
  He was smaller and less powerful, especially in the lower limbs, than man is
  now, but had a larger abdomen and came earlier to maturity. He was wavering
  and inconstant; he had no surprise or curiosity or ingenuity; his imagination
  was reminiscent only, not constructive; he lacked abstract ideas, was without
  notion of definiteness and truth, or of benevolence equity or duty; he was
  unable to think even of a single law, much less of law in general; had neither
  the habit of expressing things definitely, nor the habit of testing assertions,
  nor a due sense of contrast between fact and fiction; and for him deliberately
  to weigh evidence was impossible. He was a cannibal; was entirely promiscuous
  in his sexual relations; had no idea of any other life or of any supernatural
  existences or powers, and no care for, no sympathy with, and no idea of the
  goodness or badness of acts toward any of his fellows, except so far as female
  primitive man was concerned with her offspring during infancy.</p>
<p> How this sorry monster, this big-bellied, short-legged, bad lot of an ancestor
  of ours managed to avoid the fate of the Kilkenny cats, and keep in existence,
  we are not definitely informed; but it seems from the Synthetic Philosophy
  that he did, and went on evoluting.</p>
<p> Various processes of his further evolution are in the Synthetic Philosophy
  described. Seeing shadows cast by the sun, the primitive man took them for
  other selves, which, aided by his dreams, brought him to a belief in doubles,
  more extensive even than that which Mr. Stead has expounded in his Real Ghost
  Stories and More Ghost Stories.</p>
<p> This led him to believe in another life, and his fear of chiefs and efforts
  to propitiate them after they were dead evolved the idea of God. Some regard
  for others, and some crude notion of property, was also evolved by fear of
  reprisal from others when he injured them or took their belongings, and by
  the punishment inflicted by chiefs. Cannibalism declined as the practice of
  slavery grew, and it became more profitable to work a captive than to eat him.
  But primitive man was not only a cannibal, he was a trophy-taker, given to
  the practice of gathering human heads and jaw-bones as evidences of his prowess.
  This led to mutilations of the living, or self-mutilations, as marks of respect
  or deference, and this again led to the giving of presents; and this in its
  turn evolved on the one side into political and ecclesiastical revenues, and
  on the other into a greater respect for property, and a recognition of value,
  and finally into barter, and then trade. In similar ways all our perceptions,
  feelings, instincts and habits have arisen. As for the mooted question, whether
  we have innate ideas or whether all our ideas are derived from experience,
  the solution of the Synthetic Philosophy is, that while all our ideas are originally
  derived from experience, they are of two kinds &#8212; those which the experience
  of our ancestors has registered in our inherited nervous system, and which
  therefore seem to us original, or innate, and those which we ourselves derive
  from experience.</p>
<p> Such, in brief, is the scheme of philosophy that in the interval between
  the publication of <em>Social Statics</em> and the publication of <em>Justice</em> Mr. Spencer
  has developed; and which it is the purpose of the last book to apply to the
  moral questions gone over in the first.</p>
<p> Of the inadequacy of such a philosophy to account for human progress, or
  coherently to marshal the great facts of human life and human history I have
  already treated at some length in Book X of <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, entitled &quot;The
  Law of Human Progress.&quot; But what we are now concerned with is the question,
  Where in such a philosophy is a basis for moral ideas to be found?</p>
<p> I cannot see, nor can I find that Mr. Spencer has been able to. Though still
  continuing to condemn Bentham, as he did in <em>Social Statics</em>, all his efforts
  to obtain something like a moral sanction reach no further than expediency.</p>
<p> And how can it be otherwise? If, in all we are and think and feel, we are
  but passing phases of the interactions of matter and motion? &#8212; if behind
  the force manifested in matter and motion is nothing but the unknowable, and
  before us nothing but dissipation &#8212; personal dissipation when we die,
  and the matter and motion of which alone we are composed seek other forms;
  and
  then a death of the race, followed by a dissipation of the globe? &#8212; why
  should we not eat, drink, and be merry to the limit of opportunity and digestion?
  If our ideas of God and of a future life come merely from the blunders of savages
  so stupid that they took shadows for other selves and dreams for realities?
  if we would still be eating each other had it not been discovered that man
  might use man more profitably as a laborer than as food? if what we call the
  promptings of conscience are merely inherited habits, the results of the fear
  of punishment transmitted through the nervous system? &#8212; why should I
  not lie whenever I may find it convenient and safe to lie? why should I avoid
  any
  omission or commission that will bring no legal or social or personal penalty
  or inconvenience? why should I refrain from selling my ability, whatever it
  may be, to any cause or interest that has power to give me what I desire, whether
  it be wealth or honor?</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer's philosophy makes no distinction between motives and results,
  nor does it admit of any. If it has any gospel, it is the gospel of results,
  and the results that it treats as to be sought are only results that make life
  pleasurable. Temperance, chastity, probity, industry, public spirit, generosity,
  love! They have in this philosophy no promise and no reward, save as they may
  directly or indirectly add to the pleasure of the individual. For the self-sacrifice
  of the hero, the devotion of the saint, the steadfastness of the martyr; for
  the spirit that ennobles the annals of mankind, that has led and yet leads
  so many to endure discomfort, want, pain, death, for the love of the true and
  the pure and the good; for the noble hope of doing something to break the chains
  of the captive, to open the eyes of the blind, to make life for those who may
  come after fuller, nobler, happier; for the faith that has led men to dare
  all things and suffer all things; it has no breath of stimulation or praise.
  In the cold glare that it takes for light, such men are fools. For it knows
  no more of human will as a factor in the advance of mankind than it does of
  the Divine Will. To it what conditions exist, and what conditions will exist,
  are determined by the irresistible grind of forces that in the last analysis
  are resolvable into the integration of matter and the dissipation of motion.
  Its fatalism eliminates free will. Environment and heredity are everything,
  human volition nothing. Carry this philosophy to its legitimate conclusion,
  and the man is a mere automaton who thinks he is a free agent only because
  he does not feel the strings that move him. That I am a man is because I have
  been evolved from the brute, as the boulder is rounded from the rock; as the
  brute, my ancestor, was evolved from colloid, and colloid from indefinite,
  incoherent homogeneous matter. And that I am this or that kind of a man, with
  such and such powers, tastes, habits, ways of thinking, feeling, perceiving,
  acting, is simply the result of the external influences that registered in
  my ancestors the nerve impressions transmitted to me, and that have continued
  to mould me. Social institutions, the outgrowth of a similar evolution in which
  free will had no part, will continue their evolution without help or hindrance
  from anything which is really choice or volition of mine.</p>
<p> Extremes sometimes curiously meet. The philosophy of Schopenhauer, which
  in deriving everything from will is the antipodes of the Spencerian philosophy,
  and which, like the philosophies of India, of which it is a European version,
  holds existence an evil, and looks for relief only to the renunciation of the
  will to live, would, if it were generally accepted, produce among the European
  races the same social lethargy, the same hopelessness of reform, the same readiness
  to bow before any tyrant, that have so long characterized the masses of India.
  It seems to me that the essential fatalism of the philosophy of Mr. Spencer
  would have a similar result.16</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">16 In Progress and Poverty, Book X, Chapter 1, I say:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The practical outcome of this theory is in a sort
        of hopeful fatalism, of which current literature is full. In this view,
        progress is the result of
          forces which work slowly, steadily and remorselessly, for the elevation
        of man. War, slavery, tyranny, superstition, famine and pestilence, the
        want and
          misery which fester in modern civilization, are the impelling causes
        which drive man on, by eliminating poorer types and extending the higher;
        and hereditary
          transmission is the power by which advances are fixed, and past advances
        made the footing for new advances. The individual is the result of changes
        thus
          impressed upon and perpetuated through a long series of past individuals,
        and the social organization takes its form from the individuals of which
        it is
          composed. Thus, while this theory is, as Herbert Spencer says* 'radical
        to a degree beyond any-thing which current radicalism conceives,' inasmuch
        as
          it looks for changes in the very nature of man; it is at the same time
        'conservative to a degree beyond anything conceived by current conservatism,'
        inasmuch as
          it holds that no change can avail save these slow changes in men's
        natures. Philosophers may teach that this does not lessen the duty of
        endeavoring to
          reform abuses, just as the theologians who taught predestinarianism
        insisted on the duty of all to struggle for salvation; but, as generally
        apprehended,
          the result is fatalism &#8212; do what we may, the mill of the gods
          grind on regardless either of our aid or our hindrance.<br>

    </blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">        Some years after this was written I had a curious
      illustration of its truth. Talking one day with the late E. L. Youmans,
      the great popularize
                  of Spencerianism
              in the United States, a man of warm and generous sympathies, whose
      philosophy seemed to me like an ill-fitting coat he had accidentally picked
      up and
                  put on, he fell into speaking with much warmth of the political
      corruption of
              New York, of the utter carelessness and selfishness of the rich,
      and of their readiness to submit to it, or to promote it wherever it
                  served their money-getting
              purposes to do so. He became so indignant as he went on that he
      raised his voice till he almost shouted.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">        Alluding to a conversation some time before, in which I had affirmed
                and he had denied the duty of taking part in politics, I said to him, &quot;What
                do you propose to do about it?&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">        Of a sudden his manner and tone were completely changed, as remembering
                  his Spencerianism he threw himself back, and replied, with something
                  like a sigh, &quot;Nothing!
                  You and I can do nothing at all. It's all a matter of evolution. We can
                  only wait for evolution. Perhaps in four or five thousand years evolution
                  may have
                  carried men beyond this state of things. But we can do nothing.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> And as the pessimistic philosophy of the one seems to flow from the abandonment
  of action for mere speculation, and from the satiety and ennui which under
  certain conditions accompany it, so the evolutionary philosophy of the other
  seems to be such as might result from the abandonment of a noble purpose &#8212; from
  a turning from the thorny path which an attack upon vested wrongs must open,
  to embrace the pleasanter ways of acquiescence in things as they are.</p>
<p> It is not for me to say what is cause and what is effect; but the correspondence
  of Mr. Spencer's philosophy, which ignores the spiritual element and knows
  nothing of duty, with his own attitude as shown in his letters to the <em>St.
  James's Gazette</em> and The <em>Times</em> and in <em>The Man versus the State</em>, is very striking. In
  <em>Justice</em> we shall see more of this correspondence.</p>
