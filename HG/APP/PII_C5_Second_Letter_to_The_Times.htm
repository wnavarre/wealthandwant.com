  <p><strong><font size="-1">Henry George &#8212; A Perplexed
        Philosopher<br />
    </font></strong><strong><font size="-1">Part II&#8212;Repudiation (continued)</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Chapter V &#8212; Second Letter To The <em>Times</em>. </strong></p>
</div>
<p> In his letter to the <em>Times</em> Mr. Spencer had surely abased himself
  enough to have been let alone by those whose favor he had so dearly sought.
  But even
  those who profit by apostasy often like to show their contempt for the apostate.
  Though the <em>Times</em> itself accepted his apology, it added some contemptuous reproof,
  and gave place to letters from Mr. Greenwood, Professor Huxley and Sir Louis
  Mallet that must have been extremely galling to a renowned philosopher.</p>
<p> Here is the pertinent part of what the <em>Times</em> said.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">So, without denying that he did once say something of the
      sort, he explains that it was forty years ago, that for the last fifteen
      years he has been
    doing all he can to suppress the book in which he said it, and that he never
    meant
      his words to have any bearing upon practical questions. He was in fact
    engaged in constructing a system of &quot;absolute political ethics, or that
    which ought to be,&quot; and he feels distinctly aggrieved by the transfer
    of his opinions from that transcendental sphere to the very different one
    in which
      Mr. Laidler and his friends are accustomed to dwell. &#8230; What Mr. Spencer
      said in his youth and inexperience he has unsaid in his maturer years and
      with more deliberate judgment &#8230;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Were we asked to point a moral for philosophers, we should
      bid them beware of meddling with the absolute. Forty years ago Mr. Spencer
      set forth in
    search of &quot;absolute political ethics,&quot; and constructed his system
    to his own satisfaction. But it turns out to have been the most relative
    of things
      after all, since for the last fifteen years it has ceased to be absolute
    even to the mind that conceived it &#8230; Mr. Spencer settled that which
    ought to be, as regards landownership, but a quarter of a century later we
    find
      him endeavoring, much to the credit of his modesty and candor, to suppress
      his
      own version of the absolute. He does not seem, however, to have abandoned
      the original quest, for he gives us his revised conclusions as to the
    absolute ethics
      of land tenure, which appear to us to contain some of the original identical
      flaws which were to be found in the older version.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The communication from Mr. Frederick Greenwood, an able high-Tory journalist,
  was published by the <em>Times</em> on the 9th, under the heading &quot;A Caution to
  Social Philosophers.&quot; Characterizing Mr. Spencer's letter to the <em>Times</em>  as &quot;a heavy lesson to political philosophers,&quot; Mr. Greenwood points
  out that &quot;no matter how sorry Mr. Spencer may be for having misled so
  many poor men who habitually hang on the authority of great men like himself,&quot; yet
  the very quotation he makes from his <em>Political Institutions</em> contains the same
  seeds of error in its admission that &quot;ownership established by force does
  not stand on the same footing as ownership established by contract,&quot; and
  in its admission that &quot;the assimilation of the two ownerships may eventually
  be denied.&quot;</p>
<p> Sir Louis Mallet's letter, published on November 11 was to similar effect.
  He pointed out that Mr. Spencer still admitted an analogy between private property
  in land and slavery, which, of course, to Sir Louis seemed dangerous and wicked.</p>
<p> Professor Huxley came at the philosopher in a bullheaded way that must have
  seemed very unkind. Speaking in the name of those &quot;to whom absolute political
  ethics and <em>a priori</em> politics are alike stumbling-blocks,&quot; and expressing
  the certainty that his friend, Mr. Spencer, would be the last person willingly
  to abet the tendency to sanction popular acts of injustice by antiquarian or
  speculative arguments, he asked him for a categorical answer to the question
  whether according to &quot;absolute political ethics&quot; A. B., who has bought
  a piece of land in England, as he might buy a cabbage, has a moral as well
  as a legal right to his land or not?</p>
<p> And he follows with these pertinent questions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">If he does not, how does &quot;absolute political ethics&quot; deduce
      his right to compensation?</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> If he does, how does &quot;absolute political ethics&quot; deduce
      the state's right to disturb him?</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> By this time Mr. Spencer must have wished he had not written to the <em>Times</em>,
  though it is a striking evidence of the little knowledge of <em>Social Statics</em>  in
  England (a fact on which Mr. Spencer had evidently calculated), that in none
  of these letters, or in those that followed, do any of the &quot;hecklers,&quot; with
  the one exception of Mr. Laidler, seem to have any knowledge of what Mr. Spencer
  had really said in that book &#8212; a knowledge that would have roused their
  ire to a far higher pitch, and enabled them to ask still harder questions.</p>
<p> The reader may wonder why in an attempt to deny his utterances in <em>Social
  Statics</em>, Mr. Spencer should have printed the passage from <em>Political Institutions</em>,
  which is in reality a reaffirmation of them. The only explanation I can offer
  is that he felt that he must print something, and had absolutely nothing else
  to print. For there is no word in all his works up to this time (<em>Justice</em> being
  yet to come) that gives the slightest evidence of any modification of the views
  set forth in <em>Social Statics</em>. And since he had six years before successfully
  referred to this passage, as though it indicated a modification of his views,
  he probably felt safe in so using it a second time. Thinking that it would
  suffice to settle Mr. Laidler, he evidently did not calculate on its provoking
  a &quot;fire in the rear,&quot; from his own friends, the adherents of landlordism,
  when he was giving up everything real, and only striving to save a semblance
  of consistency.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer conveniently ignored the letters of Mr. Greenwood and Sir Louis
  Mallet, but he did make a pretense of answering Professor Huxley, in a letter
  published in the <em>Times</em>, November 15.</p>
<p> Here is the letter, which, although the first paragraph only is pertinent
  to the task I have in mind, I give in full, in order to guard against Mr. Spencer's
  controversial habit of saying that his utterances have been garbled:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">To the Editor of the <em>Times</em>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> SIR: As Professor Huxley admits that his friend A. B.'s
      title to his plot of land is qualified by the right of the state to dispossess
      him if it
    sees well&#8212;as, by implication, he admits that all landowners hold their land
      subject to the supreme ownership of the state, that is, the community &#8212; as
      he contends that any force or fraud by which land was taken in early days
      does not affect the titles of existing owners, and <em>a fortiori</em> does not
      affect the
      superior title of the community &#8212; and as, consequently, he admits
      that the community, as supreme owner with a still valid title, may resume
      possession
      if it thinks well, he seems to me to leave the question standing very much
      where it stood; and since he, as I suppose, agrees with me that any such
      resumption, should a misjudgment lead to it, ought to be accompanied by
      due compensation
      for all artificial value given to land, I do not see in what respect we
      disagree on the land question. I pass, therefore, to his comments on absolute
      political
      ethics.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> &quot;Your treatment is quite at variance with physiological principles&quot; would
      probably be the criticism passed by a modern practitioner on the doings of
      a Sangrado, if we suppose one to have survived. &quot;Oh, bother your physiological
      principles,&quot; might be the reply. &quot;I have got to cure this disease,
      and my experience tells me that bleeding and frequent draughts of hot water
      are needed.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; would be the rejoinder, &quot;if you
      do not kill your patient, you will at any rate greatly retard his recovery,
      as
      you would probably be aware had you read Professor Huxley's <em>Lessons
      on Elementary Physiology</em>, and the more elaborate books on the subject which
      medical students
      have to master.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> This imaginary conversation will sufficiently suggest that, before there
      can be rational treatment of a disordered state of the bodily functions, there
      must be a conception of what constitutes their ordered state: knowing what
      is abnormal implies knowing what is normal. That Professor Huxley recognizes
      this truth is, I suppose, proved by the inclusion of physiology in that course
      of medical education which he advocates. If he says that abandonment of the
      Sangrado treatment was due, not to the teachings of physiology, but to knowledge
      empirically gained, then I reply that if he expands this statement so as to
      cover all improvements in medical treatment he suicidally rejects the teaching
      of physiological principles as useless.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Without insisting upon that analogy between a society and
      an organism which results from the interdependence of parts performing
      different functions &#8212; though
      I believe he recognizes this &#8212; I think he will admit that conception
      of a social state as disordered implies conception of an ordered social
      state.
      We may fairly assume that, in these modern days at least, all legislation
      aims at a better; and the conception of a better is not possible without
      conception
      of a best. If there is rejoicing because certain diseases have been diminished
      by precautions enforced, the implied ideal is a state in which these diseases
      have been extinguished. If particular measures are applauded because they
      have decreased criminality, the implication is that the absence of all
      crime is
      a desideratum. Hence, however much a politician may pooh-pooh social ideals,
      he cannot take steps toward bettering the social state without tacitly
      entertaining them. And though he may regard absolute political ethics as
      an airy vision,
      he makes bit by bit reference to it in everything he does. I simply differ
      from him in contending for a consistent and avowed reference, instead of
      an inconsistent and unacknowledged reference.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Even without any such strain on the imagination as may
      be required to conceive a community consisting entirely of honest and honorable
      men &#8212; even without
      asking whether there is riot a set of definite limits to individual actions
      which such men would severally insist upon and respect &#8212; even without
      asserting that these limits must, in the nature of things, result when
      men have severally
      to carry on their lives in proximity with one another, I should have thought
      it sufficiently clear that our system of justice, by interdicting, murder,
      assault, theft, libel, etc., recognizes the existence of such limits and
      the necessity for maintaining them; and I should have thought it manifest
      enough
      that there must exist an elaborate system of limits or restraints on conduct,
      by conformity to which citizens may cooperate without dissension. Such
      a system, deduced as it may be from the primary conditions to be fulfilled,
      is what I
      mean by absolute political ethics. The complaint of Professor Huxley that
      absolute political ethics does not show us what to do in each concrete
      case seems to
      be much like the complaint of a medical practitioner who should speak slightingly
      of physiological generalizations, because they did not tell him the right
      dressing for a wound or how best to deal with varicose veins. I cannot
      here explain
      further, but any one who does not understand me may find the matter discussed
      at length in a chapter on <em>Absolute and Relative Ethics</em> contained in <em>The
      Data of Ethics</em>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> It appears to me somewhat anomalous that Professor Huxley,
      who is not simply a biologist but is familiar with science at large, and
      who must recognize
    the reign of law on every hand, should tacitly assume that there exists one
    group
      of lawless phenomena &#8212; social phenomena. For if they are not lawless &#8212; if
      there are any natural laws traceable throughout them, then our aim should
      be to ascertain these and conform to them, well knowing that nonconformity
      will
      inevitably bring penalties. Not taking this view, however, it would seem
      as though Professor Huxley agrees with the mass of &quot;practical&quot; politicians,
      who think that every legislative measure is to be decided by estimation
      of probabilities unguided by a priori conclusions. Well, had they habitually
      succeeded,
      one might not wonder that they should habitually ridicule abstract principles;
      but the astounding accumulation of failures might have been expected to
      cause less confidence in empirical methods. Of the 18,110 public Acts passed
      between
      20 Henry III. and the end of 1872, Mr. Janson, Vice-President of the Law
      Society, estimates that four-fifths have been wholly or partially repealed,
      and that
      in the years 1870-72 there were repealed 3532 Acts, of which 2759 were
      totally repealed. Further, I myself found, on examining the books for 1881-83,
      that
      in those years there had been repealed 650 Acts belonging to the present
      reign, besides many of preceding reigns. Remembering that Acts which are
      repealed
      have been doing mischief, which means loss, trouble, pain to great numbers &#8212; remembering,
      thus, the enormous amount of suffering which this helter-skelter legislation
      has inflicted for generations and for centuries, I think it would not be
      amiss to ask whether better guidance may not be had, oven though it should
      come from
      absolute political ethics.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> I regret that neither space nor health will permit me to discuss any of the
      questions raised by Sir Louis Mallet. And here, indeed, I find myself compelled
      to desist altogether. In so far as I am concerned, the controversy must end
      with this letter. I am, etc.,</font></p>

  </blockquote>
<p> Really, this &quot;Answer to Professor Huxley&quot; is no answer at all.
  What Mr. Spencer virtually says is. &quot;I admit all that the landowners may
  want me to admit. Let us change the subject.&quot;</p>
<p> Yet even in thus changing the subject, he is obliged to give up the distinction
  he had made between absolute political ethics and relative political ethics,
  for his longdrawn explanation to Professor Huxley means, if it means anything
  at all, that absolute political ethics <em>do</em> have a bearing on practical political
  conduct.</p>
