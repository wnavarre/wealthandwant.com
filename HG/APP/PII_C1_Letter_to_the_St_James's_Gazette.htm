<p align="center"><strong>  Part II&#8212;Repudiation</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong> Chapter I &#8212; Letter To The St. James's Gazette. </strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <em>There are people who hate anything in the shape of exact conclusions;
      and these are of them. According to such, the right is never in either
      extreme,
      but always half-way between the extremes. They are continually trying to
    reconcile </em>Yes<em> and </em>No<em>. Ifs and buts, and excepts, are their
    delight. They have so great
      a faith in &quot;the judicious mean&quot; that they would scarcely believe
      an oracle, if it uttered a full-length principle. Were you to inquire of
      them whether the earth turns on its axis from East to West, or from West
      to East,
      you might almost expect the reply &#8212; &quot;A little of both,&quot; or &quot;Not
      exactly either.&quot; It is doubtful whether they would assent to the axiom
      that the whole is greater than its part, without making some qualification. </em></p>
  <p align="right"><em> &#8212; Herbert Spencer, 1850.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>WITH the early years of the last decade a marked change in common thought
  began to show itself; and the doctrine of natural, inalienable and equal rights
  to land, which Mr. Spencer had avowed as it were in academic groves, began
  to stir in the hearts and minds of common men, and to make way among the great
  disinherited. Vaguely and blindly, the land question had come to the front
  in Ireland, and in this form forced its way into British politics. And <em>Progress
  and Poverty</em>, first published in the United States in 1879, had begun, by the
  close of 1882, to circulate in Great Britain as no economic work had ever circulated
  before, reinforcing what Herbert Spencer had said of the ethical injustice
  of private property in land with the weight of political economy and the proposal
  of a practical measure for restoring equal rights. Everywhere, in short, that
  the English language is spoken, the idea of natural rights to the use of land,
  that in 1850 seemed dead, was beginning to revive with a power and in a form
  that showed that the struggle for its recognition had at last begun.</p>
<p> Believing in Mr. Spencer's good faith, deeming him not a mere prater about
  justice, but one who ardently desired to carry it into practice, we who sought
  to promote what he himself had said that equity sternly commanded naturally
  looked for some word of sympathy and aid from him, the more so as the years
  had brought him position and influence, the ability to command attention, and
  the power to affect a large body of admirers who regard him as their intellectual
  leader.</p>
<p> But we looked in vain. When the Justice that in the academic cloister he
  had so boldly invoked came forth into the streets and market-places, to raise
  her standard and call her lovers, Mr. Spencer, instead of hastening to greet
  her, did his best to get out of her way, like the young wife in the old story,
  who charmed the bystanders with her invocations to Death to take her rather
  than her elderly husband, but who, when Death rapped at the door and asked, &quot;Who
  calls me?&quot; quickly replied, &quot;The gentleman in the next room!&quot;</p>
<p> In March, 1882, when Mr. Spencer issued <em>Political Institutions</em>,
  and even in August of the same year, when he left England for a visit to the
  United
  States, there was on the surface of English society nothing to indicate that
  such views as he had expressed in <em>Social Statics</em> were any nearer attracting
  popular attention and arousing feeling than in 1850, for the Irish land movement
  was considered what it indeed was in the main, &#8212; not an attack on private
  property in land, but an effort of Irish tenants to become landowners or to
  get better terms. But when Mr. Spencer returned, toward the close of November,
  it was to find that the days of contemptuous tolerance on the part of Sir John
  and his Grace had gone, and that all that was deemed &quot;respectable&quot; in
  English society had become roused to the wickedness of those who denied the
  validity of private property in land.</p>
<p> To explain the change that had taken place in this brief interval I must
  refer to my own books.</p>
<p> <em>Progress and Poverty</em> was received by the English press, as all such books
  are at first, in silence or with brief derision. Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co.,
  who first published it in England, in sheets brought from the United States,
  were on publication able to sell only twenty copies in all the three kingdoms.
  But ere long it began to make its way, and when, toward the close of August,
  1882, a sixpenny edition was issued, it began to sell in tens and scores of
  thousands, &quot;in the alleys and back streets of England,&quot; the <em>Quarterly
  Review</em> said &quot;audibly welcomed there as a glorious gospel of justice.&quot;</p>
<p> Hardly was this cheap edition out and beginning to circulate, when, conjoining
  with it my pamphlet on <a href="../irish_land_question.html"><em>The Irish Land Question</em></a>,<em><strong>4</strong></em> which had also been published
  in England in cheap form, the <em>Times</em>, on September 11, 1882, gave to <em>Progress
  and Poverty</em> a long and fair review. At once the silence of the press was broken,
  and from the quarterlies to the comic papers the British journals began to
  teem with notices and references, most of them naturally of a kind that made
  the Duke of Argyll seem mild when he called me &quot;such a preacher of unrighteousness
  as the world has never seen,&quot; and spoke of my &quot;immoral doctrines&quot; and &quot;profligate
  conclusions,&quot; the &quot;unutterable meanness of the gigantic villainy&quot; I
  advocated, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>4 </strong>Now published under the name of &quot;The Land Question,&quot; since its effort is
      to show that the Irish Land Question is simply the universal land question.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> And from being regarded in this way in the very society in which as a great
  philosopher he had come to be an honored member, it was evident that Mr. Spencer
  could not escape if he adhered to his views. For although <em>Social Statics</em> was
  little known in England, the quotations I had made from it, both in <em>Progress
  and Poverty</em> and in <a href="../irish_land_question.html"><em>The Irish Land Question</em></a>, were bringing those views into
  sharp prominence.</p>
<p> This was the situation as Mr. Spencer found it on his return from the United
  States. The burning question &#8212; a question beside which that of chattel
  slavery was almost small &#8212; had been raised in England. And he must either
  stand for the truth he had seen, and endure social ostracism for it, or he
  must deny it.</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say
  all manner of evil against you!&quot; For this to the man who has striven to
  uproot a great wrong &#8212; a wrong that by the fact of its hitherto unquestioned
  existence has necessarily enlisted on its side all the powerful influences
  that dominate the organs of opinion and rule society &#8212; is the sure sign
  that the day he has hoped for is at hand.</p>
<p> When, in 1850, Mr. Spencer had said that the rent of land could be collected
  by an agent or deputy agent of the community, quite as well as by an agent
  of Sir John or his Grace, he must have known that if ever his proposition attracted
  the attention of the interests he thus personified he would be denounced in
  all the established organs of opinion, and in &quot;polite society&quot; regarded
  as a robber. <em>Then</em>, I am inclined to think he would have hailed with joy such
  indications of the progress of thought. But in 1882, he no sooner found that
  Sir John and his Grace had been aroused by such a proposition and were likely
  to hear that he had made it, than he hastened to get the evidence out of their
  sight, and as far as he could to deny it. At once, it seems from what he tells
  us in 1892, he, &quot;resolved not again to import a supply&quot; of <em>Social
  Statics</em>,5 and took the first opportunity to write a letter.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">5. &quot;Ten years ago, after all copies of the third edition
      had been sold, I resolved not again to import a supply to meet the still
      continued demand.&quot; &#8212; <em>Preface
      to &quot;Social Statics, Abridged and Revised,&quot; 1892</em></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, for January, 1883, in an article entitled &quot;The
  Nationalization of the Land,&quot; reviewed <em>Progress and Poverty</em> &#8212; as
  fairly, it seemed to me, as could be expected, but of course adversely. In
  doing so it referred to what Mr. Spencer had said on the land question in <em>Social
  Statics</em>, giving him credit for proposing to indemnify landowners, and quoting
  with that interpretation the <a href="PI_C2_The_Incongruous_Passage.htm">incongruous
  sentences</a> in Section 9. In concluding
  it said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Writers like Mr. George and Mr. Herbert Spencer are at war not only with
      the first principles of political economy and of law, of social order and
    domestic life, but with the elements of human nature. &#8230; To attack the
    rights of private property in land is to attack property in its most concrete
    form. If
      landed property is not secure, no property can be protected by law, and
    the transmission of wealth, be it large or small, is extinguished. With it
    expires
      the perpetuity of family life, and that future which cheers and ennobles
    the labor of the present with the hopes of the future. These are the doctrines
      of communism, fatal alike to the welfare of society and to the moral character
      of man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> This brought out from Mr. Spencer a letter to the <em>St. James's Gazette</em> of
  London, an able Tory journal. Since he was writing on the subject, here was
  an opportunity for Mr. Spencer to correct the misapprehension (as I now think
  it to be) that he had in <em>Social Statics</em> proposed to compensate landowners for
  their land. And, if he wished to defend himself against the charge of attacking
  property rights and upholding the doctrines of communism, here was an opportunity
  for him to show, for all of us as well as for himself, that the denial of the
  justice of private property in land involves no denial of true property rights.
  Or if he chose to do so, here was a chance for him straightforwardly to recant,
  to apologize to landowners, and to plead that he was young and foolish when
  he asserted, as quoted by the <em>Edinburgh</em>, that &quot;equity does not permit
  property in land, and that the right of mankind to the earth's surface is still
  valid, all deeds, customs, and laws notwithstanding.&quot;</p>
<p> But, instead of manfully defending the truth he had uttered, or straightforwardly
  recanting it, Mr. Spencer sought to shelter himself behind ifs and buts, perhapses
  and it-may-bes, and the implication of untruths. Here is his letter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em> <font size="-1">To the Editor of the St. James's Gazette:</font></em></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> During my absence in America, there appeared in the <em>St.
      James's Gazette</em> (27th of October, 1882) an article entitled &quot;Mr. Herbert Spencer's Political
      Theories.&quot; Though, when it was pointed out to me after my return,
      I felt prompted to say something in explanation of my views, I should probably
      have
      let the matter pass had I not found that elsewhere such serious misapprehensions
      of them are being diffused that rectification seems imperative.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Before commenting on the statements of your contributor,
      I must devote a paragraph to certain more recent statements which have
      far less justification.
      In old days among the Persians, the subordination of subject to ruler was
    so
      extreme that, even when punished, the subject thanked the ruler for taking
      notice of him. With like humility I suppose that now, when after I have
    been publishing books for a third of a century &quot;the leading critical
    organ&quot; has
      recognized my existence, I ought to feel thankful, even though the recognition
      draws forth nothing save blame. But such elation as I might otherwise be
    expected to feel is checked by two facts. One is that the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> has
    not itself discovered me, but has had its attention drawn to me by quotations
    in the work
      of Mr. Henry George &#8212; a work which I closed after a few minutes on
      finding how visionary were its ideas. The other is that, though there has
      been thus
      made known to the reviewer a book of mine published thirty-two years ago,
      which I have withdrawn from circulation in England, and of which I have
      interdicted
      translations, he is apparently unconscious that I have written other books,
      sundry of them political; and especially he seems not to know that the
      last of them, &quot;<em>Political Institutions</em>,&quot; contains passages concerning
      the question he discusses. Writers in critical journals which have reputations
      to lose usually seek out the latest version of an author's views; and the
      more
      conscientious among them take the trouble to ascertain whether the constructions
      they put on detached passages are warranted or not by other passages. Had
      the Edinburgh reviewer read even the next chapter to the one from which
      he quotes,
      he would have seen that, so far from attacking the right of private property,
      as he represents, my aim is to put that right upon an unquestionable basis,
      the basis alleged by Locke being unsatisfactory. He would have further
      seen that, so far from giving any countenance to communistic doctrines,
      I have devoted
      four sections of that chapter to the refutation of them. Had he dipped
      into the latter part of the work, or had he consulted the more recently
      published &quot;Study
      of Sociology&quot; and &quot;Political Institutions,&quot; he would not
      have recklessly coupled me with Mr. George as upholding &quot;the doctrines
      of communism, fatal alike to the welfare of society and to the moral character
      of man;&quot; for
      he would have discovered the fact (familiar to many, though unknown to
      him) that much current legislation is regarded by me as communistic, and
      is for
      this reason condemned as socially injurious and individually degrading.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> The writer of the article in the <em>St. James's Gazette</em> does
      not represent the facts correctly when he says that the view concerning
      ownership of land
    in
      <em>Social Statics</em> is again expounded in &quot;<em>Political Institutions</em>&quot;&#8212;&quot;not
      so fully, but with as much confidence as ever.&quot; In this last work I have
      said that, &quot;though industrialism has thus far tended to individualize
      possession of land, while individualizing all other possession, <em>it
      may be doubted</em>      whether the final stage is at present reached.&quot; Further on I have said
      that &quot;at a stage still more advanced, <em>it may be</em> that private ownership
      of land will disappear;&quot; and that &quot;<em>it seems possible</em> that the primitive
      ownership of land by the community &#8230; will be revived.&quot; And yet again
      I have said that &quot;<em>perhaps</em> the right of the community to the land, thus
      tacitly asserted, will, in time to come, be overtly asserted.&quot; Now it
      seems to me that the words I have italicized imply no great &quot;confidence.&quot; Contrariwise,
      I think they show quite clearly that the opinion conveyed is a tentative
      one. The fact is, that I have here expressed myself in a way much more
      qualified
      than is usual with me; because I do not see how certain tendencies, which
      are apparently conflicting, will eventually work out. The purely ethical
      view of
      the matter does not obviously harmonize with the political and the politico-economical
      views; some of the apparent incongruities being of the kind indicated by
      your contributor. This is not the place to repeat my reasons for thinking
      that the
      present system will not be the ultimate system. Nor do I propose to consider
      the obstacles, doubtless great, which stand in the way of change. All which
      I wish here to point out is that my opinion is by no means a positive one;
      and, further, that I regard the question as one to be dealt with in the
      future rather than at present. These two things the quotations I have given
      above
      prove conclusively. I am, etc.,</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> HERBERT SPENCER.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Mr. Spencer has had much to say of the unfairness of his critics. But this
  reply is not merely unfair; it is dishonest, and that in a way that makes flat
  falsehood seem manly.</p>
<p> From this letter the casual reader would understand that the Edinburgh reviewer,
  on the strength of detached passages, had charged Mr. Spencer with attacking
  the right of private property and upholding socialism, in a sense unwarranted
  by the context and disproved by the next chapter; and that the passage quoted
  from <em>Political Institutions</em> covers the same ground and disproves
  the constructions put on <em>Social Statics</em>.</p>
<p> The fact is, that the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> had not charged either Mr.
  Spencer or myself with more than attacking private property in land. This we
  had both
  unquestionably done, not only in the passages it had quoted but in many others.
  It had made no misconstruction whatever. What it had said of &quot;attacking
  the right of private property&quot; and &quot;upholding the doctrines of communism&quot; was
  a mere rhetorical flourish, made as an inference from, and by way of reply
  to, our denial of the right of private property in land. Mr. Spencer ignores
  the real charge and assumes the mere inference to be the charge. Thus, changing
  the issue, he cites the next chapter as if it disproved the <em>Edinburgh's</em> charge.
  This chapter (<a href="PI_C3_Social_Statics_The_Right_of_Property.htm">Chapter
  X., &quot;The Right of Property&quot;</a>), which has been
  given in full, contains nothing to lessen the force of the attack on private
  property in land made in the preceding chapter. On the contrary, in this chapter
  he reiterates his attack on private property in land, and seeks a basis for
  property by carrying the idea that the community should control land to the
  length of absurdity.</p>
<p> Nor was the writer in the <em>St. James's</em> unjustified in taking the
  reference to land in <em>Political Institutions</em> to be a briefer endorsement
  of the views more fully set forth in <em>Social Statics</em>; for <em>Political
  Institutions</em>  refers to private property in land as established by force,
  says that it does not
  stand on the same basis as ownership established by contract, likens it to
  slavery and predicts its abolition &#8212; expressions which, in the absence
  of any modification of the views elaborately asserted in <em>Social Statics</em>,
  could be taken in no other way than as indorsing them. The passages Mr. Spencer
  quotes
  no more modify the view of landownership set forth in <em>Social Statics</em> than
  Lord Lytton's <em>Coming Race</em> controverts Adam Smith's <em>Wealth of Nations</em>.
  In <em>Social
  Statics</em> Mr. Spencer declares what ought to be done; in the passage he
  quotes from <em>Political Institutions</em> he is prognosticating as to what
  it is likely will be done. By now substituting prognostication for declaration
  of right, Mr. Spencer seeks to convey the false impression that the Edinburgh
  reviewer has been guilty of carelessness, and the writer in the <em>St. James's</em>  of
  misrepresentation, and that he himself has never gone further than to express
  the guarded opinion that at some time, a great way off, men <em>may</em> substitute
  a common ownership of land for private ownership.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer is more than unfair, too, in assuming that the charge of upholding
  communism, etc., is applicable to me, though not to him. For, although my book
  was too visionary for him to read, he had at least read the <em>Edinburgh's</em> article,
  and knew that the charge against me had no other ground than that against him &#8212; the
  denial of the moral validity of private property in land.</p>
<p> Even what he says about such a plain matter of fact as the withdrawal of
  <em>Social Statics</em> from circulation in England conveys untruth.</p>
<p> The grievance that Mr. Spencer here alleges is that the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>  had
  commented on a book &quot;published thirty-two years ago, which I have
  withdrawn from circulation in England, and of which I have interdicted translations.&quot; What
  is to be understood from this, and what Mr. Spencer evidently intended to have
  understood, is that he had, presumably years before, withdrawn <em>Social Statics</em>  from circulation &#8212; not in the mere territory of England, as distinguished
  from Scotland, Ireland or the United States, but &#8212; in English. To make
  sure of this understanding, he adds that he has interdicted translations &#8212; which
  means, not in other places, but in other languages than English. Now the truth
  is, that at the time he thus wrote, that book was being published by his arrangement
  in the United States, as it had been for years before, and continued to be
  for years afterwards; and that up to this very time he had been importing it
  into England, and circulating it there. The only filament of truth in this
  statement, which though made incidentally is of prime importance to his purpose,
  is, as we now discover from his own utterance in 1892, that at this very time,
  or possibly a few weeks previous, he had resolved not again to import any more
  copies of <em>Social Statics</em> into England from the United States, though still
  keeping the book in circulation there, to be bought by whomsoever would buy!</p>
<p> As for the rest of this letter, the admirers of Mr. Spencer may decide for
  themselves what kind of ethical views they are that will not harmonize with
  political economy, and what kind of political economy it is that will not harmonize
  with ethics, and what they think of an ethical teacher who, on a question that
  involves the health and happiness, nay, the very life and death of great bodies
  of men, shelters himself behind such phrases as, &quot;it may be doubted,&quot; &quot;it
  may be,&quot; &quot;it seems possible,&quot; and so on, and endeavors to make
  them show that he regards the matter of right as one to deal with in the future
  and not at present.</p>
<p> This letter is not a withdrawal or a recantation of what Mr. Spencer had
  said against private property in land. It does not rise to that dignity. It
  is merely an attempt to avoid responsibility and to placate by subterfuge the
  powerful landed interests now aroused to anger. But it does indicate that a
  moral change had come over Mr. Spencer since he wrote <em>Social Statics</em>.</p>
<p> In several places in that book occurs the strong, idiomatic phrase, &quot;a
  straight man.&quot; This letter to the <em>St. James's</em> is not the letter of a straight
  man.</p>
<p> But as hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue, so the very crookedness
  of this letter indicates Mr. Spencer's reluctance flatly to deny the truth
  to which he had borne witness. He no more wanted to deny it than Simon Peter
  to deny his Lord. But the times had changed since he wrote <em>Social Statics</em>.
  From an unknown man, printing with difficulty an unsalable book, he had become
  a popular philosopher, to whom all gratifications of sense, as of intellect,
  were open.<font size="-1"><strong><em>6</em></strong></font> He had tasted the sweets of London society, and in the United States,
  from which he had just returned, had been hailed as a thinker beside whom Newton
  and Aristotle were to be mentioned only to point his superiority. And, while
  the fire in the hall of the High Priest was warm and pleasant, &quot;society&quot; had
  become suddenly aroused to rage against those who questioned private property
  in land. So when the <em>St. James's</em> and the <em>Edinburgh</em>, both of them chosen organs
  of Sir John and his Grace, accused Herbert Spencer of being one of these, it
  was to him like the voices of the accusing damsels to Peter. Fearing, too,
  that he might be thrust out in the cold, he, too, sought refuge in an alibi.</p>
