<p align="center"><strong><font size="-1">Henry George &#8212; A Perplexed Philosopher<br />
Part I: Declaration (continued)</font></strong> </p>
<p align="center"><strong>Chapter VI&#8212; From <em>Social Statics</em> To <em>Political Institutions</em> </strong></p>
<p>BUT the crudities and seeds of
    error in Mr. Spencer's treatment of the land question in <em>Social Statics</em> were
    of little moment beside its sterling merit. It was a clear, and, if we except
    or explain the <a href="PI_C2_The_Incongruous_Passage.htm">one incongruous
    passage</a>, an unfaltering assertion of a moral
    truth of the first importance &#8212; a truth at that time ignored. If Mr.
    Spencer had not mastered all the details of its application, he had at least
    seen and stated the fundamental principle that all men have natural, equal
    and inalienable rights to the use of land; that the right of ownership which
    justly attaches to things produced by labor cannot attach to land; that neither
    force, nor fraud, nor consent, nor transfer, nor prescription can give validity
    to private property in land; and that equal rights to land are still valid, &quot;all
    deeds, customs, and laws notwithstanding,&quot; and must remain valid &quot;until
    it can be demonstrated that God has given one charter of privileges to one
    generation and another to the next.&quot;</p>
<p> He had, moreover, shown that the practical recognition of these equal rights,
  even in the rude way he proposed, involved no community of goods and nothing
  like socialism or communism; but that it may be carried out in a way that &quot;need
  cause no very serious revolution in existing arrangements,&quot; and would
  be &quot;consistent with the highest civilization.&quot;</p>
<p> And this was in England, where the whole structure of society &#8212; social,
  political and industrial &#8212; was based on and embedded in private ownership
  of land, and in the year 1850, when, except by a few &quot;dreamers,&quot; no
  one thought of making any distinction between property in land and property
  in other things, and by the vast majority of men of all classes and conditions
  private property in land was looked on as something that always had existed,
  and, in the nature of things, always must exist.</p>
<p> But beyond the warnings that this was no way to success, which he doubtless
  received from friends, there is no reason to think that this revolutionary
  utterance of Mr. Spencer in <em>Social Statics</em> brought him the slightest unpleasant
  remonstrance at the time or for years after. If &quot;Sir John and his Grace&quot; &#8212; by
  which phrase Mr. Spencer had personified British landed interests &#8212; ever
  heard of the book, it was to snore, rather than to swear. So long as they feel
  secure, vested wrongs are tolerant of mere academic questioning; for those
  who profit by them, being the class of leisure and wealth, are also the class
  of liberal education and tastes, and often find a pleasing piquancy in radicalism
  that does not go beyond their own circles. A clever sophist might freely declaim
  in praise of liberty at the table of a Roman emperor. Voltaire, Rousseau and
  the encyclopedists were the fashionable fad in the drawing-rooms of the French
  aristocracy. And at the beginning of this century, and for years afterwards,
  a theoretical abolitionist, provided he did not talk in the hearing of the
  servants, might freely express his opinion of slavery among the cultured slaveholders
  of our Southern States. Thomas Jefferson declared his detestation of slavery,
  and, despite amendment, &quot;writ large&quot; his condemnation of it in the
  Declaration of Independence itself. Yet that declaration was signed by slaveholders
  and read annually by slaveholders, and Jefferson himself never became unpopular
  with slaveholders. But when the &quot;underground railway&quot; got into operation;
  when Garrison and his colleagues came with their demand for immediate, unconditional
  emancipation, then the feeling changed, and the climate of the South began
  to grow hot for any one even suspected of doubting the justice of the &quot;peculiar
  institution.&quot;</p>
<p> So it was with private property in land for over thirty years after <em>Social
  Statics</em> was written. One of the first to congratulate me on <em>Progress and
  Poverty</em>,
  when only an author's edition of a few hundred copies had been printed, and
  it seemed unlikely to those who knew the small demand for works on economic
  questions that there would ever be any more, was a very large landowner. He
  told me that he had been able freely to enjoy what he was pleased to term the
  clear logic and graceful style of my book, because he knew that it would be
  read only by a few philosophers, and could never reach the masses or &quot;do
  any harm.&quot;</p>
<p> For a long time this was the fate of Mr. Spencer's declaration against private
  property in land. It doubtless did good work, finding here and there a mind
  where it bore fruit. But the question had not passed beyond, and Mr. Spencer's
  book did not bring it beyond, the point of extremely limited academic discussion.</p>
<p> Though it brought Mr. Spencer the appreciation of a narrow circle, and thus
  proved the beginning of his literary career, <em>Social Statics</em> had but
  a small and slow circulation. The first and only English edition, as is usual
  with
  books for which no large sale is expected, was printed directly from type,
  without making stereotype plates. As Mr. Spencer tells us in the preface of
  his recent &quot;revision and abridgement,&quot; it took some ten years to
  sell that, after which, the sale not being enough to justify republication,
  which, in the absence of stereotype plates, would have involved the cost of
  setting up the type again, the book went out of print in England, without having
  attracted any general attention. This was but in the nature of things; for
  the class that profits by any wrong which affects the distribution of wealth
  must be the wealthy class, and consequently the class whose views dominate
  the existing organs of opinion. And until recently private property in land
  has been the sacred white elephant of English respectability, not even to be
  named without a salaam. The conspiracy of silence was therefore all that such
  a book could expect until it began to make way among the masses, and that neither
  the style of <em>Social Statics</em> nor the price at which it was published
  was calculated for. A similar fate to that which <em>Social Statics</em> met
  in England befell a very similar book, covering much the same ground &#8212; <em>Theory
  of Human Progression</em>, by Patrick Edward Dove, published a little before <em>Political
  Institutions</em>, but
  in the same year, and also asserting the equal right to the use of land. While
  Dove is not so elaborate as Spencer, he is clearer in distinctly disclaiming
  the idea of compensation, and in proposing to take ground-rent for public purposes
  by taxation, abolishing all other taxes. His book must have done some good
  work on the minds it reached, but it passed out of print and was practically
  forgotten.</p>
<p> <em>Social Statics</em>, however, had a happier fate in passing over
  to the United States. Among those early attracted by Mr. Spencer's writings
  was the
  late Professor E. L. Youmans, who in 1861-62 sought his acquaintance and entered
  into correspondence with him. Professor Youmans's tireless energy, backed by
  the resources of the strong publishing house of D. Appleton &amp; Co. of New
  York, with which he was connected, was thenceforward devoted to the task of
  popularizing Mr. Spencer and his teachings in the United States. Through the
  efforts of Professor Youmans, D. Appleton &amp; Co. arranged with Mr. Spencer
  for the publication of his books, and in 1864, making stereotype plates, they
  reissued <em>Social Statics</em>, and from that time forward kept it
  in print; and as may be seen, both from the preface of 1877 in their edition
  of <em>Social
  Statics</em> and from the preface to the abridgement of 1892, such English
  demand as existed was supplied by the sending over of sheets printed by them<em><strong>2</strong></em> &#8212; a
  more economical arrangement than that of printing a book of small circulation
  on both sides of the Atlantic. Thus in a larger sphere it continued to circulate,
  mainly in the United States (where Mr. Spencer's reputation, aided by the active
  work of Professor Youmans, grew first in popular estimation), and to some small
  extent at least in Great Britain. But the radical utterances on the land question
  that it contained gave no evidence of attracting active interest or passing
  for more than an academic opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">2. &quot;A number of years passed &#8212; some ten, I think &#8212; before
      the edition was exhausted; and as the demand seemed not great enough to
      warrant the setting up of type for a new edition, it was decided to import
      an edition
      from America, where the work had been stereotyped. After this had been
      disposed of a third edition was similarly imported.&quot; &#8212; Preface to &quot;Social
      Statics, Abridged and Revised,&quot; 1932.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Between 1850 and 1882, during the greater part of which time Mr. Spencer
  was engaged in developing his evolution philosophy, nothing more that I am
  aware of was heard from him on the land question. But Social Statics,
  in the United States at least, increased in circulation as Mr. Spencer's reputation
  grew, and its declarations continued to stand for his opinions without even
  a suggestion of change. Several prefaces, or notes, were from time to time
  added, but none indicating any modification of views with regard to the land
  question. The last of these was dated January 17, 1877. In this, certain changes
  in Mr. Spencer's opinions as to teleological implications, the political status
  of women, the useful effects of war, etc., are noted, but there is no modification
  of the radical utterances as to the tenure of land. On the contrary, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">To the fundamental ethical principle expressing in its abstract form what
      we know as justice I still adhere. I adhere also to the derivative principles
      formulated in what are commonly called personal rights, of this or that special
      kind.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> In <em>Political Institutions</em>, which, after some magazine publications of chapters,
  was finally published in book form in the early part of 1882, Mr. Spencer again
  spoke of the tenure of land, and in a way that would lead any one acquainted
  with his previous fuller treatment of the subject to understand that he still
  adhered to all that he had said in <em>Social Statics</em>.</p>
<p> <em>Political Institutions</em>, like the other divisions of the &quot;Principles
  of Sociology&quot; to which it belongs, is &quot;in part a retrospect and in
  part a prospect.&quot; First explaining in accordance with his general theory
  how social institutions have been evolved, Mr. Spencer proceeds to indicate
  what he thinks will be the course of their further evolution. In the chapter
  on &quot;Property,&quot; after some pages of examination he says (Section 539):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Induction and deduction uniting to show as they do that at
        first land is common property, there presents itself the question &#8212; How
        did the possession of it become individualized? There can be little doubt
        of the general nature
      of the answer. Force, in one form or other, is the sole cause adequate to make
      the members of a society yield up their joint claim to the area they inhabit.
      Such force may be that of an external aggressor or that of an internal aggressor,
      but in either case it implies militant activity.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Having thus repeated in a form adapted to the character of the book the declaration
  of <em>Social Statics</em> that the original deeds to private property in land were
  written with the sword, he proceeds to develop it, showing by the way a comprehension
  of the fact that the feudal tenures did not recognize the private property
  in land which has grown up since, or, as he phrases it, that &quot;the private
  landownership established by militancy is an incomplete one,&quot; being qualified
  by the claims of serfs and other dependents, and by obligations to the crown
  or state, and saying:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">In our own case the definite ending of these tenures took place in 1660;
      when for feudal obligations (a burden on landowners) was substituted a beer-excise
      (a burden on the community).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> From this, in a passage which will hereafter appear,<em><strong>3</strong></em> he
        proceeds to consider what is likely to be the future evolution of land
      tenure. Saying that &quot;ownership
        established by force does not stand on the same footing as ownership
      established by contract,&quot; he likens individual property in land to
      property in slaves, and intimates that as the one has disappeared so the
      other will doubtless disappear,
        to make place for landholding &quot;by virtue of agreements between individuals
        as tenants and the community as landowner. &#8230; after making full
        allowance for <em>the accumulated value artificially given</em>.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">3 See Mr. Spencer's letter to the Times, &quot;Second Letter.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> This is a restatement of what was said in Chapter IX., Section 9, of <em>Social
    Statics</em>, where, speaking of the once universal
    assumption that slavery was natural and right and the better faith that had
    been generated,
    he adds:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">It may by and by be perceived, that Equity utters dictates to which we have
      not yet listened; and men may then learn, that to deprive others of their rights
      to the use of the earth, is to commit a crime inferior only in wickedness to
      the crime of taking away their lives or personal liberties.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Thus, in so far as was consistent with the very different scope and character
  of the book, Mr. Spencer repeated in March, 1882, the views on the land question
  that he had set forth in 1850. And in this connection the words I have italicized
  are noteworthy as showing what was really meant in that <a href="PI_C2_The_Incongruous_Passage.htm">incongruous
  passage</a>  in <em>Social Statics</em> previously discussed.</p>
<p> With this reassertion in <em>Political Institutions</em> of the views
  on the land question set forth in <em>Social Statics</em> we must draw a line in our
  review.</p>
