      <p><strong>          Chapter VII &#8212; <em>Justice</em> On The Right To Light And Air </strong>
          </p>
    </div>
    <p> Mr. Spencer's carelessness of thought is shown in the very opening sentence
  of this chapter on &quot;The Rights to the Uses of Natural Media&quot;:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <font size="-1">A man may be entirely uninjured in body by the actions of fellow-men, and
      he may be entirely unimpeded in his movements by them, and he may yet be prevented
      from carrying on the activities needful for maintenance of life, by traversing
      his relations to the physical environment on which his life depends.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> How?</p>
<p> To ordinary apprehension, the only way in which men can be deprived of the
  use of &quot;the physical environment on which life depends&quot; is either
  by such bodily injuries as killing, maiming, binding, imprisoning, or by such
  restrictions on movement as have the threat of bodily injury behind them, like
  the taboo among the South Sea Islanders, or private property in land among
  us. Nor have the tyrants of the world, much as they would have liked to, ever
  been able to find any other way.</p>
<p> Without condescending to explain, Mr. Spencer goes on to quote Erskine to
  the effect that &quot;the light, the air, running water, etc., are so adapted
  to the common use of mankind, that no individual can acquire a property in
  them, or deprive others of their use.&quot;</p>
<p> This again shows carelessness in apprehension and statement. What Erskine
  really means is that the law does not, and that because it cannot, give property
  in the substance of matter, so that the molecules or atoms of which it is composed
  may be identified and reclaimed through all changes in form or place; but that
  ownership can attach to matter only in its relation to form or place. For instance,
  I buy today a dog or a horse. I acquire in this purchase the ownership of what
  matter is now, or at any time in the future may be, contained in the form of
  this dog or horse, not the ownership of a certain amount of matter in whatever
  form it may hereafter assume. That no law could give me, nor could I even set
  up a claim to it, for it would be impossible for me to identify it. For the
  matter which my dog or horse embodies for the moment, like the matter of which
  my own frame is composed, is constantly passing from that form to other forms.
  The only thing tangible to me or other men is this form. And it is in this
  that ownership consists. If my dog eats your mutton-chop, your property in
  the chop does not become property in the dog. If the law gives you any action
  it is certainly not that of replevin.</p>
<p> The principle of the law that Erskine refers to is thus stated by Blackstone
  (Chapter 2, Book II):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">I cannot bring an action to recover possession of a pool or other piece of
      water either by superficial measure for twenty acres of water or by general
      description, as for a pond or a rivulet; but I must bring my action for what
      lies at the bottom and call it twenty acres of land covered with water. For
      water is a movable, wandering thing, and must of necessity continue common
      by the law of nature, so that I can only have a temporary, transient, usufructuary
      property; wherefore if a body of water runs out of my pond into another man's
      I have no right to reclaim it. But the land which that water covers is permanent,
      fixed and immovable, and therefore in this I may have a certain substantial
      property, of which the law will take notice and not of the other.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Now the comparatively rough distinctions that are amply sufficient for the
  purposes of the lawyer are not always sufficient for the purposes of the philosopher.
  If we analyze this principle of the law, we see that no real distinction is
  made as to ownership between the substance of water and the substance of land &#8212; that
  is to say, between the more or less stable forms of matter of which the body
  of the universe consists. The distinction is as to tangible form. I may bring
  an action for ice, which is water that has assumed tangible form by the lowering
  of temperature, or for water in barrels or bottles, which in another way gives
  it form. And the real reason why, in an action for the possession of a body
  of water I must describe it as land covered by water, is that it is the land
  which holds the water in place and gives it form.</p>
<p> So, on the other hand, if a freshet or a water-burst carry the fertile soil
  from my field into that of my neighbor, I can no more reclaim it by action
  at law than I can reclaim the water that runs out of my pond. Or if a volcanic
  convulsion were to shift the position of a mineral deposit, it would cease
  to belong to one landowner and the other would acquire legal possession. The
  legal result would be precisely the same as the legal result of a change in
  a rivulet's course. In ruder times, ere the art of surveying was so well developed
  as now, it was customary to fix the boundaries of legal possession by natural
  objects deemed immovable, such as mountains, ocean shores, rivers, etc., and
  in places where this method has been retained changes in landmarks frequently
  change the ownership of considerable bodies of land, as on the shifting banks
  of the lower Mississippi. But our modern surveying takes for its basis latitude
  and longitude. And this is the essential idea of landownership: It is the ownership,
  not of certain atoms of matter, be they rock, soil, water or air, or of certain
  forms of energy, such as heat, light or electricity, but the ownership of a
  certain section of space and of all that may be therein contained.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer is confusing two essentially different ideas &#8212; the idea
  of substance and the idea of form or locality. In the one sense nothing whatever
  may be owned &#8212; land no more than light or electricity. In the other,
  all natural substances and powers may be owned &#8212; water, air, light, heat
  or electricity, as truly as land. And they are owned, though, since in our
  legal
  terminology space and its contents are known as land, they must in law be described
  as land. Whoever, under our laws, acquires ownership in land <em>may</em> deprive
  others of light, air, running water, etc., and <em>does</em> acquire a property
  in their use, which is frequently a tangible element, and at times the only
  element in the
  value of an estate &#8212; as where the purity of the air, the beauty of the
  view, the abundance of sunlight which a favorable exposure gives, the presence
  of mineral springs, or the access to streams, are elements in the price at
  which land can be sold or rented.</p>
<p> In the next sentence we are told that &quot;light and air cannot be monopolized.&quot; But
  they <em>are</em> monopolized in the monopolization of land, and this as effectually
  as any monopolizer could wish. It is true that air and sunlight are not formally
  bought, sold and rented. But why? Not that they could not be measured off and
  determined by metes and bounds, but simply because they are to our physical
  constitutions inseparable from land, so that whoever owns the land owns also
  the air it is bathed in and the light that falls on it. Light and air are monopolized
  whenever land is monopolized; and the exclusive use to them is bought and sold
  whenever land is bought and sold.</p>
<p> It is not merely that, as the flying-machine has not yet been perfected,
  the owner of land holds the means of access to the air above it and the light
  that falls on it; it is that the owner of land <em>is</em> the owner of such light and
  air, not merely virtually, but formally and legally. And were the air-ship
  perfected, he would have the same legal right to forbid trespass on <em>his</em> light
  and air, and to demand payment for any use made of it or any passage through
  it, thousands of feet above the surface, as he now has to forbid trespass on
  his ground or to demand payment for any use of or any passage through what
  lies thousands of feet below it. In English law, land does not mean merely
  the surface of the earth within certain metes and bounds, but all that may
  be above and all that may be below that surface; and under the same legal right
  by which the landowner holds as his private property any certain part of the
  surface of the globe he also holds the rocks and minerals below it and the
  air and the light above it. As Blackstone says: &quot;The word 'land' includes
  not only the face of the earth, but everything under it or over it. &#8230; By
  the name of land everything terrestrial will pass.&quot; The landowner is,
  in law as well as in fact, not a mere surface-owner, but a universe-owner.
  And just as in some places landowners sell the surface right, retaining mineral
  rights; or sell mineral rights, retaining surface rights; or sell the right
  of way, retaining rights to other use: so, where there is occasion, the right
  to use light and air may be separated, in sales and purchases and title-deeds,
  from the right to the use of the ground.</p>
<p> An invention which would make practicable the use of light and air without
  possession of the surface, would at once bring out the fact that, legally,
  they belong to landowners, just as subterranean mining and the projection of
  underground railways have brought out the fact that landowners are legal owners
  of all beneath the surface. In fact, existing deeds furnish instances in which
  the real thing bought and sold, though properly enough styled land in the conveyances,
  is not land at all in the narrow meaning, but light and air, or the right to
  their use. To cite a case: The city of Cleveland, O., some years since, desired
  to convert the viaduct bridge over the Cuyahoga River into a swinging bridge.
  To do this it was necessary that one end of the bridge should in its swing
  pass for a short distance through the air over a strip of land belonging to
  a private owner. The city of Cleveland had, therefore, to buy the right to
  use this air, and I have before me a copy of the deed, executed on the 28th
  of February, 1880, by which, in consideration of $9994.88, Meyers, Rouse &amp; Co.
  sell and convey to the city of Cleveland the right to swing such bridge over
  a small area thirty-five feet above the ground. Of this estate in the air the
  grantors describe themselves as holding a good and indefeasible title in fee
  simple, with the right to bargain and sell the same. Were it thirty-five hundred
  or thirty-five hundred thousand feet above the surface, the legal right of
  ownership would be the same. For the ownership which attaches to land under
  our laws is not to be really measured by linear feet and inches, but by parallels
  of latitude and meridians of longitude, starting from the center of the earth
  and indefinitely extendible. And while Meyers, Rouse &amp; Co. have sold to
  the city of Cleveland a slice of their air of perhaps fifteen feet in depth,
  they still retain the legal ownership of all the air above it, and could demand
  toll of or refuse passage to any flying-machine that should attempt to cross
  it.</p>
<p> The same lack of analytic power continues to be shown by Mr. Spencer when
  he goes on to tell us that the equal rights to the use of light and air, though
  not recognized in primitive stages, have, in the course of social evolution,
  come to be completely or all but completely recognized now. So far is this
  from being true, that in such countries as England and the United States there
  is no recognition whatever of the equal right to the use of light and air.
  To the list of interdictions which he cites as recognitions of this equal right,
  he might as well have added that of shying bricks through these media at passers-by.
  For where the interdictions he mentions &#8212; of interceptions of light and
  air, of smoking in certain places, of the maintenance of stenches and fumes,
  of the making of disturbing noises &#8212; are not mere interdictions of certain
  species of assault; they are interdictions based on and involved in the ownership
  of land.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer might have seen this for himself, where he speaks of &quot;the
  law which forbids the building of walls, houses, or other edifices within prescribed
  distances of other houses &#8230; and seeks to compromise the claims of adjacent
  owners as fairly as seem practicable.&quot;</p>
<p> Owners of what? Why, owners of land. It is only as an owner of land, or as
  the tenant of an owner of land, that under our English law any one has a right
  to complain of the interception of light and air by another landowner. The
  owner of land may intercept light and air, may make noises and create stenches
  to any extent he pleases, provided he infringes not the equal rights of other
  owners of land, for light and air are considered by English law as what they
  truly are, so far as human beings are concerned, appurtenances of land. No
  one in England, be he stranger or native-born, has any legal right whatever
  to the use of English light and English air, save as the owner or grantee of
  an owner of English land. That even on the Queen's highways the public are
  deemed to have such rights as against adjacent landholders I am not sure. Certain
  it is, that one may travel for miles through the public roads, amid the finest
  scenery in those countries, and find the view wantonly shut out by high and
  costly walls, erected for the express purpose of intercepting the light, and
  crowned on their tops with broken glass, to tear the clothes and cut the flesh
  of any one who dares climb them to get such a view as the unintercepted light
  would give.</p>
<p> The rights to the use of light, air and other natural media are in truth
  as inseparable from the right to the use of land as the bottom of that atmospheric
  ocean which surrounds our globe is inseparable from the globe's surface; and
  the pretence of treating them separately could spring only from Mr. Spencer's
  evident desire to confuse the subject he is pretending to treat, to cover with
  a fog of words his abandonment of a position incapable of refutation, and from
  the false assumption that the liberty of each to the use of air and light,
  limited only by the like liberty of all, is practically and legally recognized,
  to lead to the still more preposterously false assumption that equal rights
  to the use of land are also fully recognized.</p>
<p> But before examining this last assumption, there is one form of it which
  he incidentally makes that is worth noticing &#8212; the assumption that the
  equal right to personal liberty and freedom of movement is already fully recognized.</p>
<p> It is a pity that Mr. Spencer had not intermitted his studies of the Abors,
        the Bodas, the Creeks, the Dhimals, the Eghas, and other queer people,
      to the end of the alphabet, of whom his later books are as full as those
      of the pedants
        of the last century were of classical quotations, and made some observations
        in his own country. They would have saved him from the astounding statement
        that &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">At the present time, among ourselves at least, there exists no idea, sentiment,
          or usage, at variance with the conclusion that each man is free to use his
        limbs and move about where he pleases.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
<p> The truth is, that instead of every one being free in England &quot;to use
  his limbs and move about where he pleases,&quot; there is no part of the British
  Isles, even though it be wild moor, bleak deer-forest or bare mountain-top,
  where a man is free to move about without permission of the private owner,
  except it be the highroads, the public places, or other strips and spots of
  land deemed the property of the community.</p>
<p> Mr. Spencer seems to have forgotten this now, but he knew it when in <em>Social
  Statics</em> he denounced the system that permitted the Duke of Leeds to warn off
  tourists from Ben Mac Dhui, the Duke of Atholl to close Glen Tilt, the Duke
  of Buccleuch to deny Free Church sites, and the Duke of Sutherland to displace
  Highlanders with deer.</p>
<p> &quot;Verily, they have their reward.&quot; The name of Herbert Spencer now
  appears with those of about all the Dukes in the Kingdom as the director of
  an association formed for the purpose of defending private property in land
  that was especially active in the recent London County Council election.</p>
