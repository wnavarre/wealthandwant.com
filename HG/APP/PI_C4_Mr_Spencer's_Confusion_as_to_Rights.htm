<p align="center"><strong><font size="-1">Henry George &#8212; A Perplexed Philosopher<br />
Part I: Declaration (continued)</font></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Chapter IV&#8212;  Mr. Spencer's Confusion As To Rights.
</strong></p>
<p> My purpose in quoting Chapter X is to show what were the views on the land
  question expressed by Mr. Spencer in <em>Social Statics</em>. It may, however, be worthwhile,
  in passing, to clear up the confusion in which he here entangles the right
  to the products of labor with the right to land. This confusion he has not
  yet escaped from, as it is still to be seen in his latest book, Justice, where,
  though evidently anxious to minimize the land question, he still assumes that
  to justify the right of property in things produced from nature the consent
  of all men must be obtained or inferred.</p>
<p> Nor is it the right of property alone that is thus confused. Mr. Spencer
  really puts himself in the same dilemma that, in Section 5, he proposes to
  Proudhon; for if, as in this chapter he asserts, no one can equitably become
  the exclusive possessor of any natural substance or product until the joint
  rights of all the rest of mankind have been made over to him by some species
  of quit-claim &#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Then, amongst other consequences, it follows, that a man
      can have no right to the things he consumes for food. And if these are
      not his before eating
    them, how can they become his at all? As Locke asks, &quot;when do they begin
    to be his? when he digests? or when he eats? or when he boils? or when he
    brings them home?&quot; If no previous acts can make them his property, neither
    can any process of assimilation do it; not even their absorption into the
    tissues.
    Wherefore, pursuing the idea, we arrive at the curious conclusion, that as
    the whole of his bones, muscles, skin, etc., have been thus built up from
    nutriment not belonging to him, a man has no property in his own flesh and
    blood &#8212; can
    have no valid title to himself &#8212; has no more claim to his own limbs
    than he has to the limbs of another &#8212; and has as good a right to his
    neighbor's body as to his own!</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> The fact is, that without noticing the change, Mr. Spencer has dropped the
  idea of equal rights to land, and taken up in its stead a different idea &#8212; that
  of joint rights to land. That there is a difference may be seen at once. For
  joint rights may be and often are unequal rights.</p>
<p> The matter is an important one, as it is the source of a great deal of popular
  confusion. Let me, therefore explain it fully.</p>
<p> When men have equal rights to a thing, as for instance, to the rooms and
  appurtenances of a club of which they are members, each has a right to use
  all or any part of the thing that no other one of them is using. It is only
  where there is use or some indication of use by one of the others that even
  politeness dictates such a phrase as &quot;Allow me!&quot; or &quot;If you
  please!&quot;</p>
<p> But where men have joint rights to a thing, as for instance, to a sum of
  money held to their joint credit, then the consent of all the others is required
  for the use of the thing or of any part of it, by any one of them.</p>
<p> Now, the rights of men to the use of land are not joint rights; they are
  equal rights.</p>
<p> Were there only one man on earth, he would have a right to the use of the
  whole earth or any part of the earth.</p>
<p> When there is more than one man on earth, the right to the use of land that
  any one of them would have, were he alone, is not abrogated: it is only limited.
  The right of each to the use of land is still a direct, original right, which
  he holds of himself, and not by the gift or consent of the others; but it has
  become limited by the similar rights of the others, and is therefore an equal
  right. His right to use the earth still continues; but it has become, by reason
  of this limitation, not an absolute right to use any part of the earth, but
  (1) an absolute right to use any part of the earth as to which his use does
  not conflict with the equal rights of others (i.e., which no one else wants
  to use at the same time), and (2) a coequal right to the use of any part of
  the earth which he and others may want to use at the same time.</p>
<p> It is, thus, only where two or more men want to use the same land at the
  same time that equal rights to the use of land come in conflict, and the adjustment
  of society becomes necessary.</p>
<p> If we keep this idea of equal rights in mind&#8212;the idea, namely, that
  the rights are the first thing, and the equality merely their limitation&#8212;we
  shall have no difficulty. It is through forgetting this that Mr. Spencer has
  been led into confusion.</p>
<p> In Chapter IX, &quot;The Right to the Use of the Earth,&quot; he correctly
  apprehends and states the right to the use of land as an equal right. He says:&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">Each of them is free to use the earth for the satisfaction of his wants,</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1"> Provided he allows all others the same liberty.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Here, in the first clause, is the primary right; in the second clause, the
  proviso or limitation.</p>
<p> But in the next chapter, &quot;The Right of Property,&quot; he has, seemingly
  without noticing it himself, substituted for the idea of equal rights to land
  the idea of joint rights to land. He says (Section l):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <font size="-1">No amount of labor, bestowed by an individual upon a part of the earth's
    surface, can nullify the title of society to that part, . . . no one can, by
    the mere act of appropriating to himself any wild unclaimed animal or fruit,
    supersede the joint claims of other men to it. It may be quite true that the
    labor a man expends in catching or gathering, gives him a better right to the
    thing caught or gathered, than any <em>one</em> other man; but the question at issue
    is, whether by labor so expended, he has made his right to the thing caught
    or gathered, greater than the preexisting rights of all other men put together.
    And unless he can prove that he has done this, his title to possession cannot
    be admitted as a matter of <em>right</em>, but can be conceded only on the ground of
    convenience.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Here the primary right &#8212; the right by which &quot;each of them is free
  to use the earth for the satisfaction of his wants&quot; &#8212; has been dropped
  out of sight, and the mere proviso has been swelled into the importance of
  the primary right, and has taken its place.</p>
<p> What Mr. Spencer here asserts, without noticing his change of position, is
  not that the rights of men to the use of land are equal right, but
  that they are joint rights. And, from this careless shifting of ground, he
  is led, not only into hypercritical questioning of Locke's derivation of the
  right of property, but into the assumption that a man can have no <em>right</em> to
  the wild berries he has gathered on an untrodden prairie, unless he can prove
  the consent of all other men to his taking them. This <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>  is a deduction from the idea of joint rights to land, whereas the deduction
  from the equality of rights to land would be that
  under such circumstance &#8212; a man would have a right to take all the berries
  he wanted, and that <em>all</em> other men together would have no right to forbid him.
  Indeed, so great is Mr. Spencer's confusion, and so utterly unable does he
  become to assume a clear and indisputable right of property, that he has to
  cut the knot into which he has tangled the subject and finds no escape but
  in the preposterous declaration that the dictates of ethics have no application
  to, and do not exist in, any social state except that of the highest civilization.</p>
<p> Locke was not in error. The right of property in things produced by labor &#8212; and
  this is the only true right of property &#8212; springs directly from the right
  of the individual to himself, or as Locke expresses it, from his &quot;property
  in his own person.&quot; It is as clear and has as fully the sanction of equity
  in any savage state as in the most elaborate civilization. Labor can, of course,
  produce nothing without land; but the right to the use of land is a primary
  individual right, not springing from society, or depending on the consent of
  society, either expressed or implied, but inhering in the individual, and resulting
  from his presence in the world. Men must have rights before they can have equal
  rights. Each man has a right to use the world because he is here and wants
  to use the world. The equality of this right is merely a limitation arising
  from the presence of others with like rights. Society, in other words, does
  not grant, and cannot equitably withhold from any individual, the right to
  the use of land. That right exists before society and independently of society,
  belonging at birth to each individual, and ceasing only with his death. Society
  itself has no original right to the use of land. What right it has with regard
  to the use of land is simply that which is derived from and is necessary to
  the determination of the rights of the individuals who compose it. That is
  to say, the function of society with regard to the use of land only begins
  where individual rights clash, and is to secure equality between these clashing
  right of individuals.</p>
<p> What Locke meant, or at least the expression that will give full and practical
  form to his idea, is simply this: That the equal right to life involves the
  equal right to the use of natural materials; that, consequently, any one has
  a right to the use of such natural opportunities as may not be wanted by any
  one else; and that the result of his labor, so expended, does of right become
  his individual property against all the world. For, where one man wants to
  use a natural opportunity that no one else wants to use, he has a <em>right</em> to
  do so, which springs from and is attested by the fact of his existence. This
  is an absolute, unlimited right, so long and in so far as no one else wants
  to use the same natural opportunity. Then, but not till then, it becomes limited
  by the similar rights of others. Thus no question of the right of any one to
  use any natural opportunity can arise until more than one man wants to use
  the same natural opportunity. It is only then that any question of this right,
  any need for the action of society in the adjustment of equal rights to land,
  can come up.</p>
<p> Thus, instead of there being no right of property until society has so far
  developed that all land has been properly appraised and rented for terms of
  years, an absolute right of property in the things produced by labor exists
  from the beginning &#8212; is coeval with the existence of man.</p>
<p> In the right of each man to himself, and his right to use the world, lies
  the sure basis of the right of property. This Locke saw &#8212; just as the
  first man must have seen it. But Mr. Spencer, confused by a careless substitution
  of terms, has lost his grasp on the right of property and has never since recovered
  it.</p>
<p> Getting rid of the idea of joint rights we see that the task of securing,
  in an advanced and complex civilization, the equal rights of all to the use
  of land is much simpler and easier than Mr. Spencer and the land nationalizationists
  suppose; that it is not necessary for society to take land and rent it out.
  For so long as only one man wants to use a natural opportunity it has no value;
  but as soon as two or more want to use the same natural opportunity, a value
  arises. Hence, any question as to the adjustment of equal rights to the use
  of land occurs only as to valuable land; that is to say, land that has a value
  irrespective of the value of any improvements in or on it. As to land that
  has no value, or, to use the economic phrase, bears no rent, whoever may choose
  to use it has not only an equitable title to all that his labor may produce
  from it, but society cannot justly call on him for any payment for the use
  of it. As to land that has a value, or, to use the economic phrase in the economic
  meaning, bears rent, the principle of equal freedom requires only that this
  value, or economic rent, be turned over to the community. Hence the formal
  appropriation and renting out of land by the community is not necessary: it
  is only necessary that the holder of valuable land should pay to the community
  an equivalent of the ground value, or economic rent; and this can be assured
  by the simple means of collecting ail assessment in the form of a tax on the
  value of land, irrespective of improvements in or on it.</p>
<p> In this way all members of the community are placed on equal terms with regard
  to natural opportunities that offer greater advantages than those any one member
  of the community is free to use, and are consequently sought by more than one
  of those having equal rights to use the land. And, since the value of land
  arises from competition and is constantly fixed by competition, the question
  of who shall use this superior land desired by more than one is virtually decided
  by competition, which settles clashing individual desires by determining at
  once both who shall be accorded the use of the superior land, and who will
  make the most productive use of it. In this way all, including the user of
  the superior natural opportunity, obtain their equal shares of the superiority,
  by the taking of its value for their common uses; while all the difficulties
  of state rental of land and of determining and settling for the value of improvements
  are avoided. This is the single-tax system.</p>
