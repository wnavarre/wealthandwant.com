<center><b> Moses &#8212; Apostle of Freedom</b></center>
<p style="text-align: center;"> By Henry George<br>
1878</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> An address delivered by Henry George <br>
before the Young Men&#8217;s
Hebrew Association of San Francisco, <br>
and then in many other places</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>It is not the protection of property, but the protection
of humanity, that is the aim of the Mosaic code. Its sanctions are not
directed to securing the strong in heaping up wealth as much as to
preventing the weak from being crowded to the wall.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>There is in modern thought a tendency to look upon the prominent
characters of history as resultants rather than as initiatory forces.
As in an earlier stage the irresistible disposition is to
personification, so now it is to reverse this process, and to resolve
into myths mighty figures long enshrined by tradition. </p>
<p> Yet, if we try to trace to the sources of these movements, whose
perpetuated impulses eddy and play in the currents of our times, we
at last reach the individual. It is true that "institutions make
men," but it is also true that "in the beginnings men make
institutions." </p>
<p> In a well-known passage Macaulay has described the impression
made upon the imagination by the antiquity of that Church, which,
surviving dynasties and empires, carries the mind back to a time when
the smoke of sacrifice rose from the Pantheon and camelopard and
tiger bounded in the Flavian amphitheatre. But there still exist
among us observances &#8211; transmitted in unbroken succession from
father to son &#8211; that go back to a yet more remote past. </p>
<p> Each recurring year brings a day on which, in every land, there
are men who, gathering about them their families, and attired as if
for a journey, eat with solemnity a hurried meal. Before the walls of
Rome were traced, before Homer sung, this feast was kept, and the
event to which it points was even then centuries old. </p>
<p> That event signals the entrance upon the historic stage of a
people on many accounts remarkable &#8211; a people: who, though they
never founded a great empire nor built a great metropolis, have
exercised upon a large portion of humankind an influence, widespread,
potent, and continuous; who have for nearly two thousand years been
without country or organised nationality, yet have preserved their
identity and faith through all vicissitudes of time and fortune; who
have been overthrown, crushed, scattered; who have been ground, as it
were, to very dust, and flung to the four winds of heaven; yet who,
though thrones have fallen, and empires have perished, and creeds
have changed, and living tongues have become dead, still exist with a
vitality seemingly unimpaired. They are a people who unite the
strangest contradictions; and whose annals now blaze with glory, now
sound the depths of shame and woe. </p>
<p> The advent of such a people marks an epoch in the history of the
world. But it is not of that advent as much as of the central and
colossal figure around which its traditions cluster that I propose to
speak. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Three great religions place the
leader of the Exodus upon the
highest plane they allot to humankind.</span> To Christendom and to
Islam,
as well as to Judaism, Moses is the mouthpiece and lawgiver of the
Most High; the medium, clothed with supernatural powers, through
which the divine will has spoken. Yet this very exaltation, by
raising him above comparison, may prevent the real grandeur of the
man from being seen. It is amid his brethren that Saul stands taller
and fairer. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the latest school of Biblical criticism
asserts that the books and legislation attributed to Moses are really
the products of an age subsequent to that of the prophets. Yet, to
this Moses, looming vague and dim, of whom they can tell us almost
nothing, they, too, attribute the beginning of that growth which
flowered after centuries in the humanities of Jewish law, and in the
sublime conception of one God, universal and eternal, the Almighty
Father. </p>
<p> But whether wont to look on Moses in this way or in that, it may
be sometimes worth our while to take the point of view in which all
shades of belief or disbelief may find common ground, and accepting
the main features of Hebrew record and tradition, consider them in
the light of history as we know it, and of human nature as it shows
itself today. Here is a case in which sacred history may be treated
as we would treat profane history without any shock to religious
feeling. Nor can the keenest criticism resolve Moses into a myth. The
fact of the Exodus presupposes such a leader. </p>
<p> To lead into freedom a people long crushed by tyranny; to
discipline and order such a mighty host; to harden them into fighting
men, before whom warlike tribes quailed and walled cities went down;
to repress discontent and jealousy and mutiny; to combat reactions
and reversions; to turn the quick, fierce flame of enthusiasm to the
service of a steady purpose, required some towering character &#8211;
a character blending in highest expression the qualities of
politician, patriot, philosopher, and statesman. </p>
<p> Such a character in rough but strong outline the tradition shows
us &#8211; the union of the wisdom of the Egyptians with the unselfish
devotion of the meekest of men. From first to last, in every glimpse
we get, this character is consistent with itself, and with the mighty
work which is its monument. It is the character of a great mind,
hemmed in by conditions and limitations, and working with such forces
and materials as were at hand &#8211; accomplishing, yet failing.
Behind grand deed, a grander thought. Behind high performance the
still nobler ideal. </p>
<p> Egypt was the mould of the Hebrew nation &#8211; the matrix, so to
speak, in which a single family, or, at most, a small tribe grew to a
people as numerous as the American people at the time of the
Declaration of Independence. For four centuries, according to the
Hebrew tradition &#8211; that is to say, for a period longer than
America has been known to Europe &#8211; this growing people, becoming
a patriarchal family from a roving, pastoral life, had been under the
dominance of a highly developed and ancient civilisation, whose
fixity is symbolised by monuments that rival in endurance the
everlasting hills &#8211; a civilisation so ancient that the pyramids,
as we now know, were hoary with centuries ere Abraham looked upon
them. </p>
<p> No matter how clearly the descendants of the kinsfolk, who came
into Egypt, at the invitation of the boy-slave become prime minister,
maintained the distinction of race and the traditions of a freer
life, they must have been powerfully affected by such a civilisation;
and just as the Hebrews of today are Polish in Poland, German in
Germany, and American in the United States, so, but far more clearly
and strongly, the Hebrews of the Exodus must have been essentially
Egyptian. </p>
<p> It is not remarkable, therefore, that the ancient Hebrew
institutions show in so many points the influence of Egyptian ideas
and customs. What is remarkable is the dissimilarity. To the
unreflecting nothing may seem more natural than that a people, in
turning their backs upon a land where they had been long oppressed,
should discard its ideas and institutions. But the student of
history, the observer of politics, knows that nothing is more
unnatural. Habits of thought are even more tyrannous than habits of
the body. They make for the masses of people a mental atmosphere out
of which they can no more rise than out of the physical atmosphere. A
people long used to despotism may rebel against a tyrant; they may
break his statutes and repeal his laws, cover with odium that which
he loved, and honour that which he hated; but they will hasten to set
up another tyrant in his place. A people used to superstition may
embrace a purer faith, but it will be only to degrade it to their old
ideas. A people used to persecution may flee from it, but only to
persecute in their turn when they get power. </p>
<p> For "institutions make men." And when amid a people used to
institutions of one kind, we see suddenly arise institutions of an
opposite kind, we know that behind them must be that active, that
initiative force &#8211; the "men who in the beginnings make
institutions." </p>
<p> This is what occurs in the Exodus. The striking differences
between Egyptian and Hebrew polity are not of form, but of essence.
The tendency of the one is to subordination and oppression; of the
other to individual freedom. Strangest of recorded births! From out
of the strongest and most splendid despotism of antiquity comes the
freest republic. From between the paws of the rock-hewn Sphinx rises
the genius of human liberty, and the trumpets of the Exodus throb
with the defiant proclamation of the rights of humanity. </p>
<p> Consider what Egypt was. See the grandeur of her monuments; those
very monuments &#8211; that after the lapse, not of centuries but of
millenniums, seem to say to us, as the Egyptian priests said to the
boastful Greeks: "Ye are children!" &#8211; testify to the enslavement
of the people, and are the enduring witnesses of a social
organisation that rested on the masses an immovable weight. That
narrow Nile valley, the cradle of the arts and sciences, the scene,
perhaps, of the greatest triumphs of the human mind, is also the
scene of its most abject enslavement. In the long centuries of its
splendour, its lord, secure in the possession of irresistible
temporal power, and securer still in the awful sanctions of a
mystical religion, was as a god on earth, to cover whose poor carcass
with a tomb befitting his state hundreds of thousands toiled away
their lives. </p>
<p> For the classes who came next to him were those who enjoyed all
the sensuous delights of a most luxurious civilisation, and high
intellectual pleasures which the mysteries of the temple hid from
vulgar profanation. But for the millions who constituted the base of
the social pyramid there was but the lash to stimulate their toil,
and the worship of beasts to satisfy the yearnings of the soul. From
time immemorial to the present day the lot of the Egyptian peasants
has been to work and to starve so that those above them might live
daintily. They have never rebelled. That spirit was long ago crushed
out of them by institutions which make them what they are. They know
but to suffer and to die. Imagine what opportune circumstances we
may, yet, to organise and carry on a movement resulting in the
release of a great people from such a soul-subduing tyranny, backed
by an army of half a million highly trained soldiers, required a
leadership of most commanding and consummate genius, But this task,
surprising great though it be, is not the measure of the greatness
of the leader of the Exodus. </p>
<p> It is not in the deliverance from Egypt, it is in the
constructive statesmanship that laid the foundations of the Hebrew
commonwealth that the superlative grandeur of the leadership looms
up. As we cannot imagine the Exodus without the great leader, neither
can we account for the Hebrew polity without the great statesman. Not
merely intellectually great, but morally great &#8211; a statesman
aglow with the unselfish patriotism that refuses to grasp a sceptre
or found a dynasty. </p>
<p> The lessons of modern history, the manifestations of human nature
that we behold around us, would teach us to see in the essential
divergence of the Hebrew polity from that of Egypt the impress of a
master mind, even if Hebrew tradition had not testified both to the
influence of such a mind, and to the constant disposition of
accustomed ideas to reassert themselves in the minds of the people.
</p>
<p> Over and over again the murmurings break out; no sooner is the
back of Moses turned than the cry, "These be thy gods, O Israel!",
announces the setting up of the Egyptian calf; while the strength of
the monarchial principle shows itself in the inauguration of a king
as quickly as the far-reaching influence of the great leader is
somewhat spent. </p>
<p> It matters not when or by whom were compiled the books popularly
attributed to Moses; it matters not how much of the code there given
may be the survivals of more ancient usage or the amplifications of a
later age; its great features bear the stamp of a mind far in advance
of people and time, of a mind that beneath effects sought for causes,
of a mind that drifted not with the tide of events, but aimed at a
definite purpose. </p>
<p> The outlines that the record gives us of the character of Moses
&#8211; the brief relations that wherever the Hebrew scriptures are
read have hung the chambers of the imagination with vivid pictures
&#8211; are in every way consistent with this idea. What we know of
the life illustrates what we know of the work. What we know of the
work illumines the life. </p>
<p> It was not an empire such as had reached full development in
Egypt, or existed in rudimentary patriarchal form in the tribes
around, that Moses aimed to found. Nor was it a republic where the
freedom of the citizen rested on the servitude of the helot, and the
individual was sacrificed to the state. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> It was a commonwealth based upon
the individual</span> &#8211; <strong>a
commonwealth whose ideal it was that every man should sit under his
own vine and fig tree, with none to vex him or make him afraid. It
was a commonwealth: in which none should be condemned to ceaseless
toil; in which, for even the bond slave, there should be hope; and in
which, for even the beast of burden, there should be rest. A
commonwealth in which, in the absence of deep poverty, the many
virtues that spring from personal independence should harden into a
national character &#8211; a commonwealth in which the family
affections might knit their tendrils around each member, binding with
links stronger than steel the various parts into the living whole. </strong></p>
<p><strong> It is not the protection of property, but the protection of
humanity, that is the aim of the Mosaic code.</strong> Its sanctions are not
directed to securing the strong in heaping up wealth as much as to
preventing the weak from being crowded to the wall. At every point it
interposes its barriers to the selfish greed that, if left unchecked,
will surely differentiate men into landlord and serf, capitalist and
working person, millionaire and tramp, ruler and ruled. Its Sabbath
day and Sabbath year secure, even to the lowliest, rest and leisure.
With the blast of the Jubilee trumpets the slave goes free, the debt
that cannot be paid is cancelled, and a re-division of the land
secures again to the poorest their fair share in the bounty of the
common Creator. The reaper must leave something for the gleaner; even
the ox cannot be muzzled as he treadeth out the corn. Everywhere, in
everything, the dominant idea is that of our homely phrase: "Live and
let live!" </p>
<p> <strong>And the religion with which this civil policy is so closely
intertwined exhibits kindred features &#8211; from the idea of the
"brotherhood of man" springs the idea of the fatherhood of God.
</strong>Though the forms may resemble those of Egypt, the spirit is that
which Egypt had lost. Though a hereditary priesthood is retained, the
law in its fullness is announced to all the people. Though the
Egyptian rite of circumcision is preserved, and Egyptian symbols
reappear in all the externals of worship, the tendency to take the
type for the reality is sternly repressed. It is only when we think
of the bulls and the hawks, of the deified cats, and sacred
ichneumons of Egypt, that we realise the full meaning of the command:
"Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image!" </p>
<p> And if we seek beneath form and symbol and command, the thought
of which they are but the expression, we find that the great
distinctive feature of the Hebrew religion, that which separates it
by such a wide gulf from the religions amid which it grew up, is its
utilitarianism, its recognition of divine law in human life. <strong>It
asserts, not a God whose domain is confined to the far off beginning
or the vague future, who is over and above and beyond humanity, but a
God who in His inexorable laws is here and now; a God of the living
as well as of the dead; a God of the market place as well as of the
temple; a God whose judgments wait not another world for execution,
but whose immutable decrees will, in this life, give happiness to the
people that heed them and bring misery upon the people that forget
them. </strong>Amid the forms of splendid degradation in which a once noble
religion had in Egypt sunk to petrification, amid a social order in
which the divine justice seemed to sleep &#8211; I AM was the truth
that dawned upon Moses. And in his desert contemplation of
nature&#8217;s flux and reflux, the death that bounds her life, the
life she brings from death, always consuming yet never consumed
&#8211; I AM was the message that fell upon his inner ear. </p>
<p> The absence in the Mosaic books of any reference to a future life
is only intelligible by the prominence into which this truth is
brought. Nothing could have been more familiar to the Hebrews of the
Exodus than the doctrine of immortality. The continued existence of
the soul, the judgment after death, the rewards and punishments of
the future state, were the constant subjects of Egyptian thought and
art. But a truth may be hidden or thrown into the background by the
intensity with which another truth is grasped. </p>
<p> And the doctrine of immortality, springing as it does from the
very depths of human nature, ministering to aspirations which become
stronger and stronger as intellectual life rises to higher planes and
the life of the affections becomes more intense, may yet become so
incrusted with degrading superstitions, may be turned by craft and
selfishness into such a potent instrument for enslavement, and so
used to justify crimes at which every natural instinct revolts, that
to the earnest spirit of the social reformer it may seem like an
agency of oppression to enchain the intellect and prevent true
progress; a lying device with which the cunning fetter the credulous.
</p>
<p> The belief in the immortality of the soul must have existed in
strong forms among the masses of the Hebrew people. But the truth
that Moses brought so prominently forward, the truth his gaze was
concentrated upon, is a truth that has often been thrust aside by the
doctrine of immortality, and that may perhaps, at times, react on it
in the same way. This is the truth that the actions of men and women
bear fruit in this world, that though on the petty scale of
individual life wickedness may seem to go unpunished and wrong to be
rewarded, there is yet a nemesis that with tireless feet and pitiless
arm follows every national crime and smites the children for the
father&#8217;s transgression; the truth that each individual must act
upon and be acted upon by the society of which he or she is a part,
that all must in some degree suffer for the sin of each, and the life
of each be dominated by the conditions imposed by all. </p>
<p> It is the intense appreciation of this truth that gives the
Mosaic institutions so practical and utilitarian a character. Their
genius, if I may so speak, leaves the abstract speculations, where
thought so easily loses and wastes itself, or finds expression only
in symbols that become finally but the basis of superstition, in
order that it may concentrate attention upon the laws which determine
the happiness or misery of humanity upon this earth. </p>
<p> Its lessons have never tended to the essential selfishness of
asceticism, which is so prominent a feature in Brahmanism and
Buddhism, and from which Christianity and Islamism have not been
exempt. Its injunction has never been "Leave the world to itself that
you may save your own soul" but rather: "Do your duty in the world
that you may be happier and the world be better." It has disdained no
sanitary regulation that might secure the health of the body. Its
promise has been of peace and plenty and length of days, of stalwart
sons and comely daughters. </p>
<p> It maybe that the feeling of Moses in regard to a future life was
that expressed in the language of the Stoic: "It is the business of
Jupiter, not mine;" or it may be that it partook of the same
revulsion that shows itself in modern times, when a spirit
essentially religious has been turned against the forms and
expressions of religion, because these forms and expressions have
been made the props and bulwarks of tyranny, and even the name and
teachings of the carpenter&#8217;s son perverted into supports of
social injustice &#8211; used to guard the pomp of Caesar and justify
the greed of Dives. </p>
<p> Yet, however such feelings influenced Moses, I cannot think that
such a soul as his, living such a life as his &#8211; feeling the
exaltation of great thoughts, feeling the burden of great cares,
feeling the bitterness of great disappointments &#8211; did not
stretch forward to the hope beyond; did not rest and strengthen and
ground itself in the confident belief that the death of the body is
but the emancipation of the mind; did not feel the assurance that
there is a power in the universe upon which it might confidently rely
through wreck of matter and crash of worlds! </p>
<p> Yet the great concern of Moses was with the duty that lay plainly
before him; the effort to lay the foundations of a social state in
which deep poverty and degrading want should be unknown &#8211; where
people released from the meaner struggles that waste human energy
should have opportunity for intellectual and moral development. </p>
<p> Here stands out the greatness of the man. What was the wisdom and
stretch of the forethought that in the desert sought to guard in
advance against the dangers of a settled state, let the present
speak! </p>
<p> In the full blaze of the nineteenth century, when every child in
our schools may know as common truths things of which the Egyptian
sages never dreamed; when the earth has been mapped and the stars
have been weighed; when steam and electricity have been pressed into
our service, and science is wresting from nature secret after secret
&#8211; it is but natural to look back upon the wisdom of three
thousand years ago as an adult looks back upon the learning of a
child. </p>
<p> And yet, for all this wonderful increase of knowledge, for all
this enormous gain of productive power, where is the country in the
civilised world in which today there is not want and suffering &#8211;
where the masses are not condemned to toil that gives no leisure, and
all classes are not pursued by a greed of gain that makes life an
ignoble struggle to get and to keep? Three thousands years of
advances, and still the moan goes up: "They have made our lives
bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner
of service!" Three thousand years of advances! and the piteous voices
of little children are in the moan. </p>
<p> Standing as I stand, where modern ideas have had fullest, freest
development; in the newest great city of the newest great nation; by
the side of that ultimate sea, where ends the westward march of the
race that has circled the globe, and farthest west meets east, the
cool shades and sweet waters whose promise has so long lured us on
seem dissolving into mocking mirage. </p>
<p> Over ocean wastes far wider than the Syrian desert we have sought
our promised land &#8211; no narrow strip between the mountains and
the sea, but a wide and virgin continent. Here, in greater freedom,
with vaster knowledge and fuller experience, we are building up a
nation that leads the van of modern progress. And yet while we prate
of the rights of humanity there are already many among us thousands
who find it difficult to assert the first of natural rights &#8211;
the right to earn an honest living; thousands who from time to time
must accept of degrading charity or starve. </p>
<p> <strong>We boast of equality before the law; yet notoriously justice is
deaf to the call of those who have no gold and blind to the sin of
those who have. </strong></p>
<p><strong> We pride ourselves upon our common schools; yet after our boys
and girls are educated we vainly ask: "What shall we do with them?" And about
our colleges children are growing up in vice and crime, because from their homes
poverty has driven all refining influences.
We pin our faith to universal suffrage; yet with all power in the
hands of the people, the control of public affairs is passing into
the hands of a class of professional politicians, and our governments
are, in many cases, becoming but a means for robbery of the people. </strong></p>
<p><strong> We have prohibited hereditary distinctions, we have forbidden
titles of nobility; yet there is growing up an aristocracy of wealth
as powerful and merciless as any that ever held sway. </strong></p>
<p><strong> We progress and we progress; we girdle continents with iron roads
and knit cities together with the mesh of telegraph wires; each day
brings some new invention, each year marks a fresh advance &#8211; the
power of production increased, and the avenues of exchange cleared
and broadened. Yet the complaint of "hard times" is louder and
louder; everywhere are people harassed by care, and haunted by the
fear of want. With swift, steady strides and prodigious leaps, the
power of human hands to satisfy human wants advances and advances, is
multiplied and multiplied. Yet the struggle for mere existence is
more and more intense, and human labour is becoming the cheapest of
commodities. Beside glutted warehouses human beings grow faint with
hunger and shiver with cold; under the shadow of churches festers the
vice that is born of want. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Trace to its roots the cause that is producing want in the midst
of plenty, ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in
democracy, weakness in strength &#8211; that is giving to our
civilisation a one-sided and unstable development &#8211; and you will
find it something which this Hebrew statesman three thousand years
ago perceived and guarded against. </strong></p>
<p> Moses saw that the real cause of the enslavement of the masses of
Egypt was &#8211; what has everywhere produced enslavement &#8211; the
possession by a class of land upon which and from which the whole
people must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified
private ownership that by natural right attaches to the things
produced by labour, would be inevitably to separate the people into
the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave labour &#8211;
to make the few the masters of the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation no matter what the religion.
</p>
<p> And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who
legislates not for the need of a day, but for all the future, he
sought, in ways suited to his times and conditions, to guard against
this error. </p>
<p> Everywhere in the Mosaic institutions is the land treated as the
gift of the Creator to His common creatures, which no one has the
right to monopolise. Everywhere it is, not your estate, or your
property, not the land which you bought, or the land which you
conquered, but "the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee" &#8211;
"the land which the Lord lendeth thee". And by practical legislation,
by regulations to which he gave the highest sanctions, he tried to
guard against the wrong that converted ancient civilisations into
despotisms &#8211; the wrong that in after centuries ate out the heart
of Rome, that produced the imbruting serfdom of Poland and the gaunt
misery of Ireland, the wrong that is today filling American cities
with idle men, and our virgin states with tramps. </p>
<p> He not only provided for a redistribution of the land among the people, and for making it fallow and common every seventh year,
but by the institution of the Jubilee he provided for a
redistribution of the land every fifty years, and made monopoly
impossible. </p>
<p> I do not say that these institutions were, for their ultimate
purpose, the best that might even then have been devised; but Moses
had to work, as all great constructive statesmen have to work, with
the tools that came to his hand, and upon materials as he found them.
Still less do I mean to say that forms suitable for that time and
people are suitable for every time and people. I ask, not veneration
of the form, but recognition of the spirit. </p>
<p> Yet how common it is to venerate the form and to deny the spirit.
There are many who believe that the Mosaic institutions were
literally dictated by the Almighty, yet who would denounce as
irreligious any application of their spirit to the present day. And
yet today how much we owe to these institutions! This very day the
only thing that stands between our working classes and ceaseless toil
is one of these Mosaic institutions. </p>
<p> Let the mistakes of those who think that "man was made for the
Sabbath," rather than "the Sabbath was made for man," be what they
may; that there is one day in the week that the working people may
call their own, one day in the week on which hammer is silent and
loom stands idle, is due, through Christianity, to Judaism &#8211; to
the code promulgated in the Sinaitic wilderness. </p>
<p> It is in these characteristics of the Mosaic institutions that,
as in the fragments of a Colossus, we may read the greatness of the
mind whose impress they bear &#8211; of a mind in advance of its
surroundings, in advance of its age; of one of those star souls that
dwindle not with distance, but, glowing with the radiance of
essential truth, hold their light while institutions and languages
and creeds change and pass. </p>
<p> That the thought was greater than the permanent expression it
found, who can doubt? </p>
<p>Yet from that day to this that expression has been in the world a
living power. From the free spirit of the Mosaic law sprang that
intensity of family life that amid all dispersions and persecutions
has preserved the individuality of the Hebrew race; that love of
independence that under the most adverse circumstances has
characterised the Jew; the burning patriotism that flamed in the
Maccabees and bared the breasts of Jewish peasants to the serried
steel of Grecian phalanx and the resistless onset of Roman legion;
that stubborn courage that in exile and in torture held the Jew to
his faith. It kindled that fire that has made the strains of Hebrew
seers and poets phrase for us the highest exaltations of thought;
that intellectual vigour that has over and over again made the dry
staff bud and blossom. And passing onward from one narrow race it has
exerted its power wherever the influence of the Hebrew scriptures has
been felt, It has toppled thrones and cast dawn hierarchies. It
strengthened the Scottish covenanter in the hour of trial, and the
Puritan amid the snows of a strange land. It charged with the
Ironsides at Naseby; it stood behind the low redoubt on Bunker Hill.
</p>
<p> But it is in example as in deed that such lives are helpful. It
is thus that they dignify human nature and glorify human effort, and,
to those who struggle, bring hope and trust. The life of Moses, like
the institutions of Moses, is a protest against that blasphemous
doctrine current now as it was three thousand years ago, preached oft
times even from Christian pulpits &#8211; that the want and suffering
of the masses of humankind flow from a mysterious dispensation of
providence, which we may lament, but can neither quarrel with nor
alter. Let those who hug that doctrine themselves, those to whom it
seems that the squalor and brutishness with which the very centres of
our civilisation abound are not their affair, turn to the example of
that life. For to them who will look, yet burns the bush; and to them
who will hear, again comes the voice: "The people suffer: who will
lead them forth?" </p>
<p> Adopted into the immediate family of the supreme monarch and
earthly god; standing almost at the apex of the social pyramid which
had for its base those toiling millions; priest and prince in a land
where prince and priest might revel in all delights &#8211; everything
that life could offer to gratify the senses or engage the intellect
was open to him. </p>
<p> What to him the wail of those who beneath the fierce sun toiled
under the whips of relentless masters? Heard from granite colonnade
or beneath cool linen awning, it was mellowed by distance to
monotonous music. Why should he question the Sphinx of Fate, or
quarrel with destinies the high gods had decreed? So had it always
been, for ages and ages; so must it ever be. The beetle rends the
smaller insect, and the hawk preys on the beetle; order on order,
life rises from death and carnage, and higher pleasures from lower
agonies. Shall the human be better than nature? Soothing and restful
flows the Nile, though underneath its placid surface finny tribes
wage cruel war, and the stronger eats the weaker. Shall the gazer who
would read the secrets of the stars turn because under his feet a
worm may writhe? </p>
<p> Theirs to make bricks without straw; his a high place in the
glorious procession that with gorgeous banners and glittering
emblems, with clash of music and solemn chant, winds its shining way
to dedicate the immortal edifice their toil has reared. Theirs the
leek and garlic; his to sit at the sumptuous feast. Why should he
dwell on the irksomeness of bondage, he for whom the chariots waited,
who might at will best ride the swift courses of the Delta, or be
borne on the bosom of the river with oars that beat time to song?
</p>
<p> Did he long for the excitement of action? There was the desert
hunt, with steeds fleeter than the antelope and lions trained like
dogs. Did he crave rest and ease? There was for him the soft swell of
languorous music and the wreathed movements of dancing girls. Did he
feel the stir of intellectual life? &#8211; in the arcana of the
temples he was free to the lore of ages; an initiate in the select
society where were discussed the most engrossing problems; a sharer
in that intellectual pride that centuries after compared Greek
philosophy to the babbling of children. </p>
<p> It was no sudden ebullition of passion that caused Moses to turn
his back on all this, and to bring the strength and knowledge
acquired in a dominant caste to the lifelong service of the
oppressed. The forgetfulness of self manifested in the smiting of the
Egyptian shines through the whole life. In institutions that moulded
the character of a people, in institutions that to this day make
easier the lot of toiling millions, we may read the stately purpose.
</p>
<p> Through all that tradition has given us of that life runs the
same grand passion &#8211; the unselfish desire to make humanity
better, happier, nobler. And the death is worthy of the life.
Subordinating to the good of his people the natural disposition to
found a dynasty, which in his case would have been so easy, Moses
discards the claims of blood and calls to his place of leader the
fittest man! </p>
<p> Coming from a land where the rites of sepulture were regarded as
all-important, and the preservation of the body after death was the
passion of life; among a people who were even then carrying the
remains of their great ancestor, Joseph, to rest with his fathers,
Moses yet conquered the last natural yearning and withdrew from the
sight and sympathy of his people to die alone and unattended, lest
the idolatrous feeling, always ready to break forth, should in death
accord him the superstitious reverence he had refused in life. </p>
<p> "No man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day." But, while the
despoiled tombs of the Pharaohs mock the vanity that reared them, the
name of the Hebrew who, revolting from their tyranny, strove for the
elevation of his fellow men and women, remains a beacon light to the
world. </p>
<p> Leader and servant of men and women! Lawgiver and benefactor!
Toiler toward the Promised Land seen only by the eye of faith! Type
of the high souls who in every age has given to earth its heroes and
its martyrs, whose deeds are the precious possession of the race,
whose memories are its sacred heritage! With whom among the founders
of empire shall we compare him? </p>
<p> To dispute about the inspiration of such a man would be to
dispute about words. From the depths of the unseen such characters
must draw their strength; from fountains that flow only from the pure
in heart must come their wisdom. Of something more real than matter;
of something higher than the stars; of a light that will endure when
suns are dead and dark; of a purpose of which the physical universe
is but a passing phase, such lives tell!</p>
