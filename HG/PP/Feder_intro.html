<center><b>Progress and Poverty Today</b>
<br>
Kris Feder<br>
Professor of Economics, <br>
Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction to New Abridged Edition of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>,
1997</p>
</center>
<p>As this book was written, the Industrial Revolution was
transforming America and Europe at a breathless pace. In just a
century, an economy that worked on wind, water, and muscular effort
had become supercharged by steam, coal, and electricity. Canals,
railroads, steamships and the telegraph were linking regional
economies into a national and global network of exchange. The United
States had stretched from coast to coast; the western frontier was
evaporating.</p>
<p>American journalist and editor Henry George marveled at the
stunning advance of technology, yet was alarmed by ominous trends.
Why had not this unprecedented increase in productivity banished want
and starvation from civilized countries, and lifted the working
classes from poverty to prosperity? Instead, George saw that the
division of labor, the widening of markets, and rapid urbanization
had increased the dependence of the <b>working poor</b> upon forces
beyond their control. The working poor were always, of course, the
most vulnerable in depressions, and last to recover from them.
Unemployment and pauperism had appeared in America, and indeed, were
more prevalent in the developed East than in the aspiring West. It
was "as though a great wedge were being forced, not underneath
society, but through society. Those who are above the point of
separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed down."
This, the "great enigma of our times," was the problem George set out
to solve in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>.</p>
<p>Economists will recognize his analysis as a precursor to the
modern marginal productivity theory of functional distribution. His
story is framed in the language of what is today called classical
political economy, though George was careful to avoid inconsistencies
of definition and reasoning which, he showed, had led other
economists astray.</p>
<p>A central feature of the British classical school was the
classification of productive resources into three "factors of
production" - labor, land, and capital. Most classical economists had
conceived of these in terms of three great social classes (the
workers, the landed aristocracy, and the capitalists). George, on the
other hand, identified them as functional categories, distinguished
by the conditions under which the factors are made available for
production.</p>
<p>In a competitive economy, the earnings of the factors of
production measure their separate contributions to the value of the
product. Payments for the use of labor are called wages; payments for
land are called rent; the income of capital is interest. In George's
terms, the distress of the working classes had to do with a
persistently low level of real wages. "Why," he asked, "in spite of
increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will
give but a bare living?"</p>
<p>The book proceeds systematically. First, George explores the
prevailing scholarly and popular explanations, which relied
principally on the famous population theory of Malthus, in
combination with the "wage fund" theory of British political economy.
Together these theories implied that the aggregate income of labor
depends upon the amount of capital devoted to the payment of wages.
An increase in wages required an increase in the amount of capital
per worker. However, any rise in living standards above mere
subsistence motivated workers to marry younger and bear more
children, until population growth caused capital per worker - and,
therefore, wages - to recede again.</p>
<p>Moreover, population growth diminished agricultural productivity
by forcing recourse to inferior soils. Technological advance and
capital accumulation might afford a period of relative prosperity -
but ultimately, increasing applications of labor to a fixed amount of
land could raise output only at a diminishing rate. In short,
immutable laws of nature - the population principle and the law of
diminishing returns to land - were widely believed to explain the
persistence of poverty.</p>
<p>To George, the Malthusian analysis was abhorrent: It asserted that
no institutional reform could fundamentally alter the pattern of
income distribution, and that charitable support for the needy only
compounded the problem - by lowering death rates and raising birth
rates. Fortunately, he found this theory of wages to be theoretically
flawed on several grounds. He also found it to be incompatible with
empirical facts, based on historical case studies from Ireland,
China, India, the United States and elsewhere. Today, most
development economists agree with George that famine and mass poverty
have more to do with faulty human institutions than with the
limitations of nature.</p>
<p>In his own analysis, George takes meticulous care to avoid
inconsistencies of definition and reasoning. A keen observer of
political and economic affairs, he builds his case slowly, probing
toward the truth with Socratic innocence. So, we will not deprive the
reader of the intended suspense by revealing George's conclusion at
the outset. Instead, we will try to suggest why this book is still
worth reading.</p>
<p>Public debate about economic policy revolves today, as it always
has, around a tension between two fundamental social goals.
Economists and policymakers lament a perennial "trade-off between
efficiency and equity." Policies intended to promote savings and
capital formation are held to widen inequality, while redistributive
policies (such as progressive income taxation) erode incentives to
produce and earn. The debates about welfare reform and health care
policy are the most recent versions of this enduring social debate.
And the trade-off is encountered far beyond the borders of the United
States. Citizens of formerly communist countries wonder whether the
efficiency gains of a market economy are worth the social costs.
Developed as well as developing countries agonize over the problem of
how to promote economic growth without also accelerating the
degradation of the environment.</p>
<p>Most economists deem it their business to evaluate the efficiency
of policy choices, but, claiming no special knowledge of ethics, they
leave it to philosophers and the political process to evaluate
questions of justice. Can it be true that society's arrangements to
provide for common needs must always confront a divisive choice
between equity and efficiency - between what is fair and what is
feasible?</p>
<p>Henry George not only denied it; he asserted the reverse: <b>Full
recognition of economic rights and responsibilities would reveal the
goals of equity and efficiency to be mutually reinforcing. Neither
social justice nor a well-functioning free market system can long be
enjoyed without the other.</b> "The laws of the universe are
harmonious," George proclaimed. His analysis showed that the root
cause of widening inequality lies not in the laws of nature, but in
social maladjustments which ignore them. Moreover, the breach of
justice which underlies the problem of poverty is not merely
incidental to economic development; it impedes development, leading
to wider and wider inequality.</p>
<p>George emphasized that unequal distribution is itself wasteful of
wealth.</p>
<p>Unemployment and underemployment of labor mean that energy and
intelligence go untapped. For those who find work, he said, high
wages stimulate creativity, invention, and improvement, while low
wages encourage carelessness. Inadequate education of the poor
multiplies the loss. There are the damages done by poverty-related
vice and crime, and the substantial costs of protecting society
against them. There is the burden upon the wealthy of providing
welfare support for the very poor - or risking social upheaval if
they do not. Moreover, said George, social institutions by which some
prosper at others' expense cause talent and resources to be diverted
from productive enterprise to unproductive conflict, as individuals
find that competing for political advantage can be more lucrative
than competing for market success.</p>
<p>In short, an unjust system of privileges and entitlements tends to
cause misallocation of resources, macroeconomic instability and
stagnation, political corruption, and social conflict that ultimately
may threaten whole civilizations.</p>
<p><b>George's central contribution was to show that the distinction
between individual property and common property forms a rational
basis for distinguishing the domain of public activity from that of
the private.</b> This distinction leads him to a theory of public
finance that reconciles the competing insights of socialism and
laissez-faire capitalism. By a simple fiscal device, the revenue
arising from common property can be captured for the public treasury
and applied to the common benefit, so that government may assume
needed general functions without interfering with individual
incentives. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The benefits of sustained economic development would be widely
shared. </li>
  <li>The limited resources of the earth would be managed for the
benefit of all, including future generations. </li>
  <li>Government would become, not a repressive power, but "the
administration of a great cooperative society. </li>
  <li>It would become merely the agency by which the common property
was administered for the common benefit."</li>
</ul>
<p>George's insights have wide application to modern problems. Both
domestically and internationally, the distribution of wealth has
grown more unequal. Europe, North America, and Japan have surged
ahead while many poorer countries have stagnated or declined, many
burdened by debt.</p>
<p>Modern fiscal and monetary policies have not resolved the problem
of macroeconomic fluctuations. Yet a <b>half century before Keynes,
George outlined a theory of boom and bust which explained the
underlying instability of the market economy under present fiscal
institutions.</b> The operation of a modern system of money and
credit merely serves to intensify that instability. His theory is
consistent with the circumstances of numerous episodes, recently
including Japan's recession and halting recovery, and the savings and
loan debacle in the United States.</p>
<p>Georgist (or "geoclassical") economic analysis </p>
<ul>
  <li>bears directly upon the current difficulties of Russia and other
nations emerging from communism, upon the international debt crisis,
and upon the world-wide pressure on environmental and natural
resources. </li>
  <li>It is relevant to the common experience of chronic budget
deficits, both municipal and federal. </li>
  <li>It can be applied to the problems of corruption in government,
and of the concentration of political power associated with
concentration of wealth. </li>
  <li>It provides an ideal framework for the analysis of environmental
pollution and the design of environmental policy. </li>
  <li>Indeed, readers will notice that the modern environmental
movement in certain respects seems to be grappling toward a rediscovery
of Georgist proposals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many American cities are plagued by the twin problems of urban
decay and suburban sprawl. An expanding network of roads and highways
carries commuters ever farther to their jobs. Fleeing the problems of
the city, citizens build new homes in the quiet countryside only to
find that traffic congestion, pollution, noise and urban social
problems are flung outward with the movement of population.
Sociologists decry the loss of community, while environmentalists
warn of the potentially disastrous consequences of automobile
pollution, habitat loss, deforestation and ecosystem disruption.
Economists point to the billions of dollars worth of wasted physical
and human capital left behind in the crumbling central cities - where
the urban poor remain stranded to fend for themselves, with few jobs
and, as municipal tax revenues shrink, declining public services. Yet
several years before the automobile appeared, Henry George analyzed
the dynamics of urban growth and decay. He explained the basic
processes that yield an inappropriate geographic distribution of
population, inefficient land use, and urban blight. Enlightened urban
economists and transportation planners today advocate Georgist policy
reforms at the municipal level.</p>
<p>Thus, George's synthesis informs a research program of remarkable
breadth. Some writers understand Georgism to constitute a distinct
paradigm of political economy, one which reconciles the
contradictions between the two competing paradigms dominant in the
world today - the mainstream neoclassical school, which tends to
focus on the impressive efficiency properties of free markets, and
Marxist socialism. Other Georgist writers believe that Georgism can
and should be explained in the modern language of neoclassical
economics. What is certain is that geoclassical thought bears
crucially on some of the foremost controversies in America and the
world today.</p>
