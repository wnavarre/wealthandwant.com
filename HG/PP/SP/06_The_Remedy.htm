<div align="center"><strong>6. The Remedy
  </strong>
</div>
<p> Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down while productive
    power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth and the field
    of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to make wages what justice
    commands they should be, the full earnings of the laborer, we must therefore
    substitute for the individual ownership of land a common ownership.*</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">*By the phrase &quot;common ownership&quot; of land, Henry George did not mean
      that land should be held in common or by the State, nor did he propose to interfere
      with the existing system of land tenures. (See Sections 7 and 12, post.) As
      in this condensation much of George's argument necessarily has been omitted,
      the following extracts from his later work &quot;Protection or Free Trade,&quot; chapter
      XXVI, are appended to make his position clear to the present reader.</font></p>
  <blockquote> <font size="-1">&quot;No one would sow a crop, or build a house,
      or open a mine, or plant an orchard, or cut a drain, so long as any one
      else could come in and turn him
      out of the
            land in which or on which such improvement must be fixed. Thus is
      it absolutely necessary to the proper use and improvement of land that
      society should
      secure to the user and improver safe possession. ... We can leave land
      now being used in the secure possession of those using it. ... on condition
      that those
        who
            hold land shall pay to the community a ... rent based on the value
      of the privilege the individual receives from the community in being accorded
      the
      exclusive
            use of this much of the common property, and which should have no
      reference to any improvement he has made in or on it, or to any profit
      due to the
      use of his labor and capital. In this way all would be placed on an equality
        in
            regard to the use and enjoyment of those natural elements which are
      clearly the common heritage.&quot;</font>  </blockquote>

<p align="right">source: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp062.html">Book
    VI: The Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: The True Remedy</a></p>
<p>This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes the possibility
            of any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully entitled to the produce
            of his labor, then no one can be rightfully entitled to the ownership of
            anything
            which is not the produce of his labor, or the labor of some one else from
            whom the right has passed to him. For the right to the produce of labor cannot
            be
            enjoyed without the right to the free use of the opportunities offered by
            nature, and to admit the right of property in these is to deny the right
            of property
            in the produce of labor. When nonproducers can claim as rent a portion of
            the wealth created by producers, the right of the producers to the fruits
            of their
      labor is to that extent denied.</p>
<p>A house and the lot on which it stands are alike property, as being the subject
  of ownership, and are alike classed by the lawyers as real estate. Yet in nature
  and relations they differ widely.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The one is produced by human labor, and belongs to the class in political
    economy styled wealth.</li>
  <li>  The other is a part of nature, and belongs to the class in political
        economy styled land.</li>
</ul>
<p>The essential character of the one class of things is that they embody labor,
  are brought into being by human exertion, their existence or nonexistence,
  their increase or diminution, depending on man. The essential character of
  the other class of things is that they do not embody labor, and exist irrespective
  of human exertion and irrespective of man; they are the field or environment
  in which man finds himself; the storehouse from which his needs must be supplied,
  the raw material upon which and the forces with which alone his labor can act.</p>
<p>The moment this distinction is realized, that moment is it seen that the sanction
  which natural justice gives to one species of property is denied to the other.</p>
<p>For as labor cannot produce without the use of land, the denial of the equal
  right to the use of land is necessarily the denial of the right of labor to
  its own produce. If one man can command the land upon which others must labor,
  he can appropriate the produce of their labor as the price of his permission
  to labor. The fundamental law of nature, that her enjoyment by man shall be
  consequent upon his exertion, is thus violated. The one receives without producing;
  the others produce without receiving. The one is unjustly enriched; the others
  are robbed.</p>
<p>source: B7: Justice of the Remedy</p>
<p><br>
  Place one hundred men on an island from which there is no escape, and whether
    you make one of these men the absolute owner of the other ninety-nine, or
    the absolute owner of the soil of the island, will make no difference either
    to him or to them. In the one case, as the other, the one will be the absolute
    master of the ninety-nine &#8212; his power extending even to life and death,
    for simply to refuse them permission to live upon the island would be to
    force them into the sea.</p>
<p>Upon a larger scale, and through more complex relations, the same cause must
  operate in the same way and to the same end &#8212; the ultimate result, the enslavement
  of laborers, becoming apparent just as the pressure increases which compels
  them to live on and from land which is treated as the exclusive property of
  others.</p>
<p>Yet, it will be said: As every man has a right to the use and enjoyment of
  nature, the man who is using land must be permitted the exclusive right to
  its use in order that he may get the full benefit of his labor. But there is
  no difficulty in determining where the individual right ends and the common
  right begins. A delicate and exact test is supplied by value, and with its
  aid there is no difficulty, no matter how dense population may become, in determining
  and securing the exact rights of each, the equal rights of all.</p>
<p>The value of land, as we have seen, is the price of monopoly. It is not the
  absolute, but the relative, capability of land that determines its value. No
  matter what may be its intrinsic qualities land that is no better than other
  land which may be had for the using can have no value. And the value of land
  always measures the difference between it and the best land that may be had
  for the using. Thus, the value of land expresses in exact and tangible form
  the right of the community in land held by an individual; and rent expresses
  the exact amount which the individual should pay to the community to satisfy
  the equal rights of all other members of the community.</p>
<p>Thus, if we concede to priority of possession the undisturbed use of land,
  taxing rent into the public treasury for the benefit of the community, we reconcile
  the fixity of tenure which is necessary for improvement with a full and complete
  recognition of the equal rights of all to the use of land.</p>
<p>Consider what rent is. It does not arise spontaneously from land; it is due
  to nothing that the land owners have done. It represents a value created by
  the whole community.</p>
<p>Let the land holders have, if you please, all that the possession of the land
  would give them in the absence of the rest of the community. But rent, the
  creation of the whole community, necessarily belongs to the whole community.*</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">* To the view of the extreme conservative that due consideration
      for the claims of rent receivers negatives the adoption of such a policy,
      it may
    be replied
    that society as such is under no obligation to maintain an unchanged policy
    through out all future time. Public policies are constantly changing in such
    ways as to disappoint the expectations of persons who have invested on the
    supposition that policies would not change and to affect the value of their
    property. Tarriffs are raised, and lowered. The brewing of spirituous liquors
    is at one time permitted and at another time outlawed. Prices of monopolized
    services are first left to be fixed by the monopolist and are then regulated.
    Taxes are increased on some goods and decreased on others. In some communities
    taxes have already been made higher on land values than on improvements.
    Purchasers of land have no right to insist that society may not, even by
    gradual steps,
    discriminate in taxation against land rent, which is an income socially produced.
    (Henry George himself elsewhere said -- Century Magazine, July, 1890 -- that &quot;we
    cannot get to the Single Tax at one leap, but only by gradual steps.&quot;)
    We must presume that land owners, like other persons, buy their property
    with no guarantee that public policy will never change. The conservative
    insistence
    that society, which makes frequent changes of policy in other matters, is
    under a binding implied pledge and obligation never to move, even by successive
    steps,
    towards the eventual taking of the economic rent of land by taxation, seems
    preposterous. H. G. B.</font></p>
