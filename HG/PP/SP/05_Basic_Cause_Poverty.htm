<div align="center"><strong>5. The Basic Cause of Poverty
  </strong>
</div>
<p>The great problem, of which these recurring seasons of industrial depression
  are but peculiar manifestations, is now, I think, fully solved, and the social
  phenomena which all over the civilized world appall the philanthropist and
  perplex the statesman, which hang with clouds the future of the most advanced
  races, and suggest doubts of the reality and ultimate goal of what we have
  fondly called progress, are now explained.</p>
<p>The reason why, in spite of the increase of productive power, wages constantly
  tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living, is that, with increase
  in productive power, rent tends to even greater increase, thus producing a
  constant tendency to the forcing down of wages.</p>
<p>Land being necessary to labor, and being reduced to private ownership, every
  increase in the productive power of labor but increases rent &#8212; the price
  that labor must pay for the opportunity to utilize its powers; and thus all
  the
  advantages gained by the march of progress go to the owners of land, and wages
  do not increase.*</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <font size="-1">*Whatever be the fact as to wages, the reader will, of course, recognize
                that higher money wages which merely balance higher living costs, are not
                to be
      reckoned as real wage increases. H.G.B</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The simple theory which I have outlined (if indeed it can be called a theory
    which is but the recognition of the most obvious relations) explains this
    conjunction of poverty with wealth, of low wages with high productive power,
    of degradation
    amid enlightenment, of virtual slavery in political liberty.</p>
<ul>
  <li> It harmonizes, as results flowing from a general and inexorable law,
    facts otherwise most perplexing, and exhibits the sequence and relation between
    phenomena
    that without reference to it are diverse and contradictory.</li>
  <li>  It explains why improvements which increase the productive power of
    labor and capital increase the reward of neither.</li>
  <li>  It explains what is commonly called the conflict between labor and capital,
        while proving the real harmony of interest between them.</li>
  <li> It cuts the last inch of ground from under the fallacies of protection,
          while showing why free trade fails to benefit permanently the working
          classes.</li>
  <li> It explains why want increases with abundance, and wealth tends to
            greater and greater aggregations.</li>
  <li> It explains the vice and misery which show themselves amid dense
              population, without attributing to the laws of the All-Wise and
        All-Beneficent defects
              which belong only to the shortsighted and selfish enactments of
        men.</li>
</ul>
<p>  The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
    question:</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German Ocean
  a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should be able
  to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and of
  free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of English
  soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
<p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
  to thirty shillings a day.</p>
<p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
  would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and if
  he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen without
  any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural opportunities,
  or the forms and direction of industry being much changed; only that kind of
  production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
  less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in wages
  would be at the expense of rent.</p>
<p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
  has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
  village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the railroad
  will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle;
  it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply
  the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be any higher?&quot;</p>
<p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
  a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
<p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
  on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not be
  easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances are
  that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
  possession.&quot;</p>
<p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
  more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
  of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
  in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
  to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
  you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
  almshouse.</p>
<p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
  That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
  to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
  of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. We have been advancing as through
  an enemy's country, in which every step must be secured, every position fortified,
  and every bypath explored; for this simple truth, in its application to social
  and political problems, is hid from the great masses of men partly by its very
  simplicity, and in greater part by widespread fallacies and erroneous habits
  of thought which lead them to look in every direction but the right one for
  an explanation of the evils which oppress and threaten the civilized world.
  And back of these elaborate fallacies and misleading theories is an active,
  energetic power, a power that in every country, be its political forms what
  they may, writes laws and molds thought &#8212; the power of a vast and dominant
  pecuniary interest.</p>
<p>But so simple and so clear is this truth, that to see it fully once is always
    to recognize it. There are pictures which, though looked at again and again,
    present only a confused labyrinth of lines or scroll work &#8212; a landscape,
    trees, or something of the kind &#8212; until once the attention is called
    to the fact
    that these things make up a face or a figure. This relation, once recognized,
  is always afterward clear.*</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  <font size="-1">*Hence the expression, current among adherents of Henry George's
          proposal: &quot;Do
      you see the cat?&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is so in this case. In the light of this truth all social facts group themselves
  in an orderly relation, and the most diverse phenomena are seen to spring from
  one great principle. It is not in the relations of capital and labor; it is
  not in the pressure of population against subsistence, that an explanation
  of the unequal development of our civilization is to be found. The great cause
  of inequality in the distribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership
  of land. The ownership of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately
  determines the social, the political, and consequently the intellectual and
  moral condition of a people. And it must be so. For land is the habitation
  of man, the storehouse upon which he must draw for all his needs, the material
  to which his labor must be applied for the supply of all his desires; for even
  the products of the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any
  of the forces of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products.
  On the land we are born, from it we live, to it we return again &#8212; children
  of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower of the field. Take
  away from man all that belongs to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit.
  Material progress cannot rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add
  to the power of producing wealth from land; and hence, when land is monopolized,
  it might go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition
  of those who have but their labor. It can but add to the value of land and
  the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples,
  the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great
  fortunes, the source of power. As said the Brahmins, ages ago</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <em>&quot;To whomsoever the soil at any time belongs, to him belong the
      fruits of it. White parasols and elephants mad with pride are the flowers
      of a
    grant of land.&quot;</em></p>
