<p><b>Chapter 1. The Problem    
    </b>
    <b> </b>
</p>
</center>
Could a Franklin or a Priestley have seen, in a vision of the future,
the steamship taking the place of the sailing vessel, the railroad
train of the wagon, the reaping machine of the scythe, the threshing
machine of the flail;
<ul>
  <li>could he have heard the throb of the engines that in obedience to
human will, and for the satisfaction of human desire, exert a power
greater than that of all the men and all the beasts of burden of the
earth combined;</li>
  <li>could he have seen the forest tree transformed into finished
lumber &#8212; into doors, sashes, blinds, boxes or barrels, with hardly the
touch of a human hand; the great workshops where boots and shoes are
turned out by the case with less labor than the old-fashioned cobbler
could have put on a sole; the factories where, under the eye of a girl,
cotton becomes cloth faster than hundreds of stalwart weavers could
have turned it out with their hand-looms;</li>
  <li>could he have seen steam hammers shaping mammoth shafts and
mighty anchors, and delicate machinery making tiny watches; the diamond
drill cutting through the heart of the rocks, and coal oil sparing the
whale;</li>
  <li>could he have realized the enormous saving of labor resulting
from improved facilities of exchange and communication &#8212; sheep killed
in
Australia eaten fresh in England and the order given by the London
banker in the afternoon executed in San Francisco in the morning of the
same day;</li>
  <li><b><i>could he have conceived of the hundred thousand
improvements which these only suggest, what would he have inferred as
to the social condition of mankind?</i></b></li>
</ul>
<p>It would not have seemed like an inference; further than the
vision went it would have seemed as though he saw; and his heart
would have leaped and his nerves would have thrilled, as one who from
a height beholds just ahead of the thirst-stricken caravan the living
gleam of rustling woods and the glint of laughing waters. Plainly, in
the sight of the imagination, he would have beheld these new forces
elevating society from its very foundations, lifting the very poorest
above the possibility of want, exempting the very lowest from anxiety
for the material needs of life; he would have seen these slaves of
the lamp of knowledge taking on themselves the traditional curse,
these muscles of iron and sinews of steel making the poorest
laborer's life a holiday, in which every high quality and noble
impulse could have scope to grow.</p>
<p>And out of these bounteous material conditions he would have seen
arising, as necessary sequences, moral conditions realizing the
golden age of which mankind always dreamed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Youth no longer stunted and starved;</li>
  <li>age no longer harried by avarice;</li>
  <li>the child at play with the tiger;</li>
  <li>the man with the muck-rake drinking in the glory of the stars!</li>
  <li>Foul things fled, fierce things tame;</li>
  <li>discord turned to harmony!</li>
</ul>
<p>For how could there be greed where all had enough? How could the
vice, the crime, the ignorance, the brutality, that spring from
poverty and the fear of poverty, exist where poverty had vanished?
Who should crouch where all were freemen; who oppress where all were
peers?</p>
<p>More or less vague or clear, these have been the hopes, these the
dreams born of the improvements which give this wonderful century its
preeminence. They have sunk so deeply into the popular mind as to
radically change the currents of thought, to recast creeds and
displace the most fundamental conceptions. The haunting visions of
higher possibilities have not merely gathered splendor and vividness,
but their direction has changed &#8212; instead of seeing behind the faint
tinges of an expiring sunset, all the glory of the daybreak has
decked the skies before.</p>
<p>It is true that disappointment has followed disappointment, and
that discovery upon discovery, and invention after invention, have
neither lessened the toil of those who most need respite, nor brought
plenty to the poor. But there have been so many things to which it
seemed this failure could be laid, that up to our time the new faith
has hardly weakened. We have better appreciated the difficulties to
be overcome; but not the less trusted that the tendency of the times
was to overcome them.</p>
<p>Now, however, we are coming into collision with facts which there
can be no mistaking. From all parts of the civilized world come
complaints</p>
<ul>
  <li>of industrial depression;</li>
  <li>of labor condemned to involuntary idleness;</li>
  <li>of capital massed and wasting;</li>
  <li>of pecuniary distress among business men;</li>
  <li>of want and suffering and anxiety among the working classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the dull, deadening pain, all the keen, maddening anguish,
that to great masses of men are involved in the words "hard times,"
have afflicted the world.&nbsp; <b>This state of things, common to
communities differing so widely in situation, in political
institutions, in fiscal and financial systems, in density of
population and in social organization can hardly be accounted for by
local causes.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is distress where large standing armies are maintained, but
there is also distress where the standing armies are nominal;</li>
  <li>there is distress where protective tariffs stupidly and
wastefully hamper trade, but there is also distress where trade is
nearly free;</li>
  <li>there is distress where autocratic government yet prevails, but
there is also distress where political power is wholly in the hands of
the people;</li>
  <li>in countries where paper is money, and</li>
  <li>in countries where gold and silver are the only currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidently, beneath all such things as these, we must infer a
common cause.</p>
<p><b>That there is a common cause, and that it is either what we
call material progress or something closely connected with material
progress, becomes more than an inference when it is noted that the
phenomena we class together and speak of as industrial depression
are but intensifications of phenomena which always accompany material
progress, and which show themselves more clearly and strongly as
material progress goes on. </b><i></i></p>
<p>It has always been to the newer countries &#8212; that is, to the
countries
where
material progress is yet in its earlier stages &#8212; that laborers have
emigrated in search of higher wages, and capital has flowed in search
of
higher interest. It is in the older countries &#8212; that is to say, the
countries where material progress has reached later stages &#8212; that
widespread destitution is found in the midst of the greatest
abundance. Go into a new community where Anglo-Saxon vigor
is just beginning the race of progress;</p>
<ul>
  <li>where the machinery of production and exchange is yet rude and
inefficient;</li>
  <li>where the increment of wealth is not yet great enough to enable
any class to live in ease and luxury;</li>
  <li>where the best house is but a cabin of logs or a cloth and paper
shanty, and the richest man is forced to daily work &#8212;  </li>
</ul>
<p>and though you will find an absence of wealth and all its
concomitants, you will find no beggars. There is no luxury, but there
is no destitution. No one makes an easy living, nor a very good
living; but every one <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">can </span>make a
living, and no one able and willing
to work is oppressed by the fear of want.</p>
<p><b>But just as such a community realizes the conditions which all
civilized communities are striving for, and advances in the scale of
material progress &#8212; just as closer settlement and a more intimate
connection with the rest of the world, and greater utilization of
labor-saving machinery, make possible greater economies in production
and exchange, and wealth in consequence increases, not merely in the
aggregate, but in proportion to population &#8212; <i>so does poverty take
a
darker aspect</i>.</b> Some get an infinitely better and easier
living, but others find it hard to get a living at all. The "tramp"
comes with
the locomotive, and almshouses and prisons are as surely the marks of
"material progress" as are costly dwellings, rich warehouses, and
magnificent churches. Upon streets lighted with gas and patrolled by
uniformed policemen, beggars wait for the passer-by, and in the
shadow of college, and library, and museum, are gathering the more
hideous Huns and fiercer Vandals of whom Macaulay prophesied.</p>
<p><b>This fact &#8212; the great fact that poverty and all its concomitants
show themselves in communities just as they develop into the
conditions towards which material progress tends &#8212; proves that the
social difficulties existing wherever a certain stage of progress has
been reached, do not arise from local circumstances, but are, in some
way or another, engendered by progress itself.</b></p>
<p>And, unpleasant as it may be to admit it, it is at last becoming
evident that <b>the enormous increase in productive power which has
marked the present century and is still going on with accelerating
ratio, has no tendency to extirpate poverty or to lighten the burdens
of those compelled to toil.</b> It simply widens the gulf between
<a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/d/i/diveslaz.htm">Dives and
Lazarus</a>, and makes the struggle for existence more intense. The
march of invention has clothed mankind with powers of which a century
ago the boldest imagination could not have dreamed. But</p>
<ul>
  <li>in factories where labor-saving machinery has reached its most
wonderful development, little children are at work;</li>
  <li>wherever the new forces are anything like fully utilized, large
classes are maintained by charity or live on the verge of recourse to
it;</li>
  <li>amid the greatest accumulations of wealth, men die of starvation,
and puny infants suckle dry breasts;</li>
  <li>while everywhere the greed of gain, the worship of wealth, shows
the force of the fear of want.</li>
</ul>
<p>The promised land flies before us like the mirage. The fruits of
the tree of knowledge turn as we grasp them to apples of Sodom that
crumble at the touch.</p>
<p>It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the
average of comfort, leisure, and refinement has been raised; but
these gains are not general.
<a name="In them the lowest class do not"></a>In them the lowest
class do not share. I do not mean that the condition of the lowest
class has nowhere nor in anything been improved; but that there is
nowhere any improvement which can be credited to increased productive
power. <b>I mean that the tendency of what we call material progress
is in no wise to improve the condition of the lowest class in the
essentials of healthy, happy human life.</b> Nay, more, that it is to
still further depress the condition of the lowest class. <b>The new
forces, elevating in their nature though they be, do not act upon the
social fabric from underneath, as was for a long time hoped and
believed, but strike it at a point intermediate between top and
bottom.</b> It is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not
underneath society, but through society. Those who are above the
point of separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed
down.</p>
<p>This depressing effect is not generally realized, for it is not
apparent where there has long existed a class just able to live.
Where the lowest class barely lives, as has been the case for a long
time in many parts of Europe, it is impossible for it to get any
lower, for the next lowest step is out of existence, and no tendency
to further depression can readily show itself. <b>But in the progress
of new settlements to the conditions of older communities it may
clearly be seen that material progress does not merely fail to
relieve poverty &#8212; it actually produces it. 
</b></p>
<a name="This association of poverty wit"></a><b>This association
of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times</b>.
<ul>
  <li>It is the central fact from which spring industrial, social, and
political difficulties that perplex the world, and with which
statesmanship and philanthropy and education grapple in vain.</li>
  <li>From it come the clouds that overhang the future of the most
progressive and self-reliant nations.</li>
  <li>It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our
civilization, and which not to answer is to be destroyed.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress
brings goes but to build up great fortunes, to increase luxury and
make sharper the contrast between the House of Have and the House of
Want, progress is not real and cannot be permanent.</b> The reaction
must come. The tower leans from its foundations, and every new story
but hastens the final catastrophe. To educate men who must be
condemned to poverty, is but to make them restive; to base on a state
of most glaring social inequality political institutions under which
men are theoretically equal, is to stand a pyramid on its apex.</p>
<p>All-important as this question is, pressing itself from every
quarter painfully upon attention, it has not yet received a solution
which accounts for all the facts and points to any clear and simple
remedy.</p>
<b>It must be within the province of political economy to solve it</b>.
For political economy is not a set of dogmas. It
is the explanation of a certain set of facts. It is the science
which, in the sequence of certain phenomena, seeks to trace mutual
relations and to identify cause and effect, just as the physical
sciences seek to do in other sets of phenomena. It lays its
foundations upon firm ground. <b>The premises from which it makes its
deductions are truths which have the highest sanction; axioms which
we all recognize; upon which we safely base the reasoning and actions
of every-day life, and which may be reduced to the metaphysical
expression of the physical law that motion seeks the line of least
resistance &#8212; <i>viz</i>., </b><font color="#ff6600"><b><i>that men
seek to gratify their desires with the least
exertion</i></b></font><b>.</b><br>
<br>
I propose in the following pages to attempt to solve by the
methods of political economy the great problem I have outlined. <b>I
propose to seek the law which associates poverty with progress, and
increases want with advancing wealth.&nbsp;</b> Properly commenced and
carefully pursued, such
an investigation must yield a conclusion that will stand every test,
and as truth, will correlate with all other truth. For in the sequence
of phenomena there is no accident. Every effect has a cause, and
every fact implies a preceding fact.
<p>I propose in this inquiry to take nothing for granted.&nbsp; I
propose to beg no question, to shrink from no conclusion, but to
follow truth wherever it may lead. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
