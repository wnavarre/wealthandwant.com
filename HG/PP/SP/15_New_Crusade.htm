    <div align="center"><strong>15 The Cross of a New Crusade
      </strong>
    </div>
    <p>My task is done.</p>
<p>Yet the thought still mounts. The problems we have been considering lead into
  a problem higher and deeper still. Behind the problems of social life lies
  the problem of individual life. I have found it impossible to think of the
  one without thinking of the other, and so, I imagine, will it be with those
  who, reading this book, go with me in thought; for, whatever be its fate, it
  will be read by some who in their heart of hearts have taken the cross of a
  new crusade. This thought will come to them without my suggestion; but we are
  surer that we see a star when we know that others also see it.</p>
<p>The truth that I have tried to make clear will not find easy acceptance. If
  that could be, it would have been accepted long ago. If that could be, it would
  never have been obscured. But it will find friends &#8212; those who will
  toil for it; suffer for it; if need be, die for it. This is the power of Truth.</p>
<p>Will it at length prevail? Ultimately, yes. But in our own times, or in times
  of which any memory of us remains, who shall say?</p>
<p>For the man who, seeing the want and misery, the ignorance and brutishness
  caused by unjust social institutions, sets himself, in so far as he has strength,
  to right them, there is disappointment and bitterness. So it has been of old
  time. So is it even now. But the bitterest thought &#8212; and it sometimes
  comes to the best and bravest &#8212; is that of the hopelessness of the effort,
  the futility
  of the sacrifice. To how few of those who sow the seed is it given to see it
  grow, or even with certainty to know that it will grow.</p>
<p>Let us not disguise it. Over and over again has the standard of Truth and
  Justice been raised in this world. Over and over again has it been trampled
  down &#8212; oftentimes in blood. If they are weak forces that are opposed
  to Truth, how should Error so long prevail? If Justice has but to raise her
  head to have
  Injustice flee before her, how should the wail of the oppressed so long go
  up?</p>
<p>But for those who see Truth and would follow her; for those who recognize
  Justice and would stand for her, success is not the only thing. Success! Why,
  Falsehood has often that to give; and Injustice often has that to give. Must
  not Truth and Justice have something to give that is their own by proper right
  &#8212; theirs in essence, and not by accident?</p>
<p>That they have, and that here and now, every one who has felt their exaltation
  knows. But sometimes the clouds sweep down. It is sad, sad reading, the lives
  of the men who would have done something for their fellows. To Socrates they
  gave the hemlock; Gracchus they killed with sticks and stones; and One, greatest
  and purest of all, they crucified. And in penury and want, in neglect and contempt,
  destitute even of the sympathy that would have been so sweet, how many in every
  country have closed their eyes? This we see.</p>
<p>But do we see it all?</p>
<p> I have in this inquiry followed the course of my own thought. When, in mind,
        I set out on it I had no theory to support, no conclusions to prove.
  Only, when I first realized the squalid misery of a great city, it appalled
  and
        tormented me, and would not let me rest, for thinking of what caused
  it and how it could be cured.<br>
        Political Economy has been called the dismal science, and as currently
        taught, is hopeless and despairing. But this, as we have seen, is solely
        because she
      has been degraded and shackled; her truths dislocated; her harmonies ignored;
      the word she would utter gagged in her mouth, and her protest against wrong
      turned into an indorsement of injustice. Freed, as I have tried to free
        her &#8212; in
      her own proper symmetry, Political Economy is radiant with hope.</p>
<p>For properly understood, the laws which govern the production and distribution
  of wealth show that the want and injustice of the present social state are
  not necessary; but that, on the contrary, a social state is possible in which
  poverty would be unknown, and all the better qualities and higher powers of
  human nature would have opportunity for full development.</p>
<p>And, further than this,</p>
<ul>
  <li>  when we see that social development is governed neither by a Special
    Providence nor by a merciless fate, but by law, at once unchangeable and
    beneficent; when
      we see that human will is the great factor, and that taking men in the
    aggregate, their condition is as they make it;</li>
  <li>  when we see that economic law and moral law are essentially one, and
        that the truth which the intellect grasps after toilsome effort is but
        that which
        the moral sense reaches by a quick intuition, a flood of light breaks
        in upon the problem of individual life. </li>
  </ul>
<p>These countless millions like
            ourselves,
            who
            on this earth of ours have passed and still are passing, with their
      joys and sorrows, their toil and their striving, their aspirations and
  their fears,
            their strong perceptions of things deeper than sense, their common
      feelings
            which form the basis even of the most divergent creeds &#8212; their
            little lives do not seem so much like meaningless waste.</p>
<p>The scriptures of the men who have been and gone &#8212; the Bibles, the
  Zend Avestas, the Vedas, the Dhammapadas, and the Korans; the esoteric doctrines
  of old philosophies,
  the inner meaning of grotesque religions, the dogmatic constitutions of Ecumenical
  Councils, the preachings of Foxes, and Wesleys, and Savonarolas, the traditions
  of red Indians, and beliefs of black savages, have a heart and core in which
  they agree &#8212; a something which seems like the variously distorted apprehensions
  of a primary truth. And out of the chain of thought we have been following
  there seems vaguely to rise a glimpse of what they vaguely saw &#8212; a shadowy
  gleam of ultimate relations, the endeavor to express which inevitably falls
  into type and allegory. </p>
<ul>
  <li>A garden in which are set the trees of good and evil.        </li>
  <li>A vineyard in which there is the Master's work to do. </li>
  <li>A passage &#8212; from
          life behind to life beyond. </li>
  <li>A trial and a struggle, of which we cannot
            see the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look around today.</p>
<p>Lo! here, now, in our civilized society, the old allegories yet have a meaning,
  the old myths are still true. Into the Valley of the Shadow of Death yet often
  leads the path of duty, through the streets of Vanity Fair walk Christian and
  Faithful, and on Greatheart's armor ring the clanging blows. Ormuzd still fights
  with Ahriman &#8212; the Prince of Light with the Powers of Darkness. He who
  will hear, to him the clarions of the battle call.</p>
<p>How they call, and call, and call, till the heart swells that hears them!
  Strong soul and high endeavor, the world needs them now. Beauty still lies
  imprisoned, and iron wheels go over the good and true and beautiful that might
  spring from human lives.</p>
