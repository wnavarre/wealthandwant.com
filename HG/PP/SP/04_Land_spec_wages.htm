<div align="center"><strong>4. Land Speculation Causes Reduced Wages
  </strong>
</div>
<p>There is a cause, not yet adverted to, which must be taken into consideration
  fully to explain the influence of material progress upon the distribution of
  wealth.</p>
<p>That cause is the confident expectation of the future enhancement of land
  values, which arises in all progressive countries from the steady increase
  of rent, and which leads to speculation, or the holding of land for a higher
  price than it would then otherwise bring.</p>
<p>We have hitherto assumed, as is generally assumed in elucidations of the theory
  of rent, that the actual margin of cultivation always coincides with what may
  be termed the necessary margin of cultivation &#8212; that is to say, we have
  assumed that cultivation extends to less productive points only as it becomes
  necessary
  from the fact that natural opportunities are at the more productive points
  fully utilized.</p>
<p>This, probably, is the case in stationary or very slowly progressing communities,
  but in rapidly progressing communities, where the swift and steady increase
  of rent gives confidence to calculations of further increase, it is not the
  case. In such communities, the confident expectation of increased prices produces,
  to a greater or less extent, the effects of a combination among landholders,
  and tends to the withholding of land from use, in expectation of higher prices,
  thus forcing the margin of cultivation farther than required by the necessities
  of production.</p>
<p>In communities like the United States, where the user of land generally prefers,
  if he can, to own it, and where there is a great extent of land to overrun,
  this cause operated with enormous power. </p>
<p>  The immense area over which the population of the United States is scattered
    shows this. The man who sets out from the Eastern Seaboard in search of the
    margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without paying rent, must,
    like the man who swam the river to get a drink, pass for long distances through
    half-tilled farms, and traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before he reaches
    the point where land can be had free of rent i.e., by homestead entry or
    pre-emption. He (and, with him, the margin of cultivation) is forced so much
    farther than he otherwise need have gone, by the speculation which is holding
    these unused lands in expectation of increased value in the future. And when
    he settles, he will, in his turn, take up, if he can, more land than he can
    use, in the belief that it will soon become valuable; and so those who follow
    him are again forced farther on than the necessities of production require,
    carrying the margin of cultivation to still less productive, because still
    more remote points.</p>
<p> If the land of superior quality as to location were always fully used before
      land of inferior quality were resorted to, no vacant lots would be left
  as a city extended, nor would we find miserable shanties in the midst of costly
      buildings. These lots, some of them extremely valuable, are withheld from
        use, or from the full use to which they might be put, because their owners,
        not
      being able or not wishing to improve them, prefer, in expectation of the
        advance of land values, to hold them for a higher rate than could now
  be
        obtained from
      those willing to improve them. And, in consequence of this land being withheld
      from use, or from the full use of which it is capable, the margin of the
        city is pushed away so much farther from the center.</p>
<p>But when we reach the limits of the growing city &#8212; the actual margin
  of building, which corresponds to the margin of cultivation in agriculture &#8212; we
  shall not find the land purchasable at its value for agricultural purposes,
  as it
  would
  be were rent determined simply by present requirements; but we shall find that
  for a long distance beyond the city, land bears a speculative value, based
  upon the belief that it will be required in the future for urban purposes,
  and that to reach the point at which land can be purchased at a price not based
  upon urban rent, we must go very far beyond the actual margin of urban use.</p>
<p>That mineral land, when reduced to private ownership, is frequently withheld
  from use while poorer deposits are worked, is well known, and in new states
  it is common to find individuals who are called &quot;land poor&quot; -- that
  is, who remain poor, sometimes almost to deprivation, because they insist on
  holding land, which they themselves cannot use, at prices at which no one else
  can profitably use it.</p>
<p>Whether we formulate it as an extension of the margin of production, or as
  a carrying of the rent line beyond the margin of production, the influence
  of speculation in land in increasing rent is a great fact which cannot be ignored
  in any complete theory of the distribution of wealth in progressive countries.
  It is the force, evolved by material progress, which tends constantly to increase
  rent in a greater ratio than progress increases production, and thus constantly
  tends, as material progress goes on and productive power increases, to reduce
  wages, not merely relatively, but absolutely.</p>
<p>The cause which limits speculation in commodities, the tendency of increasing
  price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot limit the speculative advance
  in land values, as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency can neither
  increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless a limit to the price of land,
  in the minimum required by labor and capital as the condition of engaging in
  production. If it were possible continuously to reduce wages until zero were
  reached, it would be possible continuously to increase rent until it swallowed
  up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently reduced below the
  point at which laborers will consent to work and reproduce, nor interest below
  the point at which capital will be devoted to production, there is a limit
  which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence speculation cannot have
  the same scope to advance rent in countries where wages and interest are already
  near the minimum, as in countries where they are considerably above it.</p>
