    <div align="center"><strong>13 Effect of Remedy Upon Social Ideals
      </strong>
    </div>
    <p>From whence springs this lust for gain, to gratify which men tread everything
  pure and noble under their feet; to which they sacrifice all the higher possibilities
  of life; which converts civility into a hollow pretense, patriotism into a
  sham, and religion into hypocrisy; which makes so much of civilized existence
  an Ishmaelitish warfare, of which the weapons are cunning and fraud?</p>
<p>Does it not spring from the existence of want? Carlyle somewhere says that
  poverty is the hell of which the modern Englishman is most afraid. And he is
  right. Poverty is the openmouthed, relentless hell which yawns beneath civilized
  society. And it is hell enough. The Vedas declare no truer thing than when
  the wise crow Bushanda tells the eagle-bearer of Vishnu that the keenest pain
  is in poverty. For poverty is not merely deprivation; it means shame, degradation;
  the searing of the most sensitive parts of our moral and mental nature as with
  hot irons; the denial of the strongest impulses and the sweetest affections;
  the wrenching of the most vital nerves. You love your wife, you love your children;
  but would it not be easier to see them die than to see them reduced to the
  pinch of want in which large classes in every highly civilized community live?
  The strongest of animal passions is that with which we cling to life, but it
  is an everyday occurrence in civilized societies for men to put poison to their
  mouths or pistols to their heads from fear of poverty, and for one who does
  this there are probably a hundred who have the desire, but are restrained by
  instinctive shrinking, by religious considerations, or by family ties.</p>
<p>From this hell of poverty, it is but natural that men should make every effort
  to escape. With the impulse to self-preservation and self-gratification combine
  nobler feelings, and love as well as fear urges in the struggle. Many a man
  does a mean thing, a dishonest thing, a greedy and grasping and unjust thing,
  in the effort to place above want, or the fear of want, mother or wife or children.</p>
<p>And out of this condition of things arises a public opinion which enlists,
  as an impelling power in the struggle to grasp and to keep, one of the strongest
  perhaps with many men the very strongest springs of human action. The desire
  for approbation, the feeling that urges us to win the respect, admiration,
  or sympathy of our fellows, is instinctive and universal. Distorted sometimes
  into the most abnormal manifestations, it may yet be everywhere perceived.
  It is potent with the veriest savage, as with the most highly cultivated member
  of the most polished society; it shows itself with the first gleam of intelligence,
  and persists to the last breath. It triumphs over the love of ease, over the
  sense of pain, over the dread of death. It dictates the most trivial and the
  most important actions.</p>
<p> Now, men admire what they desire. How sweet to the storm-stricken seems the
      safe harbor; food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, warmth to the shivering,
      rest to the weary, power to the weak, knowledge to him in whom the intellectual
      yearnings of the soul have been aroused. And thus the sting of want and
  the fear of want make men admire above all things the possession of riches,
  and
      to become wealthy is to become respected, and admired, and influential.
  Get money &#8212; honestly, if you can, but at any rate get money! This is
  the lesson that society is daily and hourly dinning in the ears of its members.
  Men
        instinctively admire virtue and truth, but the sting of want and the
  fear
        of want make them
      even more strongly admire the rich and sympathize with the fortunate. It
        is well to be honest and just, and men will commend it; but he who by
  fraud and
      injustice gets him a million dollars will have more respect, and admiration,
      and influence, more eye service and lip service, if not heart service,
  than he who refuses it. The one may have his reward in the future; he may know
        that his name is writ in the Book of Life, and that for him is the white
        robe and
      the palm branch of the victor against temptation; but the other has his
  reward
      in the present.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  His name is writ in the list of &quot;our substantial citizens&quot;;</li>
  <li>  he has the courtship of men and the flattery of women;</li>
  <li>  the best pew in the church and the personal regard of the eloquent clergyman
          who in the name of Christ preaches the Gospel of Dives, and tones down
        into a meaningless flower of Eastern speech the stern metaphor of the
        camel and
          the needle's eye.</li>
  <li>  He may be a patron of arts, a M&aelig;cenas to men of letters;</li>
  <li>  may profit by the converse of the intelligent, and</li>
  <li>  be polished by the attrition of the refined.</li>
  <li>  His alms may feed the poor, and help the struggling, and bring sunshine
                  into desolate places;</li>
  <li>  and noble public institutions commemorate, after he is gone,
                    his name and his fame.</li>
  <li>  It is not in the guise of a hideous monster, with horns
                      and tail, that Satan tempts the children of men, but as
        an angel
                      of light.
                      His promises
                      are not
                      alone of the kingdoms of the world, but of mental and moral
                      principalities and powers. He appeals not only to the animal
                      appetites, but
                      to the cravings that stir in man because he is more than
                      an animal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give labor a free field and its full earnings; take for the benefit of the
  whole community that fund which the growth of the community creates, and want
  and the fear of want would be gone. The springs of production would be set
  free, and the enormous increase of wealth would give the poorest ample comfort.
  Men would no more worry about finding employment than they worry about finding
  air to breathe; they need have no more care about physical necessities than
  do the lilies of the field. The progress of science, the march of invention,
  the diffusion of knowledge, would bring their benefits to all.</p>
<p>With this abolition of want and the fear of want, the admiration of riches
  would decay, and men would seek the respect and approbation of their fellows
  in other modes than by the acquisition and display of wealth. In this way there
  would be brought to the management of public affairs, and the administration
  of common funds, the skill, the attention, the fidelity, and integrity that
  can now be secured only for private interests</p>
<p>Shortsighted is the philosophy which counts on selfishness as the master motive
  of human action. It is blind to facts of which the world is full. It sees not
  the present, and reads not the past aright. If you would move men to action,
  to what shall you appeal? Not to their pockets, but to their patriotism; not
  to selfishness, but to sympathy. Self-interest is, as it were, a mechanical
  force &#8212; potent, it is true; capable of large and wide results. But there
  is in human nature what may be likened to a chemical force; which melts and
  fuses
  and overwhelms; to which nothing seems impossible. &quot;All that a man hath
  will he give for his life&quot; &#8212; that is self-interest. But in loyalty
  to higher impulses men will give even life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  It is not selfishness that enriches the annals of every people with heroes
      and saints.</li>
  <li>  It is not selfishness that on every page of the world's history bursts
        out in sudden splendor of noble deeds or sheds the soft radiance of benignant
        lives.</li>
  <li>  It was not selfishness that turned Gautama's back to his royal home
          or bade the Maid of Orleans lift the sword from the altar; that held
          the Three
          Hundred
          in the Pass of Thermopyl&aelig; or gathered into Winkelried's bosom
          the sheaf of spears; that chained Vincent de Paul to the bench of the
          galley,
          or brought
          little starving children, during the Indian famine, tottering to the
          relief stations with yet weaker starvelings in their arms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Call it religion, patriotism, sympathy, the enthusiasm for humanity, or the
  love of God &#8212; give it what name you will; there is yet a force which
  overcomes and drives out selfishness; a force which is the electricity of the
  moral universe;
  a force beside which all others are weak. Everywhere that men have lived it
  has shown its power, and today, as ever, the world is full of it. To be pitied
  is the man who has never seen and never felt it. Look around! among common
  men and women, amid the care and the struggle of daily life, in the jar of
  the noisy street and amid the squalor where want hides &#8212; every here
  and there is the darkness lighted with the tremulous play of its lambent flames.
  He who
  has not seen it has walked with shut eyes. He who looks may see, as says Plutarch,
  that &quot;the soul has a principle of kindness in itself, and is born to love,
  as well as to perceive, think, or remember.&quot;</p>
<p>The will within us is the ultimate fact of consciousness. Yet how little have
  the best of us, in acquirements, in position, even in character, that may be
  credited entirely to ourselves; how much to the influences that have molded
  us.</p>
<p> Who is there, wise, learned, discreet, or strong, who might not, were he
        to trace the inner history of his life, turn, like the Stoic Emperor,
  to give
      thanks to the gods, that by this one and that one, and here and there,
  good examples have been set him, noble thoughts have reached him, and happy
  opportunities
      opened before him.</p>
<p>To remove want and the fear of want, to give to all classes leisure, and comfort,
  and independence, the decencies and refinements of life, the opportunities
  of mental and moral development, would be like turning water into a desert.
  The sterile waste would clothe itself with verdure, and the barren places where
  life seemed banned would ere long be dappled with the shade of trees and musical
  with the song of birds. Talents now hidden, virtues unsuspected, would come
  forth to make human life richer, fuller, happier, nobler. For</p>
<ul>
  <li>  in these round men who are stuck into three-cornered holes, and three-cornered
      men who are jammed into round holes;</li>
  <li>  in these men who are wasting their energies in the scramble to be rich;</li>
  <li>  in these who in factories are turned into machines, or are chained by
        necessity to bench or plow;</li>
  <li>  in these children who are growing up in squalor, and vice, and ignorance,
            are powers of the highest order, talents the most splendid.</li>
</ul>
<p>They need but the opportunity to bring them forth.</p>
<p>Consider the possibilities of a state of society that gave that opportunity
  to all. Let imagination fill out the picture; its colors grow too bright for
  words to paint.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Consider the moral elevation, the intellectual activity, the social life.</li>
  <li>  Consider how by a thousand actions and interactions the members of every
          community are linked together, and how in the present condition of
        things even the fortunate few who stand upon the apex of the social pyramid
        must
          suffer, though they know it not, from the want, ignorance, and degradation
          that are underneath.</li>
  <li>  Consider these things and then say whether the change I propose would
            not be for the benefit of every one &#8212; even the greatest landholder?</li>
