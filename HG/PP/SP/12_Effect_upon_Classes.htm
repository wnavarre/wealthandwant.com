    <div align="center"><strong>12. Effect of Remedy Upon Various Economic Classes
      </strong>
    </div>
    <p>When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
  are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to the
  fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this is a proposition
  to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will show
  that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as landholders
  do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
  And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may lose
  relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For, the
  increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain very
  much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these gains,
  and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the whole
  community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly
        benefit all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head &#8212; laborers,
        operatives,
      mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</li>
      <li>  It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
            by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital &#8212; storekeepers,
            merchants, manufacturers,
        employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of all sorts from the
        peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner &#8212; and</li>
      <li>  it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those
          whose incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Take, now, the case of the homestead owner &#8212; the mechanic, storekeeper,
      or professional man who has secured himself a house and lot, where he lives,
      and
  which he contemplates with satisfaction as a place from which his family cannot
  be ejected in case of his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary, he
  will be the gainer. The selling value of his lot will diminish &#8212; theoretically
  it will entirely disappear. But its usefulness to him will not disappear. It
  will serve his purpose as well as ever. While, as the value of all other lots
  will diminish or disappear in the same ratio, he retains the same security
  of always having a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser only
  as the man who has bought himself a pair of boots may be said to be a loser
  by a subsequent fall in the price of boots. His boots will be just as useful
  to him, and the next pair of boots he can get cheaper. So, to the homestead
  owner, his lot will be as useful, and should he look forward to getting a larger
  lot, or having his children, as they grow up, get homesteads of their own,
  he will, even in the matter of lots, be the gainer. And in the present, other
  things considered, he will be much the gainer. For though he will have more
  taxes to pay upon his land, he will be released from taxes upon his house and
  improvements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all that he and
  his family eat, drink and wear, while his earnings will be largely increased
  by the rise of wages, the constant employment, and the increased briskness
  of trade. His only loss will be, if he wants to sell his lot without getting
  another, and this will be a small loss compared with the great gain.</p>
<p>And so with the farmer. I speak not now of the farmers who never touch the
  handles of a plow, but of the working farmers who constitute such a large class
  in the United States &#8212; men who own small farms, which they cultivate
  with the aid of their boys, and perhaps some hired help, and who in Europe
  would
  be called peasant proprietors. Paradoxical as it may appear to these men until
  they understand the full bearings of the proposition, of all classes above
  that of the mere laborer they have most to gain by placing all taxes upon the
  value of land. That they do not now get as good a living as their hard work
  ought to give them, they generally feel, though they may not be able to trace
  the cause. The fact is that taxation, as now levied, falls on them with peculiar
  severity. They are taxed on all their improvements &#8212; houses, barns,
  fences, crops, stock. The personal property which they have cannot be as readily
  concealed
  or undervalued as can the more valuable kinds which are concentrated in the
  cities. They are not only taxed on personal property and improvements, which
  the owners of unused land escape, but their land is generally taxed at a higher
  rate than land held on speculation, simply because it is improved. But further
  than this, all taxes imposed on commodities, and especially the taxes which,
  like our protective duties, are imposed with a view of raising the prices of
  commodities, fall on the farmer without mitigation.</p>
<p>The farmer would be a great gainer by the substitution of a single tax upon
        the value of land for all these taxes, for the taxation of land values would
        fall with greatest weight, not upon the agricultural districts, where land
        values are comparatively small, but upon the towns and cities where land values
        are high; whereas taxes upon personal property and improvements fall as heavily
        in the country as in the city. And in sparsely settled districts there would
        be hardly any taxes at all for the farmer to pay. For taxes, being levied upon
        the value of the bare land, would fall as heavily upon unimproved as upon improved
        land. Acre for acre, the improved and cultivated farm, with its buildings,
        fences, orchard, crops, and stock, could be taxed no more than unused land
        of equal quality. The result would be that speculative values would be kept
        down, and that cultivated and improved farms would have no taxes to pay until
        the country around them had been well settled. In fact, paradoxical as it may
        at first seem to them, the effect of putting all taxation upon the value of
        land would be to relieve the harder working farmers of all taxation.*</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">*Let us remember that fertility elements put into the soil
      &#8212; or maintained through constant renewal &#8212; are in the economic
      sense, capital rather
          than land, and under Henry George's plan would not be taxed. The farmer
          who builds
              up, or maintains, the fertility of his land, would not have to
      pay any higher tax than if he kept it in run-down condition and with no
      buildings,
          orchards
              or other improvements on it. H.G.B</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the great gain of the working farmer can be seen only when the effect
  upon the distribution of population is considered. The destruction of speculative
  land values would tend to diffuse population where it is too dense and to concentrate
  it where it is too sparse; to substitute for the tenement house, homes surrounded
  by gardens, and fully to settle agricultural districts before people were driven
  far from neighbors to look for land. The people of the cities would thus get
  more of the pure air and sunshine of the country, the people of the country
  more of the economies and social life of the city. If, as is doubtless the
  case, the application of machinery tends to large fields, agricultural population
  will assume the primitive form and cluster in villages. The life of the average
  farmer is now unnecessarily dreary. He is not only compelled to work early
  and late, but he is cut off by the sparseness of population from the conveniences,
  and amusements, the educational facilities, and the social and intellectual
  opportunities that come with the closer contact of man with man. He would be
  far better off in all these respects, and his labor would be far more productive,
  if he and those around him held no more land than they wanted to use. While
  his children, as they grew up, would neither be so impelled to seek the excitement
  of a city nor would they be driven so far away to seek farms of their own.
  Their means of living would be in their own hands, and at home.</p>
<p>    In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well
      as a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made.
      His
    loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. In varying degrees
    is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
    or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
    a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
    but it would impoverish no one.</p>
<p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
  I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
  would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
  powers and different desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in
  accordance with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
  of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates
  wealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the hands
  of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued to exist would
  be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial
  of natural law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the producer
  got but the barest necessities of animal existence.</p>
