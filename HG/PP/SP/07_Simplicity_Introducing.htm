    <div align="center"><strong>7 Simplicity of Method of Introducing Remedy
  </strong>
</div>
<p>It is an axiom of statesmanship, which the successful founders of tyranny
    have understood and acted upon that great changes can best be brought about
    under old forms. We, who would free men, should heed the same truth. It is
    the natural method. When nature would make a higher type, she takes a lower
    one and develops it. This, also, is the law of social growth. Let us work
    by it. With the current we may glide fast and far. Against it, it is hard
    pulling
    and slow progress.<br>
    <br>
    By making use of this existing machinery, we may, without jar or shock, assert
      the common right to land by appropriating rent by taxation. We already take
      some rent in taxation. We have only to make some changes in our modes of
      taxation to take it all.*</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">*Rent in the economic sense is not, as those unfamiliar with economic terminology
          may assume, the whole amount paid for the use of real estate. It is only
          that part of such amount which is paid for the use of the bare land or site
          employed, exclusive of the payment for the use of any buildings or other
      improvements on it. H. G. B.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In form, the ownership of land would remain just as now. No owner of land
  need be dispossessed, and no restriction need be placed upon the amount of
  land any one could hold. For, rent being taken by the State in taxes, land,
  no matter in whose name it stood, or in what parcels it was held, would be
  really common property, and every member of the community would participate
  in the advantages of its ownership.</p>
<p>Now, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily be
  increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition into practical
  form by proposing --</p>
<p align="center"> <strong><em>to abolish all taxation save that upon land values.</em></strong></p>
<p>As we have seen, the value of land is at the beginning of society nothing,
  but as society develops by the increase of population and the advance of the
  arts, it becomes greater and greater. In every civilized country, even the
  newest, the value of the land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear the entire
  expenses of government. In the better developed countries it is much more than
  sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place all taxes upon the
  value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds the present governmental
  revenues, commensurately to increase the amount demanded in taxation, and to
  continue this increase as society progresses and rent advances. But this is
  so natural and easy a matter, that it may be considered as involved, or at
  least understood, in the proposition to put all taxes on the value of land.
  That is the first step upon which the practical struggle must be made. When
  the hare is once caught and killed, cooking him will follow as a matter of
  course. When the common right to land is so far appreciated that all taxes
  are abolished save those which fall upon rent, there is no danger of much more
  than is necessary to induce them to collect the public revenues being left
  to individual landholders.</p>
<p>Wherever the idea of concentrating all taxation upon land values finds lodgment
  sufficient to induce consideration, it invariably makes way, but there are
  few of the classes most to be benefited by it, who at first, or even for a
  long time afterward, see its full significance and power.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is difficult for workingmen to get over the idea that there is a real
    antagonism between capital and labor.</li>
  <li> It is difficult for small farmers and homestead owners to get over the
        idea that to put all taxes on the value of land would be unduly to tax
      them.</li>
  <li>  It is difficult for both classes to get over the idea that to exempt
        capital from taxation would be to make the rich richer, and the poor
        poorer.</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideas spring from confused thought. But behind ignorance and prejudice
  there is a powerful interest, which has hitherto dominated literature, education,
  and opinion. A great wrong always dies hard, and the great wrong which in every
  civilized country condemns the masses of men to poverty and want, will not
  die without a bitter struggle.</p>
