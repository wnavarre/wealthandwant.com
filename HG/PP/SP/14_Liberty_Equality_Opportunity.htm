    <div align="center"><strong>14 Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity
      </strong>
    </div>
    <p>The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
  is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
  of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
  and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
  the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
<p>This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils arising
  from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming more
  and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
  but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
  themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
  greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
  previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these evils are not
  imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
  which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
  an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
<p>The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
  all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
  In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely offers
  to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for, so far
  as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems to be
  the supreme
  law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and asserting the
  rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform ourselves to the
  law &#8212; </p>
<ul>
  <li>we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality in the
        distribution of wealth and power; </li>
  <li>we shall abolish poverty; </li>
  <li>tame the ruthless
          passions of
        greed; </li>
  <li>dry up the springs of vice and misery; </li>
  <li>light in dark places
        the lamp of knowledge; </li>
  <li>give new vigor to invention and a fresh impulse
        to discovery;        </li>
  <li>substitute political strength for political weakness; and </li>
  <li>make
          tyranny and anarchy impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
  or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will make
  all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter and spirit
  of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
  that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;&quot;That all men are created
  equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights;
  that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</p>
<p>These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
  by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
  will not compensate
  for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of nature. Political liberty,
  when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population increases and
  invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment at starvation
  wages. This is the truth that we have ignored. And so</p>
<ul>
  <li>  there come beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and</li>
  <li>  poverty enslaves men who we boast are political sovereigns; and</li>
  <li>  want breeds ignorance that our schools cannot enlighten; and</li>
  <li>  citizens vote as their masters dictate; and</li>
  <li>  the demagogue usurps the part of the statesman; and</li>
  <li>  gold weighs in the scales of justice; and</li>
  <li>  in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the compliment
                of hypocrisy; and</li>
  <li>  the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already
                  bend under an increasing strain.</li>
</ul>
<p>We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound her
  praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her
  demands. She will have no half service!</p>
<p>Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
  For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law
  of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
<p>They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when she has
  abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think of her
  as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life, have not seen
  her real grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her must seem
  rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of life, as well
  as of light;
  as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support all growth, supply all
  motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be a cold and inert mass all
  the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty to mankind. It
  is not for an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that in every age
  the witnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have
  suffered.</p>
<p>We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge, invention,
  national strength, and national independence as other things. But, of all these,
  Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition. She is to virtue
  what light is to color; to wealth what sunshine is to grain; to knowledge what
  eyes are to sight. She is the genius of invention, the brawn of national strength,
  the spirit of national independence. Where Liberty rises, there virtue grows,
  wealth increases, knowledge expands, invention multiplies human powers, and
  in strength and spirit the freer nation rises among her neighbors as Saul amid
  his brethren &#8212; taller and fairer. Where Liberty sinks, there virtue
  fades, wealth diminishes, knowledge is forgotten, invention ceases, and empires
  once
  mighty in arms and arts become a helpless prey to freer barbarians!</p>
<p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
  among men, but all progress hath she called forth.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Liberty came to a race of slaves crouching under Egyptian whips, and
    led them forth from the House of Bondage. She hardened them in the desert
    and made
    of them a race of conquerors. The free spirit of the Mosaic law took their
    thinkers up to heights where they beheld the unity of God, and inspired their
    poets with strains that yet phrase the highest exaltations of thought.</li>
  <li>  Liberty dawned on the Phoenician coast, and ships passed the Pillars
      of Hercules to plow the unknown sea.</li>
  <li>  She shed a partial light on Greece, and marble grew to shapes of ideal
        beauty, words became the instruments of subtlest thought, and against
        the scanty militia
        of free cities the countless hosts of the Great King broke like surges
        against a rock.</li>
  <li>  She cast her beams on the four-acre farms of Italian husbandmen, and
          born of her strength a power came forth that conquered the world. They
          glinted from
          shields of German warriors, and Augustus wept his legions.</li>
  <li>  Out of the night that followed her eclipse, her slanting rays fell
            again on free cities, and a lost learning revived, modern civilization
            began,
            a new world was unveiled; and as Liberty grew, so grew art, wealth,
            power, knowledge,
            and refinement. In the history of every nation we may read the same
            truth.</li>
  <li> It was the strength born of Magna Charta that won Crecy and Agincourt.</li>
  <li>  It was the revival of Liberty from the despotism of the Tudors
                that glorified the Elizabethan age. It was the spirit that brought
                a crowned
                tyrant to
                the block that planted here the seed of a mighty tree.</li>
  <li>  It was the energy of ancient freedom that, the moment it had
                  gained unity, made Spain the mightiest power of the world,
        only to fall
                  to the lowest
                  depth of weakness when tyranny succeeded liberty.</li>
  <li>  See, in France, all intellectual vigor dying under the tyranny
                    of the Seventeenth Century to revive in splendor as Liberty
                    awoke in the
                    Eighteenth,
                    and on the
                    enfranchisement of French peasants in the Great Revolution,
                    basing the wonderful strength that has in our time defied
        defeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shall we not trust her?</p>
<p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
  inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
  calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
  we must wholly accept her or she will not stay. It is not enough that men should
  vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before the law.
  They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
  life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature.
  Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! Either this, or darkness comes
  on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
  destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
  Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
<p>Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one man
  to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have made them
  his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. This
  is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from
  the masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that
  is instituting a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has
  been destroyed; that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom,
  and must soon transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
<p>It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse. It
  is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
  houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
  them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
  that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
<p>Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe forbid
  it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness that is in every soul answers,
  that it cannot be. It is something grander than Benevolence, something more
  august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
  this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
  that
  with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
  and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
  when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?</p>
<p>Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
  to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that
  come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays on
  Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. We degrade
  the Everlasting. We slander the Just One. A merciful man would have better
  ordered the world; a just man would crush with his foot such an ulcerous ant-hill!
  It is not the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the vice and misery
  that fester amid our civilization. The Creator showers upon us his gifts &#8212;  more
  than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for food, we tread them in the
  mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while we tear and rend each other!</p>
<p>In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering enough
  to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel his nerves.
  Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it? Supposing the prayer
  were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang into being there
  should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air; fresh vigor
  the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should spring up,
  and the seed that now increases fiftyfold should increase a hundredfold! Would
  poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit would accrue
  would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the material universe
  could be utilized only through land.</p>
<p>This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of experience.
  We know it because we have seen it. Within our own times, under our very eyes,
  that Power which is above all, and in all, and through all; that Power of which
  the whole universe is but the manifestation; that Power which maketh all things,
  and without which is not anything made that is made, has increased the bounty
  which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility of nature had been increased.
  Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the service
  of mankind. To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels
  the lightning to bear a message round the globe. In every direction have the
  laws of matter been revealed; in every department of industry have arisen arms
  of iron and fingers of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has
  been precisely the same as an increase in the fertility of nature. What has
  been the result? Simply that landowners get all the gain.</p>
<p>Can it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated with impunity?
  Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings while greed
  rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few are surfeited?
  Turn to history, and on every page may be read the lesson that such wrong never
  goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that follows injustice never falters nor
  sleeps! Look around today. Can this state of things continue? May we even say, &quot;After
  us the deluge!&quot; Nay; the pillars of the State are trembling even now,
  and the very foundations of society begin to quiver with pent-up forces that
  glow underneath. The struggle that must either revivify, or convulse in ruin,
  is near at hand, if it be not already begun.</p>
<p>The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
  of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
  higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
  civilization, have been overwhelmed before. It is the delusion which precedes
  destruction that sees in the popular unrest with which the civilized world
  is feverishly pulsing only the passing effect of ephemeral causes. Between
  democratic ideas and the aristocratic adjustments of society there is an irreconcilable
  conflict. Here in the United States, as there in Europe, it may be seen arising.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp.</li>
  <li>  We cannot go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then
        refusing them the right to earn an honest living.</li>
  <li>  We cannot go on prating of the inalienable rights of man and then
            denying the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even now, in old bottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental forces
  gather for the strife!</p>
<p>But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her, if we trust
  Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten must disappear, the forces
  that now menace will turn to agencies of elevation. Think of the powers now
  wasted; of the infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
  of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint.</p>
<ul>
  <li> With want destroyed;</li>
  <li>    with greed changed to noble passions;</li>
  <li>  with the fraternity that is born of equality taking the place of the
        jealousy and fear that now array men against each other;</li>
  <li>  with mental power loosed by conditions that give to the humblest comfort
          and leisure; and</li>
  <li> who shall measure the heights to which our civilization may soar? </li>
</ul>
<p>Words
      fail the thought! It is the Golden Age of which poets have sung and high-raised
    seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious vision which has always haunted
    man with gleams of fitful splendor. It is what he saw whose eyes at Patmos
    were closed in a trance. It is the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the
    City of God on earth, with its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl! It
    is the
    reign of the Prince of Peace!</p>
