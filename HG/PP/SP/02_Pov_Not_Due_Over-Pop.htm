3: Inferences from Analogy<br>
<br>
That vegetable and animal life tends to press against the limits of
space does not prove the same tendency in human life.&nbsp; Granted
that man is only a more highly developed animal; that the
ring-tailed monkey is a distant relative who has gradually developed
acrobatic tendencies, and the humpbacked whale a far-off connection
who in early life took to the sea &#8212; granted that back of these he is
kin to the vegetable, and is still subject to the same laws as
plants, fishes, birds, and beasts. <b>Yet there is still this
difference between man and all other animals &#8212; he is the only animal
whose desires increase as they are fed; the only animal that is never
satisfied.</b> The wants of every other living thing are uniform and
fixed. The ox of today aspires to no more than did the ox when man
first yoked him. The sea gull of the English Channel, who poises
himself above the swift steamer, wants no better food or lodging than
the gulls who circled round as the keels of Caesar's galleys first
grated on a British beach. Of all that nature offers them, be it ever
so abundant, all living things save man can take, and care for, only
enough to supply wants which are definite and fixed. The only use
they can make of additional supplies or additional opportunities is
to multiply.
<p>But not so with man. <b>No sooner are his animal wants satisfied
than new wants arise.</b> Food he wants first, as does the beast;
shelter next, as does the beast; and these given, his reproductive
instincts assert their sway, as do those of the beast. But here man
and beast part company. The beast never goes further; the man has but
set his feet on the first step of an infinite progression &#8212; a
progression upon which the beast never enters; a progression away
from and above the beast.</p>
<b>The demand for quantity once satisfied, he seeks quality.</b>
The very desires that he has in common with the beast become
extended, refined, exalted.
<ul>
  <li>It is not merely hunger, but taste, that seeks gratification in
food; </li>
  <li>in clothes, he seeks not merely comfort, but adornment; </li>
  <li>the rude shelter becomes a house; </li>
  <li>the undiscriminating sexual attraction begins to transmute itself
into subtle influences, and </li>
  <li>the hard and common stock of animal life to blossom and to bloom
into shapes of delicate beauty. </li>
</ul>
<p>As power to gratify his wants increases, so does aspiration grow.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Held down to lower levels of desire, Lucullus will sup with
Lucullus; twelve boars turn on spits that Antony's mouthful of meat may
be done to a turn; every kingdom of Nature be ransacked to add to
Cleopatra's charms, and marble colonnades and hanging gardens and
pyramids that rival the hills arise. </li>
  <li>Passing into higher forms of desire, that which slumbered in the
plant and fitfully stirred in the beast, awakes in the man. The eyes of
the mind are opened, and he longs to know. He braves the scorching heat
of the desert and the icy blasts of the polar sea, but not for food; he
watches all night, but it is to trace the circling of the eternal
stars. He adds toil to toil, to gratify a hunger no animal has felt; to
assuage a thirst no beast can know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Out upon nature, in upon himself, back through the mists that
shroud the past, forward into the darkness that overhangs the future,
turns the restless desire that arises when the animal wants slumber
in satisfaction. Beneath things, he seeks the law; he would know how
the globe was forged and the stars were hung, and trace to their
origins the springs of life. And, then, as the man develops his
nobler nature, there arises the desire higher yet &#8212; the passion of
passions, the hope of hopes &#8212; the desire that he, even he, may
somehow aid in making life better and brighter, in destroying want
and sin, sorrow and shame. He masters and curbs the animal; he turns
his back upon the feast and renounces the place of power; he leaves
it to others to accumulate wealth, to gratify pleasant tastes, to
bask themselves in the warm sunshine of the brief day. He works for
those he never saw and never can see; for a fame, or maybe but for a
scant Justice, that can only come long after the clods have rattled
upon his coffin lid. He toils in the advance, where it is cold, and
there is little cheer from men, and the stones are sharp and the
brambles thick. Amid the scoffs of the present and the sneers that
stab like knives, he builds for the future; he cuts the trail that
progressive humanity may hereafter broaden into a highroad. Into
higher, grander spheres desire mounts and beckons, and a star that
rises in the east leads him on. Lo! the pulses of the man throb with
the yearnings of the god &#8212; he would aid in the process of the
suns!</p>
<p><b>Is not the gulf too wide for the analogy to span? Give more
food, open fuller conditions of life, and the vegetable or animal can
but multiply; the man will develop.</b> In the one the expansive
force can but extend existence in new numbers; in the other, it will
inevitably tend to extend existence in higher forms and wider powers.*
Man is an animal; but he is an animal plus something else. He is the
mythic earth-tree, whose roots are in the ground, but whose topmost
branches may blossom in the heavens!</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>* Many contemporary economists
while agreeing that population does not necessarily tend to become too
dense for the greatest per capita prosperity, would nevertheless argue
that it may do so, and in certain times and countries has done
so.&nbsp; Population, they would say, does not automatically and
without
human prevision adjust itself to available space and available natural
resources; but it may be made so to adjust itself, for the very reason
that human beings differ from non-humans in such ways as Henry George
here indicates. H. G. B. </small><br>

source: Book 2, Chapter 4:
Disproof of the Mathusian Theory<br>
<p>Look simply at the facts. Can anything be clearer than that the
cause of the poverty which festers in the centers of civilization is
not in the weakness of the productive forces? In countries where
poverty is deepest, the forces of production are evidently strong
enough, if fully employed, to provide for the lowest not merely
comfort but luxury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is this very fact &#8212; that want appears where productive power
is greatest and the production of wealth is largest &#8212; that
constitutes the enigma which perplexes the civilized world, and which
we are trying to unravel. Evidently the Malthusian theory, which
attributes want to the decrease of productive power, will not explain
it. That theory is utterly inconsistent with all the facts.<b
 style="font-weight: bold;"> It is
really a gratuitous attribution to the laws of God of results which,
even from this examination, we may infer really spring from the
mal-adjustments</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> of men.</span></p>
