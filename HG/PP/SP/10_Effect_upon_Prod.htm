    <div align="center"><strong>10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production
    </strong> </div>
    <p>  The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
    one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes, as a
    discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
    of the use of money for barter.</p>
<p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
  of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
  by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
  raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
  important the more they are considered.</p>
<ul>
  <li> This is the secret which would transform the little village into the great
    city.*</li>
  <li>  With all the burdens removed which now oppress industry and hamper exchange,
      the production of wealth would go on with a rapidity now undreamed of.</li>
  <li>  This, in its turn, would lead to an increase in the value of land &#8212;        a
    new surplus which society might take for general purposes.</li>
  <li>  And released from the difficulties which attend the collection of revenue
          in a way that begets corruption and renders legislation the tool of
        special interests, society could assume functions which the increasing
        complexity
          of life makes it desirable to assume, but which the prospect of political
          demoralization
          under the present system now leads thoughtful men to shrink from.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">*At the beginning of <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Book
        IX </a>of the complete Progress &amp; Poverty, Henry
      George quotes from Themistocles: &quot;I cannot play upon any stringed instrument,
      but I can tell you how of a little village to make a great and glorious city.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
<p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
  of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
  an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
  would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
  felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
  exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
<ul>
  <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
    them around the world.</li>
  <li>  It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
    fine upon those qualities.</li>
  <li>  If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
        been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually
        to make me
    pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than you.</li>
  <li>  If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
  <li>  If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
    had done an injury to the state;</li>
  <li>  if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it,
    as though it were a public nuisance;</li>
  <li>  if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which
    would go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
  <li>  We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring
                  it among us, we charge him for it as though we were giving
    him a privilege.</li>
  <li>  We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with
                    ripening grain,</li>
  <li>  we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a
                      swamp.</li>
</ul>
<p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
  to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
  before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
  prices.</p>
<p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
  from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
  the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship; the
  farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would be
  free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed by
  the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
  more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state
  would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising
  as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined for
  making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not be taxed
  for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
<p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
  the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
  the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
  reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
  The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
  to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
  enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
  advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
  the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
  to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
  supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
  it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
  rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
  else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
  besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
<p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
  to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
  and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
  and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
  And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
  and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
  labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
  this would commensurately increase.</p>
<p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
  or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
  of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
  one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
  would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
<p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its death
  blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions of acres
  from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned by their
  present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this not merely
  on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled districts.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot be shifted by landowners
    to tenants, though recognized by all competent economists, is sometimes a stumbling
    block to persons untrained in economics. The reason such a tax cannot be shifted
    is that it cannot limit the supply of land. Landowners are presumably, before
    the tax is laid, charging all the rent they can get. There is nothing in a
    tax on the rental value of land to make tenants willing to pay more or to make
    land more difficult to hire. On the contrary, more land will be on the market,
    because of such a tax, rather than less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty
    on holding land out of use and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition
    of former vacant land speculators to get their land used will make land cheaper
    to rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent remaining after
    the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value, land will be very
    much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
  land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as agricultural
  land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep land from its
  most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for it than the use
  to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had
  attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
  would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a
  field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter how costly, would
  have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so much land idle.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
    his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with stock.</li>
  <li>  The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the privilege
      of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use it, as his neighbor
      who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
  <li>  It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable
        land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great
        warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
  labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
    labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
  <li>  the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
      a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
  <li>  the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
        a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
  <li>  And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
          of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.
    <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists, have never succeeded
    in getting a thorough comprehension of this point. Thus, the editor has heard
    the objection advanced that the greater cheapness of land is no advantage to
    the poor man who is trying to save enough from his earnings to buy a piece
    of land; for, it is said, the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired,
    offset the lower purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that even
    if the lower price of land does no more than balance the higher tax on it,
    (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement to speculation in land),
    the reduction or removal of other taxes is all clear gain. It is easier to
    save in proportion as earnings and commodities are relieved of taxation. It
    is easier to buy land, because its selling price is lower, if the land is taxed.
    And although the land, after its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only
    can this tax be fully paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the
    purchase price, but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings
    and other improvements and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary.
    H.G.B.</font></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition would
  no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with each other
  for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point of
  bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers, and
  wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market would
  have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment of labor, a
  competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212;  the
  demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to bid
  against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade and increased
  profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
  upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
  monopolization.</p>
<p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
<ul>
  <li>  with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
    from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor
    into
    the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
  <li>  the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
  <li>  every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
  <li>  demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>
  <li>  trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every
            hand.</li>
