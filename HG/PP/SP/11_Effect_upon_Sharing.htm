<p align="center"><strong>11. Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</strong></p>
<p>  But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
  burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
  consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth.
</p>
<p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
  in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
  inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
  as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
  a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
  capital.</p>
<p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
  and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
  this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
  the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
  instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
  capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
  state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
  would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
<p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided into
  two portions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>  One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
    producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</li>
  <li>  the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
        in public benefits to all its members.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young children
  and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as the vigorous.
  And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents the result of individual
  effort in production, the other represents the increased power with which the
  community
  as a whole aids the individual.</p>
<p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
  community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
  as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
  equality.</p>
<p>Who can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity of labor
  may not be raised by social adjustments which will give to the producers of
  wealth their fair proportion of its advantages and enjoyments! With present
  processes the gain would be simply incalculable, but just as wages are high,
  so do the invention and utilization of improved processes and machinery go
  on with greater rapidity and ease.</p>
<p> But I shall not deny, and do not wish to lose sight of the fact, that while
      thus preventing waste and thus adding to the efficiency of labor, the equalization
      in the distribution of wealth that would result from the simple plan of
  taxation that I propose, must lessen the intensity with which wealth is pursued.
  It
      seems to me that in a condition of society in which no one need fear poverty,
      no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at least, no one would take the
      trouble to strive and to strain for it as men do now. For, certainly, the
      spectacle
      of men who have only a few years to live, slaving away their time for the
      sake of dying rich, is in itself so unnatural and absurd, that in a state
      of society where the abolition of the fear of want had dissipated the envious
      admiration with which the masses of men now regard the possession of great
      riches, whoever would toil to acquire more than he cared to use would be
      looked upon as we would now look on a man who would thatch his head with
      half a dozen hats.</p>
<p>And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not spare it?
  Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of development, it is
  not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization do not come from the
  weakness of the springs of production. What it suffers from, and what, if a
  remedy be not applied, it must die from, is unequal distribution!</p>
<p>Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the standpoint
  of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate of production is
  greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are pursued, is one of the most
  obtrusive facts of modern society. While, were this insane desire to get rich
  at any cost lessened, mental activities now devoted to scraping together riches
  would be translated into far higher spheres of usefulness.</p>
