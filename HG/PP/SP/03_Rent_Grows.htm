<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Land Rent Grows as Community
Develops</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>Land, Labor, and Capital are the factors of production.
    <ul>
      <li>The term Land includes all natural opportunities or forces;</li>
      <li>the term Labor, all human exertion; and</li>
      <li>the term Capital, all wealth used to produce more wealth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In returns to these three factors is the whole produce
distributed.
    <ul>
      <li>That part which goes to land owners as payment for the use of
    natural opportunities is called Rent;</li>
      <li>that part which constitutes the reward of human exertion
    is
    called Wages; and</li>
      <li>that part which constitutes the return for the use of capital
    is called Interest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>These terms mutually exclude each other. The income of any
individual may be made up from any one, two, or all three of these
sources; but in the effort to discover the laws of distribution we must
keep them separate.</li>
</ul>
There must be land before labor can be exerted, and labor must be
exerted before capital can be produced. Capital is a result of labor,
and is used by labor to assist it in further production. Labor is the
active and initial force, and labor is therefore the employer of
capital. Labor can be exerted only upon land, and it is from land
that the matter which it transmutes into wealth must be drawn.
<b><i>Land therefore is the condition precedent, the field and
material of labor. The natural order is land, labor, capital.<br>

</div>
Increasing population increases rent* without reference to the natural
qualities of land, for the increased powers of co-operation and
exchange which come with increased population are equivalent to &#8212; nay,
I think we can say without metaphor, that they give &#8212; an increased
capacity to land.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*Elsewhere, Henry George explains, "I,
of course, use 'rent' in its
economic, not in its common sense, meaning by it what is commonly
called ground-rent."</font><br>
</div>
<p><br>
    I do not mean to say merely that, like an improvement in the methods or
  tools of production, the increased power which comes with increased
  population gives to the same labor an increased result, which is
  equivalent to an increase in the natural powers of land; but that it
  brings out a superior power in labor, which is localized on land; and
  which thus inheres in the land as much as any qualities of soil,
  climate, mineral deposit, or natural situation, and passes, as they do,
  with the possession of the land.  </p>
<p> Here, let us imagine, is <b>an
    unbounded savannah</b>, stretching off in unbroken sameness of grass and
    flower, tree and rill, till the traveler tires of the monotony. Along comes
    the wagon
    of the first immigrant. Where to settle he
    cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems as good as every other acre. As to wood,
    as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there is absolutely no choice,
    and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out with the search
    for one place that is better than
    another, he stops &#8212; somewhere, anywhere &#8212; and starts to make himself
    a home. The soil is virgin and rich, game is abundant, the streams flash with
    the finest trout. Nature is at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous
    district, would make him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental
    craving, which would lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under
    all the material disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary assistance
    for any work that requires a greater union of strength than that afforded by
    his own family, or by such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has cattle,
    he cannot often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill a bullock.
    He must be his
    own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in short, a "jack
    of all trades and master of none." He cannot have his children schooled, for,
    to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher. Such things as he cannot
    produce himself, he must buy in quantities and keep on hand, or else go without,
    for he cannot be constantly leaving his work and making a long journey to the
    verge of civilization; and when forced to do so, the getting of a vial of medicine
    or the replacement of a broken auger may cost him the labor of himself and
    horses for days. Under such circumstances, though nature is prolific, the man
    is poor.
    It is an easy matter for him to get enough to eat; but beyond this, his labor
    will suffice to satisfy
    only the simplest wants in the rudest way. </p>
<p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section*
of the boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he
is not beset by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the
land is the same, there is one place that is clearly better for him
than any other place, and that is where there is already a settler
and he may have a neighbor. He settles by the side of the first
comer, whose condition is at once greatly improved, and to whom many
things are now possible that were before impossible, for two men may
help each other to do things that one man could never do.<font size="-1"></font></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*The public prairie lands of the
United States were surveyed into sections of one mile square, and a
quarter section (160 acres) was the usual government allotment to a
settler under the Homestead Act. </font><br>
</div>
Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction,
settles where there are already two. Another, and another, until
around our first comer there are a score of neighbors. Labor has now
an effectiveness which, in the solitary state, it could not approach.
If heavy work is to be done, the settlers have a logrolling, and
together accomplish in a day what singly would require years. When
one kills a bullock, the others take part of it, returning when they
kill, and thus they have fresh meat all the time. Together they hire
a schoolmaster, and the children of each are taught for a fractional
part of what similar teaching would have cost the first settler. It
becomes a comparatively easy matter to send to the nearest town, for
some one is always going. But there is less need for such journeys. A
blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our settler can
have his tools repaired for a small part of the labor it formerly
cost him. A store is opened and he can get what he wants as he wants
it; a postoffice, soon added, gives him regular communication with
the rest of the world. Then come a cobbler, a carpenter, a harness
maker, a doctor; and a little church soon arises. Satisfactions
become possible that in the solitary state were impossible. There are
gratifications for the social and the intellectual nature &#8212; for that
part of the man that rises above the animal. The power of sympathy,
the sense of companionship, the emulation of comparison and contrast,
open a wider, and fuller, and more varied life. In rejoicing, there
are others to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners do not mourn alone.
There are husking bees, and apple parings, and quilting parties.
Though the ballroom be unplastered and the orchestra but a fiddle,
the notes of the magician are yet in the strain, and Cupid dances
with the dancers. At the wedding, there are others to admire and
enjoy; in the house of death, there are watchers; by the open grave,
stands human sympathy to sustain the mourners. Occasionally, comes a
straggling lecturer to open up glimpses of the world of science, of
literature, or of art; in election times, come stump speakers, and
the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and power, as the cause of
empires is tried before him in the struggle of John Doe and Richard
Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes the circus,
talked of months before, and opening to children whose horizon has
been the prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and
princesses of fairy tale, mailclad crusaders and turbaned Moors,
Cinderella's fairy coach, and the giants of nursery lore; lions such
as crouched before Daniel, or in circling Roman amphitheater tore the
saints of God; ostriches who recall the sandy deserts; camels such as
stood around when the wicked brethren raised Joseph from the well and
sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the Alps with
Hannibal, or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music that
thrills and builds in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome
of Kubla Khan.
<p>Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit
trees which you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a
house &#8212; in short, you have by your labor added so much value to this
farm. Your land itself is not quite so good. You have been cropping
it, and by and by it will need manure. I will give you the full value
of all your improvements if you will give it to me, and go again with
your family beyond the verge of settlement." He would laugh at you.
His land yields no more wheat or potatoes than before, but it does
yield far more of all the necessaries and comforts of life. His labor
upon it will bring no heavier crops, and, we will suppose, no more
valuable crops, but it will bring far more of all the other things
for which men work. The presence of other settlers &#8212; the increase of
population &#8212; has added to the productiveness, in these things, of
labor bestowed upon it, and this added productiveness gives it a
superiority over land of equal natural quality where there are as yet
no settlers. If no land remains to be taken up, except such as is as
far removed from population as was our settler's land when he first
went upon it, the value or rent of this land will be measured by the
whole of this added capability. If, however, as we have supposed,
there is a continuous stretch of equal land, over which population is
now spreading, it will not be necessary for the new settler to go
into the wilderness, as did the first. He will settle just beyond the
other settlers, and will get the advantage of proximity to them. The
value or rent of our settler's land will thus depend on the advantage
which it has, from being at the center of population, over that on
the verge. In the one case, the margin of production will remain as
before; in the other, the margin of production will be raised.</p>
<p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do
the economies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to
the productiveness of the land. Our first settler's land, being the
center of population, the store, the blacksmith's forge, the
wheelwright's shop, are set up on it, or on its margin, where soon
arises a village, which rapidly grows into a town, the center of
exchanges for the people of the whole district. With no greater
agricultural productiveness than it had at first, this land now
begins to develop a productiveness of a higher kind. To labor
expended in raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes, it will yield no
more of those things than at first; but to labor expended in the
subdivided branches of production which require proximity to other
producers, and, especially, to labor expended in that final part of
production, which consists in distribution, it will yield much larger
returns. The wheatgrower may go further on, and find land on which
his labor will produce as much wheat, and nearly as much wealth; but
the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper, the professional man,
find that their labor expended here, at the center of exchanges, will
yield them much more than if expended even at a little distance away
from it; and this excess of productiveness for such purposes the
landowner can claim just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing
power. And so our settler is able to sell in building lots a few of
his acres for prices which it would not bring for wheatgrowing if its
fertility had been multiplied many times. With the proceeds, he
builds himself a fine house, and furnishes it handsomely. That is to
say, to reduce the transaction to its lowest terms, the people who
wish to use the land build and furnish the house for him, on
condition that he will let them avail themselves of the superior
productiveness which the increase of population has given the
land.</p>
<p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater
utility to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town
has grown into a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco &#8212; and
still it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with the best
machinery and the most favorable facilities; the
division of labor becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying
efficiency; exchanges are of such volume and rapidity that they are
made with the minimum of friction and loss. Here is the heart, the
brain, of the vast social organism that has grown up from the germ of
the first settlement; here has developed one of the great ganglia of
the human world. Hither run all roads, hither set all currents,
through all the vast regions round about. Here, if you have anything
to sell, is the market; here, if you have anything to buy, is the
largest and the choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is
gathered into a focus, and here springs that stimulus which is born
of the collision of mind with mind. Here are the great libraries, the
storehouses and granaries of knowledge, the learned professors, the
famous specialists. Here are museums and art galleries, collections
of philosophical apparatus, and all things rare, and valuable, and
best of their kind. Here come great actors, and orators, and singers,
from all over the world. Here, in short, is a center of human life,
in all its varied manifestations.</p>
So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the
application of labor, that instead of one man &#8212; with a span of
horses scratching over acres, you may count in places thousands of
workers to the acre, working tier on tier, on floors raised one above
the other, five, six, seven and eight stories from the ground, while
underneath the surface of the earth engines are throbbing with
pulsations that exert the force of thousands of horses.
<p><b>All these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and
no other that they can be utilized, for here is the center of
population &#8212; the focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of
the highest forms of industry.</b> The productive powers which
density of population has attached to this land are equivalent to the
multiplication of its original fertility by the hundredfold and the
thousandfold. And rent, which measures the difference between this
added productiveness and that of the least productive land in use,
has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever has succeeded to
his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another
<a name="Rip Van Winkle"></a>Rip Van Winkle, he may have lain down
and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not from anything he has done, but
from the increase of population. There are lots from which for every
foot of frontage the owner may draw more than an average mechanic can
earn; there are lots that will sell for more than would suffice to
pave them with gold coin. In the principal streets are towering
buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass, finished in the
most expensive style, replete with every convenience. Yet they are
not worth as much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the same land,
in nothing changed, which when our first settler came upon it had no
value at all.</p>
<p>That this is the way in which the increase of population
powerfully acts in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive
country, will look around him, may see for himself. The process is
going on under his eyes. The increasing difference in the
productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing rise in
rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased
population compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the
increased productiveness which increased population gives to the
lands already in use. <b>The most valuable lands on the globe, the
lands which yield the highest rent, are not lands of surpassing
natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing utility has been
given by the increase of population.</b></p>
<p><b>And where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities,
such as deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and
iron, or heavy timber, observation also shows that these superior
qualities are brought out, rendered tangible, by population. </b>The
coal and iron fields of Pennsylvania, that today [1879] are worth
enormous
sums, were fifty years ago valueless. What is the efficient cause of
the difference? Simply the difference in population. The coal and
iron beds of Wyoming and Montana, which today are valueless, will, in
fifty years from now, be worth millions on millions, simply because,
in the meantime, population will have greatly increased.</p>
<p>It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through
space. If the bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but
open a hatch and there is a new supply, of which before we never
dreamed. <b><i>And very great command over the services of others
comes to those who as the hatches are opened are permitted to say,
"This is mine!"</i></b></p>
