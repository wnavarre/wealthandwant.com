<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">About the Author</span><br>
  <br>
Henry George was born in Philadelphia in 1839. Appalled by the shocking
poverty he saw around him in the middle of one of the world's
wealthiest cities, he pondered where mankind had gone wrong and what
could be done about it. Natural resources, he discovered, are the key
to understanding our economy, and the failure of others to see this has
led to increasing poverty and environmental degradation. In 1879, Henry
George finished writing <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and
Poverty</span>. During the 19th century, the circulation of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span> was second
only to that of the Bible. To this day, no other book on economics has
been as widely distributed.<br>
</p>
<p><b>The Riddle<a name="riddle"></a></b></p>
<p>During the 19th century the U.S. witnessed a huge increase in
wealth-producing power. People naturally expected labor-saving
inventions to lessen toil and improve working conditions for all;
that the enormous increase in wealth producing power would wipe out
poverty forever.</p>
<p>Instead, however, squalor, misery, vice and crime increased and
are still increasing everywhere as our villages, towns and cities
grow and as new technologies bring advantages to improve methods of
production and exchange.</p>
<p>The association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of
our times. It is the source of our industrial, social and political
difficulties. Our statesmen, philanthropists, and educators grapple
with it in vain. This riddle, if not answered, will eventually topple
our entire civilization. To solve the riddle, we must research the
immutable laws governing the science of economics.</p>
<p><b>Land, Labor, Capital<a name="landlaborcapital"></a></b></p>
<p>Land, labor, and capital are the three factors of production. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The term <span style="font-weight: bold;">land </span>as used
herein, is intended to include all natural resources, such as the earth
and all its locations, minerals, oil and waterfalls as untouched by
human hands; </li>
  <li>the term <span style="font-weight: bold;">labor</span>, all
human exertion whether by brain or brawn or both; </li>
  <li>the term <span style="font-weight: bold;">capital</span>, all
wealth (such as tools, machinery, investments and goods in process of
exchange) used to produce more wealth. </li>
</ul>
<p>The return to each factor is distributed as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>landowners get the part called <span style="font-weight: bold;">rent</span>,
  </li>
  <li>laborers (whether by brain or by brawn, or both) the part called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">wages</span>, and</li>
  <li>capital the part called <span style="font-weight: bold;">interest</span>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These terms mutually exclude each other. Any person may derive
income from any one, two or all three of these sources; but to
understand how the returns to each are exchanged we must keep them
separate.</p>
<p>David Ricardo (1772-1823), an English economist, discovered that
the rent, or the cost of land, is determined by the excess of its
produce over that which the same application of labor can secure from
the least productive land in use. This is proven by the fact that
locations in active manufacturing and commercial areas are much more
valuable than land (locations) in remote areas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The increase of rent (the return to
the location owner) in the
U.S. explains why wages and interest do not increase with the
increase in productive power. </span>Wealth, which must be produced by
humans, is divided into two parts by the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">rent line</span> which is fixed by
the return which labor and capital can obtain from the natural
resources free to them without the payment of rent. From that part of
the produce below this rent line wages and interest must be paid. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">All
production above the rent line goes to the owners of land.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus,
where the value of land is low, there may be low production of
wealth, and yet a high rate of wages and interest. Where the value of
land is high, there may be enormous production of wealth, but with a
low rate of wages and interest.</span></p>
<p>The increase of rent explains why wages and interest do not
increase. The cause which enriches the landowner is the cause which
tends to impoverish the laborer and capitalist (investor). Hence, the
rate of wages and interest is everywhere fixed, not so much by the
productivity of labor as by the value of land. Wherever the value of
land is relatively low, wages and interest are relatively high.
Wherever the value of land is relatively high, wages and interest are
relatively low. Hence the increase of productive power does not
result in increased wages, but rather results in increases in the
value of land. Rent (which goes to the non-producing landowners)
swallows up the whole gain, and poverty accompanies progress.</p>
<p>Human beings in the most abject, most helpless and hopeless
condition, are in the great cities of the U.S. There you will find
the ownership of a small location is worth a fortune, while actual
wealth producers get only part of what they produce (landowners
getting the rest) and willing workers can find no jobs and no land on
which to apply their labor.</p>
<div align="left"><br>
    <b>Effect of Material Progress <a name="EffectofMaterialProgress"></a>Upon the Distribution of
  Wealth:</b></div>
<p>The term wealth means anything of value produced by human effort.
Thus, land (the earth and its locations) is not wealth, even though
some locations are enormously valuable, because humans did not
produce the earth.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wealth </span>in all its forms is
the product of labor applied to land or
the products of land. The earth is not a product of labor. Thus while
the earth is the source of all wealth, it is not, of itself,
"wealth." Therefore any increase in the power of labor, along with
unsatisfied demands for wealth, generates increased demand for land,
from which, alone, more wealth can and must be produced.</p>
<p>There are absolutely no limits to the progress of invention. Nor
can we assign any limits to the increase of land rent, short of the
whole produced. For, if labor-saving inventions proliferated until
perfection was obtained, and the need for labor in wealth production
was entirely done away with, everything the earth could yield could
be obtained without labor. And no matter how small the population
might be, if anybody but the landowners continued to exist, it would
be at the whim or by the mercy of landowners' bounty. This point, of
the absolute perfection of laborsaving inventions, may seem far
fetched, but it is the point to which the march of invention is
directed every day.</p>
<p>The improvements which increase land rent include the improvements
which directly increase productive power. Improvements in government,
manners and morals indirectly increase land rent. Considered as
material forces, the effect of all these is to increase productive
arts. Their benefits are ultimately monopolized by the possessor of
the land. If the corrupt governments of the great cities of the U.S.
were made models of integrity and economic efficiency, the effect
would simply be to increase the value of land, not to raise either
wages or interest.</p>
<p><b>The Problem Solved<a name="problemsolved"></a></b></p>
<p>There is a reason, in spite of the increase of productive power,
wages constantly tend to a minimum which will give a bare living.
With any increase in productive power, rents tend to even greater
increase, thus producing a constant tendency to lowering wages. Thus,
the laborer has no incentive to produce more, or more efficiently, as
all his or her increased production ultimately winds up in the
landowners pockets.</p>
<p>The simple theory outlined here explains this conjunction of
poverty with wealth and of low wages with high productive power. It
explains why interest and wages are relatively higher in developing
communities, though the average, as well as the total, production in
well developed communities is greater. It explains why improvements
which increase the total wealth, do not improve the rewards to labor
or interest. It explains what is commonly called the conflict between
labor and capital, yet demonstrates there is actually harmony of
interest between labor and capital.</p>
<p>Is it not a notorious fact, known to the most ignorant, that
developing communities, where the total wealth is small, but where
land is cheap, are always better communities for laborers than rich
communities, where land is expensive? Wherever one finds land values
relatively low, will one not find wages relatively high? Wherever
land value is high, will one not find wages low? As land increases in
value, poverty deepens and pauperism appears. Where land is cheap,
you will find no beggars, and the inequalities of condition are very
slight. In the great cities, where land is so valuable that it is
measured and sold by the square foot, you will find the extremes of
poverty and of luxury. And this disparity in condition between the
two extremes of the social scale may always be measured by the price
of land. Land in and near the great cities is valuable, yet there you
will see such great squalor, destitution and misery that you will
stand aghast.</p>
<p>For land is for the habitation of people, the storehouse from
which they must draw for all their needs. Material progress cannot
rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of
producing wealth from land; and hence, when land is monopolized,
material progress might go on to infinity without increasing wages or
improving the condition of those who have but their labor. It can but
add to the value of land and the power which its possession gives.
Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land
is the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the
source of power.<br>
</p>
<p><b>The Remedy<a name="remedy"></a></b></p>
<p>The equal right of all men and women to the use of land is as
clear as their equal right to breathe the air. It is a right
proclaimed by the fact of their existence. For we cannot suppose that
some men and women have a right to be in this world and others do
not.</p>
<p>Any one human being who appropriates to himself or herself the
individual right to the land of any community or country, could
legally expel therefrom all the rest of its inhabitants. If you
extend this right to the whole surface of the globe, where would
non-landowning human beings have the right to live?</p>
<p>This supposition is occurring on a growing scale, realized in
actual fact. The comparative handful of proprietors who own large
surfaces of the U.S. are doing only what federal, state, and local
laws give them full power to do (and what many of them have done
already), excluding millions of American people from their natural
birthright, the land. And such exclusions are as repugnant to natural
right as the spectacle of the vast body of the American people being
compelled to pay such enormous sums to the few landowners of their
number for the privilege of being permitted to live upon and use the
land which they, the landowners, so fondly call their own; which is
endeared to them by memories so tender and so glorious, and for which
they are held in duty bound, if need be, to spill their blood and lay
down their lives.</p>
<p>Place one hundred men and women on an island from which there is
no escape, and whether you make one the absolute owner of the other
ninety-nine, or the absolute owner of the soil of the island, will
make no difference either to the chosen one or to the other
ninety-nine.</p>
<p>It was not nobility that gave land, but the possession of land
that gave nobility.</p>
<p>What is being proposed here is a simple yet sovereign remedy,
which will raise wages, increase earnings of capital and give
remunerative employment to whomever wishes it. The proposal is to
appropriate land rent for public revenue, rather than rob producers
of their rightful earnings by punitive taxation.</p>
<p>Now, as the taking of rent, or land value, must be increased as we
abolish other "taxes," we may put the proposition in practical form
by proposing to abolish all taxation and derive all public revenue
from a legitimate charge upon land location values.</p>
<p>"Taxation," which lessens the reward of the producer, necessarily
lessens the incentive to production. Thus, taxation which diminishes
the earnings of the laborer or the returns to the capitalist tends to
make the one less industrious and intelligent, the other less
disposed to save and invest. "Taxation" which falls upon the
processes of production interposes an artificial obstacle to the
creation of wealth.</p>
<p>If manufactures are taxed the effect is to lessen improvements;
tax commerce and the effect is to prevent exchange; tax capital, and
the effect is to drive it away. But the whole rental value of land
may be taken as public revenue, and the only effect will be to
stimulate industry, to open new opportunities to capital and to
increase the production of wealth.</p>
<p>The charge on land location values may be assessed and collected
with a definiteness that partakes of the immovable and inconcealable
character of the location itself. Were all charges for public revenue
placed upon location values, irrespective of improvements, generating
public revenue would be so simple and clear, and public attention
would be so directed to it, that valuation of the charge on any
location could and would be made with the same certainty that a real
estate agent can determine the price a seller can get for a lot.</p>
<p>The charge upon location values falls only upon those who receive
from society a valuable benefit and falls on them in proportion to
the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the
use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the
community. When all location rent is taken via legitimate charges for
value received for the needs of the community, no citizen will have
an advantage over any other citizen save as is given by industry,
skill, and intelligence; and each will obtain what he or she fairly
earns. Then, and not until then, will labor get its full reward, and
capital its natural return.</p>
<p><b>Effects of the Remedy<a name="effectsremedy"></a></b></p>
<p>The advantage which will be gained by substituting for the many
taxes by which the public revenues are now raised, a single just
charge levied upon the value of locations, will appear more and more
important the more it is considered. With the removal of all the
burdens which now oppress industry and hamper exchange, production of
wealth would increase with a rapidity now undreamed of.</p>
<p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth. Abolishing all
taxation which now hampers every wheel of exchange and presses upon
every form of industry, would be like removing an immense weight from
a powerful spring. The present method of taxation operates to
penalize energy and industry and skill and thrift like a fine upon
those qualities. If a person builds a ship we make the person pay for
such temerity, as though an injury had been done to the state; if a
railroad is opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
it were a public nuisance; if a manufactory is erected we levy upon
it an annual sum which would go far toward making handsome profit. We
say we want capital, but if any one accumulates it or brings it among
us, we penalize him or her for it as though we were giving the person
a privilege. We punish with a tax those who cover barren fields with
ripening grain; we fine those who put up machinery and clean up a
dump.</p>
<p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous burden
of penalties from productive industry.</p>
<p>To change the taxation from production to a charge on the value or
rent of locations would give new stimulus to the production of
wealth; it would also open new opportunities. For under this system
no one would care to hold a location unless to use it, and locations
now withheld from use would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.
Millions of acres that today are being used inefficiently would
return to their natural, pristine state.</p>
<p>The selling price of locations would fall; speculation in
locations would receive its death blow; the monopolization of
valuable locations would no longer pay.</p>
<p>And it must be remembered that this would apply not merely to
agricultural land, but to all locations ... everywhere. Everywhere
that locations had attained value, the generating of public revenue
from those values, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon
improvement, would operate to motivate improvement. Whoever planted
an orchard or sowed a field or built a house or built a manufactory,
no matter how costly, would have no more to pay in location value
charges than if such locations were kept vacant. The monopolist of
agricultural locations would be charged as much as though those
locations were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with
stock. The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as high a
charge for the privilege of keeping other people off of it until the
owner wanted to use it as the neighbor who has a fine house upon his
lot.</p>
<p>It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon
valuable locations as if those locations were covered with grand
hotels or a pile of great warehouses filled with costly goods.</p>
<p>Consider the effect of such change upon the labor market.
Competition would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers
competing with each other for employment, and in their competition
cutting down wages to the point of bare subsistence, employers would
everywhere be competing for laborers, and wages would rise to the
fair earnings of labor. The employers of labor would not have merely
to bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater
trade and increased profits, but against the ability of laborers to
become their own employers upon the natural opportunities freely
opened to them by the location value charge which prevents the
monopolization of locations.</p>
<p>It is manifest, of course that the change proposed here will
greatly benefit all those who live by wages, whether of brain or of
brawn. And it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes
of those whose incomes are drawn from the earnings of capital, or
from investments other than in locations.</p>
<p>Farmers, not those who never touch farm equipment, but the working
farmers who are such a large class in the U.S., will benefit by the
proposed change. Paradoxical as it may appear to these farmers until
they understand the full bearings of the proposition, of all classes
above that of the laborer such farmers have the most to gain by
deriving all public revenue from just charges on location values. The
fact is that taxation, as now levied, falls on them with peculiar
punitive severity. They are taxed on all their improvements, houses,
barns, fences, crops, and stock. Farmers pay personal income taxes
and sales taxes. The personal property which they have cannot be as
readily concealed or undervalued as can the more valuable kinds which
are concentrated in the cities. They are not only taxed on personal
property and improvements, which the owner of unused locations
escapes, but their land is generally taxed at a higher rate than land
held on speculation, simply because it is improved. But further than
this all taxes imposed on commodities fall on the farmer without
mitigation. The farmer would be a gainer by the substitution of a
single charge upon the value of his or her location instead of all
these taxes. The charge on location values would fall with greatest
weight, not upon the agricultural districts, where location values
are comparatively small, but upon the towns and cities where location
values are high; whereas sales taxes and taxes upon personal income,
personal property and improvements fall as heavily in the country as
in the city. The result of a charge on location values would be that
speculative values of locations would be kept down, and that
cultivated and improved farms would have not payments to make to
support government directly until the country around them had been
well settled. In fact, paradoxical as it may at first seem to them,
the effect of putting all charges for public revenue upon the value
of locations would be to relieve the harder working farmers of all
taxation.</p>
<p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased, it would be
equitably distributed. Not to mean that each individual would get the
same amount of wealth. That would not be equitable distribution, so
long as different individuals have different powers and different
desires. But wealth would be distributed by the degree in which the
industry, skill, knowledge or prudence of each contributed to the
common stock. The non producer would no longer roll in luxury while
the producer got but the barest necessities of animal existence.</p>
<p>All fear of great fortunes might be dismissed, for when every
person gets what each fairly earns, no one can get more than he or
she fairly earns. How many men and women are there who can fairly
earn a million dollars a year?<br>
</p>
<center><b>The Law of Human Progress<a name="Lawofhumanprog"></a></b>
</center>
<p>Civilization is cooperation. Union and liberty are factors of
civilization. What has destroyed every previous civilization has been
the tendency to the unequal distribution of wealth and power. This
same tendency, operating with increasing force, is observable in our
civilization today. As corruption becomes chronic; as public spirit
is lost; as traditions of honor, virtue and patriotism are weakened;
as law is brought into contempt and reforms become hopeless; then in
the festering mass will be generated volcanic forces, which shatter
and rend when seeming accident give them vent. Strong, unscrupulous
men and women, rising up, upon occasion will become the exponents of
blind popular desires or fierce popular passions and dash aside forms
that have lost their vitality. The sword will again be mightier than
the pen, and carnivals of destructive brute force and wild frenzy
will alternate with the lethargy of a declining civilization.</p>
<p>Whence shall come the new barbarians? Go through the squalid
quarters of great cities, and you may see, even now, their gathering
hordes. How shall learning perish? Men and women will cease to read,
and books will kindle fires.</p>
<p>In the decline of civilization, communities do not go down by the
same path by which they came up. For instance, the decline of
civilization as manifested in government would not take us back from
republicanism to constitutional monarchy, and thence to the feudal
system; it would take us to emperorship and anarchy.</p>
<p>Where Liberty rises, there virtue grows, wealth increases,
knowledge expands, invention multiplies human powers and in strength
and spirit the freer nation rises among her neighbors. Where Liberty
sinks, there virtues fade, wealth diminishes, knowledge is forgotten,
invention ceases and empires once mighty in arms and arts become
helpless prey to freer barbarians.</p>
<p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet
beamed among men and women, but all progress hath she called forth.
Shall we not trust Liberty?</p>
<p>In our time as in times before, insidious forces that produce
inequality are destroying Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to
lower. Liberty calls to us again. It is not enough that men and women
should vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal
before the law. They must have liberty to avail themselves of the
opportunities and means of life; they must stand on equal terms with
reference to the bounty of nature. This is the universal law. This is
the lesson of the centuries. Unless its foundations be laid in
justice the social structure of the United States or any other
country cannot stand.</p>
