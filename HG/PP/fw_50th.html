<p align="center"><b><a name="FOREWORD TO THE FIFTIETH ANNIVE"></a>Foreword to the Fiftieth
    Anniversary Edition of <br>
    <em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></b></p>
<p align="center">1929</p>
The fame won by Henry George as writer, economist and philosopher,
has not diminished with the years that have passed since his death in
1897. On the contrary, there has been a steadily broadening
recognition of his intellectual eminence. Significant of this was the
recent Appreciation by <a href="Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html">John Dewey</a>, the famous American educator and
professor of philosophy at Columbia University, which contained these
striking statements:
<blockquote>
  <p>"It would require less than the fingers of the two hands to
    enumerate those who, from Plato down, rank with Henry George among
    the world's social philosophers.... No man, no graduate of a higher
    educational institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated
    man in social thought unless he has some firsthand acquaintance with
    the theoretical contribution of this great American thinker."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this fiftieth year after the first publication of "<em>Progress and
Poverty</em>" it must appear to that growing body of workers for social
justice who in many lands are spreading George's gospel, that there
is at this time as great a need as ever for the comprehension of the
truth he sought to make plain. For, as in 1879, there if, widespread
social unrest in the world. Industrial depression and unemployment
are conditions common to many lands, and even in the nominally
prosperous atmosphere of the United States, vast numbers are
compelled to live in poverty or close to its border line. It would
appear that in the half century since "<em>Progress and Poverty</em>" was
published, there has been little abatement of the social and economic
ills that have afflicted the human family everywhere, and that recur,
with unfailing regularity, in cycles that seem unexplainable except
to the followers of Henry George. And, at a time when world opinion
is demanding that statesmanship shall outlaw war, it is important to
recall that the World Economic Conference, held at Geneva in 1927 at
the call of the League of Nations, found a definite interdependence
of the economic causes of war and industrial depression. It seems
like a vindication of the philosophy of Henry George to find that
this Conference, to which the representatives of fifty nations were
called, unanimously arrived at the conclusion that:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"The main trouble now is neither any material shortage of the
    resources of nature nor any inadequacy in man's power to exploit
    them. It is all, in one form or another, a maladjustment; not an
    insufficient productive capacity, but a series of impediments to the
    full utilization of that capacity. The main obstacles to economic
    revival have been the hindrances opposed to the free flow of labor,
    capital, and goods."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, in effect, is what Henry George maintained fifty years ago,
contrary to the teachings of the accepted political economy.</p>
<p>Greater need than ever exists for a re-examination by mankind of
the remedy for the world's social and economic ills that is involved
in the fundamental proposals of Henry George &#8212; proposals which
Tolstoy declared must ultimately be accepted by the world because
they are so logical and so unanswerable.</p>
<p>Therefore, the trustees of the Robert Schalkenbach Foundation, of
New York, which was formed to bring about a wider acquaintance with
the social and economic philosophy of Henry George, have considered
this an appropriate time to produce from new plates this Fiftieth
Anniversary Edition of "<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>."</p>
