</a><b>Who Was Henry George?</b></p>
<center>
  <p>by Agnes George de Mille</p>
</center>
<p> A hundred years ago a young unknown printer in San Francisco
wrote a book he called <a href="../../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>. He wrote after his daily
working hours, in the only leisure open to him for writing. He had no
real training in political economy. Indeed he had stopped schooling
in the seventh grade in his native Philadelphia, and shipped before
the mast as a cabin boy, making a complete voyage around the world.
Three years later, he was halfway through a second voyage as able
seaman when he left the ship in San Francisco and went to work as a
journeyman printer. After that he took whatever honest job came to
hand. All he knew of economics were the basic rules of <a href="../../themes/Adam_Smith.html">Adam
Smith</a>,
<a href="../../themes/Ricardo.html">David Ricardo</a>, and other economists, and the new philosophies of
Herbert Spencer and <a href="../../themes/Mill.html">John Stuart Mill</a>, much of which he gleaned from
reading in public libraries and from his own painstakingly amassed
library. Marx was yet to be translated into English. </p>
<p> George was endowed for his job. He was curious and he was alertly
attentive to all that went on around him. He had that rarest of all
attributes in the scholar and historian that gift without which all
education is useless. He had mother wit. He read what he needed to
read, and he understood what he read. And he was fortunate; he lived
and worked in a rapidly developing society. George had the unique
opportunity of studying the formation of a civilization -- the change
of an encampment into a thriving metropolis. He saw a city of tents
and mud change into a fine town of paved streets and decent housing,
with tramways and buses. And as he saw the beginning of wealth, he
noted the first appearance of pauperism. He saw degradation forming
as he saw the advent of leisure and affluence, and he felt compelled
to discover why they arose concurrently. </p>
<p> The result of his inquiry, <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, is written
simply, but so beautifully that it has been compared to the very
greatest works of the English language. But George was totally
unknown, and so no one would print his book. He and his friends, also
printers, set the type themselves and ran off an author's edition
which eventually found its way into the hands of a New York
publisher, D. Appleton &amp; Co. An English edition soon followed
which aroused enormous interest. Alfred Russel Wallace, the English
scientist and writer, pronounced it "the most remarkable and
important book of the present century." It was not long before George
was known internationally. </p>
<p> During his lifetime, he became the third most famous man in the
United States, only surpassed in public acclaim by Thomas Edison and
  <a href="../../auth/Twain.html">Mark Twain</a>. George was translated into almost every language that
knew print, and some of the greatest, most influential thinkers of
his time paid tribute. Leo Tolstoy's appreciation stressed the logic
of George's exposition: "The chief weapon against the teaching of
Henry George was that which is always used against irrefutable and
self-evident truths. This method, which is still being applied in
relation to George, was that of hushing up .... People do not argue
with the teaching of George, they simply do not know it." <a href="Dewey_Appreciation_HG.html">John
Dewey</a> fervently stressed the originality of George's work, stating that,
"Henry George is one of a small number of definitely original social
philosophers that the world has produced," and "It would require less
than the fingers of the two hands to enumerate those who, from Plato
down, rank with Henry George among the world's social philosophers."
And <a href="../../themes/Shaw.html">Bernard Shaw</a>, in a letter to my mother, Anna George, years later
wrote, "Your father found me a literary dilettante and militant
rationalist in religion, and a barren rascal at that. By turning my
mind to economics he made a man of me...." </p>
<p> Inevitably he was reviled as well as idolized. The men who
believed in what he advocated called themselves disciples, and they
were in fact nothing less: working to the death, proclaiming,
advocating, haranguing, and proselytizing the idea. But it was not
implemented by blood, as was communism, and so was not forced on
people's attention. Shortly after George's death, it dropped out of
the political field. Once a badge of honor, the title, "<a href="../../themes/Single_Tax.html">Single
Taxer</a>," came into general disuse. Except in Australia and New
Zealand, Taiwan and Hong Kong and scattered cities around the world,
his plan of social action has been neglected while those of Marx,
Keynes, Galbraith and Friedman have won great attention, and Marx's
has been given partial implementation, for a time, at least, in large
areas of the globe. </p>
<p> But nothing that has been tried satisfies. We, the people, the whole people,
  are
locked in a death grapple and nothing our leaders offer, or are
willing to offer, mitigates our troubles. George said, "The people
must think because the people alone can act." </p>
<p> We have reached the deplorable circumstance where in large
measure a very powerful few are in possession of the earth's
resources, the land and its riches and all the franchises and other
privileges that yield a return. These positions are maintained
virtually without taxation; they are immune to the demands made on
others. The very poor, who have nothing, are the object of compulsory
charity. And the rest -- the workers, the middle-class, the backbone
of the country -- are made to support the lot by their labor. They are made to
  pay for the men in possession who are, in effect, their rulers, and for the
  paupers who are denied the opportunity and dignity of earning their own living.
  Forcing one group to pay for all amounts to tyranny.</p>
<p> We are taxed at every point of our lives, on everything we earn,
on everything we save, on much that we inherit, on much that we buy
at every stage of the manufacture and on the final purchase. The
taxes are punishing, crippling, demoralizing. Also they are, to a
great extent, unnecessary. </p>
<p>It was rage at unjust and proliferating taxation that drove the people
  of California to revolt. In June, 1978, they voted overwhelmingly to adopt
  Proposition 13, an amendment to the state constitution which would greatly
  diminish all taxes on real property &#8212; on land, houses, gardens, farms,
  buildings. This was neither a thoughtful nor a searching reform since the improvements
  and the site and all natural resources were lumped together, and income and
  sales tax rates were not separated. Under the so-called reform, the great landholdings
  remained intact and therefore the great profiteering untouched.</p>
<p>The voters believed that there was too much wastage in government, too
  much public welfare, and that they could do very well with a great deal less
  of both. The results so far have not been what was intended. State funds will
  undoubtedly be commandeered to bail out local treasuries and probably the state
  funding of schools, universities, libraries, symphony orchestras, museums and
  archives will be drastically reduced while the bureaucracy and welfare remain
  relatively untouched. But there has been an amount of serious thinking and
  if this change does not work the miracles that people hope (and it won't) at
  least it will cause them to study the problems thoughtfully. The electorate
  is, at long last, beginning to ask questions. In this sense the adventure has
  been of value. </p>
<p> But our system, in which state and federal taxes are interlocked,
is deeply entrenched and hard to correct. Moreover, it survives
because it is based on bewilderment; it is maintained in a manner so
bizarre and intricate that it is impossible for the ordinary citizen
to know what he owes his government except with highly paid help. Contrary to
  basic American law which presupposes innocence until guilt is proven, the government
  now takes for granted that every American citizen is lying and cherating at
  every turn and he must pay an advocate to persuade the duly elected authority
  that he is neither a liar nor cheat. It comes to this: we
support a large section of our government (the Internal Revenue
Service) to prove that we are breaking our own laws. And we support a
large profession (tax lawyers) to protect us from our own employees.
College courses are given to explain the tax forms which would
otherwise be quite unintelligible. </p>
<p>All this is galling and destructive, but it is still, in a
measure, superficial. The great sinister fact, the one that we must
live with, is that we are yielding up sovereignty. The nation is no
longer comprised of the thirteen original states, nor of the
thirty-seven younger sister states, but of the real powers: the
cartels, the corporations. Owning the bulk of our productive
resources, they are the issue of that concentration of ownership that
George saw evolving, and warned against. </p>
<p> These multinationals are not American any more. Transcending
nations, they serve not their country's interests, but their own.
They manipulate our tax policies to help themselves. They determine
our statecraft. They are autonomous. They do not need to coin money
or raise armies. They use ours. </p>
<p> And in opposition rise up the great labor unions. It is war. In the
meantime, the bureaucracy, both federal and local, supported by the
deadly opposing factions, legislate themselves mounting power never
originally intended for our government and exert a ubiquitous
influence which can be, and often is, corrupt. </p>
<p> I do not wish to be misunderstood as falling into the trap of the
socialists and communists who condemn all privately owned business,
all factories, all machinery and organizations for producing wealth.
There is nothing wrong with private corporations owning the means of
producing wealth. Georgists believe in private enterprise, and in its
virtues and incentives to produce at maximum efficiency. It is the
insidious linking together of special privilege, the unjust outright
private ownership of natural or public resources, monopolies,
franchises, that produce unfair domination and autocracy. The means of producing
  wealth differ at the root: some is thieved from the people and some is honestly
  earned. George differentiated;
Marx did not. The consequences of our failure to discern lie at the
heart of our trouble. </p>
<p> This clown civilization is ours. We have achieved it out of the hopeful agrarian
  society that flourished in the eighteenth century, out of a new government
  we had every right to believe was founded on reasonableness, wisdowm and justice.
  We were not compelled to come to this. We knew neither king nor conqueror.
  We chose this of our own free
will, in our own free democracy, with all the means to legislate
intelligently readily at hand. We chose this because we insisted on following
  the worn-out European grooves, because it
  suited a few
people to have us do so. They counted on our mental indolence and we
freely and obediently conformed. We chose not to think. </p>
<p>Our government, alas, was predicated for its effectiveness in expansion on
  free land. Now there is no more free land, and the flaw in the great plan grows
  evident. We have reached the boundaries and we turn back on ourselves and devour.</p>
<p> Henry George was a lucid voice, direct and bold, that pointed out
basic truths, that cut through the confusion which developed like
rot. Each age has known such diseases and each age has gone down for
lack of understanding. It is not valid to say that our times are more
complex than ages past and therefore the solution must be more
complex. The problems are, on the whole, the same. The fact that we
now have electricity and computers does not in any way controvert the
fact that we can succumb to the injustices that toppled Rome. </p>
<p> To avert such a calamity, to eliminate involuntary poverty and
unemployment, and to enable each individual to attain his maximum
potential, George wrote this extraordinary treatise a hundred years
ago. His ideas stand: he who makes should have; he who saves should
enjoy; what the community produces belongs to the community for
communal uses; and God's earth, all of it, is the right of the people
who inhabit the earth. In the words of Thomas Jefferson, "The earth
belongs in <a href="../../themes/Usufruct.html">usufruct</a> to the living." </p>
<p> This is simple and this is unanswerable. The ramifications may
not be simple but they do not alter the fundamental logic. </p>
<p>There never has been a time in our history when we have needed so
sorely to hear good sense, to learn to define terms exactly, to draw
reasonable conclusions. As George said, "The truth that I have tried
to make clear will not find easy acceptance. If that could be, it
would have been accepted long ago. If that could be, it would never
have been obscured." </p>
<p> We are on the brink. It is possible to have another Dark Ages.
But in George there is a voice of hope.</p>
