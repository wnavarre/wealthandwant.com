<CENTER><B>INTRODUCTORY:&nbsp;The Problem</B></CENTER>

<P>The present century has been marked by a prodigious increase in
wealth-producing power. The utilization of steam and electricity, the
introduction of improved processes and labor-saving machinery, the
greater subdivision and grander scale of production, the wonderful
facilitation of exchanges, have multiplied enormously the
effectiveness of labor.</P>

<P>At the beginning of this marvelous era it was natural to expect,
and it was expected, that labor-saving inventions would lighten the
toil and improve the condition of the laborer; that the enormous
increase in the power of producing wealth would make real poverty a
thing of the past.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Could a man of the last century--a Franklin or a
   Priestley--have seen, in a vision of the future, the steamship
   taking the place of the sailing vessel, the railroad train of the
   wagon, the reaping machine of the scythe, the threshing machine of
   the flail;</LI>
   
   <LI>could he have heard the throb of the engines that in obedience
   to human will, and for the satisfaction of human desire, exert a
   power greater than that of all the men and all the beasts of
   burden of the earth combined;</LI>
   
   <LI>could he have seen the forest tree transformed into finished
   lumber--into doors, sashes, blinds, boxes or barrels, with hardly
   the touch of a human hand; the great workshops where boots and
   shoes are turned out by the case with less labor than the
   old-fashioned cobbler could have put on a sole; the factories
   where, under the eye of a girl, cotton becomes cloth faster than
   hundreds of stalwart weavers could have turned it out with their
   hand-looms;</LI>
   
   <LI>could he have seen steam hammers shaping mammoth shafts and
   mighty anchors, and delicate machinery making tiny watches; the
   diamond drill cutting through the heart of the rocks, and coal oil
   sparing the whale;</LI>
   
   <LI>could he have realized the enormous saving of labor resulting
   from improved facilities of exchange and communication--sheep
   killed in Australia eaten fresh in England and the order given by
   the London banker in the afternoon executed in San Francisco in
   the morning of the same day;</LI>
   
   <LI><B><I>could he have conceived of the hundred thousand
   improvements which these only suggest, what would he have inferred
   as to the social condition of mankind?</I></B></LI>
</UL>

<P>It would not have seemed like an inference; further than the
vision went, it would have seemed as though he saw; and his heart
would have leaped and his nerves would have thrilled, as one who from
a height beholds just ahead of the thirst-stricken caravan the living
gleam of rustling woods and the glint of laughing waters. Plainly, in
the sight of the imagination, he would have beheld these new forces
elevating society from its very foundations, lifting the very poorest
above the possibility of want, exempting the very lowest from anxiety
for the material needs of life; he would have seen these slaves of
the lamp of knowledge taking on themselves the traditional curse,
these muscles of iron and sinews of steel making the poorest
laborer's life a holiday, in which every high quality and noble
impulse could have scope to grow.</P>

<P>And out of these bounteous material conditions he would have seen
arising, as necessary sequences, moral conditions realizing the
golden age of which mankind have always dreamed.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Youth no longer stunted and starved;</LI>
   
   <LI>age no longer harried by avarice;</LI>
   
   <LI>the child at play with the tiger;</LI>
   
   <LI>the man with the muck-rake drinking in the glory of the
   stars!</LI>
   
   <LI>Foul things fled, fierce things tame;</LI>
   
   <LI>discord turned to harmony!</LI>
</UL>

<P>For how could there be greed where all had enough? How could the
vice, the crime, the ignorance, the brutality, that spring from
poverty and the fear of poverty, exist where poverty had vanished?
Who should crouch where all were freemen; who oppress where all were
peers?</P>

<P>More or less vague or clear, these have been the hopes, these the
dreams born of the improvements which give this wonderful century its
preeminence. They have sunk so deeply into the popular mind as to
radically change the currents of thought, to recast creeds and
displace the most fundamental conceptions. The haunting visions of
higher possibilities have not merely gathered splendor and vividness,
but their direction has changed--instead of seeing behind the faint
tinges of an expiring sunset, all the glory of the daybreak has
decked the skies before.</P>

<P>It is true that disappointment has followed disappointment, and
that discovery upon discovery, and invention after invention, have
neither lessened the toil of those who most need respite, nor brought
plenty to the poor. But there have been so many things to which it
seemed this failure could be laid, that up to our time the new faith
has hardly weakened. We have better appreciated the difficulties to
be overcome; but not the less trusted that the tendency of the times
was to overcome them.</P>

<P>Now, however, we are coming into collision with facts which there
can be no mistaking. From all parts of the civilized world come
complaints;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>of industrial depression;</LI>
   
   <LI>of labor condemned to involuntary idleness;</LI>
   
   <LI>of capital massed and wasting;</LI>
   
   <LI>of pecuniary distress among business men;</LI>
   
   <LI>of want and suffering and anxiety among the working
   classes.</LI>
</UL>

<P>All the dull, deadening pain, all the keen, maddening anguish,
that to great masses of men are involved in the words "hard times,"
afflict the world today. <B>This state of things, common to
communities differing so widely in situation, in political
institutions, in fiscal and financial systems, in density of
population and in social organization can hardly be accounted for by
local causes.</B></P>

<UL>
   <LI>There is distress where large standing armies are maintained,
   but there is also distress where the standing armies are
   nominal;</LI>
   
   <LI>there is distress where protective tariffs stupidly and
   wastefully hamper trade, but there is also distress where trade is
   nearly free;</LI>
   
   <LI>there is distress where autocratic government yet prevails,
   but there is also distress where political power is wholly in the
   hands of the people;</LI>
   
   <LI>in countries where paper is money, and</LI>
   
   <LI>in countries where gold and silver are the only currency.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Evidently, beneath all such things as these, we must infer a
common cause.</P>

<P><B>That there is a common cause, and that it is either what we
call material progress or something closely connected with material
progress, becomes more than an inference when it is noted that the
phenomena we class together and speak of as industrial depression,
are but intensifications of phenomena which always accompany material
progress, and which show themselves more clearly and strongly as
material progress goes on. </B><I>Where the conditions to which
material progress everywhere tends are most fully realized--that is
to say, where population is densest, wealth greatest, and the
machinery of production and exchange most highly developed--we find
the deepest poverty, the sharpest struggle for existence, and the
most enforced idleness.</I></P>

<P>It is to the newer countries--that is, to the countries where
material progress is yet in its earlier stages--that laborers
emigrate in search of higher wages, and capital flows in search of
higher interest. It is in the older countries--that is to say, the
countries where material progress has reached later stages--that
widespread destitution is found in the midst of the greatest
abundance. Go into one of the new communities where Anglo-Saxon vigor
is just beginning the race of progress;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>where the machinery of production and exchange is yet rude and
   inefficient;</LI>
   
   <LI>where the increment of wealth is not yet great enough to
   enable any class to live in ease and luxury;</LI>
   
   <LI>where the best house is but a cabin of logs or a cloth and
   paper shanty, and the richest man is forced to daily work</LI>
</UL>

<P>and though you will find an absence of wealth and all its
concomitants, you will find no beggars. There is no luxury, but there
is no destitution. No one makes an easy living, nor a very good
living; but every one can make a living, and no one able and willing
to work is oppressed by the fear of want.</P>

<P><B>But just as such a community realizes the conditions which all
civilized communities are striving for, and advances in the scale of
material progress--just as closer settlement and a more intimate
connection with the rest of the world, and greater utilization of
labor-saving machinery, make possible greater economies in production
and exchange, and wealth in consequence increases, not merely in the
aggregate, but in proportion to population--<I>so does poverty take a
darker aspect</I>.</B> Some get an infinitely better and easier
living, but others find it hard to get a living at all.
<A NAME='The "tramp" comes with the loco'></A>The "tramp" comes with
the locomotive, and alms houses and prisons areas surely the marks of
"material progress" as are costly dwellings, rich warehouses, and
magnificent churches. Upon streets lighted with gas and controlled by
uniformed policemen, beggars wait for the passer-by, and in the
shadow of college, and library, and museum, are gathering the more
hideous Huns and fiercer Vandals of whom Macaulay prophesied.</P>

<P><B>This fact--the great fact that poverty and all its concomitants
show themselves in communities just as they develop into the
conditions towards which material progress tends--proves that the
social difficulties existing wherever a certain stage of progress has
been reached, do not arise from local circumstances, but are, in some
way or another, engendered by progress itself.</B></P>

<P>And, unpleasant as it may be to admit it, it is at last becoming
evident that <B>the enormous increase in productive power which has
marked the present century and is still going on with accelerating
ratio, has no tendency to extirpate poverty or to lighten the burdens
of those compelled to toil.</B> It simply widens the gulf between
<A HREF="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/d/i/diveslaz.htm">Dives and
Lazarus</A>, and makes the struggle for existence more intense. The
march of invention has clothed mankind with powers of which a century
ago the boldest imagination could not have dreamed. But</P>

<UL>
   <LI>in factories where labor-saving machinery has reached its most
   wonderful development, little children are at work;</LI>
   
   <LI>wherever the new forces are anything like fully utilized,
   large classes are maintained by charity or live on the verge of
   recourse to it;</LI>
   
   <LI>amid the greatest accumulations of wealth, men die of
   starvation, and puny infant suckle dry breasts;</LI>
   
   <LI>while everywhere the greed of gain, the worship of wealth,
   shows the force of the fear of want.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The promised land flies before us like the mirage. The fruit of
the tree of knowledge turn as we grasp them to apples of Sodom that
crumble at the touch.</P>

<P>It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the
average of comfort, leisure, and refinement has been raised; but
these gains are not general.
<A NAME="In them the lowest class do not"></A>In them the lowest
class do not share.* I do not mean that the condition of the lowest
class has nowhere nor in anything been improved; but that there is
nowhere any improvement which can be credited to increased productive
power. <B>I mean that the tendency of what we call material progress
is in no wise to improve the condition of the lowest class in the
essentials of healthy, happy human life.</B> Nay, more, that it is to
still further depress the condition of the lowest class. <B>The new
forces, elevating in their nature though they be, do not act upon the
social fabric from underneath, as was for a long time hoped and
believed, but strike it at a point intermediate between top and
bottom.</B> It is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not
underneath society, but through society. Those who are above the
point of separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed
down.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;* It is true that the
      poorest may now in certain ways enjoy what the richest a
      century ago could not have commanded, but this does not show
      improvement of condition so long as the ability to obtain the
      necessaries of life is not increased. The beggar in a great
      city may enjoy many things from which the backwoods farmer is
      debarred, but that does not prove the condition of the city
      beggar better than that of the independent farmer.&#93;</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This depressing effect is not generally realized, for it is not
apparent where there has long existed a class just able to live.
Where the lowest class barely lives, as has been the case for a long
time in many parts of Europe, it is impossible for it to get any
lower, for the next lowest step is out of existence, and no tendency
to further depression can readily show itself. <B>But in the progress
of new settlements to the conditions of older communities it may
clearly be seen that material progress does not merely fail to
relieve poverty--it actually produces it. In the United States it is
clear that squalor and misery, and the vices and crimes that spring
from them, everywhere increase as the village grows to the city, and
the march of development brings the advantages of the improved
methods of production and exchange.</B> It is in the older and richer
sections of the Union that pauperism and distress among the working
classes are becoming most painfully apparent. <I>If there is less
deep poverty in San Francisco than in New York, is it not because San
Francisco is yet behind New York in all that both cities are striving
for? When San Francisco reaches the point where New York now is, who
can doubt that there will also be ragged and barefooted children on
her streets?</I></P>

<P><A NAME="This association of poverty wit"></A><B>This association
of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times</B>.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>It is the central fact from which spring industrial, social,
   and political difficulties that perplex the world, and with which
   statesmanship and philanthropy and education grapple in vain.</LI>
   
   <LI>From it come the clouds that overhang the future of the most
   progressive and self-reliant nations.</LI>
   
   <LI>It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our
   civilization, and which not to answer is to be destroyed.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>So long as all the increased wealth which modern progress
brings goes but to build up great fortunes, to increase luxury and
make sharper the contrast between the House of Have and the House of
Want, progress is not real and cannot be permanent.</B> The reaction
must come. The tower leans from its foundations, and every new story
but hastens the final catastrophe. To educate men who must be
condemned to poverty, is but to make them restive; to base on a state
of most glaring social inequality political institutions under which
men are not fully equal, is to stand a pyramid on its apex.</P>

<P>All-important as this question is, pressing itself from every
quarter painfully upon attention, it has not yet received a solution
which accounts for all the facts and points to any clear and simple
remedy. This is shown by the widely varying attempts to account for
the prevailing depression. They exhibit not merely a divergence
between vulgar notions and scientific theories, but also show that
the concurrence which should exist between those who avow the same
general theories breaks up upon practical questions into an anarchy
of opinion.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>Upon high economic authority we have been told that the
   prevailing depression is due to over-consumption;</LI>
   
   <LI>upon equally high authority, that it is due to
   over-production; while</LI>
   
   <LI>the wastes of war,</LI>
   
   <LI>the extension of railroads,</LI>
   
   <LI>the attempts of workmen to keep up wages,</LI>
   
   <LI>the demonetization of silver,</LI>
   
   <LI>the issues of paper money,</LI>
   
   <LI>the increase of labor-saving machinery,</LI>
   
   <LI>the opening of shorter avenues to trade, etc., etc.,</LI>
</UL>

<P>are separately pointed out as the cause, by writers of
reputation.</P>

<P>And while professors thus disagree, the ideas</P>

<UL>
   <LI>that there is a necessary conflict between capital and
   labor,</LI>
   
   <LI>that machinery is an evil,</LI>
   
   <LI>that competition must be restrained and interest
   abolished,</LI>
   
   <LI>that wealth may be created by the issue of money,</LI>
   
   <LI>that it is the duty of government to furnish capital or to
   furnish work,</LI>
</UL>

<P>are rapidly making way among the great body of the people, who
keenly feel a hurt and are sharply conscious of a wrong. Such ideas,
which bring great masses of men, the repositories of ultimate
political power, under the leadership of charlatans and demagogues,
are fraught with danger; but they cannot be successfully combated
until political economy shall give some answer to the great question
which shall be consistent with all her teachings, and which shall
commend itself to the perceptions of the great masses of men.</P>

<P><B>It must be within the province of political economy to give
such an answer</B>. For political economy is not a set of dogmas. It
is the explanation of a certain set of facts. It is the science
which, in the sequence of certain phenomena, seeks to trace mutual
relations and to identify cause and effect, just as the physical
sciences seek to do in other sets of phenomena. It lays its
foundations upon firm ground. <B>The premises from which it makes its
deductions are truths which have the highest sanction; axioms which
we all recognize; upon which we safely base the reasoning and actions
of every-day life, and which may be reduced to the metaphysical
expression of the physical law that motion seeks the line of least
resistance--<I>viz</I>., </B><FONT COLOR="#FF6600"><B><I>that men
seek to gratify their desires with the least
exertion</I></B></FONT><B>.</B> Proceeding from a basis thus assured,
its processes, which consist simply in identification and separation,
have the same certainty. In this sense it is as exact a science as
geometry, which, from similar truths relative to space, obtains its
conclusions by similar means, and its conclusions when valid should
be as self-apparent. And although in the domain of political economy
we cannot test our theories by artificially produced combinations or
conditions, as may be done in some of the other sciences, yet we can
apply tests no less conclusive, by comparing societies in which
different conditions exist, or by, in imagination, separating,
combining, adding or eliminating forces or factors of known
direction.</P>

<P>I propose in the following pages to attempt to solve by the
methods of political economy the great problem I have outlined. <B>I
propose to seek the law which associates poverty with progress, and
increases want with advancing wealth; and I believe that in the
explanation of this paradox we shall find the explanation of those
recurring seasons of industrial and commercial paralysis which,
viewed independent of their relations to more general phenomena, seem
so inexplicable.</B> Properly commenced and carefully pursued, such
an investigation must yield a conclusion that will stand every test,
and as truth will correlate with all other truth. For in the sequence
of phenomena there is no accident. Every effect has a cause, and
every fact implies a preceding fact.</P>

<P>That political economy, as at present taught, does not explain the
persistence of poverty amid advancing wealth in a manner which
accords with the deep-seated perceptions of men;</P>

<UL>
   <LI>that the unquestionable truths which it does teach are
   unrelated and disjointed;</LI>
   
   <LI>that it has failed to make the progress in popular thought
   that truth, even when unpleasant, must make;</LI>
   
   <LI>that, on the contrary, after a century of cultivation, during
   which it has engrossed the attention some of the most subtle and
   powerful intellects, it should be spurned by the statesman,
   scouted by the masses, relegated in the opinion of many educated
   and thinking men to the rank of a pseudo-science in which nothing
   fixed or can be fixed--must, it seems to me, be due not to any
   inability of the science when properly pursued, but some false
   step in its premises, or overlooked factor in its estimates. And
   as such mistakes are generally concealed the respect paid to
   authority, I propose in this inquiry take nothing for granted, but
   to bring even accepted theories to the test of first principles,
   and should they not stand the test, to freshly interrogate facts
   in the endeavor to discover their law.</LI>
</UL>

<P>I propose to beg no question, to shrink from no conclusion, but to
follow truth wherever it may lead. Upon us the responsibility of
seeking the law, for in the very heart of our civilization today
women faint and little children moan. But what that law may prove to
be is not our affair. <B>If the conclusions that we reach run counter
to our prejudices, let us not flinch; if they challenge institutions
that have long been deemed wise and natural, let us not turn
back.</B></P>
