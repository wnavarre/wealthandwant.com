<p><a name="HOW THE BOOK CAME TO BE WRITTEN"></a><b>HOW THE BOOK CAME
TO BE WRITTEN</b></p>
<blockquote><i>In the Introduction to the Twenty-fifth Anniversary
Edition, Henry George, Jr. told interestingly, as follows, how "</i><b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b><i>" came to be written:</i></blockquote>
<p>Out of the open West came a young man of less than thirty to this
great city of New York. He was small of stature and slight of build.
His alma mater had been the forecastle and the printing-office. He
was poor, unheralded, unknown. He came from a small city rising at
the western golden portals of the country to set up here, for a
struggling little newspaper there, a telegraphic news bureau, despite
the opposition of the combined powerful press and telegraph
monopolies. The struggle was too unequal. The young man was overborne
by the monopolies and his little paper crushed.</p>
<p>This man was Henry George and the time was 1869.</p>
<p>But though defeated, Henry George was not vanquished. Out of this
struggle had come a thing that was to grow and grow until it should
fill the minds and hearts of multitudes and be as "an army with
banners."</p>
<p>For in the intervals of rest from his newspaper struggle in this
city the young correspondent had musingly walked the streets. As he
walked he was filled with wonder at the manifestations of vast
wealth. Here, as nowhere that he had dreamed of, were private
fortunes that rivaled the riches of the fabled Monte Cristo. But
here, also, side by side with the palaces of the princely rich, was
to be seen a poverty and degradation, a want and shame, such as made
the young man from the open West sick at heart.</p>
<p><b><i>Why in a land so bountifully blest, with enough and more
than enough for all, should there be such inequality of conditions?
Such heaped wealth interlocked with such deep and debasing want? Why,
amid such superabundance, should strong men vainly look for work? Why
should women faint with hunger, and little children spend the morning
of life in the treadmill of toil?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Was this intended in the order of things? No, he could not
believe it. And suddenly there came to him there in daylight, in the
city street - a burning thought, a call, a vision. Every nerve
quivered. And he made a vow that he would never rest until he had
found the cause of, and, if he could, the remedy for, this deepening
poverty amid advancing wealth.</i></b></p>
<p>Returning to San Francisco soon after his telegraphic news
failure, and keeping his vow nurtured in his heart, <b>Henry George
perceived that land speculation locked up vast territories against
labor.</b> Everywhere he perceived an effort to "corner" land; an
effort to get it and to hold it, not for use, but for a "rise."
Everywhere he perceived that this caused all who wished to use it to
compete with each other for it; and he foresaw that as population
grew the keener that competition would become. Those who had a
monopoly of the land would practically own those who had to use the
land.</p>
<p>Filled with these ideas, Henry George in 1871 sat down and in the
course of four months wrote a little book under title of "<b><i>Our
Land and Land Policy</i></b>." In that small volume of forty-eight
pages he advocated the destruction of land monopoly by shifting all
taxes from labor and the products of labor and concentrating their in
one tax on the value of land, regardless of improvements. A thousand
copies of this small book were printed, but the author quickly
perceived that really to command attention, the work would have to be
done more thoroughly.</p>
<p>That more thorough work came something more than six years later.
In August, 1877, the writing of "<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>"
was begun. It was the oak that grew out of the acorn of "<b><i>Our
Land and Land Policy</i></b>." The larger book became "an inquiry
into industrial depressions and of increase of want with increase of
wealth," and pointed out the remedy.</p>
<p>The book was finished after a year and seven months of intense
labor, and the undergoing of privations that caused the family to do
without a parlor carpet, and which frequently forced the author to
pawn his personal effects.</p>
<p>And when the last page was written, in the dead of night, when he
was entirely alone, Henry George flung himself upon his knees and
wept like a child. He had kept his vow. The rest was in the Master's
hands.</p>
<p>Then the manuscript was sent to New York to find a publisher. Some
of the publishers there thought it visionary; some, revolutionary.
Most of them thought it unsafe, and all thought that it would not
sell, or at least sufficiently to repay the outlay. Works on
political economy even by men of renown were notoriously not money -
makers. What hope then for a work of this nature from an obscure man
- unknown, and without prestige of any kind? At length, however, D.
Appleton &amp; Co. said they would publish it if the author would
bear the main cost, that of making the plates. There was nothing else
for it, and so in order that the plate - making should be done under
his own direction Henry George had the type set in a friend's
printing-office in San Francisco, the author of the book setting the
first two stickfuls himself.</p>
<p>Before the plates, made from this type, were shipped East, they
were put upon a printing-press and an "Author's Proof Edition" of
five hundred copies was struck off. One of these copies Henry George
sent to his venerable father in Philadelphia, eighty-one years old.
At the same time the son wrote:</p>
<blockquote>It is with deep feeling of gratitude to Our Father in
Heaven that I send you a printed copy of this book. I am grateful that
I have been enabled to live to write it, and that you have been enabled
to live to see it. It represents a great deal of work and a good deal
of sacrifice, but now it is done. It will not be recognized at first -
maybe not for some time - but it will ultimately be considered a great
book, will be published in both hemispheres, and be translated into
different languages. This I know, though neither of us may ever see it
here. But the belief that I have expressed in this book - the belief
that there is yet another life, for us - makes that of little moment.</blockquote>
<p>The prophecy of recognition of the book's greatness was fulfilled
very quickly. The Appletons in New York brought out the first regular
market edition in January, 1880, just twenty-five years ago. Certain
of the San Francisco newspapers derided book and author as the
"hobby"&nbsp;of "little Harry George," and predicted that the work
would never be heard of. But the press elsewhere in the country and
abroad, from the old "Thunderer" in London down, and the great
periodical publications, headed by the "Edinburgh Review," hailed it
as a remarkable book that could not be lightly brushed aside. In the
United States and Engliand it was put into cheap paper editions, and
in that form outsold most popular novels of the day. In both
countries, too, it ran serially in the columns of newspapers. Into
all the chief tongues of Europe it was translated, there being three
translations into German. Probably no exact statement of the book's
extent of publication can be made; but a conservative estimate is
that, embracing all forms and languages, more than two million copies
of "Progress and Poverty" have been printed to day; and that
including with these the other books that have followed from Henry
George's pen, and which might be called&nbsp;"The Progress and
Poverty Literature," perhaps five million copies have been given to
the world.</p>
