<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">An
Appreciation of Henry George</span><br>
John Dewey<br>
October 1927<br>
Introduction to <br>"<em>Significant Paragraphs from Progress &amp; Poverty</em>"<br>
</div>
<br>
It was a happy thought of Professor Brown to select and arrange
passages from Henry George's immortal work that give the gist of his
contribution to political economy and social philosophy, while the
pages which follow show that the task has been executed with a skill
equal to the idea. The fact that Henry George has an ardent group of
disciples who have a practical program for reform of taxation has
tended to obscure from the recognition of students of social theory
that his is one of the great names among the world's social
philosophers.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> It would require less
than the fingers of the two hands to enumerate those who from Plato
down rank with him</span>. Were he a native of some European country,
it is safe to assert that he would long ago have taken the place upon
the roll of the world's thinkers which belongs to him, irrespective,
moreover, of adherence to his practical plan. But for some reason we
Americans are slow to perceive and celebrate intellectual claims in
comparison with the merits of inventors, political leaders and great
industrialists. In the case of the author of "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>" the failure
has doubtless been accentuated in academic circles by the fact that
Henry George thought, wrote, and worked outside of them. And in the
world at large, in spite of the fact that no works on political economy
have had the circulation and reading obtained by his writings,
discussion of the practical merits of his plan of reform of taxation
has actually tended to blur his outstanding position as a thinker. This
has been the case because the enormous inertia of social habit and the
force of tremendous vested interests have depreciated his intellectual
claims in order to strengthen opposition to his practical measures.<br>
<br>
I do not say these things in order to vaunt his place as a thinker in
contrast with the merits of his proposals for a change in methods of
distributing the burdens of taxation. To my mind the two things go
together. His clear intellectual insight into social conditions, his
passionate feeling for the remediable ills from which humanity suffers,
find their logical conclusion in his plan for liberating labor and
capital from the shackles which now bind them. But I am especially
concerned in connection with Professor Brown's clear and well-ordered
summary, to point out the claims which his social theory has upon the
attention of students<span style="font-weight: bold;">. No man, no
graduate of a higher educational institution, has a right to regard
himself as an educated man in social thought unless he has some
first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical contribution of this great
American thinker.</span><br>
<br>
This is not the time and place, nor is there need, to dwell upon the
nature of this contribution. Henry George is as clear as he is
eloquent. But I cannot refrain from pointing out one feature of his
thought which is too often ignored &#8212; his emphasis upon ideal factors of
life, upon what are sometimes called the imponderables. It is a poor
version of his ideas which insists only upon the material effect of
increase of population in producing the material or monetary increment
in the value of land. One has only to read the third section of these
extracts to note that Henry George puts even greater stress upon the
fact that <span style="font-weight: bold;">community life increases
land value because it opens "a wider, fuller, and more varied life," so
that the desire to share in the higher values which the community
brings with it is a decisive factor in raising the rental value of land.</span>
And it is because the present system not only depresses the material
status of the mass of the population, but especially because it renders
one-sided and inequitable the people's share in these higher values
that we find in "Progress and Poverty" the analysis of the scientist
combined with the sympathies and aspirations of a great lover of
mankind. There have been economists of great repute who in their
pretension to be scientific have ignored the most significant elements
in human nature. There have been others who were emotionally stirred by
social ills and who proposed glowing schemes of betterment, but who
passed lightly over facts. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is the
thorough fusion of insight into actual facts and forces, with
recognition of their bearing upon what makes human life worth living,
that constitutes Henry George one of the world's great social
philosophers.</span><br>
