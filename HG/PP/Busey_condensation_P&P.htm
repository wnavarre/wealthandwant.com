<p><font size="-1"><strong>FROM THE EDITOR'S FOREWORD<a name="Fwd"></a></strong></font></p>
<p>The first appearance of <a href="../../George_P&P.html"><em>Progress and Poverty</em></a> in January of 1880, created a
  tremendous commotion. Journals throughout the world were thrown into a furor
  of praise and criticism. The name of Henry George, stirring writer from San
  Francisco, became a byword in the discussion of economic and social problems
  and particularly of the problem of poverty in the midst of plenty.</p>
<p>In the latter half of the twentieth century, destitution amidst abundance
  should long ago have passed into history. It is a tragic, perverse phenomenon
  that should have taken its place with other barbaric practices, such as slavery
  and piracy.</p>
<p>An understanding of the proposals of Henry George can reveal whether or not
  they might be useful for alleviating poverty and increasing the returns of
  labor and capital. ...</p>
<p>To provide a readable and constructive introduction to and understanding
  of Henry George, I have produced this little supercondensed version of <em>Progress
  and Poverty</em>. The words are exclusively his. The phrases are presented in the
  same order that he wrote them. Of course, expressions have been thrown together
  which in the original volume were separate by many pages or chapters. For this
  rather drastic abridgement, I alone am responsible.</p>

  PROGRESS AND POVERTY<br>
  - condensed -</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM <a name="Problem"></a></strong></p>
<p>The present century has been marked by a prodigious increase in wealth-producing
  power. ...</p>
<p>At the beginning of this marvelous era it was natural to expect, and it was
  expected, that laborsaving inventions would lighten the toil and improve the
  conditions of the laborer; that the enormous increase in the power of producing
  wealth would make real poverty a thing of the past. ...</p>
<p>Now, however, we are coming into collision with facts which there can be no
  mistaking. ...</p>
<p>In the United States it is clear that squalor and misery, and the vices and
  crimes that spring from them, everywhere increase as the village grows to the
  city, and the march of development brings the advantages of the improved methods
  of production and exchange. ...</p>
<p>This association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times.
  It is the central fact from which spring industrial, social, and political
  difficulties that perplex the world, and with which statesmanship and philanthropy
  and education grapple in vain. ...</p>
<p>It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our civilization and which
  not to answer is to be destroyed. ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE LAWS OF DISTRIBUTION<a name="LawsDist"></a></strong></p>
<p>Land, labor, and capital are the factors of production. The term land includes
  all natural opportunities or forces; the term labor, all human exertion; and
  the term capital, all wealth used to produce more wealth. In returns to these
  three factors is the whole produce distributed. That part which goes to landowners
  is called rent; that part which constitutes the reward of human exertion is
  cal!ed wages; and the part which constitutes the return for the use of capital
  is called interest. These terms mutually exclude each other. The income of
  any individual may be made up from any one, two, or all three of those sources;
  but in the effort to discover the laws of distribution we must keep them separate. ... The law, or relation, which . ... determines what rent or price can
  be got by the owner, is styled the law of rent. ... This accepted law of
  rent . . . is sometimes styled &#8220;Ricardo&#8217;s law of rent.&quot; .
  . . It is:</p>
<p> The rent of land is determined by the excess of its produce over that which
  the same application can secure from the least productive land in use.</p>
<p>This law. . . of course applies to land used for other purposes than agriculture
  . . . in truth, manufactures and exchange yield the highest rents, as is evinced
  by the greater value of land in manufacturing and commercial cities. ...</p>
<p>The increase of rent which goes on in progressive countries is at once seen
  to be the key which explains why wages and interest fail to increase with increase
  of productive power. For the wealth produced in every community is divided
  into two parts by what may be called the rent line, which is fixed by the margin
  of cultivation, or the return which labor and capital could obtain from such
  natural opportunities as are free to them without the payment of rent.</p>
<p>From the part of the produce below this line wages and interest must be paid.
  All that is above goes to the owners of land. Thus, where the value of land
  is low, there may be a small production of wealth, and yet a high rate of wages
  and interest, as we see in new countries. And, where the value of land is high,
  here may be a very large production of wealth, and yet a low rate of wages
  and interest, as we see in old countries. ...</p>
<p>The increase of rent explains why wages and interest do not increase. The
  cause which gives to the landholder is the cause which denies to the laborer
  and capitalist. Hence, the rate of wages and interest is everywhere fixed,
  not so much by the productiveness of labor as by the value of land. Wherever
  the value of land is relatively low, wages and interest are relatively high;
  wherever land is relatively high, wages and interest are relatively low. ... And hence, that the increase of productive power does not increase wages,
  is because it does increase the value of land. Rent swallows up the whole gain
  and pauperism accompanies progress. ...</p>
<p>To see human beings in the most abject, the most helpless and hopeless condition,
  you must go, not to the unfenced prairies and the log cabins of new clearings
  in the backwoods, where man singlehanded is commencing the struggle with nature,
  and land is yet worth nothing, but to the great cities, where the ownership
  of a little patch of ground is a fortune. ...</p>
<p><strong>EFFECT<a name="EFFECT"></a> OF MATERIAL PROGRESS UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH</strong></p>
<p>Wealth in all its forms being the product of labor applied to land or the
  products of land, any increase in the power of labor, the demand for wealth
  being unsatisfied, will be utilized in procuring more wealth, and thus increase
  the demand for land. ...</p>
<p>And as we can assign no limits to the progress of invention, neither can we
  assign any limits to the increase of rent, short of the whole produce. For,
  if laborsaving inventions went on until perfection was attained, and the necessity
  of labor in the production of wealth was entirely done away with, then everything
  that the earth could yield could be obtained without labor. And no matter how
  small population might be, if anybody but the landowners continued to exist,
  it would be at the whim or by the mercy of the landowners&#8212;they would
  be maintained either for the amusement of the landowners, or, as paupers, by
  their bounty. This point, of the absolute perfection of laborsaving inventions,
  may seem very remote, if not impossible of attainment; but it is a point toward
  which the march of invention is every day more strongly tending.</p>
<p>... in the improvements which advance rent are not only to be included the
  improvements which directly increase productive power, but also such improvements
  in government, manners, and morals as indirectly increase it. Considered as
  material forces, the effect of all these is to increase productive power, and
  like improvements in the productive arts, their benefit is ultimately monopolized
  by the possessors of the land. ... And if the corrupt governments of our
  great American cities were to be made models of purity and economy, the effect
  would simply be to increase the value of land, not to raise either wages or
  interest. ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM SOLVED<a name="Solved"></a></strong></p>
<p>The reason why, in spite of the increase of productive power, wages constantly
  tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living, is that with increase
  in productive power, rent tends to even greater increase, thus producing a
  constant tendency to the forcing down of wages. ...</p>
<p>The mere laborer has thus no more interest in the general advance of productive
  power than the Cuban slave has in advance of the price of sugar. ...</p>
<p>The simple theory which I have outlined ... explains this conjunction of
  poverty with wealth, of low wages with high productive power. ...</p>
<p>It explains why interest and wages are higher in new than in older communities,
  though the average, as well as the aggregate, production of wealth is less.
  It explains why improvements which increase the productive power of labor and
  capital increase the reward of neither.</p>
<p>It explains what is commonly called the conflict between labor and capital,
  while proving the real harmony of interest between them. ...</p>
<p>Is it not a notorious fact, known to the most ignorant, that new countries,
  where the aggregate wealth is small, but where land is cheap, are always better
  countries for the laboring classes than the rich countries, where land is dear?
  Wherever you find land relatively low, will you not find wages relatively high?
  And wherever land is high, will you not find wages low? As land increases in
  value, poverty deepens and pauperism appears. In the new settlements, where
  land is cheap, you will find no beggars, and the inequalities in condition
  are very slight. In the great cities, where land is so valuable that it is
  measured by the foot, you will find the extremes of poverty and of luxury.
  And this disparity in condition between the two extremes of the social scale
  may always be measured by the price of land.</p>
<p>Land in New York is more valuable than in San Francisco; and in New York,
  the San Franciscan may see squalor and misery that will make him stand aghast.
  Land is more valuable in London than in New York; and in London, there is squalor
  and destitution worse than that of New York. ...</p>
<p>For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must draw
  for all his needs. ... Material progress cannot rid us of our dependence
  upon land; it can but add to the power of producing wealth from land; and hence,
  when land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity without increasing wages
  or improving the condition of those who have but their labor. It can but add
  to the value of land and the power which its possession gives. Everywhere,
  in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is the base of aristocracy,
  the foundation of great fortunes, the source of power. As said the Brahmins,
  ages ago&#8212;</p>
<p> &#8220;To whomsoever the soil at any time belongs, to him belong the fruits
  of it. White parasols and elephants mad with pride are the flowers of a grant
  of land.&#8221; . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE REMEDY<a name="Remedy"></a></strong></p>
<p>The equal right of all men to the use of land is as clear as their equal right
  to breathe the air&#8212;it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their existence.
  For we cannot suppose that some men have a right to be in this world and others
  no right ...</p>
<p>... any one human being, could he concentrate in himself the individual
  rights to the land of any country, could expel therefrom all the rest of its
  inhabitants; and could he thus concentrate the individual rights to the whole
  surface of the globe, he alone of all the teeming population of the earth would
  have the right to live.</p>
<p>And what upon this supposition would occur is, upon a smaller scale, realized
  in actual fact. ... The comparative handful of proprietors who own the surface
  of the British Islands would be doing only what English law gives them full
  power to do, and what many of them have done on a smaller scale already, were
  they to exclude the millions of British people from their native islands. And
  such an exclusion ... would not be a whit more repugnant to natural right
  than the spectacle now presented, of the vast body of the British people being
  compelled to pay such enormous sums to a few of their number for the privilege
  of being permitted to live upon and use the land which they so fondly call
  their own; which is endeared to them by memories so tender and so glorious,
  and for which they are held in duty bound, if need be, to spill their blood
  and lay down their lives. ...</p>
<p>Place one hundred men on an island from which there is no escape, and whether
  you make one of these men the absolute owner of the other ninety-nine, or the
  absolute owner of the soil of the island, will make no difference either to
  him or to them. It was not nobility that gave land, but the possession of land
  that gave nobility. ...</p>
<p>What I ... propose, as the simple yet sovereign remedy, which will raise
  wages, increase the earnings of capital ... give remunerative employment
  to whoever wishes it ... is &#8212; to appropriate rent by taxation.</p>
<p>Now, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily be
  increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition into practical
  form by proposing &#8212;</p>
<p> To abolish all taxation save that upon land values. ...</p>
<p>Taxation which lessens the reward of the producer necessarily lessens the
  incentive to production. ... Thus taxation which diminishes the earnings
  of the laborer or the returns of the capitalist tends to render the one less
  industrious and intelligent, the other less disposed to save and invest. Taxation
  which falls upon the processes of production interposes an artificial obstacle
  to the creation of wealth. ...</p>
<p>Tax manufactures, and the effect is to check manufacturing; tax improvements,
  and the effect is to lessen improvement; tax commerce, and the effect is to
  prevent exchange; tax capital, and the effect is to drive it away. But the
  whole value of land may be taken in taxation, and the only effect will be to
  stimulate industry, to open new opportunities to capital, and to increase the
  production of wealth. ...</p>
<p>The tax on land values ... may be assessed and collected with a definiteness
  that partakes of the immovable and unconcealable character of the land itself.
  ... Were all taxes placed upon land values, irrespective of improvements, the
  scheme of taxation would be so simple and clear, and public attention would
  be so directed to it, that the valuation of taxation could and would be made
  with the same certainty that a real estate agent can determine the price a
  seller can get for a lot. ...</p>
<p>The tax upon land values ... falls only upon those who receive from society
  a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit
  they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community,
  of that value which is the creation of the community. ... When all rent is
  taken by taxation for the needs of the community ... no citizen will have
  an advantage over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill,
  and intelligence; and each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not
  till then, will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural return.
  ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EFFECTS<a name="EFFECTS"></a> OF THE REMEDY</strong></p>
<p>The advantages which would be gained by substituting for the numerous taxes
  by which the public revenues are now raised, a single tax levied upon the value
  of land, will appear more and more important the more they are considered. ... With all the burdens removed which now oppress industry and hamper exchange,
  the production of wealth would go on with a rapidity now undreamed of. ...</p>
<p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
<p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
  of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
  an immense weight from a powerful spring. ... The present method of taxation
  ... operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine
  upon those qualities. ... If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity,
  as though he had done an injury to the state; if a railroad be opened, down
  comes the tax collector upon it, as though it were a public nuisance; if a
  manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would go far toward
  making a handsome profit. We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate
  it, or bring it among us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him
  a privilege. We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
  grain, we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp. ...</p>
<p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
  from productive industry. ...</p>
<p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
  or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
  of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
  one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
  would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
<p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its death
  blow; land monopolization would no longer pay. ...</p>
<p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
  land, but to all land. ... Everywhere that land had attained a value, taxation,
  instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement, would operate to
  force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a field, or built a
  house, or built a manufactory, no matter how costly, would have no more to
  pay in taxes than if he kept so much land idle. The monopolist of agricultural
  land would be taxed as much as though his land were covered with houses and
  barns, with crops and with stock. The owner of a vacant city lot would have
  to pay as much for the privilege of keeping other people off of it until he
  wanted to use it, as his neighbor who has a fine house upon his lot. It would
  cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable land as though
  it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great warehouses filled with
  costly goods. ...</p>
<p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition would
  no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with each other
  for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point of
  bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers, and
  wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. ... The employers of labor
  would not have merely to bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus
  of greater trade and increased profits, but against the ability of laborers
  to become their own employers upon the natural opportunities freely opened
  to them by the tax which prevented monopolization. ...</p>
<p>It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
  all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head and it is likewise
  manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose incomes are drawn
  from the earnings of capital, or from investments other than in lands. ...</p>
<p>And so with the farmer. I speak not now of the farmers who never touch the
  handles of a plow ... but of the working farmers who constitute such a large
  class in the United States. ... Paradoxical as it may appear to these men
  until they understand the full bearings of the proposition, of all classes
  above that of the mere laborer they have most to gain by placing all taxes
  upon the value of land. ... The fact is that taxation, as now levied, falls
  on them with peculiar severity. They are taxed on all their improvements &#8212; houses,
  barns, fences, crops, stock. The personal property which they have cannot be
  as readily concealed or undervalued as can the more valuable kinds which are
  concentrated in the cities. They are not only taxed on personal property and
  improvements, which the owners of unused land escape, but their land is generally
  taxed at a higher rate than land held on speculation, simply because it is
  improved. But further than this, all taxes imposed on commodities fall on the
  farmer without mitigation. ... The farmer would be a gainer by the substitution
  of a single tax upon the value of land for all these taxes, for the taxation
  of land values would fall with greatest weight, not upon the agricultural districts,
  where land values are comparatively small, but upon the towns and cities where
  land values are high; whereas taxes upon personal property and improvements
  fall as heavily in the country as in the city. ... The result would be that
  speculative values would be kept down, and that cultivated and improved farms
  would have no taxes to pay until the country around them had been well settled.
  In fact, paradoxical as it may at first seem to them, the effect of putting
  all taxation upon the value of land would be to relieve the harder working
  farmers of all taxation. ...</p>
<p>Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
  I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
  would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
  powers and different desires.</p>
<p>But I mean that wealth would be distributed in accordance with the degree
  in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence of each contributed to
  the common stock. ... The non-producer would no longer roll in luxury while
  the producer got but the barest necessities of animal existence. ...</p>
<p>All fear of great fortunes might be dismissed, for when every one gets what
  he fairly earns, no one can get more than he fairly earns. How many men are
  there who fairly earn a million dollars? ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE LAW<a name="LAW"></a> OF HUMAN PROGRESS</strong></p>
<p>Civilization is co-operation. Union and liberty are its factors. ...</p>
<p>What has destroyed every previous civilization has been the tendency to the
  unequal distribution of wealth and power. This same tendency, operating with
  increasing force, is observable in our civilization today. ...</p>
<p>As corruption becomes chronic; as public spirit is lost; as traditions of
  honor, virtue, and patriotism: are weakened; as law is brought into contempt
  and reforms become hopeless; then in the festering mass will be generated volcanic
  forces, which shatter and rend when seeming accident gives them vent. Strong,
  unscrupulous men, rising up upon occasion, will become the exponents of blind
  popular desires or fierce popular passions, and dash aside forms that have
  lost their vitality. The sword will again be mightier than the pen, and in
  carnivals of destruction brute force and wild frenzy will alternate with the
  lethargy of a declining civilization. ...</p>
<p>Whence shall come the new barbarians? Go through the squalid quarters of great
  cities, and you may see, even now, their gathering hordes! How shall learning
  perish? Men will cease to read, and books will kindle fires and be turned into
  cartridges! ...</p>
<p>... in the decline of civilization, communities do not go down by the same
  paths that they came up. For instance, the decline of civilization as manifested
  in government would not take us back from republicanism to constitutional monarchy,
  and thence to the feudal system; it would take us to imperatorship and anarchy.
  ...</p>
<p>Where Liberty rises, there virtue grows, wealth increases, knowledge expands,
  invention multiplies human powers, and in strength and spirit the freer nation
  rises among her neighbors ... Where Liberty sinks, there virtue fades, wealth
  diminishes, knowledge is forgotten, invention ceases, and empires once mighty
  in arms and arts become a helpless prey to freer barbarians!</p>
<p>Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
  among men, but all progress hath she called forth. ...</p>
<p>Shall we not trust her?</p>
<p>In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
  inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
  calls to us again. ... It is not enough that men should vote; it is not enough
  that they should be theoretically equal before the law. They must have liberty
  to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of life; they must stand
  on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature ... This is the universal
  law. This is the lesson of the centuries. Unless its foundations be laid in
  justice the social structure cannot stand. ...</p>
