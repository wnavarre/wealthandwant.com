  <p><b>Harry Gunnison Brown's Preface <a name="Pref"></a><br>
    </b>to Brown's abridgement (&quot;Significant Paragraphs&quot;) <br>
    of Henry George's book, <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b></p>
</center>
<p>Probably no other writer has ever made the study of economics so interesting
  to so many readers as has Henry George. And now, when more and more economists
  of national and international reputation are coming to endorse the main idea
  for which Henry George stood, it is almost preposterous, as well as unfair
  to students of economics, that they should be assigned no reading on this idea
  other than the inadequate account of it and the superficial' adverse criticism
  which are all that some of the most widely used current texts in economics &#8212; and
  even in public finance &#8212; contain.</p>
<p>But there has been a real difficulty even for instructors most anxious that
  their students should have the case for bare-land-value taxation fairly presented
  to them. The complete <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/ppintro.html">Progress and Poverty</a></em> from which these selections
  are made would take more time than most teachers might wish to devote to a
  single topic in economics, whatever its importance.</p>
<p>The paragraphs here printed have been selected so as to present in brief compass
  the essentials of Henry George's argument in his own eloquent and inimitable
  style. Only such slight textual changes have been made as seemed necessary
  to preserve continuity. In almost any course in economics can be found space
  for the few assignments necessary to cover these selected paragraphs, and any
  class can be asked to meet the trifling incident expense. Thus might be given
  a new zest and renewed enthusiasm to the students whose sometimes waning interest
  in the categories and laws of economics is a recurrent discouragement to their
  instructors.</p>
<p>It is hoped, too, that many who are not in school or college, but who should
  know and really desire to know something of the economic philosophy of Henry
  George, will spare for that purpose the very few hours necessary to read this
  little book.</p>

  Introduction to <br>
"
  <em>Significant Paragraphs from Progress &amp; Poverty</em>"<br>
</div>
<br>
It was a happy thought of Professor Brown to select and arrange passages from
Henry George's immortal work that give the gist of his contribution to political
economy and social philosophy, while the pages which follow show that the task
has been executed with a skill equal to the idea. The fact that Henry George
has an ardent group of disciples who have a practical program for reform of taxation
has tended to obscure from the recognition of students of social theory that
his is one of the great names among the world's social
philosophers. It would require less than the
fingers of the two hands to enumerate those who from Plato
down rank with him. Were he a native of some European country, it is safe
to assert that he would long ago have taken the place upon the roll of the world's
thinkers which belongs to him, irrespective, moreover, of adherence to his practical
plan. But for some reason we Americans are slow to perceive and celebrate intellectual
claims in comparison with the merits of inventors, political leaders and great
industrialists. In the case of the author of "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>" the failure has doubtless
been accentuated in academic circles by the fact that Henry George thought, wrote,
and worked outside of them. And in the world at large, in spite of the fact that
no works on political economy have had the circulation and reading obtained by
his writings, discussion of the practical merits of his plan of reform of taxation
has actually tended to blur his outstanding position as a thinker. This has been
the case because the enormous inertia of social habit and the force of tremendous
vested interests have depreciated his intellectual claims in order to strengthen
opposition to his practical measures.<br>
<br>
I do not say these things in order to vaunt his place as a thinker in contrast
with the merits of his proposals for a change in methods of distributing the
burdens of taxation. To my mind the two things go together. His clear intellectual
insight into social conditions, his passionate feeling for the remediable ills
from which humanity suffers, find their logical conclusion in his plan for liberating
labor and capital from the shackles which now bind them. But I am especially
concerned in connection with Professor Brown's clear and well-ordered summary,
to point out the claims which his social theory has upon the
attention of students. No man, no graduate of
a higher educational institution, has a right to regard himself as an educated
man in social thought unless he has some first-hand acquaintance with the theoretical
contribution of this great
American thinker.<br>
<br>
This is not the time and place, nor is there need, to dwell upon the nature of
this contribution. Henry George is as clear as he is eloquent. But I cannot refrain
from pointing out one feature of his
thought which is too often ignored &#8212; his emphasis upon ideal factors of
life, upon what are sometimes called the imponderables. It is a poor version
of his ideas which insists only upon the material effect of increase of population
in producing the material or monetary increment in the value of land. One has
only to read the third section of these extracts to note that Henry George puts
even greater stress upon the
fact that community life increases land value
because it opens "a wider, fuller, and more varied life," so that the desire
to share in the higher values which the community brings with it is a decisive
factor in raising the rental value of land. And it is because the present
system not only depresses the material status of the mass of the population,
but especially because it renders one-sided and inequitable the people's share
in these higher values
that we find in "Progress and Poverty" the analysis of the scientist combined
with the sympathies and aspirations of a great lover of mankind. There have been
economists of great repute who in their pretension to be scientific have ignored
the most significant elements in human nature. There have been others who were
emotionally stirred by social ills and who proposed glowing schemes of betterment,
but who
passed lightly over facts. It is the thorough
fusion of insight into actual facts and forces, with recognition of their bearing
upon what makes human life worth living, that constitutes Henry George one of
the world's great social
philosophers.</span>

<p align="center"><b>1. The Problem<a name="1"></a></b> </p>
<p align="left">Could a Franklin or a Priestley have seen, in a vision of
    the future, the steamship taking the place of the sailing vessel, the railroad
    train of the wagon, the reaping machine of the scythe, the threshing machine
    of the flail;<b> </b>could he have heard the throb of the engines that in obedience
    to human will, and for the satisfaction of human desire, exert a power greater
    than
    that of all the men and all the beasts of burden of the earth combined; could
    he have seen the forest tree transformed into finished lumber &#8212; into
        doors, sashes, blinds, boxes or barrels, with hardly the touch of a human
        hand; the great workshops where boots and shoes are turned out by the
  case with less labor than the old-fashioned cobbler could have put on a sole;
        the factories where, under the eye of a girl, cotton becomes cloth faster
        than hundreds of stalwart weavers could have turned it out with their
  hand-looms; could he have seen steam hammers shaping mammoth shafts and mighty
    anchors, and delicate machinery making tiny watches; the diamond drill cutting
    through
  the heart of the rocks, and coal oil sparing the whale; could he have realized
    the enormous saving of labor resulting from improved facilities of exchange
    and communication &#8212; sheep killed
  in Australia eaten fresh in England and the order given by the London banker
  in the
  afternoon executed in San Francisco in the morning of the same day; could he
    have conceived of the hundred thousand improvements which these only suggest,
    what would he have inferred as to the social condition
  of mankind?</p>
<p align="left">It would not have seemed like an inference; further than the
  vision went it would have seemed as though he saw; and his heart would have
  leaped and his nerves would have thrilled, as one who from a height beholds
  just ahead of the thirst-stricken caravan the living gleam of rustling woods
  and the glint of laughing waters. Plainly, in the sight of the imagination,
  he would have beheld these new forces elevating society from its very foundations,
    lifting the very poorest above the possibility of want, exempting the very
  lowest from anxiety for the material needs of life; he would have seen these
  slaves of the lamp of knowledge taking on themselves the traditional curse,
  these muscles of iron and sinews of steel making the
    poorest laborer's life a holiday, in which every high quality and noble impulse
  could have scope to grow.</p>
<p align="left">And out of these bounteous material conditions he would have
  seen arising, as necessary sequences, moral conditions realizing the golden
  age of which mankind always dreamed. Youth no longer stunted and starved; age
  no longer harried by avarice; the child at play with the tiger; the man with
  the muck-rake drinking
in the glory of the stars! Foul things fled, fierce things tame; discord turned
to harmony! For how could there be greed where all had enough? How could
  the vice, the crime, the ignorance, the brutality, that spring from poverty
  and the fear of poverty, exist where poverty had vanished? Who should crouch
where all were freemen; who oppress where all were peers?</p>
<p align="left">More or less vague or clear, these have been the hopes, these
  the dreams born of the improvements which give this wonderful century its preeminence.
  They have sunk so deeply into the popular mind as to radically change the currents
  of thought, to recast creeds and displace the most fundamental conceptions.
  The haunting visions of higher possibilities have not merely gathered splendor
  and vividness, but their direction has changed &#8212; instead of seeing behind
  the faint tinges of an expiring sunset, all the glory of the daybreak has decked
  the skies before.</p>
<p align="left">It is true that disappointment has followed disappointment, and
  that discovery upon discovery, and invention after invention, have neither
  lessened the toil of those who most need respite, nor brought plenty to the
  poor. But there have been so many things to which it seemed this failure could
  be laid, that up to our time the new faith has hardly weakened. We have better
  appreciated the difficulties to be overcome; but not the less trusted that
  the tendency of the times was to overcome them.</p>
<p align="left">Now, however, we are coming into collision with facts which there
  can be no mistaking. From all parts of the civilized world come complaints
  of industrial depression; of labor condemned to involuntary idleness; of capital
  massed and wasting; of pecuniary distress among business men; of want and suffering
  and anxiety among the working classes. All the dull, deadening pain, all the
  keen, maddening anguish, that to great masses of men are involved in the words "hard
  times," have
  afflicted the world.&nbsp; This state of things, common to communities differing
  so widely in situation, in political institutions, in fiscal and financial
  systems,
  in density of population and in social organization can hardly be accounted
  for by local causes. There is distress where large standing armies are maintained,
  but there is also distress where the standing armies are nominal; there is
  distress where protective tariffs stupidly and wastefully hamper trade, but
  there is also distress where trade is nearly free; there is distress where
  autocratic government yet prevails, but there is also distress where political
  power is wholly in the hands of the people; in countries where paper is money,
  and in countries where gold and silver are the only currency. Evidently, beneath
  all such things as these, we must infer a common cause.</p>
<p align="left">That there is a common cause, and that it is either what we
    call material progress or something closely connected with material progress,
    becomes more than an inference when it is noted that the phenomena we class
    together and speak of as industrial depression are but intensifications of
    phenomena which always accompany material progress, and which show themselves
    more clearly and strongly as material progress goes on. <i></i></p>
<p align="left">It has always been to the newer countries &#8212; that is, to
  the countries where material progress is yet in its earlier stages &#8212; that
  laborers have emigrated in search of higher wages, and capital has flowed in
  search of higher interest. It is in the older countries &#8212; that is to
  say, the countries where material progress has reached later stages &#8212; that
  widespread destitution is found in the midst of the greatest abundance. Go
  into a new community where Anglo-Saxon vigor is just beginning the race of
  progress; where the machinery of production and exchange is yet rude and inefficient;
  where the increment of wealth is not yet great enough to enable any class to
  live in ease and luxury; where the best house is but a cabin of logs or a cloth
  and paper shanty, and the richest man is forced to daily work &#8212; and though
  you will find an absence of wealth and all its concomitants, you will find
  no beggars. There is no luxury, but there is no destitution.
  No one makes an easy living, nor a very good living; but every one <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">can </span>make a living, and
  no one able and willing to work is oppressed by the fear of want.</p>
<p align="left">But just as such a community realizes the conditions which
    all civilized communities are striving for, and advances in the scale of
    material progress &#8212; just as closer settlement and a more intimate connection
    with the rest of the world, and greater utilization of labor-saving machinery,
    make possible greater economies in production and exchange, and wealth in
    consequence increases, not merely in the aggregate, but in proportion to
    population &#8212; so does poverty take a darker aspect. Some
    get an infinitely better and easier living, but others find it hard to get
    a living at all. The "tramp" comes with the locomotive, and almshouses and
    prisons are as surely the marks of "material progress" as are costly dwellings,
    rich warehouses, and magnificent churches. Upon streets lighted with gas
    and patrolled by uniformed policemen, beggars wait for the passer-by, and
    in the shadow of college, and library, and museum, are gathering the more
    hideous Huns and fiercer Vandals of whom Macaulay prophesied.</p>
<p align="left">This fact &#8212; the great fact that poverty and all its
    concomitants show themselves in communities just as they develop into the
    conditions towards which material progress tends &#8212; proves that the
    social difficulties existing wherever a certain stage of progress has been
    reached, do not arise from local circumstances, but are, in some way or another,
    engendered by progress itself.</p>
<p align="left">And, unpleasant as it may be to admit it, it is at last becoming
  evident that the enormous increase in productive power which has marked
  the present century and is still going on with accelerating ratio, has no tendency
  to extirpate poverty or to lighten the burdens of those compelled to toil. It
  simply widens the gulf between <a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/d/i/diveslaz.htm">Dives
  and Lazarus</a>, and makes the struggle for existence more intense. The march
  of invention has clothed mankind with powers of which a century ago the boldest
  imagination could not have dreamed. But in factories where labor-saving machinery
  has reached its most wonderful development, little children are at work; wherever
  the new forces are anything like fully utilized, large classes are maintained
  by charity or live on the verge of recourse to it; amid the greatest accumulations
  of wealth, men die of starvation, and puny infants suckle dry breasts; while
  everywhere the greed of gain, the worship of wealth, shows the force of the
  fear of want. The promised land flies before us like the mirage. The fruits
  of the tree of knowledge turn as we grasp them to apples of Sodom that crumble
  at the touch.</p>
<p align="left">It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the
  average of comfort, leisure, and refinement has been raised; but these gains
  are not general. In them the
  lowest class do not share. I do not mean that the condition of the lowest class
  has nowhere nor in anything been improved; but that there is nowhere any improvement
  which can be credited to increased productive power. I mean that the tendency
  of what we call material progress is in no wise to improve the condition of
  the lowest class in the essentials of healthy, happy human life. Nay, more,
  that it is to still further depress the condition of the lowest class. The
  new forces, elevating in their nature though they be, do not act upon the social
  fabric from underneath, as was for a long time hoped and believed, but strike
  it at a point intermediate between top and bottom. It is as though an immense
  wedge were being forced, not underneath society, but through society. Those
  who are above the point of separation are elevated, but those who are below
  are crushed down.</p>
<p align="left">This depressing effect is not generally realized, for it is not
  apparent where there has long existed a class just able to live. Where the
  lowest class barely lives, as has been the case for a long time in many parts
  of Europe, it is impossible for it to get any lower, for the next lowest step
  is out of existence, and no tendency to further depression can readily show
  itself. But in the progress of new settlements to the conditions of older
  communities it may clearly be seen that material progress does not merely fail
  to relieve poverty &#8212; it actually produces it. </p>
<div align="left">This association
    of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times. It is the
    central fact from which spring industrial, social, and political difficulties
    that perplex the world, and with which
    statesmanship and philanthropy and education grapple in vain. From it come
    the clouds that overhang the future of the most progressive and self-reliant
    nations. It is the riddle which the Sphinx of Fate puts to our civilization,
    and which not to answer is to be destroyed. So long as all the increased
    wealth which modern progress brings goes but to build up great fortunes,
    to increase luxury and make sharper
    the contrast between the House of Have and the House of Want, progress is
    not real and cannot be permanent. The reaction must come. The tower leans
    from its foundations, and every new story but hastens the final catastrophe.
    To educate men who must be condemned to poverty, is but to make them restive;
    to base on a state of most glaring social inequality political institutions
    under which men are theoretically equal, is to stand a pyramid on its apex.</div>
<p align="left">All-important as this question is, pressing itself from every
  quarter painfully upon attention, it has not yet received a solution which
  accounts for all the facts and points to any clear and simple remedy.</p>
<p>It must be within the province of political economy to solve it. For
  political economy is not a set of dogmas. It is the explanation of a certain
  set of facts. It is the science which, in the sequence of certain phenomena,
  seeks to trace mutual relations and to identify cause and effect, just as the
  physical sciences seek to do in other sets of phenomena. It lays its foundations
  upon firm ground. The premises from which it makes its deductions are truths
  which have the highest sanction; axioms which we all recognize; upon which
  we safely base the reasoning and actions of every-day life, and which may be
  reduced to the metaphysical expression of the physical law that motion seeks
  the line of least resistance &#8212; viz., that
men seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion</font>.</p>
<p>I propose in the following pages to attempt to solve by the methods of political
  economy the great problem I have outlined. I propose to seek the law which
  associates poverty with progress, and increases want with advancing wealth.<b>&nbsp;</b> Properly
  commenced and carefully pursued, such an investigation must yield a conclusion
  that will stand every test, and as truth, will correlate with all other truth.
  For in the sequence of phenomena there is no accident. Every effect has a cause,
and every fact implies a preceding fact.</p>
<p>I propose in this inquiry to take nothing for granted.&nbsp; I propose to
  beg no question, to shrink from no conclusion, but to follow truth wherever
it may lead. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

That vegetable and animal life tends to press against the limits of space does
not prove the same tendency in human life.&nbsp; Granted that man is only a more
highly developed animal; that the ring-tailed monkey is a distant relative who
has gradually developed acrobatic tendencies, and the humpbacked whale a far-off
connection
who in early life took to the sea &#8212; granted that back of these he is kin
to the vegetable, and is still subject to the same laws as plants, fishes, birds,
and beasts. Yet there is still this
difference between man and all other animals &#8212; he is the only animal whose
desires increase as they are fed; the only animal that is never
satisfied. The wants of every other living thing are uniform and fixed. The
ox of today aspires to no more than did the ox when man first yoked him. The
sea gull of the English Channel, who poises himself above the swift steamer,
wants no better food or lodging than the gulls who circled round as the keels
of Caesar's galleys first grated on a British beach. Of all that nature offers
them, be it ever so abundant, all living things save man can take, and care for,
only enough to supply wants which are definite and fixed. The only use they can
make of additional supplies or additional opportunities is
to multiply.
<p>But not so with man. No sooner are his animal wants satisfied than new
    wants arise. Food he wants first, as does the beast; shelter next, as
    does the beast; and these given, his reproductive instincts assert their
    sway, as do those of the beast. But here man and beast part company. The
    beast never goes further; the man has but set his feet on the first step
    of an infinite progression &#8212; a progression upon which the beast never
    enters; a progression away from and above the beast.</p>
The demand for quantity once satisfied, he seeks quality. The very desires
that he has in common with the beast become
extended, refined, exalted.  It is not merely hunger, but taste, that seeks gratification
    in food; in clothes, he seeks not merely comfort, but adornment; the rude
shelter becomes a house; the undiscriminating sexual attraction begins to transmute
itself into subtle influences, and the hard and common stock of animal life to
blossom and to bloom into shapes
  of delicate beauty.  As power to gratify his wants increases, so does aspiration grow. Held
      down to lower levels of desire, Lucullus will sup with Lucullus; twelve
        boars turn on spits that Antony's mouthful of meat may be done to a turn;
        every kingdom of Nature be ransacked to add to Cleopatra's charms, and
      marble colonnades and hanging gardens and pyramids that rival the hills
    arise. Passing into higher forms of desire, that which slumbered in the plant
        and fitfully stirred in the beast, awakes in the man. The eyes of the
      mind are opened, and he longs to know. He braves the scorching heat of
      the desert
        and the icy blasts of the polar sea, but not for food; he watches all
      night, but it is to trace the circling of the eternal stars. He adds toil
      to toil,
        to gratify a hunger no animal has felt; to assuage a thirst no beast
    can know.</p>
    <p>Out upon nature, in upon himself, back through the mists that shroud the past,
      forward into the darkness that overhangs the future, turns the restless desire
      that arises when the animal wants slumber in satisfaction. Beneath things,
      he seeks the law; he would know how the globe was forged and the stars were
      hung, and trace to their origins the springs of life. And, then, as the man
      develops his nobler nature, there arises the desire higher yet &#8212; the
      passion of passions, the hope of hopes &#8212; the desire that he, even he,
      may somehow aid in making life better and brighter, in destroying want and
      sin, sorrow and shame. He masters and curbs the animal; he turns his back upon
      the feast and renounces the place of power; he leaves it to others to accumulate
      wealth, to gratify pleasant tastes, to bask themselves in the warm sunshine
      of the brief day. He works for those he never saw and never can see; for a
      fame, or maybe but for a scant Justice, that can only come long after the clods
      have rattled upon his coffin lid. He toils in the advance, where it is cold,
      and there is little cheer from men, and the stones are sharp and the brambles
      thick. Amid the scoffs of the present and the sneers that stab like knives,
      he builds for the future; he cuts the trail that progressive humanity may hereafter
      broaden into a highroad. Into higher, grander spheres desire mounts and beckons,
      and a star that rises in the east leads him on. Lo! the pulses of the man throb
    with the yearnings of the god &#8212; he would aid in the process of the suns!</p>
    <p>Is not the gulf too wide for the analogy to span? Give more food, open
        fuller conditions of life, and the vegetable or animal can but multiply;
        the man will develop. In the one the expansive force can but extend existence
        in new numbers; in the other, it will inevitably tend to extend existence
        in higher forms and wider powers.* Man is an animal; but he is an animal
        plus something else. He is the mythic earth-tree, whose roots are in the
    ground, but whose topmost branches may blossom in the heavens!</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">* Many contemporary
          economists while agreeing that population does not necessarily tend
          to become too dense for the greatest
        per capita prosperity, would nevertheless argue that it may do so, and
          in certain times and countries has done so.&nbsp; Population, they
          would say, does not automatically and without human prevision adjust
          itself to available
        space and available natural resources; but it may be made so to adjust
          itself, for the very reason that human beings differ from non-humans
          in such ways
    as Henry George here indicates. <em>H. G.B.</em></font></small>      </div>
    <p>Look simply at the facts. Can anything be clearer than that the cause of the
      poverty which festers in the centers of civilization is not in the weakness
      of the productive forces? In countries where poverty is deepest, the forces
      of production are evidently strong enough, if fully employed, to provide for
    the lowest not merely comfort but luxury.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is this very fact &#8212; that want appears where productive power is greatest
      and the production of wealth is largest &#8212; that constitutes the enigma
      which perplexes the civilized world, and which we are trying to unravel. Evidently
      the Malthusian theory, which attributes want to the decrease of productive
      power, will not explain it. That theory is utterly inconsistent with all the
      facts.<b

      of God of results which, even from this examination, we may infer really spring

Develops</span></p>
  </div>
<center>
  <div align="left">
    <p>Land, Labor, and Capital are the factors of production. The
      term Land includes all natural opportunities or forces;
 the term Labor, all human exertion; and the term Capital, all wealth
            used to produce more wealth.
          </p>
          
In returns to these three factors is the whole produce distributed. That part which goes to land owners as payment for the use of
                          natural opportunities is called Rent; that part which constitutes the reward of human exertion is called
                          Wages; and that part which constitutes the return for the use of capital is called Interest.
    </p>
    
These terms mutually exclude each other. The income of any individual
              may be made up from any one, two, or all three of these sources; but
              in the effort to discover the laws of distribution we must keep them
      separate.
  </p>
</p>
        </div>
</center>
<center>
  <div align="left">  There must be land before labor can be exerted, and labor
    must be exerted before capital can be produced. Capital is a result of labor,
    and is used
      by labor to assist it in further production. Labor is the active and initial
      force, and labor is therefore the employer of capital. Labor can be exerted
      only upon land, and it is from land that the matter which it transmutes
    into wealth must be drawn. Land therefore is the condition precedent,
      the field and
  material of labor. The natural order is land, labor, capital.<small></small><b><i><small><br>

    <div style="text-align: right;"></div>
    Increasing population increases rent* without reference to the natural
      qualities of land, for the increased powers of co-operation and exchange
      which come with
  increased population are equivalent to &#8212; nay, I think we can say without
  metaphor, that they give &#8212; an increased
  capacity to land.<br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*Elsewhere, Henry George explains, "I,
      of course, use 'rent' in its economic, not in its common sense, meaning by
    it what is commonly called ground-rent."</font></div>
  <p>  I do not mean to say merely that, like an improvement in the methods or tools
      of production, the increased power which comes with increased population
      gives to the same labor an increased result, which is equivalent to an increase
      in the natural powers of land; but that it brings out a superior power in
      labor, which is localized on land; and which thus inheres in the land as
      much as any qualities of soil, climate, mineral deposit, or natural situation,
    and passes, as they do, with the possession of the land. </p>
  <p> Here, let us imagine, is an unbounded savannah, stretching off in
      unbroken sameness of grass and flower, tree and rill, till the traveler tires
      of the monotony. Along comes the wagon of the first immigrant. Where to settle
      he cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems as good as every other acre. As to
      wood, as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there is absolutely no
      choice, and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out with
      the search for one place that is better than another, he stops &#8212; somewhere,
      anywhere &#8212; and starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin and
      rich, game is abundant, the streams flash with the finest trout. Nature is
      at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous district, would make him
      rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of the mental craving, which would
      lead him to welcome the sorriest stranger, he labors under all the material
      disadvantages of solitude. He can get no temporary assistance for any work
      that requires a greater union of strength than that afforded by his own family,
      or by such help as he can permanently keep. Though he has cattle, he cannot
      often have fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill a bullock. He must
      be his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in short,
      a "jack of all trades and master of none." He cannot have his children schooled,
      for, to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher. Such things as he
      cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities and keep on hand, or else
      go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving his work and making a long
      journey to the verge of civilization; and when forced to do so, the getting
      of a vial of medicine or the replacement of a broken auger may cost him the
      labor of himself and horses for days. Under such circumstances, though nature
      is prolific, the man is poor. It is an easy matter for him to get enough to
      eat; but beyond this, his labor will suffice to satisfy only the simplest wants
    in the rudest way. </p>
  <p>Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section* of the
      boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is not beset
      by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land is the same, there
      is one place that is clearly better for him than any other place, and that
      is where there is already a settler and he may have a neighbor. He settles
      by the side of the first comer, whose condition is at once greatly improved,
      and to whom many things are now possible that were before impossible, for two
    men may help each other to do things that one man could never do.<font size="-1"></font></p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">*The public prairie lands of
      the United States were surveyed into sections of one mile square, and a quarter
      section (160 acres) was the usual government allotment to a settler under
      the Homestead Act. </font><br>
  </div>
  Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction, settles where
  there are already two. Another, and another, until around our first comer there
  are
  a score of neighbors. Labor has now an effectiveness which, in the solitary
  state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be done, the settlers have
  a logrolling,
  and together accomplish in a day what singly would require years. When one
  kills a bullock, the others take part of it, returning when they kill, and
  thus they
  have fresh meat all the time. Together they hire a schoolmaster, and the children
  of each are taught for a fractional part of what similar teaching would have
  cost the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter to send to the
  nearest town, for some one is always going. But there is less need for such
  journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set up shops, and our settler
  can have his
  tools repaired for a small part of the labor it formerly cost him. A store
  is opened and he can get what he wants as he wants it; a postoffice, soon added,
  gives him regular communication with the rest of the world. Then come a cobbler,
  a carpenter, a harness maker, a doctor; and a little church soon arises. Satisfactions
  become possible that in the solitary state were impossible. There are gratifications
  for the social and the intellectual nature &#8212; for that part of the man that
  rises above the animal. The power of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the
  emulation of comparison and contrast, open a wider, and fuller, and more varied
  life. In rejoicing, there are others to rejoice; in sorrow, the mourners do not
  mourn alone. There are husking bees, and apple parings, and quilting parties.
  Though the ballroom be unplastered and the orchestra but a fiddle, the notes
  of the magician are yet in the strain, and Cupid dances with the dancers. At
  the wedding, there are others to admire and enjoy; in the house of death, there
  are watchers; by the open grave, stands human sympathy to sustain the mourners.
  Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer to open up glimpses of the world of
  science, of literature, or of art; in election times, come stump speakers, and
  the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and power, as the cause of empires is
  tried before him in the struggle of John Doe and Richard Roe for his support
  and vote. And, by and by, comes the circus, talked of months before, and opening
  to children whose horizon has
  been the prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and princesses
  of fairy tale, mailclad crusaders and turbaned Moors, Cinderella's fairy coach,
  and the giants of nursery lore; lions such as crouched before Daniel, or in
  circling Roman amphitheater tore the saints of God; ostriches who recall the
  sandy deserts;
  camels such as stood around when the wicked brethren raised Joseph from the
  well and sold him into bondage; elephants such as crossed the Alps with Hannibal,
  or felt the sword of the Maccabees; and glorious music that thrills and builds
  in the chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome
  of Kubla Khan.
  <p>Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit trees which
      you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in short,
      you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your land itself is
      not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and by it will need manure.
      I will give you the full value of all your improvements if you will give it
      to me, and go again with your family beyond the verge of settlement." He would
      laugh at you. His land yields no more wheat or potatoes than before, but it
      does yield far more of all the necessaries and comforts of life. His labor
      upon it will bring no heavier crops, and, we will suppose, no more valuable
      crops, but it will bring far more of all the other things for which men work.
      The presence of other settlers &#8212; the increase of population &#8212; has
      added to the productiveness, in these things, of labor bestowed upon it, and
      this added productiveness gives it a superiority over land of equal natural
      quality where there are as yet no settlers. If no land remains to be taken
      up, except such as is as far removed from population as was our settler's land
      when he first went upon it, the value or rent of this land will be measured
      by the whole of this added capability. If, however, as we have supposed, there
      is a continuous stretch of equal land, over which population is now spreading,
      it will not be necessary for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as
      did the first. He will settle just beyond the other settlers, and will get
      the advantage of proximity to them. The value or rent of our settler's land
      will thus depend on the advantage which it has, from being at the center of
      population, over that on the verge. In the one case, the margin of production
    will remain as before; in the other, the margin of production will be raised.</p>
  <p>Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the economies
      which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the productiveness of
      the land. Our first settler's land, being the center of population, the store,
      the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's shop, are set up on it, or on its
      margin, where soon arises a village, which rapidly grows into a town, the center
      of exchanges for the people of the whole district. With no greater agricultural
      productiveness than it had at first, this land now begins to develop a productiveness
      of a higher kind. To labor expended in raising corn, or wheat, or potatoes,
      it will yield no more of those things than at first; but to labor expended
      in the subdivided branches of production which require proximity to other producers,
      and, especially, to labor expended in that final part of production, which
      consists in distribution, it will yield much larger returns. The wheatgrower
      may go further on, and find land on which his labor will produce as much wheat,
      and nearly as much wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper,
      the professional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center of
      exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a little distance
      away from it; and this excess of productiveness for such purposes the landowner
      can claim just as he could an excess in its wheat-producing power. And so our
      settler is able to sell in building lots a few of his acres for prices which
      it would not bring for wheatgrowing if its fertility had been multiplied many
      times. With the proceeds, he builds himself a fine house, and furnishes it
      handsomely. That is to say, to reduce the transaction to its lowest terms,
      the people who wish to use the land build and furnish the house for him, on
      condition that he will let them avail themselves of the superior productiveness
    which the increase of population has given the land.</p>
  <p>Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater utility to
      the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town has grown into a
      city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago or a San Francisco &#8212; and still it
      grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with the best machinery
      and the most favorable facilities; the division of labor becomes extremely
      minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency; exchanges are of such volume and
      rapidity that they are made with the minimum of friction and loss. Here is
      the heart, the brain, of the vast social organism that has grown up from the
      germ of the first settlement; here has developed one of the great ganglia of
      the human world. Hither run all roads, hither set all currents, through all
      the vast regions round about. Here, if you have anything to sell, is the market;
      here, if you have anything to buy, is the largest and the choicest stock. Here
      intellectual activity is gathered into a focus, and here springs that stimulus
      which is born of the collision of mind with mind. Here are the great libraries,
      the storehouses and granaries of knowledge, the learned professors, the famous
      specialists. Here are museums and art galleries, collections of philosophical
      apparatus, and all things rare, and valuable, and best of their kind. Here
      come great actors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here,
    in short, is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations.</p>
  So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the application
  of labor, that instead of one man &#8212; with a span of horses scratching
  over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers to the acre, working
  tier
  on tier, on floors raised one above the other, five, six, seven and eight stories
  from the ground, while underneath the surface of the earth engines are throbbing
  with
  pulsations that exert the force of thousands of horses.
  <p>All these advantages attach to the land; it is on this land and no other
      that they can be utilized, for here is the center of population &#8212; the
      focus of exchanges, the market place and workshop of the highest forms
      of industry. The productive powers which density of population has attached
      to this land are equivalent to the multiplication of its original fertility
      by the hundredfold and the thousandfold. And rent, which measures the difference
      between this added productiveness and that of the least productive land
      in use, has increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever has succeeded
      to
      his right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another Rip
      Van Winkle, he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not
      from anything he has done, but from the increase of population. There are
      lots from which for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more than an
      average mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for more than would
      suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal streets are towering
      buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate glass, finished in the most
      expensive style, replete with every convenience. Yet they are not worth as
      much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the same land, in nothing changed,
    which when our first settler came upon it had no value at all.</p>
  <p>That this is the way in which the increase of population powerfully acts
    in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive country, will look around him,
    may
      see for himself. The process is going on under his eyes. The increasing
    difference in the productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing
    rise in
      rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased population
    compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the increased productiveness
    which increased
      population gives to the lands already in use. The most valuable lands on
      the globe, the lands which yield the highest rent, are not lands of surpassing
      natural fertility, but lands to which a surpassing utility has been given
    by the increase of population.</p>
  <p>And where value seems to arise from superior natural qualities, such as
      deep water and good anchorage, rich deposits of coal and iron, or heavy timber,
      observation also shows that these superior qualities are brought out, rendered
      tangible, by population. The coal and iron fields of Pennsylvania, that
      today [1879] are worth enormous sums, were fifty years ago valueless. What
      is the efficient cause of the difference? Simply the difference in population.
      The coal and iron beds of Wyoming and Montana, which today are valueless,
      will, in fifty years from now, be worth millions on millions, simply because,
    in the meantime, population will have greatly increased.</p>
  <p>It is a well-provisioned ship, this on which we sail through space. If the
      bread and beef above decks seem to grow scarce, we but open a hatch and
    there is a new supply, of which before we never dreamed. And very great command
      over the services of others comes to those who as the hatches are opened
    are permitted to say, "This is mine!"</p>

  <p align="center"><strong>4<a name="4"></a>. Land Speculation Causes Reduced Wages </strong> </p>
</div>
<p align="left">There is a cause, not yet adverted to, which must be taken into consideration
      fully to explain the influence of material progress upon the distribution
  of wealth.</p>
<p align="left">That cause is the confident expectation of the future enhancement of land
      values, which arises in all progressive countries from the steady increase
      of rent, and which leads to speculation, or the holding of land for a higher
  price than it would then otherwise bring.</p>
<p align="left">We have hitherto assumed, as is generally assumed in elucidations of the
      theory of rent, that the actual margin of cultivation always coincides
      with what may be termed the necessary margin of cultivation &#8212; that
      is to say, we have assumed that cultivation extends to less productive
      points only as it becomes necessary from the fact that natural opportunities
  are at the more productive points fully utilized.</p>
<p align="left">This, probably, is the case in stationary or very slowly progressing communities,
      but in rapidly progressing communities, where the swift and steady increase
      of rent gives confidence to calculations of further increase, it is not
      the case. In such communities, the confident expectation of increased prices
      produces, to a greater or less extent, the effects of a combination among
      landholders, and tends to the withholding of land from use, in expectation
      of higher prices, thus forcing the margin of cultivation farther than required
  by the necessities of production.</p>
<p align="left">In communities like the United States, where the user of land generally
      prefers, if he can, to own it, and where there is a great extent of land
  to overrun, this cause operated with enormous power. </p>
<p align="left"> The immense area over which the population of the United States is scattered
      shows this. The man who sets out from the Eastern Seaboard in search of
      the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without paying rent,
      must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink, pass for long distances
      through half-tilled farms, and traverse vast areas of virgin soil, before
      he reaches the point where land can be had free of rent i.e., by homestead
      entry or pre-emption. He (and, with him, the margin of cultivation) is
      forced so much farther than he otherwise need have gone, by the speculation
      which is holding these unused lands in expectation of increased value in
      the future. And when he settles, he will, in his turn, take up, if he can,
      more land than he can use, in the belief that it will soon become valuable;
      and so those who follow him are again forced farther on than the necessities
      of production require, carrying the margin of cultivation to still less
  productive, because still more remote points.</p>
<p align="left"> If the land of superior quality as to location were always fully used
      before land of inferior quality were resorted to, no vacant lots would
      be left as a city extended, nor would we find miserable shanties in the
      midst of costly buildings. These lots, some of them extremely valuable,
      are withheld from use, or from the full use to which they might be put,
      because their owners, not being able or not wishing to improve them, prefer,
      in expectation of the advance of land values, to hold them for a higher
      rate than could now be obtained from those willing to improve them. And,
      in consequence of this land being withheld from use, or from the full use
      of which it is capable, the margin of the city is pushed away so much farther
  from the center.</p>
<p align="left">But when we reach the limits of the growing city &#8212; the actual margin
      of building, which corresponds to the margin of cultivation in agriculture &#8212; we
      shall not find the land purchasable at its value for agricultural purposes,
      as it would be were rent determined simply by present requirements; but
      we shall find that for a long distance beyond the city, land bears a speculative
      value, based upon the belief that it will be required in the future for
      urban purposes, and that to reach the point at which land can be purchased
      at a price not based upon urban rent, we must go very far beyond the actual
  margin of urban use.</p>
<p align="left">That mineral land, when reduced to private ownership, is frequently withheld
      from use while poorer deposits are worked, is well known, and in new states
      it is common to find individuals who are called &quot;land poor&quot; --
      that is, who remain poor, sometimes almost to deprivation, because they
      insist on holding land, which they themselves cannot use, at prices at
  which no one else can profitably use it.</p>
<p align="left">Whether we formulate it as an extension of the margin of production, or
      as a carrying of the rent line beyond the margin of production, the influence
      of speculation in land in increasing rent is a great fact which cannot
      be ignored in any complete theory of the distribution of wealth in progressive
      countries. It is the force, evolved by material progress, which tends constantly
      to increase rent in a greater ratio than progress increases production,
      and thus constantly tends, as material progress goes on and productive
  power increases, to reduce wages, not merely relatively, but absolutely.</p>
<p align="left">The cause which limits speculation in commodities, the tendency of increasing
      price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot limit the speculative advance
      in land values, as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency can neither
      increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless a limit to the price of
      land, in the minimum required by labor and capital as the condition of
      engaging in production. If it were possible continuously to reduce wages
      until zero were reached, it would be possible continuously to increase
      rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently
      reduced below the point at which laborers will consent to work and reproduce,
      nor interest below the point at which capital will be devoted to production,
      there is a limit which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence
      speculation cannot have the same scope to advance rent in countries where
      wages and interest are already near the minimum, as in countries where
  they are considerably above it.</p>
<div align="center"><strong>5<a name="5"></a>. The Basic Cause of Poverty </strong> </div>
<p align="left">The great problem, of which these recurring seasons of industrial depression
  are but peculiar manifestations, is now, I think, fully solved, and the social
  phenomena which all over the civilized world appall the philanthropist and
  perplex the statesman, which hang with clouds the future of the most advanced
  races, and suggest doubts of the reality and ultimate goal of what we have
  fondly called progress, are now explained.</p>
<p align="left"><em>The reason why, in spite of the increase of productive power, wages constantly
  tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living, is that, with increase
  in productive power, rent tends to even greater increase, thus producing a
  constant tendency to the forcing down of wages.</em></p>
<p align="left">Land being necessary to labor, and being reduced to private ownership, every
  increase in the productive power of labor but increases rent &#8212; the price
  that labor must pay for the opportunity to utilize its powers; and thus all
  the advantages gained by the march of progress go to the owners of land, and
  wages do not increase.*</p>

<p align="left"> The simple theory which I have outlined (if indeed it can be called a theory
  which is but the recognition of the most obvious relations) explains this conjunction
  of poverty with wealth, of low wages with high productive power, of degradation
  amid enlightenment, of virtual slavery in political liberty. </p>
<p align="left">It harmonizes,

<p align="left">It explains why want increases with abundance, and wealth tends to greater
          and
            greater aggregations. </p>
<p align="left">It explains the vice and misery which show themselves
            amid dense population, without attributing to the laws of the All-Wise
        and
            All-Beneficent defects
            which belong only to the shortsighted and selfish enactments of men.</p>
<p align="left"> The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought
  this question:</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German Ocean
  a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should be able
  to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and of
  free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of English
  soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
<p align="left">He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
  to thirty shillings a day.</p>
<p align="left">And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
  would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and if
  he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen without
  any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural opportunities,
  or the forms and direction of industry being much changed; only that kind of
  production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
  less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in wages
  would be at the expense of rent.</p>
<p align="left">Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
  has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
  village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the railroad
  will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light of the candle;
  it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply
  the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be any higher?&quot;</p>
<p align="left">He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
  a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
<p align="left">He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
  on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not be
  easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances are
  that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
<p align="left">&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
  possession.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
  more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
  of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
  in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
  to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
  you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
  almshouse.</p>
<p align="left">In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
  That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
  to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
  of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. We have been advancing as through
  an enemy's country, in which every step must be secured, every position fortified,
  and every bypath explored; for this simple truth, in its application to social
  and political problems, is hid from the great masses of men partly by its very
  simplicity, and in greater part by widespread fallacies and erroneous habits
  of thought which lead them to look in every direction but the right one for
  an explanation of the evils which oppress and threaten the civilized world.
  And back of these elaborate fallacies and misleading theories is an active,
  energetic power, a power that in every country, be its political forms what
  they may, writes laws and molds thought &#8212; the power of a vast and dominant
  pecuniary interest.</p>
<p align="left">But so simple and so clear is this truth, that to see it fully once is always
  to recognize it. There are pictures which, though looked at again and again,
  present only a confused labyrinth of lines or scroll work &#8212; a landscape,
  trees, or something of the kind &#8212; until once the attention is called
  to the fact that these things make up a face or a figure. This relation, once
  recognized, is always afterward clear.*</p>

<p align="left">It is so in this case. In the light of this truth all social facts group themselves
  in an orderly relation, and the most diverse phenomena are seen to spring from
  one great principle. </p>
<p align="left">It is not in the relations of capital and labor; it is
  not in the pressure of population against subsistence, that an explanation
  of the unequal development of our civilization is to be found. The great cause
  of inequality in the distribution of wealth is inequality in the ownership
  of land. The ownership of land is the great fundamental fact which ultimately
  determines the social, the political, and consequently the intellectual and
  moral condition of a people. And it must be so. For land is the habitation
  of man, the storehouse upon which he must draw for all his needs, the material
  to which his labor must be applied for the supply of all his desires; for even
  the products of the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any
  of the forces of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products.
  On the land we are born, from it we live, to it we return again &#8212; children
  of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower of the field. Take
  away from man all that belongs to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit.
  Material progress cannot rid us of our dependence upon land; it can but add
  to the power of producing wealth from land; and hence, when land is monopolized,
  it might go on to infinity without increasing wages or improving the condition
  of those who have but their labor. It can but add to the value of land and
  the power which its possession gives. Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples,
  the possession of land is the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great
  fortunes, the source of power. As said the Brahmins, ages ago</p>

<p align="left"> Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down while productive

land a common ownership.*</p>

      argument necessarily has been omitted, the following extracts from his
      later work &quot;Protection or Free Trade,&quot; chapter XXVI, are appended

  <div align="left">
    <blockquote> <font size="-1">&quot;No one would sow a crop, or build a house,
          or open a mine, or plant an orchard, or cut a drain, so long as any
        one else could come in and turn him out of the land in which or on which
        such
          improvement must be fixed. Thus is it absolutely necessary to the proper
          use and improvement of land that society should secure to the user
        and improver safe possession. ... We can leave land now being used in
        the secure

          use of this much of the common property, and which should have no reference
          to any improvement he has made in or on it, or to any profit due to
        the use of his labor and capital. In this way all would be placed on
        an equality
          in regard to the use and enjoyment of those natural elements which
        are clearly the common heritage.&quot;</font> </blockquote>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes the possibility of
  any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully entitled to the produce
  of his labor, then no one can be rightfully entitled to the ownership of anything
  which is not the produce of his labor, or the labor of some one else from whom
  the right has passed to him. For the right to the produce of labor cannot be
  enjoyed without the right to the free use of the opportunities offered by nature,
  and to admit the right of property in these is to deny the right of property
  in the produce of labor. When nonproducers can claim as rent a portion of the
  wealth created by producers, the right of the producers to the fruits of their
labor is to that extent denied.</p>
<p align="left">A house and the lot on which it stands are alike property, as being the subject
  of ownership, and are alike classed by the lawyers as real estate. Yet in nature
  and relations they differ widely. The one is produced by human labor, and belongs
  to the class in political economy styled wealth. The other is a part of nature,
  and belongs to the class in political economy styled land.</p>
<p align="left">The essential character of the one class of things is that they embody labor,
  are brought into being by human exertion, their existence or nonexistence,
  their increase or diminution, depending on man. The essential character of
  the other class of things is that they do not embody labor, and exist irrespective
  of human exertion and irrespective of man; they are the field or environment
  in which man finds himself; the storehouse from which his needs must be supplied,
  the raw material upon which and the forces with which alone his labor can act.</p>
<p align="left">The moment this distinction is realized, that moment is it seen that the sanction
  which natural justice gives to one species of property is denied to the other.</p>
<p align="left">For as labor cannot produce without the use of land, the denial of the equal
  right to the use of land is necessarily the denial of the right of labor to
  its own produce. If one man can command the land upon which others must labor,
  he can appropriate the produce of their labor as the price of his permission
  to labor. The fundamental law of nature, that her enjoyment by man shall be
  consequent upon his exertion, is thus violated. The one receives without producing;
  the others produce without receiving. The one is unjustly enriched; the others
  are robbed.</p>
<p align="left"> Place one hundred men on an island from which there is no escape, and whether
    you make one of these men the absolute owner of the other ninety-nine, or
    the absolute owner of the soil of the island, will make no difference either
    to him or to them. In the one case, as the other, the one will be the absolute
    master of the ninety-nine &#8212; his power extending even to life and death,
    for simply to refuse them permission to live upon the island would be to
force them into the sea.</p>
<p align="left">Upon a larger scale, and through more complex relations, the same cause must
  operate in the same way and to the same end &#8212; the ultimate result, the
  enslavement of laborers, becoming apparent just as the pressure increases which
  compels them to live on and from land which is treated as the exclusive property
  of others.</p>
<p align="left">Yet, it will be said: As every man has a right to the use and enjoyment of
  nature, the man who is using land must be permitted the exclusive right to
  its use in order that he may get the full benefit of his labor. But there is
  no difficulty in determining where the individual right ends and the common
  right begins. A delicate and exact test is supplied by value, and with its
  aid there is no difficulty, no matter how dense population may become, in determining
  and securing the exact rights of each, the equal rights of all.</p>
<p align="left">The <em>value</em> of land, as we have seen, is the price of monopoly. It is not the
  absolute, but the relative, capability of land that determines its value. No
  matter what may be its intrinsic qualities land that is no better than other
  land which may be had for the using can have no value. And the value of land
  always measures the difference between it and the best land that may be had
  for the using. Thus, the value of land expresses in exact and tangible form
  the right of the community in land held by an individual; and rent expresses
  the exact amount which the individual should pay to the community to satisfy
  the equal rights of all other members of the community.</p>
<p align="left">Thus, if we concede to priority of possession the undisturbed use of land,
  taxing rent into the public treasury for the benefit of the community, we reconcile
  the fixity of tenure which is necessary for improvement with a full and complete
  recognition of the equal rights of all to the use of land.</p>
<p align="left">Consider what rent is. It does not arise spontaneously from land; it is due
  to nothing that the land owners have done. It represents a value created by
  the whole community.</p>
<p align="left">Let the land holders have, if you please, all that the possession of the land
  would give them in the absence of the rest of the community. But rent, the
  creation of the whole community, necessarily belongs to the whole community.*</p>

<blockquote><p align="left"><font size="-1">* To the view of the extreme conservative that due consideration
      for the claims of rent receivers negatives the adoption of such a policy,
      it may be replied that society as such is under no obligation to maintain
      an unchanged policy through out all future time. Public policies are constantly
      changing in such ways as to disappoint the expectations of persons who
      have invested on the supposition that policies would not change and to
      affect the value of their property. Tarriffs are raised, and lowered. The
      brewing of spirituous liquors is at one time permitted and at another time
      outlawed. Prices of monopolized services are first left to be fixed by
      the monopolist and are then regulated. Taxes are increased on some goods
      and decreased on others. In some communities taxes have already been made
      higher on land values than on improvements. Purchasers of land have no
      right to insist that society may not, even by gradual steps, discriminate
      in taxation against land rent, which is an income socially produced. (Henry
      George himself elsewhere said -- Century Magazine, July, 1890 -- that &quot;we
      cannot get to the Single Tax at one leap, but only by gradual steps.&quot;)
      We must presume that land owners, like other persons, buy their property
      with no guarantee that public policy will never change. The conservative
      insistence that society, which makes frequent changes of policy in other
      matters, is under a binding implied pledge and obligation never to move,
      even by successive steps, towards the eventual taking of the economic rent
      of land by taxation, seems preposterous. H. G. B.</font></p>

      <br>
  By making use of this existing machinery, we may, without jar or shock, assert

<p align="left">In form, the ownership of land would remain just as now. No owner of land
  need be dispossessed, and no restriction need be placed upon the amount of
  land any one could hold. For, rent being taken by the State in taxes, land,
  no matter in whose name it stood, or in what parcels it was held, would be
  really common property, and every member of the community would participate
  in the advantages of its ownership.</p>
<p align="left">Now, insomuch as the taxation of rent, or land values, must necessarily be
  increased just as we abolish other taxes, we may put the proposition into practical
  form by proposing &#8212;</p>
<p align="left"> <strong><em>To Abolish All Taxation Save That Upon Land Values.</em></strong></p>
<p align="left">As we have seen, the value of land is at the beginning of society nothing,
  but as society develops by the increase of population and the advance of the
  arts, it becomes greater and greater. </p>
<p align="left">In every civilized country, even the
    newest, the value of the land taken as a whole is sufficient to bear the
  entire expenses of government. In the better developed countries it is much
  more than
    sufficient. Hence it will not be enough merely to place all taxes upon the
    value of land. It will be necessary, where rent exceeds the present governmental
    revenues, commensurately to increase the amount demanded in taxation, and
  to continue this increase as society progresses and rent advances. But this
  is
    so natural and easy a matter, that it may be considered as involved, or at
    least understood, in the proposition to put all taxes on the value of land.
    That is the first step upon which the practical struggle must be made. When
    the hare is once caught and killed, cooking him will follow as a matter of
    course. When the common right to land is so far appreciated that all taxes
    are abolished save those which fall upon rent, there is no danger of much
  more than is necessary to induce them to collect the public revenues being
  left
    to individual landholders.</p>
<p align="left">Wherever the idea of concentrating all taxation upon land values finds lodgment
  sufficient to induce consideration, it invariably makes way, but there are
  few of the classes most to be benefited by it, who at first, or even for a
  long time afterward, see its full significance and power. It is difficult for
  workingmen to get over the idea that there is a real antagonism between capital
  and labor. It is difficult for small farmers and
  homestead owners to get over the idea that to put all taxes on the value of
  land would be unduly to tax them. It is difficult for both classes to get over
  the idea that to exempt capital from taxation would be to make the rich richer,
  and the poor poorer.</p>
<p align="left">These ideas spring from confused thought. But behind ignorance and prejudice
  there is a powerful interest, which has hitherto dominated literature, education,
  and opinion. A great wrong always dies hard, and the great wrong which in every
  civilized country condemns the masses of men to poverty and want, will not
  die without a bitter struggle.</p>
<div align="left"><strong>8<a name="8"></a>. Why a Land-Value Tax is Better than an Equal Tax
      on All Property </strong> </div>
<p align="left">The ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of property is commonly
  insisted upon is that it is equally protected by the state. The basis of this
  idea is evidently that the enjoyment of property is made possible by the state &#8212; that
  there is a value created and maintained by the community, which is justly called
  upon to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true? Only of
  the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community is
  formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of the community.
  It exists only as the community exists. Scatter again the largest community,
  and land, now so valuable, would have no value at all. With every increase
  of population the value of land rises; with every decrease it falls. This is
  true of nothing else save of things which, like the ownership of land, are
  in their nature monopolies.</p>
<p align="left">The tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all taxes.
  It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit,
and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by
  the community, for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation
of the community. It is the application of the common property to common uses.
  When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will
  the equality ordained by Nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage
  over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence;
  and each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor
get its full reward, and capital its natural return.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong>9<a name="9"></a>. Alleged Difficulty of Distinguishing Land From
      Improvements </strong> </p>
  <p align="left">The only objection to the tax on rent or land values which is to be met with
  in standard politico-economic works is one which concedes its advantages &#8212; for
  it is, that from the difficulty of separation, we might, in taxing the rent
  of land, tax something else. McCulloch, for instance, declares taxes on the
  rent of land to be impolitic and unjust because the return received for the
  natural and inherent powers of the soil cannot be clearly distinguished from
  the return received from improvements and meliorations, which might thus be
  discouraged. Macaulay somewhere says that if the admission of the attraction
  of gravitation were inimical to any considerable pecuniary interest, there
  would not be wanting arguments against gravitation &#8212; a truth of which
  this objection is an illustration. For admitting that it is impossible invariably
  to separate the value of land from the value of improvements, is this necessity
  of continuing to tax some improvements any reason why we should continue to
  tax all improvements? If it discourage production to tax values which labor
  and capital have intimately combined with that of land, how much greater discouragement
  is involved in taxing not only these, but all the clearly distinguishable values
  which labor and capital create?</p>
<p align="left">But, as a matter of fact, the value of land can always be readily distinguished
  from the value of improvements. In countries like the United States there is
  much valuable land that has never been improved; and in many of the States
  the value of the land and
    the value of improvements are habitually estimated separately by the assessors,
  though afterward reunited under the term real estate. Nor where ground has
  been occupied from immemorial times, is there any difficulty in getting at
  the value of the bare land, for frequently the land
    is owned by one person and the buildings by another, and when a fire occurs
    and improvements are destroyed, a clear and definite value remains in the
  land. In the oldest country in the world no difficulty whatever can attend
  the separation, if all that be attempted is to separate the value of the clearly
    distinguishable improvements, made within a moderate period, from the value
  of the land, should they be destroyed. This, manifestly, is all that justice
  or policy requires. Absolute accuracy is impossible in any system, and to attempt
  to separate all that the human
  race has done from what nature originally provided would be as absurd as impracticable.
  A swamp drained or a hill terraced by the Romans constitutes now as much a
  part of the natural advantages of the British Isles as though the work had
  been done by earthquake or glacier. The fact that after a certain lapse of
  time the value of such permanent improvements would be considered as having
  lapsed into that of the land, and would be taxed accordingly, could have no
  deterrent effect on such improvements, for such works are frequently undertaken
  upon leases for years. The fact is, that each generation builds and improves
  for itself, and not for the remote future. And the further fact is, that each
  generation is heir, not only to the natural powers of the earth, but to all
  that remains of the work of past generations.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>10<a name="10"></a>. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production </strong> </p>
<p align="left"> The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
  one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
  as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
  of the use of money for barter.</p>
<p align="left">To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
  of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
  by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
  raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
  important the more they are considered. This is the secret which would transform
  the little village into the great city.* With all the burdens removed which
  now oppress industry and hamper
  exchange, the production of wealth would go on with a rapidity now undreamed
  of. This, in its turn, would lead to an increase in the value of land &#8212; a
  new surplus which society might take for general purposes. And released from
  the difficulties which attend the collection of revenue in a way that begets
  corruption and renders legislation the tool of special
    interests, society could assume functions which the increasing complexity
    of life makes it desirable to assume, but which the prospect of political
    demoralization under the present system now leads thoughtful men to shrink
  from.</p>

<p align="left">Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
<p align="left">To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
  of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
  an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
  would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
  felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
  exchange like artificial deserts and mountains; it costs more to get goods
  through a custom house than it does to carry them around the world. It operates
  upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine upon those qualities.
  If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have been contented
  to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to make
  me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than you. If
  I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt. If a man build
  a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he had done an injury to
  the state; if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as
  though it were a public nuisance; if a manufactory be erected we levy upon
  it an annual sum which would go far toward making a handsome profit. We say
  we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among us, we charge
  him for it as though we were giving him a privilege. We punish with a tax the
  man who covers barren fields with ripening grain, we fine him who puts up machinery,
  and him who drains a swamp. How heavily these taxes burden production only
  those realize who have attempted to follow our system of taxation through its
  ramifications, for, as I have
  before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
  prices.</p>
<p align="left">To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
  from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
  the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship; the
  farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would be
  free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed by
  the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
  more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state
  would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising
  as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined for
  making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not be taxed
  for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
  the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
  the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
  reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
  The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
  to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
  enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
  advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
  the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
  to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
  supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
  it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
  rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
  else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
  besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
<p align="left">Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
  to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
  and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
  and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
  And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
  and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
  labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
  this would commensurately increase.</p>
<p align="left">And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
  or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
  of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
  one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
  would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
<p align="left">The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its death
  blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions of acres
  from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned by their
  present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this not merely
  on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled districts.</p>
<div align="left">
  <blockquote>&nbsp;
    </blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote><p align="left"><font size="-1">* The fact that a tax on the rental value of land cannot
      be shifted by landowners to tenants, though recognized by all competent
      economists, is sometimes a stumbling block to persons untrained in economics.
      The reason such a tax cannot be shifted is that it cannot limit the supply
      of land. Landowners are presumably, before the tax is laid, charging all
      the rent they can get. There is nothing in a tax on the rental value of
      land to make tenants willing to pay more or to make land more difficult
      to hire. On the contrary, more land will be on the market, because of such
      a tax, rather than less, since the tax puts a heavy penalty on holding
      land out of use and unimproved for mere speculation. The competition of
      former vacant land speculators to get their land used will make land cheaper
      to rent rather than more expensive. And since only the net rent remaining
      after the tax is subtracted is capitalized into salable value, land will
      be very much cheaper to buy. H.G.B.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
  land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as agricultural
  land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep land from its
  most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for it than the use
  to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had
  attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
  would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a
  field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter how costly, would
  have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so much land idle. The monopolist
  of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though his land were covered
  with houses and barns, with crops and with stock. The owner
  of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the privilege of keeping
  other people off of it until he wanted to use it, as his neighbor
    who has a fine house upon his lot. It would cost as much to keep a row of
  tumble-down shanties upon valuable land as though it were covered with a grand
  hotel or a pile of great warehouses
  filled with costly goods.</p>
<p align="left">Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
  labor can be exerted would disappear. The farmer would not have to pay out
  half his means, or mortgage his labor for years, in order to obtain land to
  cultivate; the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much
  for a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*; the company that proposed
  to erect a manufactory would not have to expend a great part of its capital
  for a site. And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be
  in lieu of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.</p>

              have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this point.
              Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the greater
              cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is trying to
              save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for, it is said,
              the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset the lower
              purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that even if the
              lower price of land does no more than balance the higher tax on it,
              (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement to speculation
              in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes is all clear gain.
              It is easier to save in proportion as earnings and commodities are
              relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling
              price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
              its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully
              paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase price,
              but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and

<p align="left">Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition would
  no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with each other
  for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point of
  bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers, and
  wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market would
  have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment of labor, a
  competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
  demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to bid
  against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade and increased
  profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
  upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
  monopolization.</p>
<p align="left"> With natural opportunities thus free to labor; with capital and improvements
  exempt from tax, and exchange released from restrictions, the spectacle of
  willing men unable to turn their labor into
the things they are suffering for would become impossible; the recurring paroxysms
which paralyze industry would cease; every wheel of production would be set in
motion; demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand; trade would
increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>11<a name="11"></a>. Effect of Remedy Upon the Sharing of Wealth</strong></p>
<p align="left"> But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
  burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
  consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
<p align="left">Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
  in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
  inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
  as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
  a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
  capital.</p>
<p align="left">Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
  and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
  this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
  the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
  instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
  capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
  state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
  would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
<p align="left">That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided into
  two portions. One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
  producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;
  the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed in public
  benefits to all its members. In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young children
  and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as the vigorous.
  And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents the result of individual
  effort in production, the other represents the increased power with which the
  community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
<p align="left">Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
  community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
  as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
  equality.</p>
<p align="left">Who can say to what infinite powers the wealth-producing capacity of labor
  may not be raised by social adjustments which will give to the producers of
  wealth their fair proportion of its advantages and enjoyments! With present
  processes the gain would be simply incalculable, but just as wages are high,
  so do the invention and utilization of improved processes and machinery go
  on with greater rapidity and ease.</p>
<p align="left"> But I shall not deny, and do not wish to lose sight of the fact, that while
  thus preventing waste and thus adding to the efficiency of labor, the equalization
  in the distribution of wealth that would result from the simple plan of taxation
  that I propose, must lessen the intensity with which wealth is pursued. It
  seems to me that in a condition of society in which no one need fear poverty,
  no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at least, no one would take the trouble
  to strive and to strain for it as men do now. For, certainly, the spectacle
  of men who have only a few years to live, slaving away their time for the sake
  of dying rich, is in itself so unnatural and absurd, that in a state of society
  where the abolition of the fear of want had dissipated the envious admiration
  with which the masses of men now regard the possession of great riches, whoever
  would toil to acquire more than he cared to use would be looked upon as we
  would now look on a man who would thatch his head with half a dozen hats.</p>
<p align="left">And though this incentive to production be withdrawn, can we not spare it?
  Whatever may have been its office in an earlier stage of development, it is
  not needed now. The dangers that menace our civilization do not come from the
  weakness of the springs of production. What it suffers from, and what, if a
  remedy be not applied, it must die from, is unequal distribution!</p>
<p align="left">Nor would the removal of this incentive, regarded only from the standpoint
  of production, be an unmixed loss. For, that the aggregate of production is
  greatly reduced by the greed with which riches are pursued, is one of the most
  obtrusive facts of modern society. While, were this insane desire to get rich
  at any cost lessened, mental activities now devoted to scraping together riches
  would be translated into far higher spheres of usefulness.</p>
<div align="center"><strong>12<a name="12"></a>. Effect of Remedy Upon Various Economic Classes </strong> </div>
<p align="left">When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
  are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to the
  fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this is a proposition
  to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection will show
  that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests as landholders
  do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists, or both.
  And further consideration will show that though the large landholders may lose
  relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain. For, the
  increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will gain very
  much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in these gains,
  and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition, the whole
  community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</p>
<p align="left"> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
    all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head &#8212; laborers,
    operatives, mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts. It is manifest,
    also, that
  it will benefit all those who live partly by wages and partly by the earnings
  of their capital &#8212; storekeepers, merchants,
    manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of all sorts
    from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner &#8212; and
    it is likewise manifest that it will increase the incomes of those whose
    incomes
  are drawn from the earnings of capital.</p>
<p align="left">Take, now, the case of the homestead owner &#8212; the mechanic, storekeeper,
  or professional man who has secured himself a house and lot, where he lives,
  and
  which he contemplates with satisfaction as a place from which his family cannot
  be ejected in case of his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary, he
  will be the gainer. The selling value of his lot will diminish &#8212; theoretically
  it will entirely disappear. But its usefulness to him will not disappear. It
  will serve his purpose as well as ever. While, as the value of all other lots
  will diminish or disappear in the same ratio, he retains the same security
  of always having a lot that he had before. That is to say, he is a loser only
  as the man who has bought himself a pair of boots may be said to be a loser
  by a subsequent fall in the price of boots. His boots will be just as useful
  to him, and the next pair of boots he can get cheaper. </p>
<p align="left">So, to the homestead
    owner, his lot will be as useful, and should he look forward to getting a
  larger lot, or having his children, as they grow up, get homesteads of their
  own,
    he will, even in the matter of lots, be the gainer. And in the present, other
    things considered, he will be much the gainer. For though he will have more
    taxes to pay upon his land, he will be released from taxes upon his house
  and improvements, upon his furniture and personal property, upon all that he
  and
    his family eat, drink and wear, while his earnings will be largely increased
    by the rise of wages, the constant employment, and the increased briskness
    of trade. His only loss will be, if he wants to sell his lot without getting
    another, and this will be a small loss compared with the great gain.</p>
<p align="left">And so with the farmer. I speak not now of the farmers who never touch the
  handles of a plow, but of the working farmers who constitute such a large class
  in the United States &#8212; men who own small farms, which they cultivate
  with the aid of their boys, and perhaps some hired help, and who in Europe
  would
  be called peasant proprietors. </p>
<p align="left">Paradoxical as it may appear to these men until
    they understand the full bearings of the proposition, of all classes above
    that of the mere laborer they have most to gain by placing all taxes upon
  the value of land. That they do not now get as good a living as their hard
  work
    ought to give them, they generally feel, though they may not be able to trace
    the cause. The fact is that taxation, as now levied, falls on them with peculiar
    severity. They are taxed on all their improvements -- houses, barns, fences,
    crops, stock. The personal property which they have cannot be as readily
  concealed or undervalued as can the more valuable kinds which are concentrated
  in the
    cities. They are not only taxed on personal property and improvements, which
    the owners of unused land escape, but their land is generally taxed at a
  higher rate than land held on speculation, simply because it is improved. But
  further
    than this, all taxes imposed on commodities, and especially the taxes which,
    like our protective duties, are imposed with a view of raising the prices
  of commodities, fall on the farmer without mitigation.</p>
<p align="left">The farmer would be a great gainer by the substitution of a single tax upon
  the value of land for all these taxes, for the taxation of land values would
  fall with greatest weight, not upon the agricultural districts, where land
  values are comparatively small, but upon the towns and cities where land values
  are high; whereas taxes upon personal property and improvements fall as heavily
  in the country as in the city. And in sparsely settled districts there would
  be hardly any taxes at all for the farmer to pay. For taxes, being levied upon
  the value of the bare land, would fall as heavily upon unimproved as upon improved
  land. Acre for acre, the improved and cultivated farm, with its buildings,
  fences, orchard, crops, and stock, could be taxed no more than unused land
  of equal quality. The result would be that speculative values would be kept
  down, and that cultivated and improved farms would have no taxes to pay until
  the country around them had been well settled. In fact, paradoxical as it may
  at first seem to them, the effect of putting all taxation upon the value of
  land would be to relieve the harder working farmers of all taxation.*</p>

      not have to pay any higher tax than if he kept it in run-down condition
      and with no buildings, orchards or other improvements on it. H.G.B</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">But the great gain of the working farmer can be seen only when the effect
  upon the distribution of population is considered. The destruction of speculative
  land values would tend to diffuse population where it is too dense and to concentrate
  it where it is too sparse; to substitute for the tenement house, homes surrounded
  by gardens, and fully to settle agricultural districts before people were driven
  far from neighbors to look for land. The people of the cities would thus get
  more of the pure air and sunshine of the country, the people of the country
  more of the economies and social life of the city. If, as is doubtless the
  case, the application of machinery tends to large fields, agricultural population
  will assume the primitive form and cluster in villages. The life of the average
  farmer is now unnecessarily dreary. He is not only compelled to work early
  and late, but he is cut off by the sparseness of population from the conveniences,
  and amusements, the educational facilities, and the social and intellectual
  opportunities that come with the closer contact of man with man. He would be
  far better off in all these respects, and his labor would be far more productive,
  if he and those around him held no more land than they wanted to use. While
  his children, as they grew up, would neither be so impelled to seek the excitement
  of a city nor would they be driven so far away to seek farms of their own.
  Their means of living would be in their own hands, and at home.</p>
<p align="left"> In short, the working farmer is both a laborer and a capitalist, as well
  as a landowner, and it is by his labor and capital that his living is made.
  His loss would be nominal; his gain would be real and great. </p>
<p align="left">In varying degrees
    is this true of all landholders. Many landholders are laborers of one sort
    or another. This measure would make no one poorer but such as could be made
    a great deal poorer without being really hurt. It would cut down great fortunes,
    but it would impoverish no one.</p>
<p align="left">Wealth would not only be enormously increased; it would be equally distributed.
  I do not mean that each individual would get the same amount of wealth. That
  would not be equal distribution, so long as different individuals have different
  powers and different desires. But I mean that wealth would be distributed in
  accordance with the degree in which the industry, skill, knowledge, or prudence
  of each contributed to the common stock. The great cause which concentrates
  wealth in the hands of those who do not produce, and takes it from the hands
  of those who do, would be gone. The inequalities that continued to exist would
  be those of nature, not the artificial inequalities produced by the denial
  of natural law. The nonproducer would no longer roll in luxury while the producer
  got but the barest necessities of animal existence.</p>
<div align="center"><strong>13<a name="13"></a>. Effect of Remedy Upon Social Ideals </strong> </div>
<p align="left">From whence springs this lust for gain, to gratify which men tread everything
  pure and noble under their feet; to which they sacrifice all the higher possibilities
  of life; which converts civility into a hollow pretense, patriotism into a
  sham, and religion into hypocrisy; which makes so much of civilized existence
  an Ishmaelitish warfare, of which the weapons are cunning and fraud?</p>
<p align="left">Does it not spring from the existence of want? Carlyle somewhere says that
  poverty is the hell of which the modern Englishman is most afraid. And he is
  right. Poverty is the openmouthed, relentless hell which yawns beneath civilized
  society. And it is hell enough. The Vedas declare no truer thing than when
  the wise crow Bushanda tells the eagle-bearer of Vishnu that the keenest pain
  is in poverty. For poverty is not merely deprivation; it means shame, degradation;
  the searing of the most sensitive parts of our moral and mental nature as with
  hot irons; the denial of the strongest impulses and the sweetest affections;
  the wrenching of the most vital nerves. You love your wife, you love your children;
  but would it not be easier to see them die than to see them reduced to the
  pinch of want in which large classes in every highly civilized community live?
  The strongest of animal passions is that with which we cling to life, but it
  is an everyday occurrence in civilized societies for men to put poison to their
  mouths or pistols to their heads from fear of poverty, and for one who does
  this there are probably a hundred who have the desire, but are restrained by
  instinctive shrinking, by religious considerations, or by family ties.</p>
<p align="left">From this hell of poverty, it is but natural that men should make every effort
  to escape. With the impulse to self-preservation and self-gratification combine
  nobler feelings, and love as well as fear urges in the struggle. Many a man
  does a mean thing, a dishonest thing, a greedy and grasping and unjust thing,
  in the effort to place above want, or the fear of want, mother or wife or children.</p>
<p align="left">And out of this condition of things arises a public opinion which enlists,
  as an impelling power in the struggle to grasp and to keep, one of the strongest
  perhaps with many men the very strongest springs of human action. The desire
  for approbation, the feeling that urges us to win the respect, admiration,
  or sympathy of our fellows, is instinctive and universal. Distorted sometimes
  into the most abnormal manifestations, it may yet be everywhere perceived.
  It is potent with the veriest savage, as with the most highly cultivated member
  of the most polished society; it shows itself with the first gleam of intelligence,
  and persists to the last breath. It triumphs over the love of ease, over the
  sense of pain, over the dread of death. It dictates the most trivial and the
  most important actions.</p>
<p align="left"> Now, men admire what they desire. How sweet to the storm-stricken seems the
  safe harbor; food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, warmth to the shivering,
  rest to the weary, power to the weak, knowledge to him in whom the intellectual
  yearnings of the soul have been aroused. And thus the sting of want and the
  fear of want make men admire above all things the possession of riches, and
  to become wealthy is to become respected, and admired, and influential. Get
  money &#8212; honestly, if you can, but at any rate get money! This is the
  lesson that society is daily and hourly dinning in the ears of its members.
  Men instinctively admire virtue and truth, but the sting of want and the fear
  of want make them even more strongly admire the rich and sympathize with the
  fortunate. It is well to be honest and just, and men will commend it; but he
  who by fraud and injustice gets him a million dollars will have more respect,
  and admiration, and influence, more eye service and lip service, if not heart
  service, than he who refuses it. The one may have his reward in the future;
  he may know that his name is writ in the Book of Life, and that for him is
  the white robe and the palm branch of the victor against temptation; but the
  other has his reward in the present. His name is writ in the list of &quot;our
  substantial citizens&quot;;
  he has the courtship of men and the flattery of women; the best pew in the
  church
  and the personal regard of the eloquent clergyman who in the name of Christ
  preaches the Gospel of Dives, and tones down into
    a meaningless flower of Eastern speech the stern metaphor of the camel and
the needle's eye. He may be a patron of arts, a M&aelig;cenas to men of letters;
may profit by the converse of the intelligent, and be polished by the attrition
of the refined. His alms may feed the poor, and help the struggling, and bring
sunshine into desolate places; and noble public institutions commemorate, after
he is gone, his name and his fame. It is not in the guise of a hideous monster,
with horns and tail, that Satan tempts the children of men, but as an angel of
light. His promises
    are not alone of the kingdoms of the world, but of mental and moral principalities
    and powers. He appeals not only to the animal appetites, but to the cravings
that stir in man because he is more than an animal.</p>
<p align="left">Give labor a free field and its full earnings; take for the benefit of the
  whole community that fund which the growth of the community creates, and want
  and the fear of want would be gone. The springs of production would be set
  free, and the enormous increase of wealth would give the poorest ample comfort.
  Men would no more worry about finding employment than they worry about finding
  air to breathe; they need have no more care about physical necessities than
  do the lilies of the field. The progress of science, the march of invention,
  the diffusion of knowledge, would bring their benefits to all.</p>
<p align="left">With this abolition of want and the fear of want, the admiration of riches
  would decay, and men would seek the respect and approbation of their fellows
  in other modes than by the acquisition and display of wealth. In this way there
  would be brought to the management of public affairs, and the administration
  of common funds, the skill, the attention, the fidelity, and integrity that
  can now be secured only for private interests</p>
<p align="left">Shortsighted is the philosophy which counts on selfishness as the master motive
  of human action. It is blind to facts of which the world is full. It sees not
  the present, and reads not the past aright. If you would move men to action,
  to what shall you appeal? Not to their pockets, but to their patriotism; not
  to selfishness, but to sympathy. Self-interest is, as it were, a mechanical
  force &#8212; potent, it is true; capable of large and wide results. But there
  is in human nature what may be likened to a chemical force; which melts and
  fuses and overwhelms; to which nothing seems impossible. &quot;All that a man
  hath will he give for his life&quot; &#8212; that is self-interest. But in
  loyalty to higher impulses men will give even life.</p>
<p align="left"> It is not selfishness that enriches the annals of every people with heroes
    and saints. It is not selfishness that on every page of the world's history
  bursts out in sudden splendor of noble deeds or sheds the soft radiance of
  benignant
    lives. It was not selfishness that turned Gautama's back to his royal home
  or bade the Maid of Orleans lift the sword from the altar; that held the Three
      Hundred in the Pass of Thermopyl&aelig; or gathered into Winkelried's bosom
      the sheaf of spears; that chained Vincent de Paul to the bench of the galley,
      or brought little starving children, during the Indian famine, tottering
    to the relief stations with yet weaker starvelings in their arms. Call it
      religion, patriotism, sympathy, the enthusiasm for humanity, or the love
      of God &#8212; give it what name you will; there is yet a force which
  overcomes and drives out selfishness; a force which is the electricity of the
  moral universe; a force beside which all others are weak. Everywhere that men
  have lived it has shown its power, and today, as ever, the world is full of
  it. To be pitied is the man who has never seen and never felt it. Look around!
  among common men and women, amid the care and the struggle of daily life, in
  the jar of the noisy street and amid the squalor where want hides &#8212; every
  here and there is the darkness lighted with the tremulous play of its lambent
  flames. He who has not seen it has walked with shut eyes. He who looks may
  see, as says Plutarch, that &quot;the soul has a principle of kindness in itself,
  and is born to love, as well as to perceive, think, or remember.&quot;</p>
<p align="left">The will within us is the ultimate fact of consciousness. Yet how little have
  the best of us, in acquirements, in position, even in character, that may be
  credited entirely to ourselves; how much to the influences that have molded
  us. Who is there, wise, learned, discreet, or strong, who might not, were he
  to trace the inner history of his life, turn, like the Stoic Emperor, to give
  thanks to the gods, that by this one and that one, and here and there, good
  examples have been set him, noble thoughts have reached him, and happy opportunities
  opened before him.</p>
<p align="left">To remove want and the fear of want, to give to all classes leisure, and comfort,
  and independence, the decencies and refinements of life, the opportunities
  of mental and moral development, would be like turning water into a desert.
  The sterile waste would clothe itself with verdure, and the barren places where
  life seemed banned would ere long be dappled with the shade of trees and musical
  with the song of birds. Talents now hidden, virtues unsuspected, would come
  forth to make human life richer, fuller, happier, nobler. For in these round
  men who are stuck into three-cornered holes, and three-cornered men who are
  jammed into round holes; in these men who are wasting their energies in the
  scramble to be rich; in these who in factories are turned into machines, or
  are chained by necessity to bench or plow; in these children who are growing
  up in squalor, and vice, and ignorance, are powers of the highest order, talents
  the most splendid. They need but the opportunity to bring them forth.</p>
<p align="left">Consider the possibilities of a state of society that gave that opportunity
  to all. Let imagination fill out the picture; its colors grow too bright for
  words to paint. Consider the moral elevation, the intellectual activity, the
  social life. Consider how by a thousand actions and interactions the members
  of every community
  are linked together, and how in the present condition of things
    even the fortunate few who stand upon the apex of the social pyramid must
    suffer, though they know it not, from the want, ignorance, and degradation
that are underneath. Consider these things and then say whether the change I
  propose would not be for the benefit of every one &#8212; even the greatest
landholder?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><strong>14<a name="14"></a>. Liberty, and Equality of Opportunity </strong> </div>
<p align="left">The truth to which we were led in the politico-economic branch of our inquiry
  is as clearly apparent in the rise and fall of nations and the growth and decay
  of civilizations, and it accords with those deep-seated recognitions of relation
  and sequence that we denominate moral perceptions. Thus are given to our conclusions
  the greatest certitude and highest sanction.</p>
<p align="left">This truth involves both a menace and a promise. It shows that the evils arising
  from the unjust and unequal distribution of wealth, which are becoming more
  and more apparent as modern civilization goes on, are not incidents of progress,
  but tendencies which must bring progress to a halt; that they will not cure
  themselves, but, on the contrary, must, unless their cause is removed, grow
  greater and greater, until they sweep us back into barbarism by the road every
  previous civilization has trod. But it also shows that these evils are not
  imposed by natural laws; that they spring solely from social maladjustments
  which ignore natural laws, and that in removing their cause we shall be giving
  an enormous impetus to progress.</p>
<p align="left">The poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes men, and
  all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a denial of justice.
  In permitting the monopolization of the opportunities which nature freely offers
  to all, we have ignored the fundamental law of justice &#8212; for, so far
  as we can see, when we view things upon a large scale, justice seems to be
  the supreme law of the universe. But by sweeping away this injustice and asserting
  the rights of all men to natural opportunities, we shall conform ourselves
  to the law &#8212; we shall remove the great cause of unnatural inequality
  in the distribution of wealth and power; we shall abolish poverty; tame the
  ruthless passions of greed; dry up the springs of vice and misery; light in
  dark places the lamp of knowledge; give new vigor to invention and a fresh
  impulse to discovery; substitute political strength for political weakness;
  and make tyranny and anarchy impossible.</p>
<p align="left">The reform I have proposed accords with all that is politically, socially,
  or morally desirable. It has the qualities of a true reform, for it will make
  all other reforms easier. What is it but the carrying out in letter and spirit
  of the truth enunciated in the Declaration of Independence &#8212; the &quot;self-evident&quot; truth
  that is the heart and soul of the Declaration &#8212;<em>&quot;That all men
  are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
  rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!&quot;</em></p>
<p align="left">These rights are denied when the equal right to land &#8212; on which and
  by which men alone can live &#8212; is denied. Equality of political rights
  will not compensate for the denial of the equal right to the bounty of nature.
  Political liberty, when the equal right to land is denied, becomes, as population
  increases and invention goes on, merely the liberty to compete for employment
  at starvation wages. This is the truth that we have ignored. And so there come
  beggars in our streets and tramps on our roads; and poverty enslaves men who
  we boast are political sovereigns; and want breeds ignorance that our schools
  cannot enlighten; and citizens vote as their masters dictate; and the demagogue
  usurps the part of the statesman; and gold weighs in the scales of justice;
  and in high places sit those who do not pay to civic virtue even the compliment
  of hypocrisy; and the pillars of the republic that we thought so strong already
  bend under an increasing strain.</p>
<p align="left">We honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her statues and sound her
  praises. But we have not fully trusted her. And with our growth so grow her
  demands. She will have no half service!</p>
<p align="left">Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty boastings.
  For Liberty means Justice, and Justice is the natural law &#8212; the law of
  health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and co-operation.</p>
<p align="left">They who look upon Liberty as having accomplished her mission when she has
  abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot, who think of her
  as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life, have not seen
  her real grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her must seem
  rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of life, as well
  as of light; as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support all growth,
  supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise be a cold and inert
  mass all the infinite diversities of being and beauty, so is liberty to mankind.
  It is not for an abstraction that men have toiled and died; that in every age
  the witnesses of Liberty have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have
  suffered.</p>
<p align="left">We speak of Liberty as one thing, and of virtue, wealth, knowledge, invention,
  national strength, and national independence as other things. But, of all these,
  Liberty is the source, the mother, the necessary condition. She is to virtue
  what light is to color; to wealth what sunshine is to grain; to knowledge what
  eyes are to sight. She is the genius of invention, the brawn of national strength,
  the spirit of national independence. Where Liberty rises, there virtue grows,
  wealth increases, knowledge expands, invention multiplies human powers, and
  in strength and spirit the freer nation rises among her neighbors as Saul amid
  his brethren &#8212; taller and fairer. Where Liberty sinks, there virtue fades,
  wealth diminishes, knowledge is forgotten, invention ceases, and empires once
  mighty in arms and arts become a helpless prey to freer barbarians!</p>
<p align="left">Only in broken gleams and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed
  among men, but all progress hath she called forth. Liberty came to a race of
  slaves crouching under Egyptian whips, and led them forth from the House of
  Bondage. She hardened them in the desert and
    made of them a race of conquerors. The free spirit of the Mosaic law took
    their thinkers up to heights where they beheld the unity of God, and inspired
  their poets with strains that yet phrase the highest exaltations of thought.
  Liberty dawned on the Phoenician coast, and ships passed the Pillars of Hercules
  to plow the unknown sea. She shed a partial light on Greece, and marble grew
  to shapes of ideal beauty, words became the instruments of subtlest thought,
  and against the
    scanty militia of free cities the countless hosts of the Great King broke
  like surges against a rock. She cast her beams on the four-acre farms of Italian
  husbandmen, and born of her strength a power came forth that conquered the
  world. They glinted
  from shields of German warriors, and Augustus wept his legions. Out of the
  night that followed her eclipse, her slanting rays fell again on free cities,
  and a lost learning revived, modern civilization began, a
    new world was unveiled; and as Liberty grew, so grew art, wealth, power,
    knowledge, and refinement. In the history of every nation we may read the
  same truth. It was the strength born of Magna Charta that won Crecy and Agincourt.
  It was the revival of Liberty from the despotism of the Tudors that glorified
    the Elizabethan age. It was the spirit that brought a crowned tyrant to the
  block that planted here the seed of a mighty tree. It was the energy of ancient
  freedom that, the moment it had gained unity, made Spain the mightiest power
  of the world, only to fall to the lowest depth
  of weakness when tyranny succeeded liberty. See, in France, all intellectual
  vigor dying under the tyranny of the Seventeenth Century to revive in splendor
  as Liberty awoke in the Eighteenth,
    and on the enfranchisement of French peasants in the Great Revolution, basing
  the wonderful strength that has in our time defied defeat.</p>
<p align="left">Shall we not trust her?</p>
<p align="left">In our time, as in times before, creep on the insidious forces that, producing
  inequality, destroy Liberty. On the horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty
  calls to us again. We must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either
  we must wholly accept her or she will not stay. It is not enough that men should
  vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before the law.
  They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities and means of
  life; they must stand on equal terms with reference to the bounty of nature.
  Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light! Either this, or darkness comes
  on, and the very forces that progress has evolved turn to powers that work
  destruction. This is the universal law. This is the lesson of the centuries.
  Unless its foundations be laid in justice the social structure cannot stand.</p>
<p align="left">Our primary social adjustment is a denial of justice. In allowing one man
  to own the land on which and from which other men must live, we have made them
  his bondsmen in a degree which increases as material progress goes on. This
  is the subtle alchemy that in ways they do not realize is extracting from the
  masses in every civilized country the fruits of their weary toil; that is instituting
  a harder and more hopeless slavery in place of that which has been destroyed;
  that is bringing political despotism out of political freedom, and must soon
  transmute democratic institutions into anarchy.</p>
<p align="left">It is this that turns the blessings of material progress into a curse. It
  is this that crowds human beings into noisome cellars and squalid tenement
  houses; that fills prisons and brothels; that goads men with want and consumes
  them with greed; that robs women of the grace and beauty of perfect womanhood;
  that takes from little children the joy and innocence of life's morning.</p>
<p align="left">Civilization so based cannot continue. The eternal laws of the universe forbid
  it. Ruins of dead empires testify, and the witness that is in every soul answers,
  that it cannot be. It is something grander than Benevolence, something more
  august than Charity &#8212; it is Justice herself that demands of us to right
  this wrong. Justice that will not be denied; that cannot be put off &#8212; Justice
  that with the scales carries the sword. Shall we ward the stroke with liturgies
  and prayers? Shall we avert the decrees of immutable law by raising churches
  when hungry infants moan and weary mothers weep?</p>
<p align="left">Though it may take the language of prayer, it is blasphemy that attributes
  to the inscrutable decrees of Providence the suffering and brutishness that
  come of poverty; that turns with folded hands to the All-Father and lays on
  Him the responsibility for the want and crime of our great cities. We degrade
  the Everlasting. We slander the Just One. A merciful man would have better
  ordered the world; a just man would crush with his foot such an ulcerous ant-hill!
  It is not the Almighty, but we who are responsible for the vice and misery
  that fester amid our civilization. The Creator showers upon us his gifts &#8212; more
  than enough for all. But like swine scrambling for food, we tread them in the
  mire &#8212; tread them in the mire, while we tear and rend each other!</p>
<p align="left">In the very centers of our civilization today are want and suffering enough
  to make sick at heart whoever does not close his eyes and steel his nerves.
  Dare we turn to the Creator and ask Him to relieve it? Supposing the prayer
  were heard, and at the behest with which the universe sprang into being there
  should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air; fresh vigor
  the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should spring up,
  and the seed that now increases fiftyfold should increase a hundredfold! Would
  poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no! Whatever benefit would accrue
  would be but temporary. The new powers streaming through the material universe
  could be utilized only through land.</p>
<p align="left">This is not merely a deduction of political economy; it is a fact of experience.
  We know it because we have seen it. Within our own times, under our very eyes,
  that Power which is above all, and in all, and through all; that Power of which
  the whole universe is but the manifestation; that Power which maketh all things,
  and without which is not anything made that is made, has increased the bounty
  which men may enjoy, as truly as though the fertility of nature had been increased.
  Into the mind of one came the thought that harnessed steam for the service
  of mankind. To the inner ear of another was whispered the secret that compels
  the lightning to bear a message round the globe. In every direction have the
  laws of matter been revealed; in every department of industry have arisen arms
  of iron and fingers of steel, whose effect upon the production of wealth has
  been precisely the same as an increase in the fertility of nature. What has
  been the result? Simply that landowners get all the gain.</p>
<p align="left">Can it be that the gifts of the Creator may be thus misappropriated with impunity?
  Is it a light thing that labor should be robbed of its earnings while greed
  rolls in wealth &#8212; that the many should want while the few are surfeited?
  Turn to history, and on every page may be read the lesson that such wrong never
  goes unpunished; that the Nemesis that follows injustice never falters nor
  sleeps! Look around today. Can this state of things continue? May we even say, &quot;After
  us the deluge!&quot; Nay; the pillars of the State are trembling even now,
  and the very foundations of society begin to quiver with pent-up forces that
  glow underneath. The struggle that must either revivify, or convulse in ruin,
  is near at hand, if it be not already begun.</p>
<p align="left">The fiat has gone forth! With steam and electricity, and the new powers born
  of progress, forces have entered the world that will either compel us to a
  higher plane or overwhelm us, as nation after nation, as civilization after
  civilization, have been overwhelmed before. It is the delusion which precedes
  destruction that sees in the popular unrest with which the civilized world
  is feverishly pulsing only the passing effect of ephemeral causes. Between
  democratic ideas and the aristocratic adjustments of society there is an irreconcilable
  conflict. Here in the United States, as there in Europe, it may be seen arising.
  We cannot go on permitting men to vote and forcing them to tramp. We cannot
  go on educating boys and girls in our public schools and then refusing them
the right to earn an honest living. We cannot go on prating of the inalienable
rights of man and then denying the inalienable right to the bounty of the Creator.
  Even now, in old bottles the new wine begins to ferment, and elemental forces
gather for the strife!</p>
<p align="left">But if, while there is yet time, we turn to Justice and obey her, if we trust
  Liberty and follow her, the dangers that now threaten must disappear, the forces
  that now menace will turn to agencies of elevation. Think of the powers now
  wasted; of the infinite fields of knowledge yet to be explored; of the possibilities
  of which the wondrous inventions of this century give us but a hint. With want
  destroyed; with greed changed to noble passions; with the fraternity that is
  born of equality taking the place of the jealousy and fear that now
array men against each other; with mental power loosed by conditions that give
to the humblest comfort and leisure; and who shall measure the heights to which
our civilization may soar? Words fail the thought! It is the Golden Age of which
  poets have sung and high-raised seers have told in metaphor! It is the glorious
  vision which has
  always haunted man with gleams of fitful splendor. It is what he saw whose
  eyes at Patmos were closed in a trance. It is the culmination of Christianity &#8212; the
  City of God on earth, with its walls of jasper and its gates of pearl! It is
the reign of the Prince of Peace!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><strong>15<a name="15"></a>. The Cross of a New Crusade </strong> </div>
<p align="left">My task is done.</p>
<p align="left">Yet the thought still mounts. The problems we have been considering lead into
  a problem higher and deeper still. Behind the problems of social life lies
  the problem of individual life. I have found it impossible to think of the
  one without thinking of the other, and so, I imagine, will it be with those
  who, reading this book, go with me in thought; for, whatever be its fate, it
  will be read by some who in their heart of hearts have taken the cross of a
  new crusade. This thought will come to them without my suggestion; but we are
  surer that we see a star when we know that others also see it.</p>
<p align="left">The truth that I have tried to make clear will not find easy acceptance. If
  that could be, it would have been accepted long ago. If that could be, it would
  never have been obscured. But it will find friends &#8212; those who will toil
  for it; suffer for it; if need be, die for it. This is the power of Truth.</p>
<p align="left">Will it at length prevail? Ultimately, yes. But in our own times, or in times
  of which any memory of us remains, who shall say?</p>
<p align="left">For the man who, seeing the want and misery, the ignorance and brutishness
  caused by unjust social institutions, sets himself, in so far as he has strength,
  to right them, there is disappointment and bitterness. So it has been of old
  time. So is it even now. But the bitterest thought &#8212; and it sometimes
  comes to the best and bravest &#8212; is that of the hopelessness of the effort,
  the futility of the sacrifice. To how few of those who sow the seed is it given
  to see it grow, or even with certainty to know that it will grow.</p>
<p align="left">Let us not disguise it. Over and over again has the standard of Truth and
  Justice been raised in this world. Over and over again has it been trampled
  down &#8212; oftentimes in blood. If they are weak forces that are opposed
  to Truth, how should Error so long prevail? If Justice has but to raise her
  head to have Injustice flee before her, how should the wail of the oppressed
  so long go up?</p>
<p align="left">But for those who see Truth and would follow her; for those who recognize
  Justice and would stand for her, success is not the only thing. Success! Why,
  Falsehood has often that to give; and Injustice often has that to give. Must
  not Truth and Justice have something to give that is their own by proper right &#8212; theirs
  in essence, and not by accident?</p>
<p align="left">That they have, and that here and now, every one who has felt their exaltation
  knows. But sometimes the clouds sweep down. It is sad, sad reading, the lives
  of the men who would have done something for their fellows. To Socrates they
  gave the hemlock; Gracchus they killed with sticks and stones; and One, greatest
  and purest of all, they crucified. And in penury and want, in neglect and contempt,
  destitute even of the sympathy that would have been so sweet, how many in every
  country have closed their eyes? This we see.</p>
<p align="left"><em>But do we see it all?</em></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> I have in this inquiry followed the course of my own thought. When, in mind,
  I set out on it I had no theory to support, no conclusions to prove. Only,
  when I first realized the squalid misery of a great city, it appalled and tormented
  me, and would not let me rest, for thinking of what caused it and how it could
  be cured.</p>
<p align="left">  Political Economy has been called the dismal science, and as currently taught,
  is hopeless and despairing. But this, as we have seen, is solely because she
  has been degraded and shackled; her truths dislocated; her harmonies ignored;
  the word she would utter gagged in her mouth, and her protest against wrong
  turned into an indorsement of injustice. Freed, as I have tried to free her &#8212; in
  her own proper symmetry, Political Economy is radiant with hope.</p>
<p align="left">For properly understood, the laws which govern the production and distribution
  of wealth show that the want and injustice of the present social state are
  not necessary; but that, on the contrary, a social state is possible in which
  poverty would be unknown, and all the better qualities and higher powers of
  human nature would have opportunity for full development.</p>
<p align="left">And, further than this, when we see that social development is governed neither
  by a Special Providence nor by a merciless fate, but by law, at once unchangeable
  and beneficent;
    when we see that human will is the great factor, and that taking men in the
aggregate, their condition is as they make it; when we see that economic law
  and moral law are essentially one, and that the truth which the intellect grasps
  after toilsome effort is but that which
    the moral sense reaches by a quick intuition, a flood of light breaks in
upon the problem of individual life. </p>
<p align="left">These countless millions like ourselves, who on this earth of ours have passed
  and still are passing, with their joys and sorrows, their toil and their striving,
  their aspirations and their fears, their strong perceptions of things deeper
  than sense, their common feelings which form the basis even of the most divergent
  creeds &#8212; their little lives do not seem so much like meaningless waste.</p>
<p align="left">The scriptures of the men who have been and gone &#8212; the Bibles, the Zend
  Avestas, the Vedas, the Dhammapadas, and the Korans; the esoteric doctrines
  of old philosophies, the inner meaning of grotesque religions, the dogmatic
  constitutions of Ecumenical Councils, the preachings of Foxes, and Wesleys,
  and Savonarolas, the traditions of red Indians, and beliefs of black savages,
  have a heart and core in which they agree &#8212; a something which seems like
  the variously distorted apprehensions of a primary truth. And out of the chain
  of thought we have been following there seems vaguely to rise a glimpse of
  what they vaguely saw &#8212; a shadowy gleam of ultimate relations, the endeavor
  to express which inevitably falls into type and allegory. A garden in which
  are set the trees of good and evil. A vineyard in which there is the Master's
  work to do. A passage &#8212; from life behind to life
beyond. A trial and a struggle, of which we cannot see the end.</p>
<p align="left">Look around today.</p>
<p align="left">Lo! here, now, in our civilized society, the old allegories yet have a meaning,
  the old myths are still true. Into the Valley of the Shadow of Death yet often
  leads the path of duty, through the streets of Vanity Fair walk Christian and
  Faithful, and on Greatheart's armor ring the clanging blows. Ormuzd still fights
  with Ahriman &#8212; the Prince of Light with the Powers of Darkness. He who
  will hear, to him the clarions of the battle call.</p>
<p align="left">How they call, and call, and call, till the heart swells that hears them!
  Strong soul and high endeavor, the world needs them now. Beauty still lies
  imprisoned, and iron wheels go over the good and true and beautiful that might
  spring from human lives.</p>
