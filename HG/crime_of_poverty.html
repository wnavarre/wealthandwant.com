<center><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Crime of Poverty</span>
<p> by Henry George</p>
An address delivered in the Opera House, <br>
Burlington, Iowa, April
1, 1885
</center>
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">"And as wages mounted to the
higher levels, then you would see the productive power increased. The
country where wages are high is the country of greatest productive
powers. Where wages are highest, there will invention be most active;
there will labor be most intelligent; there will be the greatest yield
for the expenditure of exertion."
  <p>The most astonishing thing to those Sioux chiefs who were recently
brought from the Far West and taken through our manufacturing cities in
the East, was not the marvellous inventions that enabled machinery to
act almost as if it had intellect; it was not the growth of our cities;
it was not the speed with which the railway car whirled along; it was
not the telegraph or the telephone that most astonished them; but the
fact that <span style="font-weight: bold;">amid this marvellous
development of productive power they found little children at work." ... </span></p>
  <p>No man, I think, ever saw a herd of buffalo, of which a few were fat and the
    great majority lean. No man ever saw a flock of birds, of which two or three

    is there anything like the poverty that festers in our
  civilisation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: 
</p>
<p>I PROPOSE to talk to you tonight of the Crime of Poverty. I
cannot, in a short time, hope to convince you of much; but the thing
of things I should like to show you is that poverty is a crime. I do
not mean that it is a crime to be poor. Murder is a crime; but it is
not a crime to be murdered; and a man who is in poverty, I look upon,
not as a criminal in himself, so much as the victim of a crime for
which others, as well perhaps as himself, are responsible. That
poverty is a curse, the bitterest of curses, we all know. Carlyle was
right when he said that the hell of which Englishmen are most afraid
is the hell of poverty; and this is true, not of Englishmen alone,
but of people all over the civilised world, no matter what their
nationality. It is to escape this hell that we strive and strain and
struggle; and work on oftentimes in blind habit long after the
necessity for work is gone. </p>
<p> The curse born of poverty is not confined to the poor alone; it
runs through all classes, even to the very rich. They, too, suffer;
they must suffer; for there cannot be suffering in a community from
which any class can totally escape. The vice, the crime, the
ignorance, the meanness born of poverty, poison, so to speak, the
very air which rich and poor alike must breathe. </p>
<p> Poverty is the mother of ignorance, the breeder of crime. I
walked down one of your streets this morning, and I saw three men
going along with their hands chained together. I knew for certain
that those men were not rich men; and, although I do not know the
offence for which they were carried in chains through your streets,
this I think I can safely say, that, if you trace it up you will find
it in some way to spring from poverty. Nine tenths of human misery, I
think you will find, if you look, to be due to poverty. If a man
chooses to be poor, he commits no crime in being poor, provided his
poverty hurts no one but himself. If a man has others dependent upon
him; if there are a wife and children whom it is his duty to support,
then, if he voluntarily chooses poverty, it is a crime &#8212; aye, and
I think that, in most cases, the men who have no one to support but
themselves are men that are shirking their duty. A woman comes into
the world for every man; and for every man who lives a single life,
caring only for himself, there is some woman who is deprived of her
natural supporter. But while a man who chooses to be poor cannot be
charged with crime, it is certainly a crime to force poverty on
others. And it seems to me clear that the great majority of those who
suffer from poverty are poor not from their own particular faults,
but because of conditions imposed by society at large. Therefore I
hold that poverty is a crime &#8211; not an individual crime, but a
social crime, a crime for which we all, poor as well as rich, are
responsible. </p>
<p> Two or three weeks ago I went one Sunday evening to the church of
a famous Brooklyn preacher. Mr. Sankey was singing and something like
a revival was going on there. The clergyman told some anecdotes
connected with the revival, and recounted some of the reasons why men
failed to become Christians. One case he mentioned struck me. He said
that he had noticed on the outskirts of the congregation, night after
night, a man who listened intently and who gradually moved forward.
One night, the clergyman said, he went to him, saying: "My
brother, are you not ready to become a Christian?" The man said,
no, he was not. He said it, not in a defiant tone, but in a sorrowful
tone; the clergyman asked him why, whether he did not believe in the
truths he had been hearing? Yes, he believed them all. Why, then,
wouldn't he become a Christian? "Well," he said, "I
can't join the church without giving up my business; and it is
necessary for the support of my wife and children. If I give that up,
I don't know how in the world I can get along. I had a hard time
before I found my present business, and I cannot afford to give it
up. Yet I can't become a Christian without giving it up." The
clergyman asked, "are you a rum-seller?" No, he was not a
rum-seller. Well, the clergyman said, he didn't know what in the
world the man could be; it seemed to him that a rum-seller was the
only man who does a business that would prevent his becoming a
Christian; and he finally said: "What is your business?"
The man said, "I sell soap." "Soap!" exclaimed
the clergyman, "you sell soap? How in the world does that
prevent your becoming a Christian?" "Well," the man
said, "it is this way; the soap I sell is one of these patent
soaps that are extensively advertised as enabling you to clean
clothes very quickly, as containing no deleterious compound whatever.
Every cake of the soap that I sell is wrapped in a paper on which is
printed a statement that it contains no injurious chemicals, whereas
the truth of the matter is that it does, and that though it will take
the dirt out of clothes pretty quickly, it will, in a little while,
rot them completely. I have to make my living in this way; and I
cannot feel that I can become a Christian if I sell that soap."
The minister went on, describing how he labored unsuccessfully with
that man, and finally wound up by saying: "He stuck to his soap
and lost his soul." </p>
<p> But, if that man lost his soul, was it his fault alone? Whose
fault is it that social conditions are such that men have to make
that terrible choice between what conscience tells them is right, and
the necessity of earning a living? I hold that it is the fault of
society; that it is the fault of us all. Pestilence is a curse. The
man who would bring cholera to this country, or the man who, having
the power to prevent its coming here, would make no effort to do so,
would be guilty of a crime. Poverty is worse than cholera; poverty
kills more people than pestilence, even in the best of times. Look at
the death statistics of our cities; see where the deaths come
quickest; see where it is that the little children die like
flies &#8211; it is in the poorer quarters. And the man who looks with
careless eyes upon the ravages of this pestilence, the man who does
not set himself to stay and eradicate it, he, I say, is guilty of a
crime. </p>
<p> If poverty is appointed by the power which is above us all, then
it is no crime; but if poverty is unnecessary, then it is a crime for
which society is responsible and for which society must suffer. I
hold, and I think no one who looks at the facts can fail to see, that
poverty is utterly unnecessary. It is not by the decree of the
Almighty, but it is because of our own injustice, our own
selfishness, our own ignorance, that this scourge, worse than any
pestilence, ravages our civilisation, bringing want and suffering and
degradation, destroying souls as well as bodies. Look over the world,
in this heyday of nineteenth century civilisation. In every civilised
country under the sun you will find men and women whose condition is
worse than that of the savage: men and women and little children with
whom the veriest savage could not afford to exchange. Even in this
new city of yours with virgin soil around you, you have had this
winter to institute a relief society. Your roads have been filled
with tramps, fifteen, I am told, at one time taking shelter in a
round-house here. As here, so everywhere; and poverty is deepest
where wealth most abounds. </p>
<p> What more unnatural than this? There is nothing in nature like
this poverty which today curses us. We see rapine in nature; we see
one species destroying another; but as a general thing animals do not
feed on their own kind; and, wherever we see one kind enjoying
plenty, all creatures of that kind share it. No man, I think, ever
saw a herd of buffalo, of which a few were fat and the great majority
lean. No man ever saw a flock of birds, of which two or three were
swimming in grease and the others all skin and bone. Nor in savage
life is there anything like the poverty that festers in our
civilisation. </p>
<p> In a rude state of society there are seasons of want, seasons
when people starve; but they are seasons when the earth has refused
to yield her increase, when the rain has not fallen from the heavens,
or when the land has been swept by some foe &#8211; not when there is
plenty. And yet the peculiar characteristic of this modern poverty of
ours is that it is deepest where wealth most abounds. </p>
<p> Why, today, while over the civilised world there is so much
distress, so much want, what is the cry that goes up? What is the
current explanation of the hard times? Overproduction! There are so
many clothes that men must go ragged, so much coal that in the bitter
winters people have to shiver, such over-filled granaries that people
actually die by starvation! Want due to over-production! Was a
greater absurdity ever uttered? How can there be over-production till
all have enough? It is not over-production; it is unjust
distribution. </p>
<p> Poverty necessary! Why, think of the enormous powers that are
latent in the human brain! Think how invention enables us to do with
the power of one man what not long ago could not be done by the power
of a thousand. Think that in England alone the steam machinery in
operation is said to exert a productive force greater than the
physical force of the population of the world, were they all adults.
And yet we have only begun to invent and discover. We have not yet
utilised all that has already been invented and discovered. And look
at the powers of the earth. They have hardly been touched. In every
direction as we look new resources seem to open. Man's ability to
produce wealth seems almost infinite&#8212;we can set no bounds to it.
Look at the power that is flowing by your city in the current of the
Mississippi that might be set at work for you. So in every direction
energy that we might utilise goes to waste; resources that we might
draw upon are untouched. Yet men are delving and straining to satisfy
mere animal wants; women are working, working, working their lives
away, and too frequently turning in despair from that hard struggle
to cast away all that makes the charm of woman. </p>
<p> If the animals can reason what must they think of us? Look at one
of those great ocean steamers ploughing her way across the Atlantic,
against wind, against wave, absolutely setting at defiance the utmost
power of the elements. If the gulls that hover over her were thinking
beings could they imagine that the animal that could create such a
structure as that could actually want for enough to eat? Yet, so it
is. How many even of those of us who find life easiest are there who
really live a rational life? Think of it, you who believe that there
is only one life for man &#8212; what a fool at the very best is a man
to pass his life in this struggle to merely live? And you who
believe, as I believe, that this is not the last of man, that this is
a life that opens but another life, think how nine tenths, aye, I do
not know but ninety-nine-hundredths of all our vital powers are spent
in a mere effort to get a living; or to heap together that which we
cannot by any possibility take away. Take the life of the average
workingman. Is that the life for which the human brain was intended
and the human heart was made? Look at the factories scattered through
our country. They are little better than penitentiaries. </p>
<p> I read in the New York papers a while ago that the girls at the
Yonkers factories had struck. The papers said that the girls did not
seem to know why they had struck, and intimated that it must be just
for the fun of striking. Then came out the girls' side of the story
and it appeared that they had struck against the rules in force. They
were fined if they spoke to one another, and they were fined still
more heavily if they laughed. There was a heavy fine for being a
minute late. I visited a lady in Philadelphia who had been a
forewoman in various factories, and I asked her, "Is it possible
that such rules are enforced?" She said it was so in
Philadelphia. There is a fine for speaking to your next neighbour, a
fine for laughing; and she told me that the girls in one place where
she was employed were fined ten cents a minute for being late, though
many of them had to come for miles in winter storms. She told me of
one poor girl who really worked hard one week and made $3.50; but the
fines against her were $5.25. That seems ridiculous; it is
ridiculous, but it is pathetic and it is shameful. </p>
<p> But take the cases of those even who are comparatively
independent and well off. Here is a man working hour after hour, day
after day, week after week, in doing one thing over and over again,
and for what? Just to live! He is working ten hours a day in order
that he may sleep eight and may have two or three hours for himself
when he is tired out and all his faculties are exhausted. That is not
a reasonable life; that is not a life for a being possessed of the
powers that are in man, and I think every man must have felt it for
himself. I know that when I first went to my trade I thought to
myself that it was incredible that a man was created to work all day
long just to live. I used to read the "Scientific
American," and as invention after invention was heralded in that
paper I used to think to myself that when I became a man it would not
be necessary to work so hard. But on the contrary, the struggle for
existence has become more and more intense. People who want to prove
the contrary get up masses of statistics to show that the condition
of the working classes is improving. Improvement that you have to
take a statistical microscope to discover does not amount to
anything. But there is not improvement. </p>
<p> Improvement! Why, according to the last report of the Michigan
Bureau of Labor Statistics, as I read yesterday in a Detroit paper,
taking all the trades, including some of the very high priced ones,
where the wages are from $6 to $7 a day, the average earnings amount
to $1.77, and, taking out waste time, to $1.40. Now, when you
consider how a man can live and bring up a family on $1.40 a day,
even in Michigan, I do not think you will conclude that the condition
of the working classes can have very much improved. </p>
<p> Here is a broad general fact that is asserted by all who have
investigated the question, by such men as Hallam, the historian, and
Professor Thorold Rogers, who has made a study of the history of
prices as they were five centuries ago. When all the productive arts
were in the most primitive state, when the most prolific of our
modern vegetables had not been introduced, when the breeds of cattle
were small and poor, when there were hardly any roads and
transportation was exceedingly difficult, when all manufacturing was
done by hand &#8212; in that rude time the condition of the laborers of
England was far better than it is today. In those rude times no man
need fear want save when actual famine came, and owing to the
difficulties of transportation the plenty of one district could not
relieve the scarcity of another. Save in such times, no man need fear
want. Pauperism, such as exists in modern times, was absolutely
unknown. Everyone, save the physically disabled, could make a living,
and the poorest lived in rude plenty. But perhaps the most
astonishing fact brought to light by this investigation is that at
that time, under those conditions in those "dark ages," as
we call them, the working day was only eight hours. While with all
our modern inventions and improvements, our working classes have been
agitating and struggling in vain to get the working day reduced to
eight hours. </p>
<p> Do these facts show improvement? Why, in the rudest state of
society in the most primitive state of the arts the labor of the
natural bread-winner will suffice to provide a living for himself and
for those who are dependent upon him. Amid all our inventions there
are large bodies of men who cannot do this. What is the most
astonishing thing in our civilisation? Why, the most astonishing
thing to those Sioux chiefs who were recently brought from the Far
West and taken through our manufacturing cities in the East, was not
the marvellous inventions that enabled machinery to act almost as if
it had intellect; it was not the growth of our cities; it was not the
speed with which the railway car whirled along; it was not the
telegraph or the telephone that most astonished them; but the fact
that amid this marvellous development of productive power they found
little children at work. And astonishing that ought to be to us; a
most astounding thing! </p>
<p> Talk about improvement in the condition of the working classes,
when the facts are that a larger and larger proportion of women and
children are forced to toil. Why, I am told that, even here in your
own city, there are children of thirteen and fourteen working in
factories. In Detroit, according to the report of the Michigan Bureau
of Labor Statistics, one half of the children of school age do not
go to school. In New Jersey, the report made to the legislature
discloses an amount of misery and ignorance that is appalling.
Children are growing up there, compelled to monotonous toil when they
ought to be at play, children who do not know how to play; children
who have been so long accustomed to work that they have become used
to it; children growing up in such ignorance that they do not know
what country New Jersey is in, that they never heard of George
Washington, that some of them think Europe is in New York. Such facts
are appalling; they mean that the very foundations of the Republic
are being sapped. The dangerous man is not the man who tries to
excite discontent; the dangerous man is the man who says that all is
as it ought to be. Such a state of things cannot continue; such
tendencies as we see at work here cannot go on without bringing at
last an overwhelming crash. </p>
<p><b> I say that all this poverty and the ignorance that flows from
it is unnecessary; I say that there is no natural reason why we
should not all be rich, in the sense, not of having more than each
other, but in the sense of all having enough to completely satisfy
all physical wants; of all having enough to get such an easy living
that we could develop the better part of humanity. </b>There is no
reason why wealth should not be so abundant, that no one should think
of such a thing as little children at work, or a woman compelled to a
toil that nature never intended her to perform; wealth so abundant
that there would be no cause for that harassing fear that sometimes
paralyses even those who are not considered "the poor," the
fear that every man of us has probably felt, that if sickness should
smite him, or if he should be taken away, those whom he loves better
than his life would become charges upon charity. "Consider the
lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin." I believe that in a really Christian community, in a
society that honored not with the lips but with the act, the
doctrines of Jesus, no one would have occasion to worry about
physical needs any more than do the lilies of the field. There is
enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this mad struggle, we
trample in the mire what has been provided in sufficiency for us all;
trample it in the mire while we tear and rend each other. </p>
<p> <b>There is a cause for this poverty; and, if you trace it down,
you will find its root in a primary injustice. Look over the world
today&#8212;poverty everywhere. The cause must be a common one. You
cannot attribute it to the tariff, or to the form of government, or
to this thing or to that in which nations differ; because, as deep
poverty is common to them all the cause that produces it must be a
common cause. What is that common cause? There is one sufficient
cause that is common to all nations; and that is the appropriation as
the property of some of that natural element on which and from which
all must live. </b></p>
<p> Take that fact I have spoken of, that appalling fact that, even
now, it is harder to live than it was in the ages dark and rude five
centuries ago &#8212; how do you explain it? There is no difficulty in
finding the cause. Whoever reads the history of England, or the
history of any other civilised nation (but I speak of the history of
England because that is the history with which we are best
acquainted) will see the reason. For century after century a
parliament composed of aristocrats and employers passed laws
endeavoring to reduce wages, but in vain. Men could not be crowded
down to wages that gave a mere living because the bounty of nature
was not wholly shut up from them; because some remains of the
recognition of the truth that all men have equal rights on the earth
still existed; because the land of that country, that which was held
in private possession, was only held on a tenure derived from the
nation, and for a rent payable back to the nation. The church lands
supported the expenses of public worship, of the maintenance of
seminaries and the care of the poor; the crown lands defrayed the
expenses of the civil list; and from a third portion of the lands,
those held under the military tenures, the army was provided for.
There was no national debt in England at that time. They carried on
wars for hundreds of years, but at the charge of the landowners. And
more important still, there remained everywhere, and you can see in
every old English town their traces to this day, the common lands to
which any of the neighborhood was free. It was as those lands were
enclosed; it was as the commons were gradually monopolised, as the
church lands were made the prey of greedy courtiers, as the crown
lands were given away as absolute property to the favorites of the
king, as the military tenants shirked their rents and laid the
expenses they had agreed to defray, upon the nation, in taxation that
bore upon industry and upon thrift&#8212;it was then that poverty
began to deepen, and the tramp appeared in England; just as today he
is appearing in our new States. </p>
<p> Now, think of it &#8212; is not land monopolisation a sufficient
reason for poverty? What is man? In the first place, he is an animal,
a land animal who cannot live without land. All that man produces
comes from land; all productive labor, in the final analysis,
consists in working up land; or materials drawn from land, into such
forms as fit them for the satisfaction of human wants and desires.
Why, man's very body is drawn from the land. Children of the soil, we
come from the land, and to the land we must return.<b> Take away from
man all that belongs to the land, and what have you but a disembodied
spirit? Therefore he who holds the land on which and from which
another man must live, is that man's master; and the man is his
slave. The man who holds the land on which I must live can command me
to life or to death just as absolutely as though I were his chattel.
Talk about abolishing slavery &#8212; we have not abolished slavery; we
have only abolished one rude form of it, chattel slavery. There is a
deeper and a more insidious form, a more cursed form yet before us to
abolish, in this industrial slavery that makes a man a virtual slave,
while taunting him and mocking him with the name of freedom.</b>
Poverty! want! they will sting as much as the lash. Slavery! God
knows there are horrors enough in slavery; but there are deeper
horrors in our civilised society today. Bad as chattel slavery was,
it did not drive slave mothers to kill their children, yet you may
read in official reports that the system of child insurance which has
taken root so strongly in England, and which is now spreading over
our Eastern States, has perceptibly and largely increased the rate of
child mortality! &#8212; What does that mean? </p>
<p> Robinson Crusoe, as you know, when he rescued Friday from the
cannibals, made him his slave. Friday had to serve Crusoe. But,
supposing Crusoe had said, "O man and brother, I am very glad to
see you, and I welcome you to this island, and you shall be a free
and independent citizen, with just as much to say as I have except
that this island is mine, and of course, as I can do as I please with
my own property, you must not use it save upon my terms." Friday
would have been just as much Crusoe's slave as though he had called
him one. Friday was not a fish, he could not swim off through the
sea; he was not a bird, and could not fly off through the air; if he
lived at all, he had to live on that island. And if that island was
Crusoe's, Crusoe was his master through life to death.</p>
<p> A friend of mine, who believes as I do upon this question was
talking a while ago with another friend of mine who is a greenbacker,
but who had not paid much attention to the land question. Our
greenback friend said, "Yes, yes, the land question is an
important question; oh, I admit the land question is a very important
question; but then there are other important questions. There is this
question and that question, and the other question; and there is the
money question. The money question is a very important question; it
is a more important question than the land question. You give me all
the money, and you can take all the land." My friend said, "Well,
suppose you had all the money in the world and I had all
the land in the world. What would you do if I were to give you notice
to quit?" </p>
<p> Do you know that I do not think that the average man realises
what land is? I know a little girl who has been going to school for
some time, studying geography, and all that sort of thing; and one
day she said to me: "Here is something about the surface of the
earth. I wonder what the surface of the earth looks like?" "Well," I
said, "look out into the yard there. That is
the surface of the earth." She said, "That the surface of
the earth? Our yard the surface of the earth? Why, I never thought of
it!" That is very much the case not only with grown men, but
with such wise beings as newspaper editors. They seem to think, when
you talk of land, that you always refer to farms; to think that the
land question is a question that relates entirely to farmers, as
though land had no other use than growing crops. Now, I should like
to know how a man could even edit a newspaper without having the use
of some land. He might swing himself by straps and go up in a
balloon, but he could not even then get along without land. What
supports the balloon in the air? Land; the surface of the earth. Let
the earth drop, and what would become of the balloon? The air that
supports the balloon is supported in turn by land. So it is with
everything else men can do. Whether a man is working away three
thousand feet under the surface of the earth or whether he is working
up in the top of one of those immense buildings that they have in New
York; whether he is ploughing the soil or sailing across the ocean,
he is still using land. </p>
<p> Land! Why, in owning a piece of ground, what do you own ? The
lawyers will tell you that you own from the centre of the earth right
up to heaven; and, so far as all human purposes go, you do. In New
York they are building houses thirteen and fourteen stories high.
What are men, living in those upper stories, paying for? There is a
friend of mine who has an office in one of them, and he estimates
that he pays by the cubic foot for air. Well, the man who owns the
surface of the land has the renting of the air up there, and would
have if the buildings were carried up for miles. </p>
<p> This land question is the bottom question. Man is a land animal.
Suppose you want to build a house; can you build it without a place
to put it? What is it built of? Stone, or mortar, or wood, or
iron &#8212; they all come from the earth. <b>Think of any article of
wealth you choose, any of those things which men struggle for, where
do they come from? From the land. It is the bottom question. The land
question is simply the labor question; and when some men own that
element from which all wealth must be drawn, and upon which all must
live, then they have the power of living without work, and,
therefore, those who do work get less of the products of work.
</b></p>
<p> Did you ever think of the utter absurdity and strangeness of the
fact that, all over the civilised world, the working classes are the
poor classes? Go into any city in the world, and get into a cab and
ask the man to drive you where the working people live. He won't take
you to where the fine houses are. He will take you, on the contrary,
into the squalid quarters, the poorer quarters. Did you ever think
how curious that is? Think for a moment how it would strike a
rational being who had never been on the earth before, if such an
intelligence could come down, and you were to explain to him how we
live on earth, how houses and food and clothing, and all the many
things we need were all produced by work, would he not think that the
working people would be the people who lived in the finest houses and
had most of everything that work produces? Yet, whether you took him
to London or Paris or New York, or even to Burlington, he would find
that those called the working people were the people who live in the
poorest houses. </p>
<p> All this is strange &#8212; just think of it. We naturally despise
poverty; and it is reasonable that we should. I do not say &#8212; I
distinctly repudiate it &#8212; that the people who are poor are poor
always from their own fault, or even in most cases; but it ought to
be so. If any good man or woman could create a world, it would be a
sort of a world in which no one would be poor unless he was lazy or
vicious. But that is just precisely the kind of a world this is; that
is just precisely the kind of a world the Creator has made. <b>Nature
gives to labor, and to labor alone; there must be human work before
any article of wealth can be produced; and in the natural state of
things the man who toiled honestly and well would be the rich man,
and he who did not work would be poor. We have so reversed the order
of nature that we are accustomed to think of the workingman as a poor
man. </b></p>
<p> And if you trace it out I believe you will see that the primary
cause of this is that we compel those who work to pay others for
permission to do so. You may buy a coat, a horse, a house; there you
are paying the seller for labor exerted, for something that he has
produced, or that he has got from the man who did produce it; but
when you pay a man for land, what are you paying him for? You are
paying for something that no man has produced; you pay him for
something that was here before man was, or for a value that was
created, not by him individually, but by the community of which you
are a part. What is the reason that the land here, where we stand
tonight, is worth more than it was twenty-five years ago? What is the
reason that land in the centre of New York, that once could be bought
by the mile for a jug of whiskey, is now worth so much that, though
you were to cover it with gold, you would not have its value? Is it
not because of the increase of population? Take away that population,
and where would the value of the land be? Look at it in any way you
please. </p>
<p> We talk about over-production. How can there be such a thing as
over-production while people want? All these things that are said to
be over-produced are desired by many people. Why do they not get
them? They do not get them because they have not the means to buy
them; not that they do not want them. Why have not they the means to
buy them? They earn too little. When the great masses of men have to
work for an average of $1.40 a day, it is no wonder that great
quantities of goods cannot be sold. </p>
<p> Now why is it that men have to work for such low wages? Because
if they were to demand higher wages there are plenty of unemployed
men ready to step into their places. It is this mass of unemployed
men who compel that fierce competition that drives wages down to the
point of bare subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot
get employment? Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that
men cannot find employment? Adam had no difficulty in finding
employment; neither had Robinson Crusoe; the finding of employment
was the last thing that troubled them. </p>
<p> If men cannot find an employer, why cannot they employ
themselves? Simply because they are shut out from the element on
which human labor can alone be exerted. Men are compelled to compete
with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been
robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because
they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
paying some other human creature for the privilege. </p>
<p> I do not mean to say that even after you had set right this
fundamental injustice, there would not be many things to do; but this
I do mean to say, that our treatment of land lies at the bottom of
all social questions. This I do mean to say, that, do what you
please, reform as you may, <b>you never can get rid of wide-spread
poverty so long as the element on which and from which all men must
live is made the private property of some men. It is utterly
impossible. Reform government &#8212; get taxes down to the
minimum &#8212; build railroads; institute co-operative stores; divide
profits, if you choose, between employers and employed -- and what will
be the result? The result will be that the land will increase in
value &#8212; that will be the result &#8212; that and nothing else.
Experience shows this. Do not all improvements simply increase the
value of land &#8212; the price that some must pay others for the
privilege of living? </b></p>
<p> Consider the matter, I say it with all reverence, and I merely
say it because I wish to impress a truth upon your minds &#8212; it is
utterly impossible, so long as His laws are what they are, that God
himself could relieve poverty &#8212; utterly impossible. Think of it
and you will see. Men pray to the Almighty to relieve poverty. But
poverty comes not from God's laws &#8212; it is blasphemy of the worst
kind to say that; it comes from man's injustice to his fellows.
Supposing the Almighty were to hear the prayer, how could He carry
out the request so long as His laws are what they are? </p>
<p> Consider &#8212; the Almighty gives us nothing of the things that
constitute wealth; He merely gives us the raw material, which must be
utilised by man to produce wealth. Does He not give us enough of that
now? How could He relieve poverty even if He were to give us more?
Supposing in answer to these prayers He were to increase the power of
the sun; or the virtue of the soil? Supposing He were to make plants
more prolific, or animals to produce after their kind more
abundantly? Who would get the benefit of it? Take a country where
land is completely monopolised, as it is in most of the civilised
countries &#8212; who would get the benefit of it? Simply the
landowners. And even if God in answer to prayer were to send down out
of the heavens those things that men require, who would get the
benefit? </p>
<p><a name="Manna"></a><b> In the Old Testament we are told that when
the Israelites journeyed through the desert, they were hungered, and
that God sent manna down out of the heavens. There was enough for all
of them, and they all took it and were relieved. But supposing that
desert had been held as private property, as the soil of Great
Britain is held, as the soil even of our new States is being held;
suppose that one of the Israelites had a square mile, and another one
had twenty square miles, and another one had a hundred square miles,
and the great majority of the Israelites did not have enough to set
the soles of their feet upon, which they could call their
own &#8212; what would become of the manna? What good would it have done
to the majority? Not a whit. Though God had sent down manna enough
for all, that manna would have been the property of the landholders;
they would have employed some of the others perhaps, to gather it up
into heaps for them, and would have sold it to their hungry brethren.
Consider it; this purchase and sale of manna might have gone on until
the majority of Israelites had given all they had, even to the
clothes off their backs. What then? Then they would not have had
anything left to buy manna with, and the consequences would have been
that while they went hungry the manna would have lain in great heaps,
and the landowners would have been complaining of the over-production
of manna. There would have been a great harvest of manna and hungry
people, just precisely the phenomenon that we see today. </b></p>
<p> I cannot go over all the points I would like to try, but I wish
to call your attention to the utter absurdity of private property in
land! Why, consider it, the idea of a man's selling the
earth &#8212; the earth, our common mother. A man selling that which no
man produced &#8212; a man passing title from one generation to another.
Why, it is the most absurd thing in the world. Why, did you ever
think of it? What right has a dead man to land? For whom was this
earth created? It was created for the living, certainly, not for the
dead. Well, now we treat it as though it was created for the dead.
Where do our land titles come from? They come from men who for the
most part are past and gone. Here in this new country you get a
little nearer the original source; but go to the Eastern States and
go back over the Atlantic. There you may clearly see the power that
comes from landownership. </p>
<p><b> As I say, the man that owns the land is the master of those
who must live on it.</b> Here is a modern instance: you who are
familiar with the history of the Scottish Church know that in the
forties there was a disruption in the church. You who have read Hugh
Miller's work on "<b><i>The Cruise of the Betsey</i></b>"
know something about it; how a great body, led by Dr. Chalmers, came
out from the Established Church and said they would set up a Free
Church. In the Established Church were a great many of the
landowners. Some of them, like the Duke of Buccleugh, owning miles
and miles of land on which no common Scotsman had a right to put his
foot, save by the Duke of Buccleugh's permission. These landowners
refused not only to allow these Free Churchmen to have ground upon
which to erect a church, but they would not let them stand on their
land and worship God. You who have read "<b><i>The Cruise of the
Betsey</i></b>" know that it is the story of a clergyman who was
obliged to make his home in a boat on that wild sea because he was
not allowed to have land enough to live on. In many places the people
had to take the sacrament with the tide coming to their
knees &#8212; many a man lost his life worshipping on the roads in rain
and snow. They were not permitted to go on Mr. Landlord's land and
worship God, and had to take to the roads. The Duke of Buccleugh
stood out for seven years compelling people to worship in the roads,
until finally relenting a little, he allowed them to worship God in a
gravel pit; whereupon they passed a resolution of thanks to His
Grace. </p>
<p> But that is not what I wanted to tell you. The thing that struck
me was this significant fact: As soon as the disruption occurred, the
Free Church, composed of a great many able men, at once sent a
delegation to the landlords to ask permission for Scotsmen to worship
God in Scotland and in their own way. This delegation set out for
London &#8212; they had to go to London, England, to get permission for
Scotsmen to worship God in Scotland, and in their own native home!
</p>
<p> But that is not the most absurd thing. In one place where they
were refused land upon which to stand and worship God, the late
landowner had died and his estate was in the hands of the trustees,
and the answer of the trustees was, that so far as they were
concerned they would exceedingly like to allow them to have a place
to put up a church to worship God, but they could not conscientiously
do it because they knew that such a course would be very displeasing
to the late Mr. Monaltie! Now this dead man had gone to heaven, let
us hope; at any rate he had gone away from this world, but lest it
might displease him men yet living could not worship God. Is it
possible for absurdity to go any further? </p>
<p> You may say that those Scotch people are very absurd people, but
they are not a whit more so than we are. I read only a little while
ago of some Long Island fishermen who had been paying as rent for the
privilege of fishing there, a certain part of the catch. They paid it
because they believed that James II, a dead man centuries ago, a man
who never put his foot in America, a king who was kicked off the
English throne, had said they had to pay it, and they got up a
committee, went to the county town and searched the records. They
could not find anything in the records to show that James II had ever
ordered that they should give any of their fish to anybody, and so
they refused to pay any longer. But if they had found that James II
had really said they should they would have gone on paying. Can
anything be more absurd? </p>
<p> There is a square in New York &#8212; Stuyvesant Square that is
locked up at six o'clock every evening, even on the long summer
evenings. Why is it locked up? Why are the children not allowed to
play there? Why because old Mr. Stuyvesant, dead and gone I don't
know how many years ago, so willed it. Now can anything be more
absurd?* </p>
<center><font size="-2"> *)After a popular agitation, the park
authorities since decided to have the gates open later than six
o'clock.</font></center>
<p><b>Yet that is not any more absurd than our land titles. From whom
do they come?</b> Dead man after dead man. Suppose you get on the
cars here going to Council Bluffs or Chicago. You find a passenger
with his baggage strewn over the seats. You say: "Will you give
me a seat, if you please, sir?" He replies: "No; I bought
this seat." "Bought this seat? From whom did you buy
it?" I bought it from the man who got out at the last
station," That is the way we manage this earth of ours. </p>
<p> Is it not a self-evident truth, as Thomas Jefferson said, that "<i>the
land belongs in usufruct to the living</i>," and
that they who have died have left it, and have no power to say how it
shall be disposed of? Title to land! Where can a man get any title
which makes the earth his property? There is a sacred right to
property &#8212; sacred because ordained by the laws of nature, that
is to say, by the laws of God, and necessary to social order and
civilisation. That is the right of property in things produced by
labor; it rests on the right of a man to himself. That which a man
produces, that is his against all the world, to give or to keep, to
lend, to sell or to bequeath; but how can he get such a right to land
when it was here before he came? Individual claims to land rest only
on appropriation. I read in a recent number of the "<b><i>Nineteenth
Century</i></b>," possibly some of you
may have read it, an article by an ex-prime minister of Australia in
which there was a little story that attracted my attention. It was of
a man named Galahard, who in the early days got up to the top of a
high hill in one of the finest parts of western Australia. He got up
there, looked all around, and made this proclamation: "<b><i>All
the land that is in my sight from the top of this hill I claim for
myself; and all the land that is out of sight I claim for my son
John.</i></b>" </p>
<p> That story is of universal application. <b>Land titles everywhere
come from just such appropriations.</b> Now, under certain
circumstances, appropriation can give a right. You invite a company
of gentlemen to dinner and you say to them: "Be seated,
gentlemen," and I get into this chair. Well, that seat for the
time being is mine by the right of appropriation. It would be very
ungentlemanly, it would be very wrong for any one of the other guests
to come up and say: "Get out of that chair; I want to sit
there!" But that right of possession, which is good so far as
the chair is concerned, for the time, does not give me a right to
appropriate all there is on the table before me. <b>Grant that a man
has a right to appropriate such natural elements as he can use, has
he any right to appropriate more than he can use?</b> Has a guest in
such a case as I have supposed a right to appropriate more than he
needs and make other people stand up? That is what is done. </p>
<p> Why, look all over this country &#8212; look at this town or any
other town. If men only took what they wanted to use we should all
have enough; but they take what they do not want to use at all.
<b>Here are a lot of Englishmen coming over here and getting titles
to our land in vast tracts; what do they want with our land? They do
not want it at all; it is not the land they want; they have no use
for American land. What they want is the income that they know they
can in a little while get from it. Where does that income come from?
It comes from labor, from the labor of American citizens. What we
are selling to these people is our children, not land. </b></p>
<p> Poverty! Can there be any doubt of its cause? Go, into the old
countries &#8212; go into western Ireland, into the highlands of
Scotland &#8212; these are purely primitive communities. There you will
find people as poor as poor can be &#8212; living year after year on
oatmeal or on potatoes, and often going hungry. I could tell you many
a pathetic story. Speaking to a Scottish physician who was telling me
how this diet was inducing among these people a disease similar to
that which from the same cause is ravaging Italy (the Pellagra), I
said to him: "There is plenty of fish; why don't they catch
fish? There is plenty of game; I know the laws are against it, but
cannot they take it on the sly?" "That," he said, "never enters their
heads. Why, if a man was even suspected of
having a taste for trout or grouse he would have to leave at
once." </p>
<p> <b>There is no difficulty in discovering what makes those people
poor. They have no right to anything that nature gives them. All they
can make above a living they must pay to the landlord.</b> They not
only have to pay for the land that they use, but they have to pay for
the seaweed that comes ashore and for the turf they dig from the
bogs.<font color="#ff6600"> They dare not improve, for any
improvements they make are made an excuse for putting up the
rent.</font> These people who work hard live in hovels, and the
landlords, who do not work at all &#8212; oh! they live in luxury in
London or Paris. If they have hunting boxes there, why they are
magnificent castles as compared with the hovels in which the men live
who do the work. Is there any question as to the cause of poverty
there? </p>
<p> Now go into the cities and what do you see! Why, you see even a
lower depth of poverty; aye, if I would point out the worst of the
evils of land monopoly I would not take you to Connemara; I would not
take you to Skye or Kintire&#8212;I would take you to Dublin or
Glasgow or London. There is something worse than physical
deprivation, something worse than starvation; and that is the
degradation of the mind, the death of the soul. That is what you will
find in those cities. </p>
<p>Now, what is the cause of that? <font color="#ff6600">Why, it is
plainly to be seen; the people driven off the land in the country are
driven into the slums of the cities.</font> For every man that is
driven off the land the demand for the produce of the workmen of the
cities is lessened; and the man himself with his wife and children,
is forced among those workmen to compete upon any terms for a bare
living and force wages down. Get work he must or starve&#8212;get work
he must or do that which those people, so long as they maintain their
manly feelings, dread more than death, go to the alms-houses. That is
the reason, here as in Great Britain, that the cities are
overcrowded. Open the land that is locked up, that is held by dogs in
the manger, who will not use it themselves and will not allow anybody
else to use it, and you would see no more of tramps and hear no more
of over-production. </p>
<p> The utter absurdity of this thing of private property in land! I
defy any one to show me any good from it, look where you please. Go
out in the new lands, where my attention was first called to it, or
go to the heart of the capital of the world &#8212; London.
Everywhere, when your eyes are once opened, you will see its
inequality and you will see its absurdity. You do not have to go
farther than Burlington. You have here a most beautiful site for a
city, but the city itself as compared with what it might be is a
miserable, straggling town. A gentleman showed me today a big hole
alongside one of your streets. The place has been filled up all
around it and this hole is left. It is neither pretty nor useful. Why
does that hole stay there? Well, it stays there because somebody
claims it as his private property. There is a man, this gentleman
told me, who wished to grade another lot and wanted somewhere to put
the dirt he took off it, and he offered to buy this hole so that he
might fill it up. Now it would have been a good thing for Burlington
to have it filled up, a good thing for you all &#8212; your town would
look better, and you yourself would be in no danger of tumbling into
it some dark night. Why, my friend pointed out to me another similar
hole in which water had collected and told me that two children had
been drowned there. And he likewise told me that a drunken man some
years ago had fallen into such a hole and had brought suit against
the city which cost you taxpayers some $11,000. Clearly it is to the
interest of you all to have that particular hole I am talking of
filled up. The man who wanted to fill it up offered the hole owner
$300. But the hole owner refused the offer and declared that he would
hold out until he could get $1000; and in the meanwhile that
unsightly and dangerous hole must remain. This is but an illustration
of private property in land. </p>
<p> You may see the same thing all over this country. See how
injuriously in the agricultural districts this thing of private
property in land affects the roads and the distances between the
people. <b>A man does not take what land he wants, what he can use,
but he takes all he can get, and the consequence is that his next
neighbor has to go further along, people are separated from each
other further than they ought to be, to the increased difficulty of
production, to the loss of neighborhood and companionship. They have
more roads to maintain than they can decently maintain; they must do
more work to get the same result, and life is in every way harder and
drearier. </b></p>
<p> When you come to the cities it is just the other way. In the
country the people are too much scattered; in the great cities they
are too crowded. Go to a city like New York and there they are jammed
together like sardines in a box, living family upon family, one above
the other. It is an unnatural and unwholesome life. How can you have
anything like a home in a tenement room, or two or three rooms? How
can children be brought up healthily with no place to play? Two or
three weeks ago I read of a New York judge who fined two little boys
five dollars for playing hop-scotch on the street&#8212;where else
could they play? Private property in land had robbed them of all
place to play. Even a temperance man, who had investigated the
subject, said that in his opinion the gin palaces of London were a
positive good in this, that they enabled the people whose abodes were
dark and squalid rooms to see a little brightness and thus prevent
them from going wholly mad. </p>
<p><b> What is the reason for this overcrowding of cities? There is
no natural reason. Take New York, one half its area is not built
upon. Why, then, must people crowd together as they do there? Simply
because of private ownership of land. There is plenty of room to
build houses and plenty, of people who want to build houses, but
before anybody can build a house a blackmail price must be paid to
some dog in the manger. It costs in many cases more to get vacant
ground upon which to build a house than it does to build the house.
And then what happens to the man who pays this blackmail and builds a
house? Down comes the tax-gatherer and fines him for building the
house. </b></p>
<p> It is so all over the United States &#8212; the men who improve,
the men who turn the prairie into farms and the desert into gardens,
the men who beautify your cities, are taxed and fined for having done
these things. Now, nothing is clearer than that the people of New
York want more houses; and I think that even here in Burlington you
could get along with more houses. Why, then, should you fine a man
who builds one?<b> Look all over this country &#8212; the bulk of the
taxation rests upon the improver; the man who puts up a building, or
establishes a factory, or cultivates a farm he is taxed for it; and
not merely taxed for it, but I think in nine cases out of ten the
land which he uses, the bare land, is taxed more than the adjoining
lot or the adjoining 160 acres that some speculator is holding as a
mere dog in the manger, not using it himself and not allowing anybody
else to use it.</b> </p>
<p> I am talking too long; but let me in a few words point out the
way of getting rid of land monopoly, securing the right of all to the
elements which are necessary for life. We could not divide the land.
In a rude state of society, as among the ancient Hebrews, giving each
family its lot and making it inalienable we might secure something
like equality. But in a complex civilisation that will not suffice.
<b>It is not, however, necessary to divide up the land. All that is
necessary is to divide up the income that comes from the land.</b> In
that way we can secure absolute equality; nor could the adoption of
this principle involve any rude shock or violent change. <b>It can be
brought about gradually and easily by abolishing taxes that now rest
upon capital, labor and improvements, and raising all our public
revenues by the taxation of land values; and the longer you think of
it the clearer you will see that in every possible way will it be a
benefit.</b> </p>
<p> Now, supposing we should abolish all other taxes direct and
indirect, substituting for them a tax upon land values, what would be
the effect? In the first place it would be to kill speculative
values. It would be to remove from the newer parts of the country the
bulk of the taxation and put it on the richer parts. It would be to
exempt the pioneer from taxation and make the larger cities pay more
of it. It would be to relieve energy and enterprise, capital and
labor, from all those burdens that now bear upon them. What a start
that would give to production! In the second place we could, from the
value of the land, not merely pay all the present expenses of the
government, but we could do infinitely more. In the city of San
Francisco James Lick left a few blocks of ground to be used for
public purposes there, and the rent amounts to so much, that out of
it will be built the largest telescope in the world, large public
baths and other public buildings, and various costly works. If,
instead of these few blocks, the whole value of the land upon which
the city is built had accrued to San Francisco what could she not do?
</p>
<p> So in this little town, where land values are very low as
compared with such cities as Chicago and San Francisco, you could do
many things for mutual benefit and public improvement did you
appropriate to public purposes the land values that now go to
individuals. You could have a great free library; you could have an
art gallery; you could get yourselves a public park, a magnificent
public park, too. You have here one of the finest natural sites for a
beautiful town I know of, and I have travelled much. You might make
on this site a city that it would be a pleasure to live in. You will
not as you go now &#8212; oh, no! Why, the very fact that you have a
magnificent view here will cause somebody to hold on all the more
tightly to the land that commands this view and charge higher prices
for it. The State of New York wants to buy a strip of land so as to
enable the people to see Niagara, but what a price she must pay for
it! Look at all the great cities; in Philadelphia, for instance, in
order to build their great city hall they had to block up the only
two wide streets they had in the city. Everywhere you go you may see
how private property in land prevents public as well as private
improvement. </p>
<p> But I have not time to enter into further details. I can only ask
you to think upon this thing, and the more you will see its
desirability. As an English friend of mine puts it: "No taxes
and a pension for everybody;" and why should it not be? To take
land values for public purposes is not really to impose a tax, but to
take for public purposes a value created by the community. And out of
the fund which would thus accrue from the common property, we might,
without degradation to anybody, provide enough to actually secure
from want all who were deprived of their natural protectors or met
with accident, or any man who should grow so old that he could not
work. All prating that is heard from some quarters about its hurting
the common people to give them what they do not work for is humbug.
The truth is, that anything that injures self-respect, degrades, does
harm; but if you give it as a right, as something to which every
citizen is entitled to, it does not degrade. Charity schools do
degrade children that are sent to them, but public schools do not.
</p>
<p> But all such benefits as these, while great, would be incidental.
The great thing would be that the reform I propose would tend to open
opportunities to labor and enable men to provide employment for
themselves. That is the great advantage. We should gain the enormous
productive power that is going to waste all over the country, the
power of idle hands that would gladly be at work. And that removed,
then you would see wages begin to mount. It is not that everyone
would turn farmer, or everyone would build himself a house if he had
an opportunity for doing so, but so many could and would, as to
relieve the pressure on the labor market and provide employment for
all others. And as wages mounted to the higher levels, then you would
see the productive power increased. The country where wages are high
is the country of greatest productive powers. Where wages are
highest, there will invention be most active; there will labor be
most intelligent; there will be the greatest yield for the
expenditure of exertion. The more you think of it the more clearly
you will see that what I say is true. I cannot hope to convince you
in an hour or two, but I shall be content if I shall put you upon
inquiry. </p>
<p>Think for yourselves; ask yourselves whether this wide-spread fact
of poverty is not a crime, and a crime for which every one of us, man
and woman, who does not do what he or she can do to call attention to
it and do away with it, is responsible. </p>
