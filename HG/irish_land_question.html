<p><font size="-1">This book was first published in the early part of 1881, under
    the title of The Irish Land Question.&quot; In order better to indicate the general
    character
  of this subject, and to conform to the title under which it had been republished
  in other countries, the title was subsequently changed to &quot;The Land Question.&quot;</font><br>
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Unpalatable_Truth."></a>Chapter 1: Unpalatable
Truth</p>
<p>IN charging the Dublin jury in the Land League cases, Mr. Justice
Fitzgerald told them that the land laws of Ireland were more
favorable to the tenant than those of Great Britain, Belgium, or the
United States.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Justice Fitzgerald is right. For in Ireland
certain local customs and the provisions of the Bright Land Act
mitigate somewhat the power of the landlord in his dealings with the
tenant. In Great Britain, save by custom in a few localities, there
are no such mitigations. In Belgium I believe there are none. There
are certainly none in the United States.</p>
<p>This fact which Justice Fitzgerald cites will be reechoed by the
enemies of the Irish movement. And it is a fact well worth the
consideration of its friends. For the Irish movement has passed its
first stage, and it is time for a more definite understanding of what
is needed and how it is to be got.</p>
<p>It is the fashion of Land League orators and sympathizing
newspapers in this country to talk as if the distress and disquiet in
Ireland were wholly due to political oppression, and our national
House of Representatives recently passed, by unanimous vote, a
resolution which censured England for her treatment of Ireland. But,
while it is indeed true that Ireland has been deeply wronged and
bitterly oppressed by England, it is not true that there is any
economic oppression of Ireland by England now. To whatever cause
Irish distress may be due, it is certainly not due to the existence
of laws which press on industry more heavily in Ireland than in any
other part of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>And, further than this, the Irish land system, which is so much
talked of as though it were some peculiarly atrocious system, is
essentially the same land system which prevails in all civilized
countries, which we of the United States have accepted
unquestioningly, and have extended over the whole temperate zone of a
new continent &#8211; the same system which all over the civilized world
men are accustomed to consider natural and just.</p>
<p>Justice Fitzgerald is unquestionably right.</p>
<p>As to England, it is well known that the English landlords
exercise freely all the powers complained of in the Irish landlords,
without even the slight restrictions imposed in Ireland.</p>
<p>As to Belgium, let me quote the high authority of the
distinguished Belgian publicist, M. &Eacute;mile de Laveleye, of the
University of Li&eacute;ge. He says that the Belgian
tenantfarmers &#8211; for tenancy largely prevails even where the land
is most minutely divided &#8211; are rack-rented with a mercilessness
unknown in England or even in Ireland, and are compelled to vote as
their landlords dictate!</p>
<p>And as to the United States, let me ask the men who to applauding
audiences are nightly comparing the freedom of America with the
oppression of Ireland &#8211; let me ask the Representatives who voted
for the resolution of sympathy with Ireland, this simple question:
What would the Irish landlords lose, what would the Irish tenants
gain, if tomorrow, Ireland were made a State in the American Union
and American law substituted for English law?</p>
<p>I think it will puzzle them to reply. The truth is that the gain
would be to the landlords, the loss to the tenants. The simple truth
is that, under our laws, the Irish landlords could rack-rent,
distrain, evict, or absent themselves, as they pleased, and without
any restriction from Ulster tenant-right or legal requirement of
compensation for improvements. Under our laws they could, just as
freely as they can now, impose whatever terms they pleased upon their
tenants &#8211; whether as to cultivation, as to improvements, as to
game, as to marriages, as to voting, or as to anything else. For
these powers do not spring from special laws. They are merely
incident to the right of property; they result simply from the
acknowledgment of the right of the owner of land to do as he pleases
with his own &#8211; to let it, or not let it. So far as law can give
them to him, every American landlord has these powers as fully as any
Irish landlord. Cannot the American owner of land make, in letting
it, any stipulation he pleases as to how it shall be used, or
improved, or cultivated? Can he not reserve any of his own rights
upon it, such as the right of entry, or of cutting wood, or shooting
game, or catching fish? And, in the absence of special agreement,
does not American law give him, what the law of Ireland does not now
give him, the ownership at the expiration of the lease of all the
improvements made by the tenant? What single power has the Irish
landowner that the American landowner has not as fully? Is not the
American landlord just as free as is the Irish landlord to refuse to
rent his lands or his houses to any one who does not attend a certain
church or vote a certain ticket? Is he not quite as free to do this
as he is free to refuse his contributions to all but one particular
benevolent society or political committee? Or, if, not liking a
certain newspaper, he chooses to give notice to quit to any tenant
whom he finds taking that newspaper, what law can be invoked to
prevent him? There is none. The property is his, and he can let it,
or not let it, as he wills. And, having this power to let or not let,
he has power to demand any terms he pleases.</p>
<p>That Ireland is a conquered country; that centuries ago her soil
was taken from its native possessors and parceled out among aliens,
and that it has been confiscated again and again, has nothing to do
with the real question of today &#8211; no more to do with it than have
the confiscations of Marius and Sylla. England, too, is a conquered
country; her soil has been confiscated again and again; and, spite of
all talk about Saxon and Celt, it is not probable that, after the
admixture of generations, the division of landholder and
non-landholder any more coincides with distinction of race in the one
country than in the other. That Irish land titles rest on force and
fraud is true; but so do land titles in every country &#8211; even to a
large extent in our own peacefully settled country. Even in our most
recently settled States, how much land is there to which title has
been got by fraud and perjury and bribery &#8211; by the arts of the
lobbyist or the cunning tricks of hired lawyers, by double-barreled
shotguns and repeating rifles?</p>
<p>The truth is that the Irish land system is simply the general
system of modern civilization. In no essential feature does it differ
from the system that obtains here &#8211; in what we are accustomed to
consider the freest country under the sun. Entails and primogeniture
and family settlements may be in themselves bad things, and may
sometimes interfere with putting the land to its best use, but their
effects upon the relations of landlord and tenant are not worth
talking about. As for rack-rent, which is simply a rent fixed at
short intervals by competition, that is in the United States even a
more common way of letting land than in Ireland. In our cities the
majority of our people live in houses rented from month to month or
year to year for the highest price the landlord thinks he can get.
The usual term, in the newer States, at least, for the letting of
agricultural land is from season to season. And that the rent of land
in the United States comes, on the whole, more closely to the
standard of rack, or full competition rent, there can be, I think,
little doubt. That the land of Ireland is, as the apologists for
landlordism say, largely under-rented (that is, not rented for the
full amount the landlord might get with free competition) is probably
true. Miss C. G. O'Brien, in a recent article in the <em>Nineteenth
Century</em>, states that the tenant-farmers generally get for such
patches as they sub-let to their laborers twice the rent they pay the
landlords. And we hear incidentally of many "good landlords," i.e.,
landlords not in the habit of pushing their tenants for as much as
they might get by rigorously demanding all that any one would
give.</p>
<p>These things, as well as the peculiar bitterness of complaints
against middlemen and the speculators who have purchased encumbered
estates and manage them solely with a view to profit, go to show the
truth of the statement that the land of Ireland has been, by its
present owners, largely underlet, when considered from what we would
deem a business point of view. And this is but what might be
expected. Human nature is about the same the world over, and the
Irish Landlords as a class are no better nor worse than would be
other men under like conditions. An aristocracy such as that of
Ireland has its virtues as well as its vices, and is influenced by
sentiments which do not enter into mere business
transactions &#8211; sentiments which must often modify and soften the
calculations of cold self-interest. But with us the letting of land
is as much a business matter as the buying or selling of wheat or of
stocks. An American would not think he was showing his goodness by
renting his land for low rates, any more than he would think he was
showing his goodness by selling wheat for less than the market price,
or stocks for less than the quotations. So in those districts of
France and Belgium where the land is most sub-divided, the peasant
proprietors, says M. de Laveleye, boast to one another of the high
rents they get, just as they boast of the high prices they get for
pigs or for poultry.</p>
<p>The best measure of rent is, of course, its proportion to the
produce. The only estimate of Irish rent as a proportion of which I
know is that of Buckle, who puts it at one-fourth of the produce. In
this country I am inclined to think one-fourth would generally be
considered a moderate rent. Even in California there is considerable
land rented for one-third the crop, and some that rents for one-half
the crop; while, according to a writer in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>, the
common rent in that great wheat-growing section of the New Northwest
now being opened up is one-half the crop!</p>
<p>It does not seem to me that Justice Fitzgerald's statement can be
disputed, though of course its developments are not yet as strikingly
bad, for this is yet a new country, and tenants are comparatively
few, and land comparatively easy to get. The American land system is
really worse for the tenant than the Irish system. For with us there
is neither sentiment nor custom to check the force of competition or
mitigate the natural desire of the landlord to get all he can.</p>
<p>Nor is there anything in our system to prevent or check
absenteeism, so much complained of in regard to Ireland. Before the
modern era, which has so facilitated travel and communication, and
made the great cities so attractive to those having money to spend,
the prevalence of Irish absenteeism may have been due to special
causes, but at the present day there is certainly nothing peculiar in
it. Most of the large English and Scotch landholders are absentees
for the greater part of the year, and many of them live permanently
or for long intervals upon the Continent. So are our large American
landowners generally absentees. In New York, in San Francisco, in
Washington, Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis, live men who own large
tracts of land which they seldom or never see. A resident of
Rochester is said to own no less than four hundred farms in different
States, one of which (I believe in Kentucky) comprises thirty-five
thousand acres. Under the plantation system of farming and that of
stock-raising on a grand scale, which are developing so rapidly in
our new States, very much of the profits go to professional men and
capitalists who live in distant cities. Corporations whose stock is
held in the East or in Europe own much greater bodies of land, at
much greater distances, than do the London corporations possessing
landed estates in Ireland. To say nothing of the great land-grant
railroad companies, the Standard Oil Company probably owns more acres
of Western land than all the London companies put together own of
Irish land. And, although landlordism in its grosser forms is only
beginning in the United States, there is probably no American,
wherever he may live, who cannot in his immediate vicinity see some
instance of absentee landlordism. The tendency to concentration born
of the new era ushered in by the application of steam shows itself in
this way as in many others. To those who can live where they please,
the great cities are becoming more and more attractive.</p>
<p>And it is further to be remarked that too much stress is laid upon
absenteeism, and that it might be prevented without much of the evil
often attributed to it being cured. That is to say, that to his
tenantry and neighborhood the owner of land in Galway or Kilkenny
would be as much an absentee if he lived in Dublin as if he lived in
London, and that, if Irish landlords were compelled to live in
Ireland, all that the Irish people would gain would be,
metaphorically speaking, the crumbs that fell from the landlords'
tables. For if the butter and eggs, the pigs and the poultry, of the
Irish peasant must be taken from him and exported to pay for his
landlord's wine and cigars, what difference does it make to him where
the wine is drunk or the cigars are smoked?</p>
<p><b><a name="Distress_and_Famine"></a>Chapter 2: Distress and Famine</b></p>
<p>BUT it will be asked: If the land system which prevails in Ireland
is essentially the same as that which prevails elsewhere, how is it
that it does not produce the same results elsewhere?</p>
<p>I answer that it does everywhere produce the same kind of results.
As there is nothing essentially peculiar in the Irish land system, so
is there nothing essentially peculiar in Irish distress. Between the
distress in Ireland and the distress in other countries there may be
differences in degree and differences in manifestation; but that is
all.</p>
<p>The truth is, that as there is nothing peculiar in the Irish land
system, so is there nothing peculiar in the distress which that land
system causes. We hear a great deal of Irish emigration, of the
millions of sons and daughters of Erin who have been compelled to
leave their native soil. But have not the Scottish Highlands been all
but depopulated? Do not the English emigrate in the same way, and for
the same reasons? Do not the Germans and Italians and Scandinavians
also emigrate? Is there not a constant emigration from the Eastern
States of the Union to the Western &#8211; an emigration impelled by the
same motives as that which sets across the Atlantic? Nor am I sure
that this is not in some respects a more demoralizing emigration than
the Irish, for I do not think there is any such monstrous
disproportion of the sexes in Ireland as in Massachusetts. If French
and Belgian peasants do not emigrate as do the Irish, is it not
simply because they do not have such "long families"?</p>
<p>There has recently been deep and wide-spread distress in Ireland,
and but for the contributions of charity many would have perished for
want of food. But, to say nothing of such countries as India, China,
Persia, and Syria, is it not true that within the last few years
there have been similar spasms of distress in the most highly
civilized countries &#8211; not merely in Russia and in Poland, but in
Germany and England? Yes, even in the United States.</p>
<p>Have there not been, are there not constantly occurring, in all
these countries, times when the poorest classes are reduced to the
direst straits, and large numbers are saved from starvation only by
charity?</p>
<p>When there is famine among savages it is because food enough is
not to be had. But this was not the case in Ireland. In any part of
Ireland, during the height of what was called the famine, there was
food enough for whoever had means to pay for it. The trouble was not
in the scarcity of food. There was, as a matter of fact, no real
scarcity of food, and the proof of it is that food did not command
scarcity prices. During all the so-called famine, food was constantly
exported from Ireland to England, which would not have been the case
had there been true famine in one country any more than in the other.
During all the so-called famine a practically unlimited supply of
American meat and grain could have been poured into Ireland, through
the existing mechanism of exchange, so quickly that the relief would
have been felt instantaneously. Our sending of supplies in a national
war-ship was a piece of vulgar ostentation, fitly paralleled by their
ostentatious distribution in British gunboats under the nominal
superintendence of a royal prince. Had we been bent on relief, not
display, we might have saved our government the expense of fitting up
its antiquated warship, the British gunboats their coal, the Lord
Mayor his dinner, and the Royal Prince his valuable time. A cable
draft, turned in Dublin into postal orders, would have afforded the
relief, not merely much more easily and cheaply, but in less time
than it took our war-ship to get ready to receive her cargo; for the
reason that so many of the Irish people were starving was, not that
the food was not to be had, but that they had not the means to buy
it. Had the Irish people had money or its equivalent, the bad seasons
might have come and gone without stinting any one of a full meal.
Their effect would merely have been to determine toward Ireland the
flow of more abundant harvests.</p>
<p>I wish clearly to bring to view this point. The Irish famine was
not a true famine arising from scarcity of food. It was what an
English writer styled the Indian famine &#8211; a "financial famine,"
arising not from scarcity of food but from the poverty of the people.
The effect of the short crops in producing distress was not so much
in raising the price of food as in cutting off the accustomed incomes
of the people. The masses of the Irish people get so little in
ordinary times that they are barely able to live, and when anything
occurs to interrupt their accustomed incomes they have nothing to
fall back on.</p>
<p>Yet is this not true of large classes in all countries? And are
not all countries subject to just such famines as this Irish famine?
Good seasons and bad seasons are in the order of nature, just as the
day of sunshine and the day of rain, the summer's warmth and the
winter's snow. But agriculture is, on the whole, as certain as any
other pursuit, for even those industries which may be carried en
regardless of weather are subject to alternations as marked as those
to which agriculture is liable. There are good seasons and bad
seasons even in fishing and hunting, while the alternations are very
marked in mining and in manufacturing. In fact, the more highly
differentiated branches of industry which advancing civilization
tends to develop, though less directly dependent upon rain and
sunshine, heat and cold, seem increasingly subject to alternations
more frequent and intense. Though in a country of more diversified
industry the failure of a crop or two could not have such wide-spread
effects as in Ireland, yet the countries of more complex industries
are liable to a greater variety of disasters. A war on another
continent produces famine in Lancashire; Parisian milliners decree a
change of fashion, and Coventry operatives are saved from starvation
only by public alms; a railroad combination decides to raise the
price of coal, and Pennsylvania miners find their earnings diminished
by half or totally cut off; a bank breaks in New York, and in all the
large American cities soup-houses must be opened!</p>
<p>In this Irish famine which provoked the land agitation, there is
nothing that is peculiar. Such famines on a smaller or a larger scale
are constantly occurring. Nay, more! the fact is, that famine, just
such famine as this Irish famine, constantly exists in the richest
and most highly civilized lands. It persists even in "good times"
'when trade is "booming;" it spreads and rages whenever from any
cause industrial depression comes. It is kept under, or at least kept
from showing its worst phases, by poor-rates and almshouses, by
private benevolence and by vast organized charities, but it still
exists, gnawing in secret when it does not openly rage. In the very
centers of civilization, where the machinery of production and
exchange is at the highest point of efficiency, where bankvaults hold
millions, and show-windows flash with more than a prince's ransom,
where elevators and warehouses are gorged with grain, and markets are
piled with all things succulent and toothsome, where the dinners of
Lucullus are eaten every day, and, if it be but cool, the very
greyhounds wear dainty blankets &#8211; in these centers in wealth and
power and refinement, there are always hungry men and women and
little children. Never the sun goes down but on human beings prowling
like wolves far food, or huddling together like vermin for shelter
and warmth. "Always with You" is the significant heading under which
a New York paper, in these most prosperous times, publishes daily the
tales of chronic famine; and in the greatest and richest city in the
world &#8211; in that very London where the plenty of meat in the
butchers' shops seemed to some savages the most wondrous of all its
wonderful sights &#8211; in that very London, the mortuary reports have
a standing column for deaths by starvation.</p>
<p>But no more in its chronic than in its spasmodic forms is famine
to be measured by the deaths from starvation. Perfect, indeed, in all
its parts must be the human machine if it can run till the last bit
of available tissue be drawn to feed its fires. It is under the guise
of disease to which physicians can give less shocking names, that
famine &#8211; especially the chronic famine of civilization &#8211; kills.
And the statistics of mortality, especially of infant mortality, show
that in the richest communities famine is constantly at its work.
Insufficient nourishment, inadequate warmth and clothing, and
unwholesome surroundings, constantly, in the very centers of plenty,
swell the death-rates. What is this but famine &#8211; just such famine
as the Irish famine? It is not that the needed things are really
scarce; but that those whose need is direst have not the means to get
them, and, when not relieved by charity, want kills them in its
various ways. When, in the hot midsummer, little children die like
flies in the New York tenement wards, what is that but famine? And
those barges crowded with such children that a noble and tender
charity sends down New York Harbor to catch the fresh salt breath of
the Antlantic &#8211; are they not fighting famine as truly as were our
food-laden war-ship and the Royal Prince's gunboats? Alas! to find
famine one has not to cross the sea.</p>
<p>There was bitter satire in the cartoon that one of our illustrated
papers published when subscriptions to the Irish famine fund were
being made &#8211; a cartoon that represented James Gordon Bennett
sailing away for Ireland in a boat loaded down with provisions, while
a sad-eyed, hungry-looking, tattered group gazed wistfully on them
from the pier. The bite and the bitterness of it, the humiliating
sting and satire of it, were in its truth.</p>
<p>This is "the home of freedom," and "the asylum of the oppressed;"
our population is yet sparse, our public domain yet wide; we are the
greatest of food producers, yet even here there are beggars, tramps,
paupers, men torn by anxiety for the support of their families, women
who know not which way to turn, little children growing up in such
poverty and squalor that only a miracle can keep them pure. "Always
with you," even here. What is the week or the day of the week that
our papers do not tell of man or woman who, to escape the tortures of
want, has stepped out of life unbidden? What is this but famine?</p>

<p><b><i>LET me be understood. I am not endeavoring to excuse or

clear, for it has hitherto, in most of the discussions of the Irish
Land Question, been ignored. And without an appreciation of this fact
the real nature of the Irish Land Question is not understood, nor the
real importance of the agitation seen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What I contend for is this: That it
is a mistake to consider the
Irish Land Question as a mere local question, arising out of
conditions peculiar to Ireland, and which can be settled by remedies
that can have but local application.</span> On the contrary, I contend
that
what has been brought into prominence by Irish distress, and forced
into discussion by Irish agitation, is something infinitely more
important than any mere local question could be; it is nothing less
than that question of transcendent importance which is everywhere
beginning to agitate, and, if not settled, must soon convulse the
civilized world &#8211; the question</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">whether</span>, their political
equality
conceded (for, where this has not already been, it soon will be), <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the
masses of mankind are to remain mere hewers of wood and drawers of
water for the benefit of a fortunate few?</span> <br>
  </li>
  <li>whether, having escaped
from feudalism, modern society is to pass into an industrial
organization more grinding and oppressive, more heartless and
hopeless, than feudalism?</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">whether, amid the abundance
their labor
creates, the producers of wealth are to be content in good times with
the barest of livings and in bad times to suffer and to starve? </span>  </li>
</ul>
What
is involved in this Irish Land Question is not a mere local matter
between Irish landlords and Irish tenants, but the great social
problem of modern civilization. What is arraigned in the arraignment
of the claims of Irish landlords is nothing less than the wide-spread
institution of private property in land. In the assertion of the
natural rights of the Irish people is the assertion of the natural
rights that, by virtue of his existence, pertain everywhere to
man.
<br>
<br>
It is probable that the Irish agitators did not at first perceive
the real bearing and importance of the question they took in hand.
But they &#8211; the more intelligent and earnest of them, at
least &#8211; must now begin to realize it.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1)</span></small> Yet,
save, perhaps, on
the part of the ultra-Tories, who would resist any concession as the
opening of a door that cannot again be shut, there is on all sides a
disposition to ignore the real nature of the question, and to treat
it as springing from conditions peculiar to Ireland. On the one hand,
there is a large class in England and elsewhere, who, while willing
to concede or even actually desire that something should be done for
Ireland, fear any extension of the agitation into a questioning of
the rights of landowners elsewhere. And, on the other hand, the Irish
leaders seem anxious to confine attention in the same way, evidently
fearing that, should the question assume a broader aspect, strong
forces now with them might fall away and, perhaps to a large extent,
become directly and strongly antagonistic.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-2">(1) <em>The Irish World</em>,
which, though published in New York, has exerted a large influence upon
the agitation on both sides of the Atlantic, does realize, and has from
the first frankly declared, that the fight must be against landlordism
in toto and everywhere.</font></div>
<p>But it is not possible so to confine the discussion; no more
possible than it was possible to confine to France the questions
involved in the French Revolution; no more possible than it was
possible to keep the discussion which arose over slavery in the
Territories confined to the subject of slavery in the Territories.
And it is best that the truth be fully stated and clearly recognized.
He who sees the truth, let him proclaim it, without asking who is for
it or who is against it. This is not radicalism in the bad sense
which so many attach to the word. This is conservatism in the true
sense.</p>
<p>What gives to the Irish Land Question its supreme significance is
that it brings into attention and discussion &#8211; nay, that it forces
into attention and discussion, not a mere Irish question, but a
question of world-wide importance.</p>
<p>What has brought the land question to the front in Ireland, what
permits the relation between land and labor to be seen there with
such distinctness &#8211; to be seen even by those who cannot in other
places perceive them &#8211; is certain special conditions. Ireland is a
country of dense population, so that competition for the use of land
is so sharp and high as to produce marked effects upon the
distribution of wealth. It is mainly an agricultural country so that
production is concerned directly and unmistakably with the soil. Its
industrial organization is largely that simple one in which an
employing capitalist does not mind between laborer and landowner, so
that the connection between rent and wages is not obscured. Ireland,
moreover, was never conquered by the Romans, nor, until comparatively
recently, by any people who had felt in their legal system the effect
of Roman domination. It is the European country in which primitive
ideas as to land tenures have longest held their sway, and the
circumstances of its conquest, its cruel misgovernment, and the
differences of race and religion between the masses of the people and
those among whom the land was parceled, have tended to preserve old
traditions and to direct the strength of Irish feeling and the fervor
of Irish imagination against a system which forces the descendant of
the ancient possessors of the soil to pay tribute for it to the
representative of a hated stranger. It is for these reasons that the
connection between Irish distress and Irish landlordism is so easily
seen and readily realized.</p>
<p>But does not the same relation exist between English pauperism and
English landlordism &#8211; between American tramps and the American
land system? Essentially the same land system as that of Ireland
exists elsewhere, and, wherever it exists, distress of essentially
the same kind is to be seen. And elsewhere, just as certainly as in
Ireland, is the connection between the two that of cause and
effect.</p>
<p>When the agent of the Irish landlord takes from the Irish cottier
for rent his pigs, his poultry, or his potatoes, or the money that he
gains by the sale of these things, it is clear enough that this rent
comes from the earnings of labor, and diminishes what the laborer
gets. But is not this in reality just as clear when a dozen middlemen
stand between laborer and landlord? Is it not just as clear when,
instead of being paid monthly or quarterly or yearly, rent is paid in
a lumped sum called purchase-money? Whence come the incomes which the
owners of land in mining districts, in manufacturing districts, or in
commercial districts, receive for the use of their land? Manifestly,
they must come from the earnings of labor &#8211; there is no other
source from which they can come. From what are the revenues of
Trinity Church corporation drawn, if not from the earnings of labor?
What is the source of the income of the Astors, if it is not the
labor of laboring-men, women, and children? When a man makes a
fortune by the rise of real estate, as in New York and elsewhere many
men have done within the past few months, what does it mean? It means
that he may have fine clothes, costly food, a grand house luxuriously
furnished, etc. Now, these things are not the spontaneous fruits of
the soil; neither do they fall from heaven, nor are they cast up by
the sea. They are products of labor &#8211; can be produced only by
labor. And hence, if men who do no labor get them, it must
necessarily be at the expense of those who do labor.</p>
<p>It may seem as if I were needlessly dwelling upon a truth apparent
by mere statement. Yet, simple as this truth is, it is persistently
ignored. This is the reason that the true relation and true
importance of the question which has come to the front in Ireland are
so little realized.</p>
<p>To give an illustration: In his article in the <em>North American
Review</em> last year, Mr. Parnell speaks as though the building up of
manufactures in Ireland would lessen the competition for land. What
justification for such a view is there either in theory or in fact?
Can manufacturing be carried on without land any more than
agriculture can be carried on without land? Is not competition for
land measured by price, and, if Ireland were a manufacturing country,
would not the value of her land be greater than now? Had English
clamor for "protection to home industry" not been suffered to secure
the strangling of Irish industries in their infancy, Ireland might
now be more of a manufacturing country with larger population and a
greater aggregate production of wealth. But the tribute which the
landowners could have taken would likewise have been greater. Put a
Glasgow, a Manchester, or a London in one of the Irish agricultural
counties, and, where the landlords now take pounds in rent, they
would be enabled to demand hundreds and thousands of pounds. And it
would necessarily come from the same source &#8211; the ultimate source
of all incomes &#8211; the earnings of labor. That so large a proportion
of the laboring-class would not have to compete with each other for
agricultural land is true. But they would have to do what is
precisely the same thing. They would have to compete with each other
for employment &#8211; for the opportunity to make a living. And there
is no reason to think that this competition would be less intense
than now. On the contrary, in the manufacturing districts of England
and Scotland, just as in the agricultural districts of Ireland, the
competition for the privilege of earning a living forces wages to
such a minimum as, even in good times, will give only a living.</p>
<p>What is the difference? The Irish peasant cultivator hires his
little farm from a landlord, and pays rent directly. The English
agricultural laborer hires himself to an employing farmer who hires
the land, and who out of the produce pays to the one his wages and to
the other his rent. In both cases competition forces the laborer down
to a bare living as a net return for his work, and only stops at that
point because, when men do not get enough to live on, they die and
cease to compete. And, in the same way, competition forces the
employing farmer to give up to the landlord all that he has left
after paying wages, save the ordinary returns of capital &#8211; for the
profits of the English farmer do not, on the average, I understand,
exceed five or six per cent. And in other businesses, such as
manufacturing, competition in the same way forces down wages to the
minimum of a bare living, while rent goes up and up. Thus is it clear
that no change in methods or improvements in the processes of
industry lessens the landlord's power of claiming the lion's
share.</p>
<p>I am utterly unable to see in what essential thing the condition
of the Irish peasant would be a whit improved were Ireland as rich as
England, and her industries as diversified. For the Irish peasant is
not to be compared with the English tenant-farmer, who is really a
capitalist, but with the English agricultural laborer and the lowest
class of factory operatives. Surely their condition is not so much
better than that of the Irish peasant as to make a difference worth
talking about. On the contrary, miserable as is the condition of the
Irish peasantry, sickening as are the stories of their suffering, I
am inclined to think that for the worst instances of human
degradation one must go to the reports that describe the condition of
the laboring poor of England, rather than to the literature of Irish
misery. For there are three things for which, in spite of their
poverty and wretchedness and occasional famine, the very poorest of
Irish peasants are by all accounts remarkable &#8211; the physical vigor
of their men, the purity of their women, and the strength of the
family affections. This, to put it mildly, cannot be said of large
classes of the laboring populations of England and Scotland. In those
rich manufacturing districts are classes stunted and deteriorated
physically by want and unwholesome employments; classes in which the
idea of female virtue is all but lost, and the family affections all
but trodden out.</p>
<p>But it is needless to compare sufferings and measure miseries. I
merely wish to correct that impression which leads so many people to
talk and write as though rent and land tenures related solely to
agriculture and to agricultural communities. Nothing could be more
erroneous. Land is necessary to all production, no matter what be the
kind or form; land is the standing-place, the workshop, the
storehouse of labor; it is to the human being the only means by which
he can obtain access to the material universe or utilize its powers.
Without land man cannot exist. To whom the ownership of land is
given, to him is given the virtual ownership of the men who must live
upon it. When this necessity is absolute, then does he necessarily
become their absolute master. And just as this point is
neared &#8211; that is to say, just as competition increases the demand
for land &#8211; just in that degree does the power of taking a larger
and larger share of the earnings of labor increase. It is this power
that gives land its value; this is the power that enables the owner
of valuable land to reap where he has not sown &#8211; to appropriate to
himself wealth which he has had no share in producing. Rent is always
the devourer of wages. The owner of city land takes, in the rents he
receives for his land, the earnings of labor just as clearly as does
the owner of farming land. And whether he be working in a garret ten
stories above the street, or in a mining drift thousands of feet
below the earth's surface, it is the competition for the use of land
that ultimately determines what proportion of the produce of his
labor the laborer will get for himself. This is the reason why modern
progress does not tend to extirpate poverty; this is the reason why,
with all the inventions and improvements and economies which so
enormously increase productive power, wages everywhere tend to the
minimum of a bare living. The cause that in Ireland produces poverty
and distress &#8211; the ownership by some of the people of the land on
which and from which the whole people must live &#8211; everywhere else
produces the same results. It is this that produces the hideous
squalor of London and Glasgow slums; it is this that makes want
jostle luxury in the streets of rich New York, that forces little
children to monotonous and stunting toil in Massachusetts mills, and
that fills the highways of our newest States with tramps.</p>
<p><b><a name="Proposed_Remedies"></a>Chapter 4: Proposed Remedies</b></p>
<p>THE facts we have been considering give to the Irish agitation a
significance and dignity that no effort for the redress of merely
local grievances, no struggle for mere national independence could
have. As the cause which produces Irish distress exists everywhere
throughout modern civilization, and everywhere produces the same
results, the question as to what measures will fully meet the case of
Ireland has for us not merely a speculative and sentimental interest,
but a direct and personal interest.</p>
<p>For a year and more the English journals and magazines have been
teeming with articles on the Irish Land Question; but, among all the
remedies proposed, even by men whose reputation is that of clear
thinkers and advanced Liberals, I have seen nothing which shows any
adequate grasp of the subject. And this is true also of the measures
proposed by the agitators, so far as they have proposed any. They are
illogical and insufficient to the last degree. They neither disclose
any clear principle nor do they aim at any result worth the
struggle.</p>
<p>From the most timid to the most radical, these schemes are
restricted to one or more of the following propositions:</p>
<blockquote>1st. To abolish entails and primogenitures and other
difficulties in the way of sales.
  <p>2nd. To legalize and extend tenant-right.</p>
  <p>3rd. To establish tribunals of arbitrament which shall decide upon
appeal the rent to be paid.</p>
  <p>4th. To have the State buy out the landlords and sell again on
time to the tenants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first of these propositions is good in itself. To make the
transfer of land easy would be to remove obstacles which prevent its
passing into the hands of those who would make the most out of it.
But, so far as this will have any effect at all, it will not be
toward giving the Irish tenants more merciful landlords; nor yet will
it be to the diffusion of landed property. Those who think so shut
their eyes to the fact that the tendency of the time is to
concentration.</p>
<p>As for the propositions which look in various forms to the
establishment of tenant-right, it is to be observed that, in so far
as they go beyond giving the tenant surety for his improvements, they
merely carve out of the estate of the landlord an estate for the
tenant. Even if the proposal to empower the courts, in cases of
dispute, to decide what is a fair rent were to amount to anything
(and the Land Leaguers say it would not), the fixing of a lower rent
as the share of the landlord would merely enable the tenant to charge
a higher price to his successor. Whatever might thus be done for
present agricultural tenants would be of no use to future tenants,
and nothing whatever would be done for the masses of the people. In
fact, that the effect would be to increase rent in the aggregate
there can be no doubt. Whatever modification might be made in the
landlord's demands, the sum which the outgoing tenant would ask would
be very certain to be all he could possibly get, so that rent in the
aggregate, instead of being diminished, would be screwed up to the
full competition or rack-rent standard.</p>
<p>What seem to be considered the most radical propositions yet made
are those for the creation of a "peasant proprietary" &#8211; the State
to buy out the landlords and resell to the tenants, for annual
payments extending over a term of years, and covering principal and
interest. Waiving all practical difficulties, and they are very
great, what could thus be accomplished? Nothing real and permanent.
For not merely is this, too, but a partial measure, which could not
improve the condition of the masses of the people or help those most
needing help, but no sooner were the lands thus divided than a
process of concentration would infallibly set in which would be all
the more rapid from the fact that the new landholders would be
heavily mortgaged. The tendency to concentration which has so
steadily operated in Great Britain, and is so plainly showing itself
in our new States, must operate in Ireland, and would immediately
begin to weld together again the little patches of the newly created
peasant proprietors. The tendency of the time is against peasant
proprietorships; it is in everything to concentration, not to
separation. The tendency which has wiped out the small landowners,
the boasted yeomanry, of England &#8211; which in our new States is
uniting the quarter-sections of preemption and homestead settlers
into great farms of thousands of acres &#8211; is already too strong to
be resisted, and is constantly becoming stronger and more
penetrating. For it springs from the inventions and improvements and
economies which are transforming modern industry &#8211; the same
influences which are concentrating population in large cities,
business into the hands of great houses, and for the blacksmith
making his own nails or the weaver working his own loom substitute
the factory of the great corporation.</p>
<p>That a great deal that the English advocates of peasant
proprietorship have to say about the results of their favorite system
in continental Europe is not borne out by the facts, any one who
chooses to look over the testimony may see. But it is useless to
discuss that.</p>
<p>Peasant proprietorship in continental Europe is a survival. It
exists only among populations which have not felt fully the breath of
the new era. It continues to exist only by virtue of conditions which
do not obtain in Ireland. The Irish peasant is not the French or
Belgian peasant. He is in the habit of having very "long families,"
they very short ones. He has become familiar with the idea of
emigrating; they have not. He can hardly be expected to have acquired
those habits of close economy and careful forethought for which they
are so remarkable; and there are various agencies, among which are to
be counted the national schools and the reaction from America, that
have roused in him aspirations and ambitions which would prevent him
from continuing to water his little patch with his sweat, as do the
French and Belgian peasant proprietors, when he could sell it for
enough to emigrate. Peasant proprietorship, like that of France and
Belgium, might possibly have been instituted in Ireland some time
ago, before the railroad and the telegraph and the national schools
and the establishment of the steam bridge across the Atlantic. But to
do it now to any extent, and with any permanency, seems to me about
as practicable as to go back to hand-loom weaving in Manchester. Much
more in accordance with modern tendencies is the notice I have
recently seen of the formation of a company to buy up land in
Southern Ireland, and cultivate it on a large scale; for to
production on a large scale modern processes more and more strongly
tend. It is not merely the steam-plow and harvesting machinery that
make the cultivation of the large field more profitable than that of
the small one; it is the railroad, the telegraph, the manifold
inventions of all sorts. Even butter and cheese are now made and
chickens hatched and fattened in factories.</p>
<p>But the fatal defect of all these schemes as remedial measures is,
that they do not go to the cause of the disease.</p>
<p>What they propose to do, they propose to do for merely one class
of the Irish people &#8211; the agricultural tenants. Now, the
agricultural tenants are not so large nor so poor a class (among them
are in fact many large capitalist farmers of the English type) as the
agricultural laborers, while besides these there are the laborers of
other kinds &#8211; the artisans, operatives, and poorer classes of the
cities. What extension of tenant-right or conversion of
tenant-farmers into partial or absolute proprietors is to benefit
them? Even if the number of owners of Irish soil could thus be
increased, the soil of Ireland would still be in the hands of a
class, though of a somewhat larger class. And the spring of Irish
misery would be untouched. Those who had merely their labor would be
as badly off as now, if not in some respects worse off. Rent would
soon devour wages, and the injustice involved in the present system
would be intrenched by the increase in the number who seemingly
profit by it.</p>
<p>It is that peasant proprietors would strengthen the existing
system that makes schemes for creating them so popular among certain
sections of the propertied classes of Great Britain. This is the
ground on which these schemes are largely urged. These small
landowners are desired that they may be used as a buffer and bulwark
against any questioning of the claims of the larger owners. They
would be put forward to resist the shock of "agrarianism," just as
the women are put forward in resistance to the process-servers.
"What! do you propose to rob these poor peasants of their little
homesteads?" would be the answer to any one who proposed to attack
the system under which the larger landholders draw millions annually
from the produce of labor.</p>
<p>And here is the danger in the adoption of measures not based upon
correct principles. They fail not only to do any real and permanent
good, but they make proper measures more difficult. Even if a
majority of the people of Ireland were made the owners of the soil,
the injustice to the minority would be as great as now, and wages
would still tend to the minimum, which in good times means a bare
living, and in bad times means starvation. Even were it possible to
cut up the soil of Ireland into those little patches into which the
soil of France and Belgium is cut in the districts where the
morcellement prevails, this would not be the attainment of a just and
healthy social state. But it would make the attainment of a just and
healthy social state much more difficult.</p>
<p><b><a name="Whose_Land_is_it"></a>Chapter 5: Whose Land is it?</b></p>
<p>WHAT, then, is the true solution of the Irish problem? The answer
is as important to other countries as to Ireland, for the Irish
problem is but a local phase of the great problem which is everywhere
pressing upon the civilized world.</p>
<p>With the leaders of the Irish movement, the question is, of
course, not merely what ought to be done, but what can be done. But,
to a clear understanding of the whole subject, the question of
principle must necessarily precede that of method. We must decide
where we want to go before we can decide what is the best road to
take.</p>
<p>The first question that naturally arises is that of right. Among
whatever kind of people such a matter as this is discussed, the
question of right is sure to be raised. This, to me, seems a very
significant thing; for I believe it to spring from nothing less than
a universal perception of the human mind &#8211; a perception often dim
and vague, yet still a universal perception, that justice is the
supreme law of the universe, so that, as a short road to what is
best, we instinctively ask what is right?</p>
<p>Now, what are the rights of this case? </p>
<ul>
  <li>To whom rightfully does the soil of Ireland belong? </li>
  <li>Who are justly entitled to its use and to all the benefits that
flow from its use? </li>
</ul>
<p>Let us settle this question clearly and decisively, before we
attempt anything else.</p>
<p>Let me go to the heart of this question by asking another
question: Has or has not the child born in Ireland a right to live?
There can be but one answer, for no one would contend that it was
right to drown Irish babies, or that any human law could make it
right. Well, then, if every human being born in Ireland has a right
to live in Ireland, these rights must be equal. If each one has a
right to live, then no one can have any better right to live than any
other one. There can be no dispute about this. No one will contend
that it would be any less a crime to drown a baby of an Irish peasant
woman than it would be to drown the baby of the proudest duchess, or
that a law commanding the one would be any more justifiable than a
law commanding the other.</p>
<p>Since, then, all the Irish people have the same equal right to
life, it follows that they must all have the same equal right to the
land of Ireland. If they are all in Ireland by the same equal
permission of Nature, so that no one of them can justly set up a
superior claim to life than any other one of them; so that all the
rest of them could not justly say to any one of them, "You have not
the same right to live as we have; therefore we will pitch you out of
Ireland into the sea!" then they must all have the same equal rights
to the elements which Nature has provided for the sustaining of
life &#8211; to air, to water, and to land. For to deny the equal right
to the elements necessary to the maintaining of life is to deny the
equal right to life. Any law that said, "Certain babies have no right
to the soil of Ireland; therefore they shall be thrown off the soil
of Ireland;" would be precisely equivalent to a law that said,
"Certain babies have no right to live; therefore they shall be thrown
into the sea." And as no law or custom or agreement can justify the
denial of the equal right to life, so no law or custom or agreement
can justify the denial of the equal right to land.</p>
<p>It therefore follows, from the very fact of their existence, that
the right of each one of the people of Ireland to an equal share in
the land of Ireland is equal and inalienable: that is to say, that
the use and benefit of the land of Ireland belong rightfully to the
whole people of Ireland, to each one as much as to every other; to no
one more than to any other &#8211; not to some individuals, to the
exclusion of other individuals; not to one class, to the exclusion of
other classes; not to landlords, not to tenants, not to cultivators,
but to the whole people.</p>
<p>This right is irrefutable and indefeasible. It pertains to and
springs from the fact of existence, the right to live. No law, no
covenant, no agreement, can bar it. One generation cannot stipulate
away the rights of another generation. If the whole people of Ireland
were to unite in bargaining away their rights in the land, how could
they justly bargain away the right of the child who the next moment
is born? No one can bargain away what is not his; no one can
stipulate away the rights of another. And if the new-born infant has
an equal right to life, then has it an equal right to land. Its
warrant, which comes direct from Nature, and which sets aside all
human laws or title-deeds, is the fact that it is born.</p>
<p>Here we have a firm, self-apparent principle from which we may
safely proceed. The land of Ireland does not belong to one individual
more than to another individual; to one class more than to another
class; to one generation more than to the generations that come
after. It belongs to the whole people who at the time exist upon
it.</p>
<p><b><a name="Landlords_Right_is_Labors_Wrong."></a>Chapter 6: Landlords' Right
is Labor's Wrong</b></p>
<p>I DO not dwell upon this principle because it has not yet been
asserted. I dwell upon it because, although it has been asserted, no
proposal to carry it out has yet been made. The cry has indeed gone
up that the land of Ireland belongs to the people of Ireland, but
there the recognition of the principle has stopped. To say that the
land of Ireland belongs to the people of Ireland, and then merely to
ask that rents shall be reduced, or that tenant-right be extended, or
that the State shall buy the land from one class and sell it to
another class, is utterly illogical and absurd.</p>
<p>Either the land of Ireland rightfully belongs to the Irish
landlords, or it rightfully belongs to the Irish people; there can be
no middle ground. If it rightfully belongs to the landlords, then is
the whole agitation wrong, and every scheme for interfering in any
way with the landlords is condemned. If the land rightfully belongs
to the landlords, then it is nobody else's business what they do with
it, or what rent they charge for it, or where or how they spend the
money they draw from it, and whoever does not want to live upon it on
the landlords' terms is at perfect liberty to starve or emigrate. But
if, on the contrary, the land of Ireland rightfully belongs to the
Irish people, then the only logical demand is, not that the tenants
shall be made joint owners with the landlords, not that it be bought
from a smaller class and sold to a larger class, but that it be
resumed by the whole people. To propose to pay the landlords for it
is to deny the right of the people to it. The real fight for Irish
rights must he made outside of Ireland; and, above all things, the
Irish agitators ought to take a logical position, based upon a broad,
clear principle which can be everywhere understood and appreciated.
To ask for tenant-right or peasant proprietorship is not to take such
a position; to concede that the landlords ought to be paid is utterly
to abandon the principle that the land belongs rightfully to the
people.</p>
<p>To admit, as even the most radical of the Irish agitators seem to
admit, that the landlords should be paid the value of their lands, is
to deny the rights of the people. It is an admission that the
agitation is an interference with the just rights of property. It is
to ignore the only principle on which the agitation can be justified,
and on which it can gather strength for the accomplishment of
anything real and permanent. To admit this is to admit that the Irish
people have no more right to the soil of Ireland than any outsider.
For, any outsider can go to Ireland and buy land, if he will give its
market value. To propose to buy out the landlords is to propose to
continue the present injustice in another form. They would get in
interest on the debt created what they now get in rent. They would
still have a lien upon Irish labor.</p>
<p>And why should the landlords be paid? If the land of Ireland
belongs of natural right to the Irish people, what valid claim for
payment can be set up by the landlords? No one will contend that the
land is theirs of natural right, for the day has gone by when men
could be told that the Creator of the universe intended his bounty
for the exclusive use and benefit of a privileged class of his
creatures &#8211; that he intended a few to roll in luxury while their
fellows toiled and starved for them. The claim of the landlords to
the land rests not on natural right, but merely on municipal
law &#8211; on municipal law which contravenes natural right. And,
whenever the sovereign power changes municipal law so as to conform
to natural right, what claim can they assert to compensation? Some of
them bought their lands, it is true; but they got no better title
than the seller had to give. And what are these titles? Titles based
on murder and robbery, on blood and rapine &#8211; titles which rest on
the most atrocious and wholesale crimes. Created by force and
maintained by force, they have not behind them the first shadow of
right. That Henry II and James I and Cromwell and the Long Parliament
had the power to give and grant Irish lands is true; but will any one
contend they had the right? Will any one contend that in all the past
generations there has existed on the British Isles or anywhere else
any human being, or any number of human beings, who had the right to
say that in the year 1881 the great mass of Irishmen should be
compelled to pay &#8211; in many cases to residents of England, France,
or the United States &#8211; for the privilege of living in their native
country and making a living from their native soil? Even if it be
said that might makes right; even if it be contended that in the
twelfth, or seventeenth, or eighteenth century lived men who, having
the power, had therefore the right, to give away the soil of Ireland,
it cannot be contended that their right went further than their
power, or that their gifts and grants are binding on the men of the
present generation. No one can urge such a preposterous doctrine.
And, if might makes right, then the moment the people get power to
take the land the rights of the present landholders utterly cease,
and any proposal to compensate them is a proposal to do a fresh
wrong.</p>
<p>Should it be urged that, no matter on what they originally rest,
the lapse of time has given to the legal owners of Irish land a title
of which they cannot now be justly deprived without compensation, it
is sufficient to ask, with Herbert Spencer, at what rate per annum
wrong becomes right? Even the shallow pretense that the acquiescence
of society can vest in a few the exclusive right to that element on
which and from which Nature has ordained that all must live, cannot
be urged in the case of Ireland. For the Irish people have never
acquiesced in their spoliation, unless the bound and gagged victim
may be said to acquiesce in the robbery and maltreatment which he
cannot prevent. Though the memory of their ancient rights in the land
of their country may have been utterly stamped out among the people
of England, and have been utterly forgotten among their kin on this
side of the sea, it has long survived among the Irish. If the Irish
people have gone hungry and cold and ignorant, if they have been
evicted from lands on which their ancestors had lived from time
immemorial, if they have been forced to emigrate or to starve, it has
not been for the want of protest. They have protested all they could;
they have struggled all they could. It has been but superior force
that has stifled their protests and made their struggles vain. In a
blind, dumb way, they are protesting now and struggling now, though
even if their hands were free they might not at first know how to
untie the knots in the cords that bind them. But acquiesce they never
have.</p>
<p>Yet, even supposing they had aquiesced, as in their ignorance the
working-classes of such countries as England and the United States
now acquiesce, in the iniquitous system which makes the common
birthright of all the exclusive property of some. What then? Does
such acquiescence turn wrong into right? If the sleeping traveler
wake to find a robber with his hand in his pocket, is he bound to buy
the robber off &#8211; bound not merely to let him keep what he has
previously taken, but pay him the full value of all he expected the
sleep of his victim to permit him to get? If the stockholders of a
bank find that for a long term of years their cashier has been
appropriating the lion's share of the profits, are they to be told
that they cannot discharge him without paying him for what he might
have got, had his peculations not been discovered?</p>
<p><b><a name="The_Great-Great-Grandson_of_Captain"></a>Chapter 7: The
Great-Great-Grandson of Captain Kidd.</b></p>
<p>I APOLOGIZE to the Irish landlords and to all other landlords for
likening them to thieves and robbers.</p>
<p>I trust they will understand that I do not consider them as
personally worse than other men, but that I am obliged to use such
illustrations because no others will fit the case. I am concerned not
with individuals, but with the system. What I want to do is, to point
out a distinction that in the plea for the vested rights of
landowners is ignored &#8211; a distinction which arises from the
essential difference between land and things that are the produce of
human labor, and which is obscured by our habit of classing them all
together as property.</p>
<p>The galleys that carried Caesar to Britain, the accoutrements of
his legionaries, the baggage that they carried, the arms that they
bore, the buildings that they erected; the scythed chariots of the
ancient Britons, the horses that drew them, their wicker boats and
wattled houses &#8211; where are they now? But the land for which Roman
and Briton fought, there it is still. That British soil is yet as
fresh and as new as it was in the days of the Romans. Generation
after generation has lived on it since, and generation after
generation will live on it yet. Now, here is a very great difference.
The right to possess and to pass on the ownership of things that in
their nature decay and soon cease to be is a very different thing
from the right to possess and to pass on the ownership of that which
does not decay, but from which each successive generation must
live.</p>
<p>To show how this difference between land and such other species of
property as are properly styled wealth bears upon the argument for
the vested rights of landholders, let me illustrate again.</p>
<p><a name="Captain Kidd"></a>Captain Kidd was a pirate. He made a
business of sailing the seas, capturing merchantmen, making their
crews walk the plank, and appropriating their cargoes. In this way he
accumulated much wealth, which he is thought to have buried. But let
us suppose, for the sake of the illustration, that he did not bury
his wealth, but left it to his legal heirs, and they to their heirs
and so on, until at the present day this wealth or a part of it has
come to a great-great-grandson of Captain Kidd. Now, let us suppose
that some one &#8211; say a great-great-grandson of one of the
shipmasters whom Captain Kidd plundered, makes complaint, and says:
"This man's great-great-grandfather plundered my
great-great-grandfather of certain things or certain sums, which have
been transmitted to him, whereas but for this wrongful act they would
have been transmitted to me; therefore, I demand that he be made to
restore them." What would society answer?</p>
<p>Society, speaking by its proper tribunals, and in accordance with
principles recognized among all civilized nations, would say: "We
cannot entertain such a demand. It may be true that Mr. Kidd's
great-great-grandfather robbed your great-great-grandfather, and that
as the result of this wrong he has got things that otherwise might
have come to you. But we cannot inquire into occurrences that
happened so long ago. Each generation has enough to do to attend to
its own affairs. If we go to righting the wrongs and reopening the
controversies of our great-great-grandfathers, there will be endless
disputes and pretexts for dispute. What you say may be true, but
somewhere we must draw the line, and have an end to strife. Though
this man's great-great-grandfather may have robbed your
great-great-grandfather, he has not robbed you. He came into
possession of these things peacefully, and has held them peacefully,
and we must take this peaceful possession, when it has been continued
for a certain time, as absolute evidence of just title; for, were we
not to do that, there would be no end to dispute and no secure
possession of anything."</p>
<p>Now, it is this common-sense principle that is expressed in the
statute of limitations &#8211; in the doctrine of vested rights. This is
the reason why it is held &#8211; and as to most things held
justly&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; that peaceable possession for a certain time cures
all
defects of title.</p>
<p>But let us pursue the illustration a little further:</p>
<p>Let us suppose that Captain Kidd, having established a large and
profitable piratical business, left it to his son, and he to his son,
and so on, until the great-great-grandson, who now pursues it, has
come to consider it the most natural thing in the world that his
ships should roam the sea, capturing peaceful merchantmen, making
their crews walk the plank, and bringing home to him much plunder,
whereby he is enabled, though he does no work at all, to live in very
great luxury, and look down with contempt upon people who have to
work. But at last, let us suppose, the merchants get tired of having
their ships sunk and their goods taken, and sailors get tired of
trembling for their lives every time a sail lifts above the horizon,
and they demand of society that piracy be stopped.</p>
<p>Now, what should society say if Mr. Kidd got indignant, appealed
to the doctrine of vested rights, and asserted that society was bound
to prevent any interference with the business that he had inherited,
and that, if it wanted him to stop, it must buy him out, paying him
all that his business was worth &#8211; that is to say, at least as much
as he could make in twenty years' successful pirating, so that if he
stopped pirating he could still continue to live in luxury off of the
profits of the merchants and the earnings of the sailors?</p>
<p>What ought society to say to such a claim as this? There will be
but one answer. We will all say that society should tell Mr. Kidd
that his was a business to which the statute of limitations and the
doctrine of vested rights did not apply; that because his father, and
his grandfather, and his great- and great-great-grandfather pursued
the business of capturing ships and making their crews walk the
plank, was no reason why lie should be permitted to pursue it.
Society, we will all agree, ought to say he would have to stop piracy
and stop it at once, and that without getting a cent for
stopping.</p>
<p>Or supposing it had happened that Mr. Kidd had sold out his
piratical business to Smith, Jones, or Robinson, we will all agree
that society ought to say that their purchase of the business gave
them no greater right than Mr. Kidd had.</p>
<p>We will all agree that that is what society ought to say. Observe,
I do not ask what society would say.</p>
<p>For, ridiculous and preposterous as it may appear, I am satisfied
that, under the circumstances I have supposed, society would not for
a long time say what we have agreed it ought to say. Not only would
all the Kidds loudly claim that to make them give up their business
without full recompense would be a wicked interference with vested
rights, but the justice of this claim would at first be assumed as a
matter of course by all or nearly all the influential
classes &#8211; the great lawyers, the able journalists, the writers for
the magazines, the eloquent clergymen, and the principal professors
in the principal universities. Nay, even the merchants and sailors,
when they first began to complain, would be so tyrannized and
browbeaten by this public opinion that they would hardly think of
more than of buying out the Kidds, and, wherever here and there any
one dared to raise his voice in favor of stopping piracy at once and
without compensation, he would only do so under penalty of being
stigmatized as a reckless disturber and wicked foe of social
order.</p>
<p>If any one denies this, if any one says mankind are not such
fools, then I appeal to universal history to bear me witness. I
appeal to the facts of to-day.</p>
<p>Show me a wrong, no matter how monstrous, that ever yet, among any
people, became ingrafted in the social system, and I will prove to
you the truth of what I say.</p>
<p>The majority of men do not think; the majority of men have to
expend so much energy in the struggle to make a living that they do
not have time to think. The majority of men accept, as a matter of
course, whatever is. This is what makes the task of the social
reformer so difficult, his path so hard. This is what brings upon
those who first raise their voices in behalf of a great truth the
sneers of the powerful and the curses of the rabble, ostracism and
martyrdom, the robe of derision and the crown of thorns.</p>
<p>Am I not right? Have there not been states of society in which
piracy has been considered the most respectable and honorable of
pursuits? Did the Roman populace see anything more reprehensible in a
gladiatorial show than we do in a horse-race? Does public opinion in
Dahomey see anything reprehensible in the custom of sacrificing a
thousand or two human beings by way of signalizing grand occasions?
Are there not states of society in which, in spite of the natural
proportions of the sexes, polygamy is considered a matter of course?
Are there not states of society in which it would be considered the
most ridiculous thing in the world to say that a man's son was more
closely related to him than his nephew? Are there not states of
society in which it would be considered disreputable for a man to
carry a burden while a woman who could stagger under it was
around? &#8211; states of society in which the husband who did not
occasionally beat his wife would be deemed by both sexes a
weak-minded, low-spirited fellow? What would Chinese fashionable
society consider more outrageous than to be told that mothers should
not be permitted to squeeze their daughters' feet, or Flathead women
than being restrained from tying a board on their infants' skulls?
How long has it been since the monstrous doctrine of the divine right
of kings was taught through all Christendom?</p>
<p>What is the slave-trade but piracy of the worst kind? Yet it is
not long since the slave-trade was looked upon as a perfectly
respectable business, affording as legitimate an opening for the
investment of capital and the display of enterprise as any other. The
proposition to prohibit it was first looked upon as ridiculous, then
as fanatical, then as wicked. It was only slowly and by hard fighting
that the truth in regard to it gained ground. Does not our very
Constitution bear witness to what I say? Does not the fundamental law
of the nation, adopted twelve years after the enunciation of the
Declaration of Independence, declare that for twenty years the
slave-trade shall not be prohibited nor restricted? Such dominion had
the idea of vested interests over the minds of those who had already
proclaimed the inalienable right of man to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness!</p>
<p>Is it not but yesterday that in the freest and greatest republic
on earth, among the people who boast that they lead the very van of
civilization, this doctrine of vested rights was deemed a sufficient
justification for all the cruel wrongs of human slavery? Is it not
but yesterday when whoever dared to say that the rights of property
did not justly attach to human beings; when whoever dared to deny
that human beings could be rightfully bought and sold like
cattle &#8211; the husband torn from the wife and the child from the
mother; when whoever denied the right of whoever had paid his money
for him to work or whip his own nigger was looked upon as a wicked
assailant of the rights of property? Is it not but yesterday when in
the South whoever whispered such a thought took his life in his
hands; when in the North the abolitionist was held by the churches as
worse than an infidel, was denounced by the politicians and
rotten-egged by the mob? I was born in a Northern State, I have never
lived in the South, I am not yet gray; but I well remember, as every
American of middle age must remember, how over and over again I have
heard all questionings of slavery silenced by the declaration that
the negroes were the property of their masters, and that to take away
a man's slave without payment was as much a crime as to take away his
horse without payment. And whoever does not remember that far back,
let him look over American literature previous to the war, and say
whether, if the business of piracy had been a flourishing business,
it would have lacked defenders? Let him say whether any proposal to
stop the business of piracy without compensating the pirates would
not have been denounced at first as a proposal to set aside vested
rights?</p>
<p>But I am appealing to other states of society and to times that
are past merely to get my readers, if I can, out of their accustomed
ruts of thought. The proof of what I assert about the Kidds and their
business is in the thought and speech of to-day.</p>
<p>Here is a system which robs the producers of wealth as
remorselessly and far more regularly and systematically than the
pirate robs the merchantman. Here is a system that steadily condemns
thousands to far more lingering and horrible deaths than that of
walking the plank &#8211; to death of the mind and death of the soul, as
well as death of the body. These things are undisputed. No one denies
that Irish pauperism and famine are the direct results of this land
system, and no one who will examine the subject will deny that the
chronic pauperism and chronic famine which everywhere mark our
civilization are the results of this system. Yet we are
told &#8211; nay, it seems to be taken for granted &#8211; that this system
cannot be abolished without buying off those who profit by it. Was
there ever more degrading abasement of the human mind before a
fetish? Can we wonder, as we see it, at any perversion of ideas?</p>
<p>Consider: is not the parallel I have drawn a true one? Is it not
just as much a perversion of ideas to apply the doctrine of vested
rights to property in land, when these are its admitted fruits, as it
was to apply it to property in human flesh and blood; as it would be
to apply it to the business of piracy? In what does the claim of the
Irish landholders differ from that of the hereditary pirate or the
man who has bought out a piratical business? "Because I have
inherited or purchased the business of robbing merchantmen," says the
pirate, "therefore respect for the rights of property must compel you
to let me go on robbing ships and making sailors walk the plank until
you buy me out." "Because we have inherited or purchased the
privilege of appropriating to ourselves the lion's share of the
produce of labor," says the landlord, "therefore you must continue to
let us do it, even though poor wretches shiver with cold and faint
with hunger, even though, in their poverty and misery, they are
reduced to wallow with the pigs." What is the difference?</p>
<p>This is the point I want to make clearly and distinctly, for it
shows a distinction that in current thought is overlooked. Property
in land, like property in slaves, is essentially different from
property in things that are the result of labor. Rob a man or a
people of money, or goods, or cattle, and the robbery is finished
there and then. The lapse of time does not, indeed, change wrong into
right, but it obliterates the effects of the deed. That is done; it
is over; and, unless it be very soon righted, it glides away into the
past, with the men who were parties to it, so swiftly that nothing
save omniscience can trace its effects; and in attempting to right it
we would be in danger of doing fresh wrong. The past is forever
beyond us. We can neither punish nor recompense the dead. But rob a
people of the land on which they must live, and the robbery is
continuous. It is a fresh robbery of every succeeding
generation &#8211; a new robbery every year and every day; it is like
the robbery which condemns to slavery the children of the slave. To
apply to it the statute of limitations, to acknowledge for it the
title of prescription, is not to condone the past; it is to legalize
robbery in the present, to justify it in the future. The indictment
which really lies against the Irish landlords is not that their
ancestors, or the ancestors of their grantors, robbed the ancestors
of the Irish people. That makes no difference. "Let the dead bury
their dead." The indictment that truly lies is that here, now, in the
year 1881, they rob the Irish people. And shall we be told that there
can be a vested right to continue such robbery?</p>
<p><b><a name="The_only_Way_the_easy_Way."></a>Chapter 8: The Only Way, the
    Easy
Way</b></p>
<p>I HAVE dwelt so long upon this question of compensating
landowners, not merely because it is of great practical importance,
but because its discussion brings clearly into view the principles
upon which the land question, in any country, can alone be justly and
finally settled. In the light of these principles we see that
landowners have no rightful claim either to the land or to
compensation for its resumption by the people, and, further than
that, we see that no such rightful claim can ever be created. <b>It
would be wrong to pay the present landowners for "their" land at the
expense of the people; it would likewise be wrong to sell it again to
smaller holders. It would be wrong to abolish the payment of rent,
and to give the land to its present cultivators</b>. In the very
nature of things, land cannot rightfully be made individual property.
This principle is absolute. The title of a peasant proprietor
deserves no more respect than the title of a great territorial noble.
No sovereign political power, no compact or agreement, even though
consented to by the whole population of the globe, can give to an
individual a valid title to the exclusive ownership of a square inch
of soil. The earth is an entailed estate &#8211; entailed upon all the
generations of the children of men, by a deed written in the
constitution of Nature, a deed that no human proceedings can bar, and
no proscription determine. Each succeeding generation has but a
tenancy for life. Admitting that any set of men may barter away their
own natural rights (and this logically involves an admission of the
right of suicide), they can no more barter away the rights of their
successors than they can barter away the rights of the inhabitants of
other worlds.</p>
<p>What should be aimed at in the settlement of the Irish Land
Question is thus very clear. The "three F's" are, what they have
already been called, <b>three frauds</b>; and the proposition to
create peasant proprietorship is no better.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It will not do merely to
carve out of the estates of the landlords minor estates for the
tenants;  </li>
  <li>it will not do merely to substitute a larger for a smaller
class of proprietors;  </li>
  <li>it will not do to confine the settlement to
agricultural land, leaving to its present possessors the land of the
towns and villages.  </li>
</ul>
None of these lame and impotent conclusions will
satisfy the demands of justice or cure the bitter evils now so
apparent. The only true and just solution of the problem, the only
end worth aiming at, is to make all the land the common property of
all the people.
<p>This principle conceded, the question of method arises. How shall
this be done? Nothing is easier. It is merely necessary to divert the
rent which now flows into the pockets of the landlords into the
common treasury of the whole people. It is not possible so to divide
up the land of Ireland as to give each family, still less each
individual, an equal share. And, even if that were possible, it would
not be possible to maintain equality, for old people are constantly
dying and new people constantly being born, while the relative value
of land is constantly changing. But it is possible to divide the rent
equally, or, what amounts to the same thing, to apply it to purposes
of common benefit. This is the way, and this is the only way, in
which absolute justice can be done. This is the way, and this is the
only way, in which the equal right of every man, woman, and child can
be acknowledged and secured. As Herbert Spencer says of it (in Social
Statics):</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Such a doctrine is consistent with the
highest state of
civilization; may be carried out without involving a community of
goods, and need cause no very serious revolution in existing
arrangements. The change required would simply be a change of
landlords. Separate ownership would merge into the joint-stock
ownership of the public. Instead of being in the possession of
individuals, the country would be held by the great corporate
body &#8211; society. Instead of leasing his acres from an isolated
proprietor, the farmer would lease them from the nation. Instead of
paying his rent to the agent of Sir John or his Grace, he would pay
it to an agent or deputy agent of the community. Stewards would be
public officials instead of private ones, and tenancy the only land
tenure. A state of things so ordered would be in perfect harmony with
the moral law. Under it, all men would be equally landlords; all men
would be alike free to become tenants. . . . Clearly, therefore, on
such a system, the earth might be inclosed, occupied, and cultivated,
in entire subordination to the law of equal freedom.</p>
<p>Now, it is a very easy thing thus to sweep away all private
ownership of land, and convert all occupiers into tenants of the
State, by appropriating rent. No complicated laws or cumbersome
machinery is necessary. It is necessary only to tax land up to its
full value. Do that, and without any talk about dispossessing
landlords, without any use of the ugly word "confiscation," without
any infringement of the just rights of property, the land would
become virtually the people's, while the landlords would be left the
absolute and unqualified possessors of &#8211; their deeds of title and
conveyance! They could continue to call themselves landlords, if they
wished to, just as that poor old Bourbon, the Comte de Chambord,
continues to call himself King of France; but, as what, under this
system, was paid by the tenant would be taken by the State, it is
pretty clear that middlemen would not long survive, and that very
soon the occupiers of land would come to be nominally the owners,
though, in reality, they would be the tenants of the whole
people.</p>
<p>How beautifully this simple method would satisfy every economic
requirement; how, freeing labor and capital from the fetters that now
oppress them (for all other taxes could be easily remitted), it would
enormously increase the production of wealth; how it would make
distribution conform to the law of justice, dry up the springs of
want and misery, elevate society from its lowest stratum, and give
all their fair share in the blessings of advancing civilization, can
perhaps be fully shown only by such a detailed examination of the
whole social problem as I have made in a book (<a
 href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>)
which I hope will he read by all the readers of this, since in it I
go over much ground and treat many subjects which cannot be even
touched upon here. Nevertheless, any one can see that to tax land up
to its full rental value would amount to precisely the same thing as
formally to take possession of it, and then let it out to the highest
bidders.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Principle_the_Best_Policy."></a>&nbsp;Chapter
  9: Principle
the Best Policy</p>
<p>WE have now seen the point that should be aimed at, and the method
by which it is to be reached. There is another branch of the subject
which practical men must consider: the political forces that may be
marshaled; the political resistance that must be overcome. It is one
thing to work out such a problem in the closet &#8211; to demonstrate
its proper solution to the satisfaction of a few intelligent readers.
It is another thing to solve it in the field of action, where
ignorance, prejudice, and powerful interests must be met.</p>
<p>It cannot be that the really earnest men in the Irish movement are
satisfied with any program yet put forth. But they are doubtless
influenced by the fear that the avowal of radical views and aims
would not merely intensify present opposition, but frighten away from
their cause large numbers and important influences now with it. To
say nothing of English conservatism, there is in Ireland a large
class now supporting the movement who are morbidly afraid of anything
which savors of "communism" or "socialism," while in the United
States, whence much moral support and pecuniary aid have been
derived, it is certain that many of those who are now loudest in
their expressions of sympathy would slink away from a movement which
avowed the intention of abolishing private property in land. A
resolution expressive of sympathy with the Irish people in their
"struggle for the repeal of oppressive land laws" was, by a unanimous
vote of the National House of Representatives, flung full in the face
of the British lion. How many votes would that resolution have got
had it involved a declaration of hostility to the institution of
individual property in land?</p>
<p>I understand all this. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the Irish
land movement would gain, not lose, were its earnest leaders,
disdaining timid counsels, boldly to avow the principle that the land
of Ireland belongs of right to the whole people of Ireland, and,
without bothering about compensation to the landholders, to propose
its resumption by the people in the simple way I have suggested.
That, in doing this, they would lose strength and increase antagonism
in some directions is true, but they would in other directions gain
strength and allay antagonisms. And, while the loss would constantly
tend to diminish, the gain would constantly tend to increase. They
would, to use the phrase of Emerson, have "hitched their wagon to a
star."</p>
<p>I admit, as will be urged by those who would hold back from such
an avowal as I propose, that political progress must be by short
steps rather than by great leaps; that those who would have the
people follow them readily, and especially those who would enjoy a
present popularity and preferment, must not go too far in advance;
and that to demand a little at first is often the surest way to
obtain much at last.</p>
<p>So far as personal consideration is concerned, it is only to
earnest men capable of feeling the inspiration of a great principle
that I care to talk, or that I can hope to convince. To them I wish
to point out that caution is not wisdom when it involves the ignoring
of a great principle; that it is not every step that involves
progression, but only such steps as are in the right line and make
easier the next; that there are strong forces that wait but the
raising of the true standard to rally on its side.</p>
<p>Let the time-servers, the demagogues, the compromisers, to whom
nothing is right and nothing is wrong, but who are always seeking to
find some half-way house between right and wrong &#8211; let them all go
their ways. Any cause which can lay hold of a great truth is the
stronger without them. If the earnest men among the Irish leaders
abandon their present half-hearted, illogical position, and take
their stand frankly and firmly upon the principle that the youngest
child of the poorest peasant has as good a right to tread the soil
and breathe the air of Ireland as the eldest son of the proudest
duke, they will have put their fight on the right line. Present
defeat will but pave the way for future victory, and each step won
makes easier the next. Their position will be not only logically
defensible, but will prove the stronger the more it is discussed; for
private property in land &#8211; which never arises from the natural
perceptions of men, but springs historically from usurpation and
robbery &#8211; is something so utterly absurd, so outrageously unjust,
so clearly a waste of productive forces and a barrier to the most
profitable use of natural opportunities, so thoroughly opposed to all
sound maxims of public policy, so glaringly in the way of further
progress, that it is only tolerated because the majority of men never
think about it or hear it questioned. Once fairly arraign it, and it
must be condemned; once call upon its advocates to exhibit its
claims, and their cause is lost in advance. There is to-day no
political economist of standing who dare hazard his reputation by
defending it on economic grounds; there is to-day no thinker of
eminence who either does not, like Herbert Spencer, openly declare
the injustice of private property in land, or tacitly make the same
admission.</p>
<p>Once force the discussion on this line, and the Irish reformers
will compel to their side the most active and powerful of the men who
mold thought.</p>
<p>And they will not merely close up their own ranks, now in danger
of being broken; they will "carry the war into Africa," and make
possible the most powerful of political combinations.</p>
<p>It is already beginning to be perceived that the Irish movement,
so far as it has yet gone, is merely in the interest of a class;
that, so far as it has yet voiced any demand, it promises nothing to
the laboring and artisan classes. Its opponents already see this
opportunity for division, which, even without their efforts, must
soon show itself, and which, now that the first impulse of the
movement is over, will the more readily develop. To close up its
ranks, and hold them firm, so that, even though they be forced to
bend, they will not break and scatter, it must cease to be a movement
looking merely to the benefit of the tenant-farmer, and become a
movement for the benefit of the whole laboring-class.</p>
<p>And the moment this is done the Irish land agitation assumes a new
and a grander phase. It ceases to be an Irish movement; it becomes
but the van of a world-wide struggle. Count the loss and the
gain.</p>
<p><b><a name="Appeals_to_Animosity."></a>Chapter 10: Appeals to Animosity</b></p>
<p>THE Land League movement, as an Irish movement, has in its favor
the strength of Irish national feeling. In assuming the radical
ground I urge, it would lose some of this; for there are doubtless a
considerable number of Irishmen on both sides of the Atlantic who
would shrink at first from the proposal to abolish private property
in land. But all that is worth having would soon come back to it. And
its strength would be more compact and intense &#8211; animated by a
more definite purpose and a more profound conviction.</p>
<p>But in ceasing to be a movement having relation simply to
Ireland &#8211; in proclaiming a truth and proposing a remedy which
apply as well to every other country &#8211; it would allay opposition,
which, as a mere local movement, it arouses, and bring to its support
powerful forces.</p>
<p>The powerful landed interest of England is against the movement
anyhow. The natural allies of the Irish agitators are the English
working-classes &#8211; not merely the Irishmen and sons of Irishmen
who, in the larger English cities, are numerous enough to make some
show and exert some voting power, without being numerous enough to
effect any important result &#8211; but the great laboring masses of
Great Britain. So long as merely Irish measures are proposed, they
cannot gain the hearty support even of the English radicals; so long
as race prejudices and hatreds are appealed to, counter-prejudices
and -hatreds must be aroused.</p>
<p>It is the very madness of folly, it is one of those political
blunders worse than crimes, to permit in this land agitation that
indiscriminating denunciation of England and everything English which
is so common at Land League meetings and in the newspapers which
voice Irish sentiment. The men who do this may be giving way to a
natural sentiment; but they are most effectually doing the work of
the real oppressors of Ireland. Were they secret emissaries of the
London police, were they bribed with the gold which the British
oligarchy grinds out of the toil of its white slaves in mill and mine
and field, they could not better be doing its work. "Divide and
conquer" is the golden maxim of the oppressors of mankind. It is by
arousing race antipathies and exciting national animosities, by
appealing to local prejudices and setting people against people, that
aristocracies and despotisms have been founded and maintained. They
who would free men must rise above such feelings if they would be
successful. The greatest enemy of the people's cause is he who
appeals to national passion and excites old hatreds. He is its best
friend who does his utmost to bury them out of sight. For that action
and reaction are equal and uniform is the law of the moral as of the
physical world. Herein lies the far-reaching sweep of those sublime
teachings that, after centuries of nominal acceptance, the so-called
Christian world yet ignores, and which call on us to answer not
revilings with revilings, but to meet hatred with love. "For," as say
the Scriptures of the Buddhists, "hatred never ceases by hatred at
any time; hatred ceases by love; that is an old rule." To
undiscriminately denounce Englishmen is simply to arouse prejudices
and excite animosities &#8211; to separate force that sought to be
united. To make this the fight of the Irish people against the
English people is to doom it to failure. To make it the common cause
of the people everywhere against a system which everywhere oppresses
and robs them is to make its success assured. Had this been made to
appear, the Irish members would not have stood alone when it came to
the final resistance to coercion. Had this been made to appear, Great
Britain would be in a ferment at the proposal to give the government
despotic powers. If the Irish leaders are wise, they may yet avail
themselves of the rising tide of British democracy. Let the Land
Leaguers adopt the noble maxim of the German Social Democrats. Let
them be Land Leaguers first, and Irishmen afterward. Let them account
him an enemy of their cause who seeks to pander to prejudice and
arouse hate. Let them arouse to a higher love than the mere love of
country; to a wider patriotism than that which exhausts itself on one
little sub-division of the human race, one little spot on the great
earth's surface; and in this name, and by this sign, call upon their
brothers, not so much to aid them, as to strike for themselves.</p>
<p>The Irish people have the same inalienable right to govern
themselves as have every other people; but the full recognition of
this right need not necessarily involve separation, and to talk of
separation first is to arouse passions that will be utilized by the
worst enemies of Ireland. The demand for the full political rights of
the Irish people will be the stronger if it be made to line with and
include the demand for the full political rights of the
unenfranchised British people. And it must be remembered that all the
tendencies of the time are not to separation, but to integration; not
to independence, but to interdependence. This is observable wherever
modern influences reach, and in all things. To attempt to resist it
is to attempt to turn back the tide of progress.</p>
<p>It is not with the English people that the Irish people have cause
of quarrel. It is with the system that oppresses both. That is the
thing to denounce; that is the thing to fight. And it is to be fought
most effectually by uniting the masses against it. Monarchy,
aristocracy, landlordism, would get but a new lease of life by the
arousing of sectional passions. The greatest blow that could be
struck against them would be, scrupulously avoiding everything that
could excite antagonistic popular feeling, to carry this land
agitation into Great Britain, not as a mere Irish question, but as a
home question as well. To proclaim the universal truth that land is
of natural right common property; to abandon all timid and half-way
schemes which attempt to compromise between justice and injustice,
and to demand nothing more nor less than a full recognition of this
natural right would be to do this. It would inevitably be to put the
British masses upon inquiry; to put British landholders upon the
defensive, and give them more than enough to do at home. Both England
and Scotland are ripe for such an agitation, and, once fairly begun,
it can have but one result &#8211; the victory of the popular cause.</p>
<p><b><a name="How_to_Win."></a>Chapter 11: How to Win</b></p>
<p>NOR is it merely the laboring-classes of Great Britain who may
thus be brought into the fight, if the true standard be raised. To
demand the nationalization of land by the simple means I have
proposed makes possible &#8211; nay, as the discussion goes on, makes
inevitable &#8211; an irresistible combination, the combination of labor
and capital against landlordism. This combination proved its power by
winning the battle of free trade in 1846 against the most determined
resistance of the landed interest. It would be much more powerful
now, and, if it can again be made on the land question, it can again
force the intrenchments of the landed aristocracy.</p>
<p>This combination cannot be made on any of the timid, illogical
schemes as yet proposed; but it can be made on the broad principle
that land is rightfully common property. Paradoxical as it may seem,
it is yet true that, while the present position of the Irish
agitators does involve a menace to capital, the absolute denial of
the right of private property in land would not.</p>
<p>In admitting that the landlords ought to get any rent at all, in
admitting that, if the land is taken from them, they must be paid for
it, the Irish agitators give away their whole case. For in this they
admit that the land really belongs to the landlords, and put property
in land in the same category with other property. Thus they place
themselves in an indefensible position; thus they give to the
agitation a "communistic" (2) character, and excite against it that
natural and proper feeling which strongly resents any attack upon the
rights of property as an attack upon the very foundations of society.
It was doubtless this mistake of the agitators in admitting the right
of private property in land to which Archbishop McCabe recently
alluded in saying that some of the utterances of the agitators
excited the solicitude of the Holy See. For this mistake gives to the
agitation the character of an attack upon the rights of property. If
the land is really the property of the landlords (and this is
admitted when it is admitted that they are entitled to any rent or to
any compensation), then to limit the rent which they shall get, or to
interfere with their freedom to make what terms they please with
tenants, is an attack upon property rights. If the land is rightfully
the landlords', then is any compulsion as to how they shall let it,
or on what terms they shall part with it, a bad and dangerous
precedent, which naturally alarms capital and excites the solicitude
of those who are concerned for good morals and social order. For, if
a man may be made to part with one species of property by boycotting
or agitation, why not with another? If a man's title to land is as
rightful as his title to his watch, what is the difference between
agitation by Land League meetings and Parliamentary filibustering to
make him give up the one and agitation with a cocked pistol to make
him give up the other?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">(2) I use the word in the usual
sense in which it is used by the
vulgar, and in which a communist is understood as one who wants to
divide up other people's property.</font></small></p>
<p>But, if it be denied that land justly is, or can be, private
property, if the equal rights of the whole people to the use of the
elements gratuitously furnished by Nature be asserted without
drawback or compromise, then the essential difference between
property in land and property in things of human production is at
once brought out. Then will it clearly appear not only that the
denial of the right of individual property in land does not involve
any menace to legitimate property rights, but that the maintenance of
private property in hand necessarily involves a denial of the right
to all other property, and that the recognition of the claims of the
landlords means a continuous robbery of capital as well as of
labor.</p>
<p>All this will appear more and more clearly as the practical
measures necessary to make land common property are proposed and
discussed. These simple measures involve no harsh proceedings, no
forcible dispossession, no shock to public confidence, no
retrogression to a lower industrial organization, no loaning of
public money, or establishment of cumbrous commissions. Instead of
doing violence to the rightful sense of property, they assert and
vindicate it. The way to make land common property is simply to take
rent for the common benefit. And to do this, the easy way is to
abolish one tax after another, until the whole weight of taxation
falls upon the value of land. When that point is reached, the battle
is won. The hare is caught, killed, and skinned, and to cook him will
be a very easy matter. The real fight will come on the proposition to
consolidate existing taxation upon land values. When that is once
won, the landholders will not merely have been decisively defeated,
they will have been routed; and the nature of land values will be so
generally understood that to raise taxation so as to take the whole
rent for common purposes will be a mere matter of course.</p>
<p>The political art is like the military art. It consists in
combining the greatest strength against the point of least
resistance. I have pointed out the way in which, in the case we are
considering, this can be done. And, the more the matter is
considered, the clearer and clearer will it appear that there is
every practical reason, as there is every theoretical reason, why the
Irish reformers should take this vantage-ground of principle. To
propose to put the public burdens upon the landholders is not a novel
and unheard-of thing against which English prejudice would run as
something "newfangled," some new invention of modern socialism. On
the contrary, it is the ancient English practice. It would be but a
return, in a form adapted to modern times, to the system under which
English land was originally parceled out to the predecessors of the
present holders &#8211; the just system, recognized for centuries, that
those who enjoy the common property should bear the common burdens.
The putting of property in land in the same category as property in
things produced by labor is comparatively modern. In England, as in
Ireland and Scotland, as in fact among every people of whom we know
anything, the land was originally treated as common property, and
this recognition ran all through the feudal system. The essence of
the feudal system was in treating the landholder not as an owner, but
as a lessee. William the Conqueror did not give away the land of
England as the Church lands were given away by Henry VIII, when he
divided among his sycophants the property of the people, which, after
the manner of the times, had been set apart for the support of
religious, educational, and charitable institutions. To every grant
of land made by the Conqueror was annexed a condition which amounted
to a heavy perpetual tax or rent. One of his first acts was to divide
the soil of England into sixty thousand knights' fees; and thus,
besides many other dues and obligations, was thrown upon the
landholders the cost of providing and maintaining the army. All the
long, costly wars that England fought during feudal times involved no
public debt. Public debt, pauperism, and the grinding poverty of the
poorer classes came in as the landholders gradually shook off the
obligations on which they had received their land, an operation
culminating in the abolition after the Restoration of the feudal
tenures, for which were substituted indirect taxes that still weigh
upon the whole people. To now reverse this process, to abolish the
taxes which are borne by labor and capital, and to substitute for
them a tax on rent, would be not the adoption of anything new, but a
simple going back to the old plan. In England, as in Ireland, the
movement would appeal to the popular imagination as a demand for the
reassertion of ancient rights.</p>
<p>There are other most important respects in which this measure will
commend itself to the English mind. The tax upon land values or rent
is in all economic respects the most perfect of taxes. No political
economist will deny that it combines the maximum of certainty with
the minimum of loss and cost; that, unlike taxes upon capital or
exchange or improvement, it does not check production or enhance
prices or fall ultimately upon the consumer. And, in proposing to
abolish all other taxes in favor of this theoretically perfect tax,
the Land Reformers will have on their side the advantage of ideas
already current, while they can bring the argumentum ad hominem to
bear on those who might never comprehend an abstract principle.
Englishmen of all classes have happily been educated up to a belief
in free trade, though a very large amount of revenue is still
collected from customs. Let the Land Reformers take advantage of this
by proposing to carry out the doctrine of free trade to its fullest
extent. If a revenue tariff is better than a protective tariff, then
no tariff at all is better than a revenue tariff. Let them propose to
abolish the customs duties entirely, and to abolish as well harbor
dues and lighthouse dues and dock charges, and in their place to add
to the tax on rent, or the value of land exclusive of improvements.
Let them in the same way propose to get rid of the excise, the
various license taxes, the tax upon buildings, the onerous and
unpopular income tax, etc., and to saddle all public expenses on the
landlords.</p>
<p>This would bring home the land question to thousands and thousands
who have never thought of it before; to thousands and thousands who
have heretofore looked upon the land question as something peculiarly
Irish, or something that related exclusively to agriculture and to
farmers, and have never seen how, in various direct and indirect
ways, they have to contribute to the immense sums received by the
landlords as rent. It would be putting the argument in a shape in
which even the most stupid could understand it. It would be directing
the appeal to a spot where even the unimaginative are
sensitive &#8211; the pocket. How long would a merchant or banker or
manufacturer or annuitant regard as dangerous and wicked an agitation
which proposed to take taxation off of him? Even the most prejudiced
can be relied on to listen with patience to an argument in favor of
making some one else pay what they now are paying.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate by a little story what I feel confident would be
the effect of the policy I propose:</p>
<p>Once upon a time I was the Pacific-coast agent of an Eastern news
association, which took advantage of an opposition telegraph company
to run against the Associated Press monopoly. The association in
California consisted of one strong San Francisco paper, to which
telegraphic news was of much importance, and a number of interior
papers, to which it was of minor importance, if of any importance at
all. It became necessary to raise more money for the expenses of
collecting and transmitting these despatches, and, thinking it only
fair, I assessed the increased cost to the strong metropolitan paper.
The proprietor of this paper was very indignant. He appealed to the
proprietors of all the other papers, and they all joined in his
protest. I replied by calling a meeting. At this meeting the
proprietor of the San Francisco paper led off with an indignant
speech. He was seconded by several others, and evidently had the
sympathy of the whole crowd. Then came my turn. I said, in
effect:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you can do what you please about this matter. Whatever
satisfies you satisfies me. The only thing fixed is, that more money
has to be raised. As this San Francisco paper pays now a much lower
relative rate than you do, I thought it only fair that it should pay
the increased cost. But, if you think otherwise, there is no reason
in the world why you should not pay it yourselves." The debate
immediately took another turn, and in a few minutes my action was
indorsed by a unanimous vote, for the San Francisco man was so
disgusted by the way his supporters left him that he would not vote
at all.</p>
<p>Now, that is just about what will happen to the British landlords
if the question be put in the way I propose. The British landowners
are in numbers but an insignificant minority. And, the more they
protested against the injustice of having to pay all the taxes, the
quicker would the public mind realize the essential injustice of
private property in land, the quicker would the majority of the
people come to see that the landowners ought not only to pay all the
taxes, but a good deal more besides. Once put the question in such a
way that the British working-man will realize that he pays two prices
for his ale and half a dozen prices for his tobacco, because a
landowners' Parliament in the time of Charles II shook off their
ancient dues to the State, and imposed them in indirect taxation on
him; once bring to the attention of the well-to-do Englishman, who
grunts as he pays his income tax, the question as to whether the
landowner, who draws his income from property that of natural right
belongs to the whole people, ought not to pay it instead of him, and
it will not be long before the absurd injustice of allowing rent to
be appropriated by individuals will be thoroughly understood. This is
a very different thing from asking the British taxpayer to buy out
the Irish landlord for the sake of the Irish peasant.</p>
<p>I have been speaking as though all landholders would resist the
change which would sacrifice their special interests to the larger
interests of society. But I am satisfied that to think this is to do
landholders a great injustice. For landholders as a class are not
more stupid nor more selfish than any other class. And as they saw,
as they must see, as the discussion progresses, that they also would
be the gainers in the great social change which would abolish poverty
and elevate the very lowest classes &#8211; the "mudsills" of society,
as a Southern Senator expressively called them during the Slavery
discussion &#8211; above the want, the misery, the vice, and degradation
in which they are now plunged, there are many landowners who would
join heartily and unreservedly in the effort to bring this change
about. This I believe, not merely because my reading and observation
both teach me that low, narrow views of self-interest are not the
strongest of human motives, but because I know that today among
those who see the truth I have here tried to set forth, and who would
carry out the reform I have proposed, are many
landholders.<font size="-2"><b><i>(3)</i></b></font> And, if they be
earnest men, I appeal to landholders as confidently as to any other
class. There is that in a great truth that can raise a human soul
above the mists of selfishness.</p>

<p><b><a name="In_the_United_States."></a>Chapter 12: In the United States</b></p>
<p>IN speaking with special reference to the case of Ireland, I have,
so far as general principles are concerned, been using it as a
stalking-horse. In discussing the Irish Land Question, we really
discuss the most vital of American questions. And if we of the United
States cannot see the beam in our own eye, save by looking at the
mote in our brother's, then let us look at the mote; and let us take
counsel together how he may get it out. For, at least, we shall in
this way learn how we may deal with our own case when we wake up to
the consciousness of it.</p>
<p>And never had the parable of the mote and the beam a better
illustration than in the attitude of so many Americans toward this
Irish Land Question. We denounce the Irish land system! We express
our sympathy with Ireland! We tender our advice by Congressional and
legislative resolution to our British brethren across the sea! Truly
our indignation is cheap and our sympathy is cheap, and our advice is
very, very cheap! For what are we doing? Extending over new soil the
very institution that to them descended from a ruder and a darker
time. With what conscience can we lecture them? With all power in the
hands of the people, with institutions yet plastic, with millions of
virgin acres yet to settle, it should he ours to do more than vent
denunciation, and express sympathy, and give advice. It should be
ours to show the way. This we have not done; this we do not do. Out
in our new States may be seen the growth of a system of cultivation
worse in its social effects than that which prevails in Ireland. In
Ireland the laborer has some sort of a home, and enjoys some of the
family affections. In these great "wheat-manufacturing" districts the
laborer is a nomad, his home is in his blankets, which he carries
around with him. The soil bears wheat, crop after crop, till its
fertility is gone. It does not bear children. These machine-worked
"grain factories" of the great Republic of the New World are doing
just what was done by the slave-worked latifundia of the Roman world.
Here they prevent, where there they destroyed, "the crop of men." And
in our large cities may we not see misery of the same kind as exists
in Ireland? If it is less in amount, is it not merely because our
country is yet newer; because we have yet a wide territory and a
sparse population &#8211; conditions past which our progress is rapidly
carrying us? As for evictions, is it an unheard-of thing, even in New
York, for families to be turned out of their homes because they
cannot pay the rent? Are there not many acres in this country from
which those who made homes have been driven by sheriffs' posses, and
even by troops? Do not a number of the Mussell Slough settlers lie in
Santa Clara jail today because a great railroad corporation set its
envious eyes on soil which they had turned from desert into garden,
and they in their madness tried to resist ejectment?</p>
<p>And the men on the other side of the Atlantic who vainly imagine
that they may settle the great question now pressing upon them by
free trade in land, or tenant-right, or some mild device for
establishing a peasant proprietary &#8211; they may learn something
about their own case if they will turn their eyes to us.</p>
<p>We have had free trade in land; we have had in our American
farmer, owning his own acres, using his own capital, and working with
his own hands, something far better than peasant proprietorship. We
have had, what no legislation can give the people of Great Britain,
vast areas of virgin soil. We have had all of these under democratic
institutions. Yet we have here social disease of precisely the same
kind as that which exists in Ireland and England. And the reason is
that we have had here precisely the same cause &#8211; that we have made
land private property. So long as this exists, our democratic
institutions are vain, our pretense of equality but cruel irony, our
public schools can but sow the seeds of discontent. So long as this
exists, material progress can but force the masses of our people into
a harder and more hopeless slavery. Until we in some way make the
land, what Nature intended it to be, common property, until we in
some way secure to every child born among us his natural birthright,
we have not established the Republic in any sense worthy of the name,
and we cannot establish the Republic. Its foundations are
quicksand.</p>
<p><b><a name="A_little_Island_or_a_little_World._"></a>Chapter 13: A Little
    Island
or a Little World</b></p>
<p>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world swimming
in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide
the land, share and share alike, as individual property. At first,
while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and
primitive, this will work well enough.</p>
<p>Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment, let time pass, and
look again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly
multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased, and
even supposing there have been no important inventions or
improvements in the productive arts, the increase in population, by
causing the division of labor, will have made industry more complex.
During this time some of these people will have been careless,
generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some
of them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how
they themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to
inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond
their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many
things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others
again will have devoted all their energies to the extending of their
possessions. What, then, shall we see, land having been all this time
treated as private property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive
equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more
than one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very
many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in all things save this,
our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are
no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency;
imagine, if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is
utterly abolished; yet inequality in the ownership of land will have
produced poverty and virtual slavery.</p>
<p>For the people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to
say, in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can
live only on land and by the aid of the products of land. They may
make machines which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps
to fly in the air, but to build and equip these machines they must
have land and the products of land, and must constantly come back to
land. Therefore those who own the land must be the masters of the
rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land, he is their
absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the land
only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as
his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in
everything as he wills.</p>
<p>If, however, the concentration of landownership has not gone so
far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is
competition between them as well as between those who have only their
labor &#8211; then the terms on which these non-landholders can live
will seem more like free contract. But it will not be free contract.
Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor; labor can
produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary
factors of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts
as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors of
these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have
his stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but
labor cannot exist without land. If I own a piece of land, I can let
it lie idle for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the
laborer must eat every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the
making of terms between them, the landowner has an immense advantage
over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that the intense
pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
urged by hunger. And, further than this: As population increases, as
the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a
larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it
produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation
of future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the
effects of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a
constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less and less or to
give more and more (put it which way you please, it amounts to the
same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity to
work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our
little island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some
of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all
the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others
would be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</p>
<p>But let us introduce another element into the supposition. Let us
suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the
steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the
reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that
are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</p>
<p>Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries and inventions is
to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the
same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen
the necessity for land. Until we can discover some way of making
something out of nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as
to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or
invention which can lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And,
this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving devices, land
being the private property of some, would simply be to increase the
proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for
the use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and
inventions would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more
dependent.</p>
<p>And, since we are imagining conditions, imagine laborsaving
inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to
perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done
away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one
else. For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they
continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of
the landowners!</p>
<p><b><a name="The_Civilization_that_is_Possible."></a>Chapter 14: The Civilization
that is Possible</b></p>
<p>IN the effects upon the distribution of wealth, of making land
private property, we may thus see an explanation of that paradox
presented by modern progress. The perplexing phenomena of deepening
want with increasing wealth, of labor rendered more dependent and
helpless by the very introduction of labor-saving machinery, are the
inevitable result of natural laws as fixed and certain as the law of
gravitation. Private property in land is the primary cause of the
monstrous inequalities which are developing in modern society. It is
this, and not any miscalculation of Nature in bringing into the world
more mouths than she can feed, that gives rise to that tendency of
wages to a minimum &#8211; that "iron law of wages," as the Germans call
it-that, in spite of all advances in productive power, compels the
laboring-classes to the least return on which they will consent to
live. It is this that produces all those phenomena that are so often
attributed to the conflict of labor and capital. It is this that
condemns Irish peasants to rags and hunger, that produces the
pauperism of England and the tramps of America. It is this that makes
the almshouse and the penitentiary the marks of what we call high
civilization; that in the midst of schools and churches degrades and
brutalizes men, crushes the sweetness out of womanhood and the joy
out of childhood. It is this that makes lives that might be a
blessing a pain and a curse, and every year drives more and more to
seek unbidden refuge in the gates of death. For, a permanent tendency
to inequality once set up, all the forces of progress tend to greater
and greater inequality.</p>
<p>All this is contrary to Nature. The poverty and misery, the vice
and degradation, that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth,
are not the results of natural law; they spring from our defiance of
natural law. They are the fruits of our refusal to obey the supreme
law of justice. It is because we rob the child of his birthright;
because we make the bounty which the Creator intended for all the
exclusive property of some, that these things come upon us, and,
though advancing and advancing, we chase but the mirage.</p>
<p>When, lit by lightning-flash or friction amid dry grasses, the
consuming flames of fire first flung their lurid glow into the face
of man, how must he have started back in affright! When he first
stood by the shores of the sea, how must its waves have said to him,
"Thus far shalt thou go, but no farther"! Yet, as he learned to use
them, fire became his most useful servant, the sea his easiest
highway. The most destructive element of which we know &#8211; that
which for ages and ages seemed the very thunderbolt of the angry
gods &#8211; is, as we are now beginning to learn, fraught for us with
untold powers of usefulness. Already it enables us to annihilate
space in our messages, to illuminate the night with new suns; and its
uses are only beginning. And throughout all Nature, as far as we can
see, whatever is potent for evil is potent for good. "Dirt," said
Lord Brougham, "is matter in the wrong place." And so the squalor and
vice and misery that abound in the very heart of our civilization are
but results of the misapplication of forces in their nature most
elevating.</p>
<p>I doubt not that whichever way a man may turn to inquire of
Nature, he will come upon adjustments which will arouse not merely
his wonder, but his gratitude. Yet what has most impressed me with
the feeling that the laws of Nature are the laws of beneficent
intelligence is what I see of the social possibilities involved in
the law of rent. Rent <font size="-2"><b><i>(4)</i></b></font>
springs from natural causes. It arises, as society develops, from the
differences in natural opportunities and the differences in the
distribution of population. It increases with the division of labor,
with the advance of the arts, with the progress of invention. And
thus, by virtue of a law impressed upon the very nature of things,
has the Creator provided that the natural advance of mankind shall be
an advance toward equality, an advance toward cooperation, an advance
toward a social state in which not even the weakest need be crowded
to the wall, in which even for the unfortunate and the cripple there
may be ample provision. For this revenue, which arises from the
common property, which represents not the creation of value by the
individual, but the creation by the community as a whole, which
increases just as society develops, affords a common fund, which,
properly used, tends constantly to equalize conditions, to open the
largest opportunities for all, and utterly to banish want or the fear
of want.</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-2">(4) I, of course, use the word in its
economic, not in its common sense, meaning by it what is commonly
called ground-rent.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The squalid poverty that festers in the heart of our civilization,
the vice and crime and degradation and ravening greed that flow from
it, are the results of a treatment of land that ignores the simple
law of justice, a law so clear and plain that it is universally
recognized by the veriest savages. What is by nature the common
birthright of all, we have made the exclusive property of
individuals; what is by natural law the common fund, from which
common wants should be met, we give to a few that they may lord it
over their fellows. And so some are gorged while some go hungry, and
more is wasted than would suffice to keep all in luxury.</p>
<p>In this nineteenth century, among any people who have begun to
utilize the forces and methods of modern production, there is no
necessity for want. There is no good reason why even the poorest
should not have all the comforts, all the luxuries, all the
opportunities for culture, all the gratifications of refined taste
that only the richest now enjoy. There is no reason why any one
should be compelled to long and monotonous labor. Did invention and
discovery stop to day, the forces of production are ample for this.
What hampers production is the unnatural inequality in distribution.
And, with just distribution, invention and discovery would only have
begun.</p>
<p>Appropriate rent in the way I propose, and speculative rent would
be at once destroyed. The dogs in the manger who are now holding so
much land they have no use for, in order to extract a high price from
those who do want to use it, would be at once choked off, and land
from which labor and capital are now debarred under penalty of a
heavy fine would be thrown open to improvement and use. The incentive
to land monopoly would be gone. Population would spread where it is
now too dense, and become denser where it is now too sparse.</p>
<p>Appropriate rent in this way, and not only would natural
opportunities be thus opened to labor and capital, but all the taxes
which now weigh upon production and rest upon the consumer could be
abolished. The demand for labor would increase, wages would rise,
every wheel of production would be set in motion.</p>
<p>Appropriate rent in this way, and the present expenses of
government would be at once very much reduced &#8211; reduced directly
by the saving in the present cumbrous and expensive schemes of
taxation, reduced indirectly by the diminution in pauperism and in
crime. This simplification in governmental machinery, this elevation
of moral tone which would result, would make it possible for
government to assume the running of railroads, telegraphs, and other
businesses which, being in their nature monopolies, cannot, as
experience is showing, be safely left in the hands of private
individuals and corporations. In short, losing its character as a
repressive agency, government could thus gradually pass into an
administrative agency of the great cooperative
association-society.</p>
<p>For, appropriate rent in this way, and there would be at once a
large surplus over and above what are now considered the legitimate
expenses of government. We could divide this, if we wanted to, among
the whole community, share and share alike. Or we could give every
boy a small capital for a start when he came of age, every girl a
dower, every widow an annuity, every aged person a pension, out of
this common estate. Or we could do with our great common fund many,
many things that would be for the common benefit, many, many things
that would give to the poorest what even the richest cannot now
enjoy. We could establish free libraries, lectures, museums,
art-galleries, observatories, gymnasiums, baths, parks, theaters; we
could line our roads with fruit-trees, and make our cities clean and
wholesome and beautiful; we could conduct experiments, and offer
rewards for inventions, and throw them open to public
use.<font size="-2"><b><i>(5)</i></b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font size="-2">(5) A million dollars spent in premiums
and experiments would, in all probability, make aerial navigation an
accomplished fact.</font></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Think of the enormous wastes that now go on: The waste of false
revenue systems, which hamper production and bar exchange, which fine
a man for erecting a building where none stood before, or for making
two blades of grass grow where there was but one. The waste of
unemployed labor, of idle machinery, of those periodical depressions
of industry almost as destructive as war. The waste entailed by
poverty, and the vice and crime and thriftlessness and drunkenness
that spring from it; the waste entailed by that greed of gain that is
its shadow, and which makes business in large part but a masked war;
the waste entailed by the fret and worry about the mere physical
necessities of existence, to which so many of us are condemned; the
waste entailed by ignorance, by cramped and undeveloped faculties, by
the turning of human beings into mere machines!</p>
<p>Think of these enormous wastes, and of the others which, like
these, are due to the fundamental wrong which produces an unjust
distribution of wealth and distorts the natural development of
society, and you will begin to see what a higher, purer, richer
civilization would be made possible by the simple measure that will
assert natural rights. You will begin to see how, even if no one but
the present landholders were to be considered, this would be the
greatest boon that could be vouchsafed them by society, and that, for
them to fight it, would be as if the dog with a tin kettle tied to
his tail should snap at the hand that offered to free him. Even the
greatest landholder! As for such landholders as our working farmers
and homestead-owners, the slightest discussion would show them that
they had everything to gain by the change. But even such landholders
as the Duke of Westminster and the Astors would be gainers.</p>
<p>For it is of the very nature of injustice that it really profits
no one. When and where was slavery good for slaveholders? Did her
cruelties in America, her expulsions of Moors and Jews, her burnings
of heretics, profit Spain? Has England gained by her injustice toward
Ireland? Did not the curse of an unjust social system rest on Louis
XIV and Louis XV as well as on the poorest peasant whom it condemned
to rags and starvation &#8211; as well as on that Louis whom it sent to
the block? Is the Czar of Russia to be envied?</p>
<p>This we may know certainly, this we may hold to confidently: that
which is unjust can really profit no one; that which is just can
really harm no one. Though all other lights move and circle, this is
the pole-star by which we may safely steer.</p>
<p><b><a name="The_Civilization_that_is."></a>Chapter 15: The Civilization that
    is</b></p>
<p>WHEN we think of the civilization that might be, how poor and
pitiful, how little better than utter barbarism, seems this
civilization of which we boast! Even here, where it has had the
freest field and fullest development! Even here!</p>
<p>This is a broad land and a rich land. How wide it is, how rich it
is, how the fifty millions of us already here are but beginning to
scratch it, a man cannot begin to realize, till he does some
thousands of miles of traveling over it. There are a school and a
church and a newspaper in every hamlet; we have no privileged orders,
no legacies of antiquated institutions, no strong and covertly
hostile neighbors, who in fancy or reality oblige us to keep up great
standing armies. We have had the experience of all other nations to
guide us in selecting what is good and rejecting what is bad. In
politics, in religion, in science, in mechanism, everything shows the
latest improvements. We think we stand, and in fact we do stand, in
the very van of civilization. Food here is cheaper, wages higher,
than anywhere else. There is here a higher average of education, of
intelligence, of material comfort, and of individual opportunity,
than among any other of the great civilized nations. Here modern
civilization is at its very best. Yet even here!</p>
<p>Last winter I was in San Francisco. <b>There are in San Francisco
citizens who can build themselves houses that cost a million and a
half; citizens who can give each of their children two millions of
registered United States bonds for a Christmas present; citizens who
can send their wives to Paris to keep house there, or rather to "keep
palace" in a style that outdoes the lavishness of Russian grand
dukes; citizens whose daughters are golden prizes to the
bluest-blooded of English aristocrats; citizens who can buy seats in
the United States Senate and leave them empty, just to show their
grandeur. </b>There are, also, in San Francisco other citizens. Last
winter I could hardly walk a block without meeting a citizen begging
for ten cents. And, when a charity fund was raised to give work with
pick and shovel to such as would rather work than beg, the
applications were so numerous that, to make the charity fund go as
far as possible, one set of men was discharged after having been
given a few days' work, in order to make room for another set. This
and much else of the same sort I saw in San Francisco last winter.
Likewise in Sacramento, and in other towns.</p>
<p>Last summer, on the plains, I took from its tired mother, and held
in my arms, a little sun-browned baby, the youngest of a family of
the sturdy and keen Western New England stock, who alone in their two
wagons had traveled near three thousand miles looking for some place
to locate and finding none, and who were now returning to where the
father and his biggest boy could go to work on a railroad, what they
had got by the sale of their Nebraska farm all gone. And I walked
awhile by the side of long, lank Southwestern men who, after similar
fruitless journeyings way up into Washington Territory, were going
back to the Choctaw Nation.</p>
<p>This winter I have been in New York. New York is .the greatest and
richest of American cities &#8211; the third city of the modern world,
and moving steadily toward the first place. This is a time of great
prosperity. Never before were so many goods sold, so much business
done. Real estate is advancing with big jumps, and within the last
few months many fortunes have been made in buying and selling vacant
lots. Landlords nearly everywhere are demanding increased rents;
asking in some of the business quarters an increase of three hundred
per cent. Money is so plenty that government four per cents sell for
114, and a bill is passing Congress for refunding the maturing
national debt at three per cent, per annum, a rate that awhile ago in
California was not thought exorbitant per month. All sorts of shares
and bonds have been going up and up. You can sell almost anything if
you give it a high-sounding corporate name and issue well-printed
shares of stock. Seats in the Board of Brokers are worth thirty
thousand dollars, and are cheap at that. There are citizens here who
rake in millions at a single operation with as much ease as a
faro-dealer rakes in a handful of chips.</p>
<p>Nor is this the mere seeming prosperity of feverish speculation.
The country is really prosperous. The crops have been enormous, the
demand insatiable. We have at last a sound currency; gold has been
pouring in. The railroads have been choked with produce, steel rails
are being laid faster than ever before; all sorts of factories are
running full time or overtime. So prosperous is the country, so good
are the times, that, at the Presidential election a few months since,
the determining argument was that we could not afford to take the
chance of disturbing so much material prosperity by a political
change.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, prosperous as are these times, citizens of the
United States beg you on the streets for ten cents and five cents,
and although you know that there are in this city two hundred
charitable societies, although you realize that on general principles
to give money in this way is to do evil rather than good, you are
afraid to refuse them when you read of men in this great city
freezing to death and starving to death. Prosperous as are these
times, women are making overalls for sixty cents a dozen, and you can
hire citizens for trivial sums to parade up and down the streets all
day with advertising placards on their backs. I get on a horse-car
and ride with the driver. He is evidently a sober, steady man, as
intelligent as a man can be who drives a horse-car all the time he is
not asleep or eating his meals. He tells me he has a wife and four
children. He gets home (if a couple of rooms can be called a home) at
two o'clock in the morning; he has to be back on his car at nine.
Sunday he has a couple of hours more, which he has to put in in
sleep, else, as he says, he would utterly break down. His children he
never sees, save when one of them comes at noon or supper-time to the
horse-car route with something for him to eat in a tin pail. He gets
for his day's work one dollar and seventy-five cents &#8211; a sum that
will buy at Dehnonico's a beefsteak and cup of coffee. I say to him
that it must be pretty hard to pay rent and keep six persons on one
dollar and seventy-five cents a day. He says it is; that he has been
trying for a month to get enough ahead to buy a new pair of shoes,
but he hasn't yet succeeded. I ask why he does not leave such a job.
He says, "What can I do? There are a thousand men ready to step into
my place!" And so, in this time of prosperity, he is chained to his
car. The horses that he drives, they are changed six times during his
working-day. They have lots of time to stretch themselves and rest
themselves and eat in peace their plentiful meals, for they are worth
from one to two hundred dollars each, and it would be a loss to the
company for them to fall ill. But this driver, this citizen of the
United States, he may fall ill or drop dead, and the company would
not lose a cent. As between him and the beasts he drives, I am
inclined to think that this most prosperous era is more prosperous
for horses than for men.</p>
<p>Our Napoleon of Wall Street, our rising Charlemagne of railroads,
who came to this city with nothing but a new kind of mouse-trap in a
mahogany box, but who now, though yet in the vigor of his prime,
counts his wealth by hundreds of millions, if it can be counted at
all, is interviewed by a reporter just as he is about to step aboard
his palace-car for a grand combination expedition into the Southwest.
He descants upon the services he is rendering in welding into one big
machine a lot of smaller machines, in uniting into one vast railroad
empire the separated railroad kingdoms. He likewise descants upon the
great prosperity of the whole country. Everybody is prosperous and
contented, he says: there is, of course, a good deal of misery in the
big cities, but, then, there always is!</p>
<p>Yet not alone in the great cities. I ride on the Hudson River
Railroad on a bitter cold day, and from one of the pretty towns with
Dutch names gets in a constable with a prisoner, whom he is to take
to the Albany penitentiary. In this case justice has been swift
enough, for the crime, the taking of a shovel, has been committed
only a few hours before. Such coat as the man has he keeps buttoned
up, even in the hot car, for, the constable says, he has no
underclothes at all. He stole the shovel to get to the penitentiary,
where it is warm. The constable says they have lots of such cases,
and that even in these good times these pretty country towns are
infested with such tramps. With all our vast organizing, our
developing of productive powers and cheapening of transportation, we
are yet creating a class of utter pariahs. And they are to be found
not merely in the great cities, but wherever the locomotive runs.</p>
<p>Is it real advance in civilization which, on the one hand,
produces these great captains of industry, and, on the other, these
social outcasts?</p>
<p>It is the year of grace 1881, and of the Republic the 105th. The
girl who has brought in coal for my fire is twenty years old. She was
born in New York, and can neither read nor write. To me, when I heard
it, this seemed sin and shame, and I got her a spelling-book. She is
trying what she can, but it is uphill work. She has really no time.
Last night when I came in, at eleven, she was not through scrubbing
the halls. She gets four dollars a month. Her shoes cost two dollars
a pair. She says she can sew; but I guess it is about as I can. In
the natural course of things, this girl will be a mother of citizens
of the Republic.</p>
<p>Underneath are girls who can sew; they run sewing-machines with
their feet all day. I have seen girls in Asia carrying water-jugs on
their heads and young women in South America bearing burdens. They
were lithe and strong and symmetrical; but to turn a young woman into
motive power for a sewing-machine is to weaken and injure her
physically. And these girls are to rear, or ought to rear, citizens
of the Republic.</p>
<p>But there is worse and worse than this. Go out into the streets at
night, and you will find them filled with girls who will never be
mothers. To the man who has known the love of mother, of sister, of
sweetheart, wife, and daughter, this is the saddest sight of all.</p>
<p>The ladies of the Brooklyn churches &#8211; they are getting up
petitions for the suppression of Mormon polygamy; they would have it
rooted out with pains and penalties, trampled out, if need be, with
fire and sword; and their reverend Congressman-elect is going, when
he takes his seat, to introduce a most stringent bill to that end;
for that a man should have more wives than one is a burning scandal
in a Christian country. So it is; but there are also other burning
scandals. As for scandals that excite talk, I will spare Brooklyn a
comparison with Salt Lake. But as to ordinary things: I have walked
through the streets of Salt Lake City, by day and by night, without
seeing what in the streets of New York or Brooklyn excites no
comment. Polygamy is unnatural and wrong, no doubt of that, for
Nature brings into the world something over twenty-two boys for every
twenty girls. But is not a state of society unnatural and wrong in
which there are thousands and thousands of girls for whom no husband
ever offers? Can we brag of a state of society in which one citizen
can load his wife with more diamonds than an Indian chief can put
beads on his squaw, while many other citizens are afraid to marry
lest they cannot support a wife &#8211; a state of society in which
prostitution flourishes? Polygamy is bad, but is it not better than
that? Civilization is advancing day by day; never was such progress
as we are making! Yet divorces are increasing and insanity is
increasing. What is the goal of a civilization that tends toward free
love and the madhouse?</p>
<p>This is a most highly civilized community. There is not a bear nor
wolf on Manhattan Island, save in a menagerie. Yet it is easier,
where they are worst, to guard against bears and wolves than it is to
guard against the human beasts of prey that roam this island. In this
highly civilized city every lower window has to be barred, every door
locked and bolted; even door-mats, not worth twenty-five cents, you
will see chained to the steps. Stop for a moment in a crowd and your
watch is gone as if by magic; shirt-studs are taken from their
owners' bosoms, and ear-rings cut from ladies' ears. Even a standing
army of policemen do not prevent highway robbery; there are populous
districts that to walk through after nightfall is a risk, and where
you have far more need to go armed and to be wary than in the
backwoods. There are dens into which men are lured only to be drugged
and robbed, sometimes to be murdered. All the resources of science
and inventive genius are exhausted in making burglar-proof strong
rooms and safes, yet, as the steel plate becomes thicker and harder,
so does the burglar's tool become keener. If the combination lock
cannot be picked, it is blown open. If not a crack large enough for
the introduction of powder is left, then the air-pump is applied and
a vacuum is created. So that those who in the heart of civilization
would guard their treasures safely must come back to the most
barbarous device, and either themselves, or by proxy, sleeplessly
stand guard. What sort of a civilization is this? In what does
civilization essentially consist if not in civility &#8211; that is to
say, in respect for the rights of person and of property?</p>
<p>Yet this is not all, nor the worst. These are but the grosser
forms of that spirit that in the midst of our civilization compels
every one to stand on guard. What is the maxim of business
intercourse among the most highly respectable classes? That if you
are swindled it will be your own fault; that you must treat every man
you have dealings with as though he but wanted the chance to cheat
and rob you. Caveat emptor. "Let the buyer beware." If a man steal a
few dollars he may stand a chance of going to the penitentiary &#8211; I
read the other day of a man who was sent to the penitentiary for
stealing four cents from a horse-car company. But, if he steal a
million by business methods, he is courted and flattered, even though
he steal the poor little savings which washerwomen and sewing-girls
have brought to him in trust, even though he rob widows and orphans
of the security which dead men have struggled and stinted to
provide.</p>
<p>This is a most Christian city. There are churches and churches.
All sorts of churches, where are preached all sorts of religions,
save that which once in Galilee taught the arrant socialistic
doctrine that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God; all save that
which once in Jerusalem drove the money-changers from the temple.
Churches of brown and gray and yellow stone, lifting toward heaven in
such noble symmetry that architecture seems invocation and benison;
where, on stained-glass windows, glow angel and apostle, and the
entering light is dimmed to a soft glory; where such music throbs and
supplicates and bursts in joy as once in St. Sophia ravished the
souls of heathen Northmen; churches where richly cushioned pews let
for the very highest prices, and the auctioneer determines who shall
sit in the foremost seats; churches outside of which on Sunday stand
long lines of carriages, on each carriage a coachman. And there are
white marble churches, so pure and shapely that the stone seems to
have bloomed and flowered &#8211; the concrete expression of a grand,
sweet thought. Churches restful to the very eye, and into which the
weary and heavy-laden can enter and join in the worship of their
Creator for no larger an admission fee than it costs on the Bowery to
see the bearded lady or the Zulu giant eight feet high. And then
there are mission churches, run expressly for poor people, where it
does not cost a cent. There is no lack of churches. There are, in
fact, more churches than there are people who care to attend them.
And there are likewise Sunday-schools, and big religious "book
concerns," and tract societies, and societies for spreading the light
of the gospel among the heathen in foreign parts.</p>
<p>Yet, land a heathen on the Battery with money in his pocket, and
he will be robbed of the last cent of it before he is a day older.
"By their fruits ye shall know them." I wonder whether they who send
missionaries to the heathen ever read the daily papers. I think I
could take a file of these newspapers, and from their daily
chroniclings match anything that could be told in the same period of
any heathen community &#8211; at least, of any heathen community in a
like state of peace and prosperity. I think I could take a file of
these papers, and match, horror for horror, all that returning
missionaries have to tell-even to the car of Juggernaut or infants
tossed from mothers' arms into the sacred river; even to Ashantee
"customs" or cannibalistic feasts.</p>
<p>I do not say that such things are because of civilization, or
because of Christianity. On the contrary, I point to them as
inconsistent with civilization, as incompatible with Christianity.
They show that our civilization is one-sided and cannot last as at
present based; they show that our so-called Christian communities are
not Christian at all. I believe a civilization is possible in which
all could be civilized &#8211; in which such things would be impossible.
But it must be a civilization based on justice and acknowledging the
equal rights of all to natural opportunities. I believe that there is
in true Christianity a power to regenerate the world. But it must be
a Christianity that attacks vested wrongs, not that spurious thing
that defends them. The religion which allies itself with injustice to
preach down the natural aspirations of the masses is worse than
atheism.</p>
<p><b><a name="True_Conservatism."></a>Chapter 16: True Conservatism</b></p>
<p>THERE are those who may look on this little book as very radical,
in the bad sense they attach to the word. They mistake. This is, in
the true sense of the word, a most conservative little book. I do not
appeal to prejudice and passion. I appeal to intelligence. I do not
incite to strife; I seek to prevent strife.</p>
<p>That the civilized world is on the verge of the most tremendous
struggle, which, according to the frankness and sagacity with which
it is met, will be a struggle of ideas or a struggle of actual
physical force, calling upon all the potent agencies of destruction
which modern invention has discovered, every sign of the times
portends. The voices that proclaim the eve of revolution are in the
air. Steam and electricity are not merely transporting goods and
carrying messages. They are everywhere changing social and industrial
organization; they are everywhere stimulating thought, and arousing
new hopes and fears and desires and passions; they are everywhere
breaking down the barriers that have separated men, and integrating
nations into one vast organism, through which the same pulses throb
and the same nerves tingle.</p>
<p>The present situation in Great Britain is full of dangers, of
dangers graver and nearer than those who there are making history are
likely to see. Who in France, a century ago, foresaw the drama of
blood so soon to open? Who in the United States dreamed of what was
coming till the cannon-shot rang and the flag fell on Sumter? How
confidently we said, "The American people are too intelligent, too
practical, to go to cutting each other's throats"! How confidently we
relied upon the strong common sense of the great masses, upon the
great business interests, upon the universal desire to make money!
"War does not pay," we said, "therefore war is impossible." A shot
rang over Charleston harbor; a bit of bunting dropped, and, riven
into two hostile camps, a nation sprang to its feet to close in the
death-lock.</p>
<p>And to just such a point are events hurrying in Great Britain
today. History repeats itself, and what happened a century ago on
one side of the English Channel is beginning again on the other.
Already has the States-General met, and the Third Estate put on their
hats. Already Necker is in despair. Already has the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">lit de justice
</span>been held, and the Tennis-Court been locked, and ball-cartridge
been
served to the Swiss Guard! For the moment the forces of reaction
triumph. Davitt is snatched to prison; a "Liberal" government carries
coercion by a tremendous majority, and the most despotic powers are
invoked to make possible the eviction of Irish peasants. The order of
Warsaw is to reign in Ireland, and the upholders of ancient wrong
deem it secure again, as the wave that was mounting seems sweeping
back. Let them wait a little and they will see. For again the wave
will mount, and higher and higher, and soon the white foam will
seethe and hiss on its toppling crest. It is not true conservatism
which cries "Peace! peace!" when there is no peace; which, like the
ostrich, sticks its head in the sand and fancies itself secure; which
would compromise matters by putting more coal in the furnace, and
hanging heavier weights on the safety-valve! That alone is true
conservatism which would look facts in the face, which would
reconcile opposing forces on the only basis on which reconciliation
is possible &#8211; that of justice.</p>
<p>I speak again of Great Britain, but I speak with reference to the
whole modern world. The true nature of the inevitable conflict with
which modern civilization is everywhere beginning to throb, can, it
seems to me, best be seen in the United States, and in the newer
States even more clearly than in the older States. That intelligent
Englishmen imagine that in the democratization of political
institutions, in free trade in land, or in peasant proprietorship,
can be found any solution of the difficulties which are confronting
them, is because they do not see what may be seen in the United
States by whoever will look. That intelligent Americans imagine that
by these questions which are so menacingly presenting themselves in
Europe their peace is to be unvexed, is because they shut their eyes
to what is going on around them, because they attribute to themselves
and their institutions what is really due to conditions now rapidly
passing away &#8211; to the sparseness of population and the cheapness
of land. Yet it is here, in this American Republic, that the true
nature of that inevitable conflict now rapidly approaching which must
determine the fate of modern civilization may be most clearly
seen.</p>
<p>We have here abolished all hereditary privileges and legal
distinctions of class. Monarchy, aristocracy, prelacy, we have swept
them all away. We have carried mere political democracy to its
ultimate. Every child born in the United States may aspire to be
President. Every man, even though he be a tramp or a pauper, has a
vote, and one man's vote counts for as much as any other man's vote.
Before the law all citizens are absolutely equal. In the name of the
people all laws run. They are the source of all power, the fountain
of all honor. In their name and by their will all government is
carried on; the highest officials are but their servants.
Primogeniture and entail we have abolished wherever they existed. We
have and have had free trade in land. We started with something
infinitely better than any scheme of peasant proprietorship which it
is possible to carry into effect in Great Britain. We have had for
our public domain the best part of an immense continent. We have had
the preemption law and the homestead law. It has been our boast that
here every one who wished it could have a farm. We have had full
liberty of speech and of the press. We have not merely common
schools, but high schools and universities, open to all who may
choose to attend. Yet here the same social difficulties apparent on
the other side of the Atlantic are beginning to appear. It is already
clear that our democracy is a vain pretense, our make-believe of
equality a sham and a fraud.</p>
<p>Already are the sovereign people becoming but a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">roi
fain&eacute;ant</span>, like the Merovingian kings of France, like the
Mikados of Japan. The shadow of power is theirs; but the substance of
power is being grasped and wielded by the bandit chiefs of the stock
exchange, the robber leaders who organize politics into machines. In
any matter in which they are interested, the little finger of the
great corporations is thicker than the loins of the people. Is it
sovereign States or is it railroad corporations that are really
represented in the elective Senate which we have substituted for an
hereditary House of Lords? Where is the count or marquis or duke in
Europe who wields such power as is wielded by such simple citizens as
our Stanfords, Goulds, and Vanderbilts? What does legal equality
amount to, when the fortunes of some citizens can be estimated only
in hundreds of millions, and other citizens have nothing? What does
the suffrage amount to when, under threat of discharge from
employment, citizens can be forced to vote as their employers
dictate? when votes can be bought on election day for a few dollars
apiece? If there are citizens so dependent that they must vote as
their employers wish, so poor that a few dollars on election day seem
to them more than any higher consideration, then giving them votes
simply adds to the political power of wealth, and universal suffrage
becomes the surest basis for the establishment of tyranny. "Tyranny!"
There is a lesson in the very word. What are our American bosses but
the exact antitypes of the Greek tyrants, from whom the word comes?
They who gave the word tyrant its meaning did not claim to rule by
right divine. They were simply the Grand Sachems of Greek Tammanys,
the organizers of Hellenic "stalwart machines."</p>
<p>Even if universal history did not teach the lesson, it is in the
United States already becoming very evident that political equality
can continue to exist only upon a basis of social equality; that
where the disparity in the distribution of wealth increases,
political democracy only makes easier the concentration of power, and
must inevitably lead to tyranny and anarchy. And it is already
evident that there is nothing in political democracy, nothing in
popular education, nothing in any of our American institutions, to
prevent the most enormous disparity in the distribution of wealth.
Nowhere in the world are such great fortunes growing up as in the
United States. Considering that the average income of the working
masses of our people is only a few hundred dollars a year, a fortune
of a million dollars is a monstrous thing &#8211; a more monstrous and
dangerous thing under a democratic government than anywhere else. Yet
fortunes of ten and twelve million dollars are with us ceasing to be
noticeable. We already have citizens whose wealth can be estimated
only in hundreds of millions, and before the end of the century, if
present tendencies continue, we are likely to have fortunes estimated
in thousands of millions &#8211; such monstrous fortunes as the world
has never seen since the growth of similar fortunes ate out the heart
of Rome. And the necessary correlative of the growth of such fortunes
is the impoverishment and loss of independence on the part of the
masses. These great aggregations of wealth are like great trees,
which strike deep roots and spread wide branches, and which, by
sucking up the moisture from the soil and intercepting the sunshine,
stunt and kill the vegetation around them. When a capital of a
million dollars comes into competition with capitals of thousands of
dollars, the smaller capitalists must be driven out of the business
or destroyed. With great capital nothing can compete save great
capital. Hence, every aggregation of wealth increases the tendency to
the aggregation of wealth, and decreases the possibility of the
employee ever becoming more than an employee, compelling him to
compete with his fellows as to who will work cheapest for the great
capitalist &#8211; a competition that can have but one result, that of
forcing wages to the minimum at which the supply of labor can be kept
up. Where we are is not so important as in what direction we are
going, and in the United States all tendencies are clearly in this
direction. A while ago, and any journeyman shoemaker could set up in
business for himself with the savings of a few months. But now the
operative shoemaker could not in a lifetime save enough from his
wages to go into business for himself. And, now that great capital
has entered agriculture, it must be with the same results. The large
farmer, who can buy the latest machinery at the lowest cash prices
and use it to the best advantage, who can run a straight furrow for
miles, who can make special rates with railroad companies, take
advantage of the market, and sell in large lots for the least
commission, must drive out the small farmer of the early American
type just as the shoe factory has driven out the journeyman
shoemaker. And this is going on today.</p>
<p>There is nothing unnatural in this. On the contrary, it is in the
highest degree natural. Social development is in accordance with
certain immutable laws. And the law of development, whether it be the
development of a solar system, of the tiniest organism, or of a human
society, is the law of integration. It is in obedience to this
law &#8211; a law evidently as all &#8211; compelling as the law of
gravitation &#8211; that these new agencies, which so powerfully
stimulate social growth, tend to the specialization and
interdependence of industry. It is in obedience to this law that the
factory is superseding the independent mechanic, the large farm is
swallowing up the little one, the big store shutting up the small
one, that corporations are arising that dwarf the State, and that
population tends more and more to concentrate in cities. Men must
work together in larger and in more closely related groups.
Production must be on a greater scale. The only question is, whether
the relation in which men are thus drawn together and compelled to
act together shall be the natural relation of interdependence in
equality, or the unnatural relation of dependence upon a master.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If
the one, then may civilization advance in what is evidently the
natural order, each step leading to a higher step.  </li>
  <li>If the other, then
what Nature has intended as a blessing becomes a curse, and a
condition of inequality is produced which will inevitably destroy
civilization. Every new invention but hastens the catastrophe.</li>
</ul>
Now, all this we may deduce from natural laws as fixed and certain
as the law of gravitation. And all this we may see going on to-day.
This is the reason why modern progress, great as it has been, fails
to relieve poverty; this is the secret of the increasing discontent
which pervades every civilized country. Under present conditions,
with land treated as private property, material progress is
developing two diverse tendencies, two opposing currents. 
<ul>
  <li>On the one
side, the tendency of increasing population and of all improvement in
the arts of production is to build up enormous fortunes, to wipe out
the intermediate classes, and to crowd down the masses to a level of
lower wages and greater dependence.  </li>
  <li>On the other hand, by bringing
men closer together, by stimulating thought, by creating new wants,
by arousing new ambitions, the tendency of modern progress is to make
the masses discontented with their condition, to feel bitterly its
injustice. The result can be predicted just as certainly as the
result can be predicted when two trains are rushing toward each other
on the same track.</li>
</ul>
<b>This thing is absolutely certain: Private property in land
blocks the way of advancing civilization.</b> The two cannot long
coexist. Either private property in land must be abolished, or, as
has happened again and again in the history of mankind, civilization
must again turn back in anarchy and bloodshed. Let the remaining
years of the nineteenth century bear me witness. Even now, I believe,
the inevitable struggle has begun. It is not conservatism which would
ignore such a tremendous fact. It is the blindness that invites
destruction. He that is truly conservative let him look the facts in
the face; let him speak frankly and dispassionately. This is the duty
of the hour. For, when a great social question presses for
settlement, it is only for a little while that the voice of Reason
can be heard. The masses of men hardly think at any time. It is
difficult even in sober moments to get them to reason calmly. But
when passion is roused, then they are like a herd of stampeded bulls.
I do not fear that present social adjustments can continue. That is
impossible. What I fear is that the dams may hold till the flood
rises to fury. What I fear is that dogged resistance on the one side
may kindle a passionate sense of wrong on the other. What I fear are
the demagogues and the accidents.
<p>The present condition of all civilized countries is that of
increasing unstable equilibrium. In steam and electricity, and all
the countless inventions which they typify, mighty forces have
entered the world. If rightly used, they are our servants, more
potent to do our bidding than the genii of Arabian story. If wrongly
used, they, too, must turn to monsters of destruction. They require
and will compel great social changes. That we may already see.
Operating under social institutions which are based on natural
justice, which acknowledge the equal rights of all to the material
and opportunities of nature, their elevating power will be equally
exerted, and industrial organization will pass naturally into that of
a vast cooperative society. Operating under social institutions which
deny natural justice by treating land as private property, their
power is unequally exerted, and tends, by producing inequality, to
engender forces that will tear and rend and shatter. The old bottles
cannot hold the new wine. This is the ferment which throughout the
civilized world is everywhere beginning.</p>
<p><b><i><a name="In_Hoc_Signo_Vinces."></a></i>Chapter 17:<i><em> </em>In Hoc
      Signo Vinces</i></b></p>
<p>LET me recapitulate.</p>
<p>What I want to impress upon those who may read this book is
this:</p>
<p>The land question is nowhere a mere local question; it is a
universal question. It involves the great problem of the distribution
of wealth, which is everywhere forcing itself upon attention.</p>
<p>It cannot be settled by measures which in their nature can have
but local application. It can be settled only by measures which in
their nature will apply everywhere.</p>
<p>It cannot be settled by half-way measures. It can be settled only
by the acknowledgment of equal rights to land. Upon this basis it can
be settled easily and permanently.</p>
<p>If the Irish reformers take this ground, they will make their
fight the common fight of all the peoples; they will concentrate
strength and divide opposition. They will turn the flank of the
system that oppresses them, and awake the struggle in its very
intrenchments. They will rouse against it a force that is like the
force of rising tides.</p>
<p>What I urge the men of Ireland to do is to proclaim, without
limitation or evasion, that the land, of natural right, is the common
property of the whole people, and to propose practical measures which
will recognize this right in all countries as well as in Ireland.</p>
<p>What I urge the Land Leagues of the United States to do is to
announce this great principle as of universal application; to give
their movement a reference to America as well as to Ireland; to
broaden and deepen and strengthen it by making it a movement for the
regeneration of the world &#8211; a movement which shall concentrate and
give shape to aspirations that are stirring among all nations.</p>
<p>Ask not for Ireland mere charity or sympathy. Let her call be the
call of fraternity: "For yourselves, O brothers, as well as for us!"
Let her rallying cry awake all who slumber, and rouse to a common
struggle all who are oppressed. Let it breathe not old hates; let it
ring and echo with the new hope!</p>
<p>In many lands her sons are true to her; under many skies her
daughters burn with the love of her. Lo! the ages bring their
opportunity. Let those who would honor her bear her banner to the
front!</p>
<p>The harp and the shamrock, the golden sunburst on the field of
living green! emblems of a country without nationality; standard of a
people downtrodden and oppressed! The hour has come when they may
lead the van of the great world-struggle. Types of harmony and of
ever-springing hope, of light and of life! The hour has come when
they may stand for something higher than local patriotism; something
grander than national independence. The hour has come when they may
stand forth to speak the world's hope, to lead the world's
advance!</p>
<p>Torn away by pirates, tending in a strange land a heathen master's
swine, the slave boy, with the spirit of Christ in his heart, praying
in the snow for those who had enslaved him, and returning to bring to
his oppressors the message of the gospel, returning with good to give
where evil had been received, to kindle in the darkness a great
light &#8211; this is Ireland's patron saint. In his spirit let
Ireland's struggle be. Not merely through Irish vales and hamlets,
but into England, into Scotland, into Wales, wherever our common
tongue is spoken, let the torch be carried and the word be preached.
And beyond! The brotherhood of man stops not with differences of
speech any more than with seas or mountain-chains. A century ago it
was ours to speak the ringing word. Then it was France's. Now it may
be Ireland's, if her sons be true.</p>
<p>But wherever, or by whom, the word must be spoken, the standard
will be raised. No matter what the Irish leaders do or do not do, it
is too late to settle permanently the question on any basis short of
the recognition of equal natural right. And, whether the Land Leagues
move forward or slink back, the agitation must spread to this side of
the Atlantic. The Republic, the true Republic, is not yet here. But
her birth-struggle must soon begin. Already, with the hope of her,
men's thoughts are stirring.</p>
<p>Not a republic of landlords and peasants; not a republic of
millionaires and tramps; not a republic in which some are masters and
some serve. But a republic of equal citizens, where competition
becomes cooperation, and the interdependence of all gives true
independence to each; where moral progress goes hand in hand with
intellectual progress, and material progress elevates and
enfranchises even the poorest and weakest and lowliest.</p>
<p>And the gospel of deliverance, let us not forget it: it is the
gospel of love, not of hate. He whom it emancipates will know neither
Jew nor Gentile, nor Irishman nor Englishman, nor German nor
Frenchman, nor European nor American, nor difference of color or of
race, nor animosities of class or condition. Let us set our feet on
old prejudices, let us bury the old hates. There have been "Holy
Alliances" of kings. Let us strive for the Holy Alliance of the
people.</p>
<p><b><i>Liberty, equality, fraternity!</i></b> Write them on the
banners. Let them be for sign and countersign. Without equality,
liberty cannot be; without fraternity, neither equality nor liberty
can be achieved.</p>
<p>Liberty &#8211; the full freedom of each bounded only by the equal
freedom of every other!</p>
<p>Equality &#8211; the equal right of each to the use and enjoyment of
all natural opportunities, to all the essentials of happy, healthful,
human life!</p>
<p>Fraternity &#8211; that sympathy which links together those who
struggle in a noble cause; that would live and let live; that would
help as well as be helped; that, in seeking the good of all, finds
the highest good of each!</p>
<p><b>"By this sign shall ye conquer!"</b></p>
<p><em>"We hold these truths to be self-evident &#8211; that all men are
created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness!"</em></p>
<p>It is over a century since these words rang out. It is time to
give them their full, true meaning. Let the standard be lifted that
all may see it; let the advance be sounded that all may hear it. Let
those who would fall back, fall back. Let those who would oppose,
oppose. Everywhere are those who will rally. The stars in their
courses fight against Sisera!</p>
