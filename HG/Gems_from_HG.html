  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fred Harrison's FOREWORD <font size="-1">(1980)</font><br>
    </span>&nbsp;<br>
    THIS book contains the distilled wisdom of Henry George. The selection
    of extracts from George's books was compiled and arranged by the Rev.
    Arthur Compton Auchmuty, who until his death in 1917 was one of a
    small group of British country clergymen preaching the cause of radical
    land reform. <br>
    <br>
    Why, a century after George's main writings were published &#8212; and,
    to
    judge by the wide sales, popularly received &#8212; should we still be
    interested in them? Why, when the popularity acquired by many
    philosophers is eclipsed by new fashions, are the works of this writer
    still
    published and carefully scrutinized?* The short answer is that the
    philosophy Henry George sought to promote is close to the hearts of
    most people: a philosophy which has at its heart the ideas of freedom,
    justice and truth.  </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
<font size="-1">*The American Economic Association, the professional and scientific
organization of North American economists, devoted a session of its
annual meeting at Atlanta, Georgia, on Dec. 30, 1979, to celebrate the
centenary of the publication of <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, Henry George's
most influential book. </font></small></div>
<p>  These concepts, of course, are used to defend a wide range of
  ideologies, and the passages in this book will introduce the reader to
  the merits of Henry George's philosophy and his practical proposals for
  social and economic change. <br>
  <br>
  Henry George did not enjoy a formal education above the rudimentary
  level. But he acquired multi-disciplinary skills, which he deployed
  ruthlessly to expose the deficiencies of industrial society. The single
  crucial structural defect, he discovered, was the monopolization of
  nature by a minority of citizens. He argued that social conflicts and
  economic instability were nurtured by this crippling defect that was
  present in a system which was technically capable of providing <span style="font-style: italic;">everybody </span>with
  a rising standard of living.<br>
  <br>
  Combining the skills of the economist, the politician and the
  journalist he documented the problems and defined the elements
  necessary for a program of corrective reforms.&nbsp; No area of
  knowledge was neglected.&nbsp; Using history and anthropology, he
  compared the lot of working men in modern society with the generally
happier condition of people in pre-industrial societies.</p>
<ul>
  <li>    The "primitive" Amerindian and the European peasant, he noted, worked
    shorter hours, were physically stronger and were of a happier demeanor:
  <em>  <strong>why?</strong></em></li>
  <li>    Men were not genetically predisposed to crime, yet many of them were deviant
  and pursued anti-social behavior: <em><strong>why?</strong></em></li>
  <li>    Men were rational beings, yet the majority were persuaded to adopt
        opinions and institutions contrary to their individual and collective
  interests: <em><strong>why?</strong></em></li>
  <li>    While a few men acquired riches without themselves adding one iota to
          the wealth of nations, a growing number were condemned to eke out a
  bare subsistence in the meanest of conditions: <em><strong>why?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>  His answers were based largely on theoretical reasoning.&nbsp; The vast
  accumulation of empirical knowledge on which today's social scientists
  can draw was not available to Henry George, yet he singlemindedly
  explored those contradictions which did not disturb most of the
  complacent thinkers of his time.&nbsp; Thus, his perceptions are rich
  with analogies, sharpened by satire and meticulously recorded by paying
  due respect to the meaning of words (a method of advancing knowledge
  which is today associated with the Oxford school of linguistic
  philosophy).<br>
  <br>
  For the student, the books of Henry George provide a wide range of hypotheses
  with which to grapple. Few of these insights into the working of
  society and its economy would fail to stand up to empirical testing.
  But this is not to say that his views are uncontroversial: one mark of
  a successful commentator and reformer is that he is able to challenge
  conventional wisdom. An example, which illuminates the contemporary
relevance of George's writings, concerns the population question. </p>
<p>  Henry George adopted an optimistic and anti-Malthusian position. If he
    were alive today he would seriously question the orthodox view that a
    principal way to cure poverty in the Third World was to increase the
    distribution of intrauterine devices and the pill. In his view, people
    were hungry not for procreative reasons (he saw each pair of hands as
    an exciting opportunity, not something to be feared for the burden
    allegedly placed on the carrying capacity of earth). The real problem,
    he argued, was that people were actively prevented from gaining access
    to the natural resources with which to provide themselves with their
    daily bread. Today, he would contend that, if we paid greater attention
    to appropriate land reforms, the characteristics which are identified
    as part of a demographic problem, such as malnutrition, would be
    solved. <br>
  <br>
  History is on George's side. Apart from those periods of famine caused
    by drought, men in the past were able to order their cultural patterns
    to conform neatly with their ecological environment. Today, however,
    with all the developments of technology and science, poverty and hunger
    not only remain, but are frequently aggravated by these very developments. <br>
  <br>
  The problems of contemporary society are multiplying in number and
    magnifying in scale to an extent which seems almost incomprehensible to
    the human mind. Yet solutions have to be found if we are to avoid
    ecological chaos and survive territorial conflicts. That is why the
    critique offered by Henry George is crucial. The power of his logic and
    his prose penetrate our complacency, compel us to confront
uncomfortable facts. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
If we want to be free, we cannot justify sectional privileges which
circumscribe the rights of others. </li>
  <li>
If we want the economy to function smoothly, we cannot expect barriers
to be put up in order to protect our limited interests. </li>
  <li>
If we want society to live in harmony with the ecological environment,
we cannot claim the right to abuse nature for our private, short-term
interests. </li>
</ul>

<div align="left">
  <p>But how do we re-synthesize culture to produce the results which we
    all, in our rare moments of altruism, concede as desirable? How do we
    protect natural rights, such as individual liberty and free speech,
    while establishing a well-functioning political order? How do we
    achieve a distribution of income which reflects both equal opportunity
    and the individual contributions of men and women of varying talents
    and industry? <br>
    <br>
    This volume provokes these questions. The book's primary purpose is to
    encourage readers to turn to the full texts. There, they will find the
    answers with which we must, sooner or later, come to terms if we are to
    begin the process of reconstructing society into a state which might be
  accorded the status of "civilization." </p>

COULD a man of a century ago* &#8212;  a Franklin or a Priestley &#8212; have
seen,
in a
vision of the future, the steamship taking the place of the sailing
vessel, the railroad train of the wagon, the reaping machine of the
scythe, the threshing machine of the flail; could he have heard the
throb of the engines that in obedience to human will, and for the
satisfaction of human desire, exert a power greater than that of all
the men and all the beasts of burden of the earth combined; could he
have seen the forest tree transformed into finished lumber into doors,
sashes, blinds, boxes or barrels, with hardly the touch of a human
hand; the great workshops where boots and shoes are turned out by the
case with less labor than the old-fashioned cobbler could have put on
a sole; the factories where, under the eye of a girl, cotton becomes
cloth faster than hundreds of stalwart weavers could have turned it out
with their hand-looms; could he have seen steam hammers shaping mammoth
shafts and mighty anchors, and delicate machinery making tiny watches;
the diamond drill cutting through the heart of the rocks, and coal oil
sparing the whale; could he have realized the enormous saving of labor
resulting from improved facilities of exchange and communication &#8212; 
sheep killed in Australia eaten fresh in England, and the order given
by the London banker in the afternoon executed in San Francisco in the
morning of the same day; could he have conceived of the hundred
thousand improvements which these only suggest, what would he have
inferred as to the social condition of mankind? <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>* Written in 1877. </small></div>

<br>
It would not have seemed like an inference; further than the vision
went, it would have seemed as though he saw, and his heart would have leaped
and his nerves would have thrilled, as one who from a height beholds just ahead
of the
thirst-stricken caravan the living gleam of rustling woods and the
glint of laughing waters. Plainly, in the sight of the imagination,
he would have beheld these new forces elevating society from its very
foundations, lifting the very poorest above the possibility of want,
exempting the very lowest from anxiety for the material needs of life;
he would have seen these slaves of the lamp of knowledge taking on
themselves the traditional curse, these muscles of iron and sinews of
steel making the poorest laborer's life a holiday, in which every high
quality and noble impulse could have scope to grow. And out of these
bounteous material conditions he would have seen arising, as necessary
sequences, moral conditions realizing the golden age of which mankind
have always dreamed. Youth no longer stunted and starved; age no longer
harried by avarice; the child at play with the tiger; the man with the
muck-rake drinking in the glory of the stars! Foul things fled, fierce
things tame; discord turned to harmony! For how could there be greed
where all had enough? How could the vice, the crime, the ignorance, the
brutality, <em>that spring from poverty and the fear of poverty, exist
where poverty had vanished? Who should crouch where all were freemen,
who oppress where all were peers? &#8212; <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/ppintro.html">Progress
&amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/ppintro.html"> &#8212; Introductory:
The Problem</a><br>
<br>
THIS fact &#8212; the great fact that poverty and all its concomitants show
themselves in communities just as they develop into the conditions
toward which material progress tends &#8212; proves that the social
difficulties existing wherever a certain stage of progress has been
reached, do not arise from local circumstances, but are, in some way or
another, engendered by progress itself. <br>
<br>
And, unpleasant as it may be to admit it, it is at last becoming
evident that the enormous increase in productive power which has
marked the present century<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small>, and is still going on with accelerating ratio, has no tendency to
extirpate poverty or to lighten the burdens of those compelled to toil.
It simply widens the gulf between Dives and Lazarus, and makes the
struggle for existence more intense. The march of invention has clothed
mankind with powers of which a century ago the boldest imagination
could not have dreamed. But in factories where labor-saving machinery
has reached its most wonderful development, little children, are at
work; wherever the new forces are anything like fully utilized, large
classes are maintained by charity or live on the verge of recourse to
it; amid the greatest accumulations of wealth, men die of starvation,
and puny infants suckle dry breasts; while everywhere the greed of
gain, the worship of wealth, shows the force of the fear of want. The
promised land lies before us like the mirage. The fruits of the tree of
knowledge turn as we grasp them to apples of Sodom that crumble at the
touch. <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">1. Written in 1877. </font></small></div>
<p>It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the average
  of comfort, leisure, and refinement has. been raised; but these gains
  are not general. In them the lowest class do not share. I do not mean
  that the condition of the lowest class has nowhere nor in anything
  been improved; but that there is nowhere any improvement which can be
  credited to increased productive power. I mean that the tendency of
  what we call material progress is in nowise to improve the condition of
  the lowest class in the essentials of healthy, happy human life. Nay,
  more, that it is to still further depress the condition of the lowest
  class. The new forces, elevating in their nature though they be, do not
  act upon the social fabric from underneath, as was for a long time
  hoped and believed, but strike it at a point intermediate between top
  and bottom. It is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not
  underneath society, but through society. Those who are above the point
  of separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed  down. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/ppintro.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/ppintro.html"> &#8212; Introductory:
  The Problem</a><br>
  <br>
  THREE thousand years of advance, and still the moan goes up, "They have
  made our lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in brick, and in
  all manner of service!" Three thousand years of advance! and the
  piteous voices of little children are in the moan. We progress and we
  progress; we girdle continents with iron roads and knit cities together
  with the mesh of telegraph wires; each day brings some new invention;
  each year marks a fresh advance &#8212;  the power of production increased,
  and
  the avenues of exchange cleared and broadened. Yet the complaint of
"hard times" is louder and louder; everywhere are men harassed by care,
  and haunted by the fear of want. With swift, steady strides and
  prodigious leaps, the power of human hands to satisfy human wants
  advances and advances, is multiplied and multiplied. Yet the struggle
  for mere existence is more and more intense, and human labor is
  becoming the cheapest of commodities. Beside glutted warehouses human
  beings grow faint with hunger and shiver with cold; under the shadow of
  churches festers the vice that is born of wants. &#8212; Speech: <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a> <br>
  <br>
  IF it were possible to express in figures the direct pecuniary loss
  which society suffers from the social mal-adjustments which condemn
  large classes to poverty and vice, the estimate would be appalling.
  England maintains over a million paupers on official charity; the city
  of New York alone spends over seven million dollars a year in a similar
  way. But what is spent from public funds, what is spent by charitable
  societies, and what is spent in individual charity, would, if
  aggregated, be but the first and smallest item in the account. The
  potential earnings of the labor thus going to waste, the cost of the
  reckless, improvident and idle habits thus generated, the pecuniary
  loss (to consider nothing more) suggested by the appalling statistics
  of mortality, and especially infant mortality, among the poorer
  classes; the waste indicated by the gin palaces or low groggeries which
  increase as poverty deepens; the damage done by the vermin of society
  that are bred of poverty and destitution &#8212; the thieves,
  prostitutes, beggars, and tramps; the cost of guarding society against
  them, are all items in the sum which the present unjust and unequal
  distribution of wealth takes from the aggregate which, with present
  means of production, society might enjoy. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html"> &#8212; Book
  IX, Chapter 2: Effects of the Remedy, upon distribution and thence on production</a><br>
  <br>
  FIVE centuries ago the wealth-producing power of England, man for man,
  was small indeed compared with what it is now. Not merely were all the
  great inventions and discoveries which since the Introduction of steam
  have revolutionized mechanical industry then undreamed of, but even
  agriculture was far ruder and less productive. Artificial grasses had
  not been discovered. The potato, the carrot, the turnip, the beet,
  and many other plants and vegetables which the farmer now finds most
  prolific, had not been introduced. The advantages which ensue from
  rotation of crops were unknown. Agricultural implements consisted of
  the spade, the sickle, the flail, the rude plow and the harrow. Cattle
  had not been bred to more than one-half the size they average now, and
  sheep did not yield half the fleece. Roads, where there were roads,
  were extremely bad, wheel vehicles scarce and rude, and places a
  hundred miles from each other were, in difficulties of transportation,
  practically as far apart as London and Hong Kong, or San Francisco and
  New York, are now.  <br>
  <br>
  Yet patient students of those times tell us that the condition of the
  English laborer was not only relatively, but absolutely better in
  those rude times than it is in England today, after five centuries of
  advance in the productive arts. They tell us that the workingman did
  not work so hard as he does now, and lived better; that he was exempt
  from the harassing dread of being forced by loss of employment to want
  and beggary, or of leaving a family that must apply to charity to avoid
  I starvation. Pauperism as it prevails in the rich England of the
  nineteenth century was in the far poorer England of the fourteenth
  century absolutely unknown. Medicine was empirical and superstitious, sanitary
  regulations and precautions were all but unknown. There were frequently plague
  and occasionally famine, for,
  owing to the difficulties of transportation, the scarcity of one
  district could not "be relieved by the plenty of another. But men did
  not as they do now, starve in the midst of abundance; and what is
  perhaps the most significant fact of all is that not only were women
  and children not worked as they are today, but the eight-hour system,
  which even the working classes of the United States, with all the
  profusion of labor-saving machinery and appliances have not yet
  attained, was then the common system! &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

  The Savage and 
  the Modern Workman<a name="Savage"></a> </span><br>
  <br>
  THE aggregate produce of the labor of a savage tribe is small, but each
  member is capable of an independent life. He can build his own
  habitation, hew out or stitch together his own canoe, make his own
  clothing, manufacture his own weapons, snares, tools and ornaments. He
  has all the knowledge of nature possessed by his tribe &#8212; knows what
  vegetable productions are fit for food, and where they maybe found;
  knows the habits and resorts of beasts, birds, fishes and insects;
  can pilot himself by the sun or the stars, by the turning of blossoms
  or the mosses on the trees; is, in short, capable of supplying all his
  wants. He may be cut off from his fellows and still live; and thus
  possesses an independent power which makes him a free contracting party
  in his relations to the community of which he is a member. <br>
  <br>
  Compare with this savage the laborer in the lowest ranks of civilized
  society, whose life is spent in producing but one thing, or oftener but
  the infinitesimal part of one thing, out of the multiplicity of
  things that constitute the wealth of society and go to supply even the
  most primitive wants; who not only cannot make even the tools required
  for his work, but often works with tools that he does not own, and can
  never hope to own. Compelled to even closer and more continuous labor
  than the savage, and gaining by it no more than the savage gets &#8212; the
  mere  necessaries of life &#8212; he loses the independence of the savage. He
  is not
  only unable to apply his own powers to the direct satisfaction of his
  own wants, but, without the concurrence of many others, he is unable to
  apply them indirectly to the satisfaction of his wants. He is a mere
  link in an enormous chain of producers and consumers, helpless to
  separate himself, and helpless to move, except as they move. The worse
  his position in society, the more dependent is he on society; the more
  utterly unable does he become to do anything for himself. The very
  power of exerting his labor for the satisfaction of his wants passes
  from his own control, and may be taken away or restored by the actions
  of others, or by general causes over which he has no more influence
  than he has over the motions of the solar system. The primeval curse
  comes to be looked upon as a boon, and men think, and talk, and
  clamor, and legislate as though monotonous manual labor in itself
  were a good and not an evil, an end and not a means. Under such
  circumstances, the man loses the essential quality of manhood &#8212; the
  godlike power of modifying and controlling conditions. He becomes a
  slave, a machine, a commodity &#8212; a thing, in some respects, lower than
  the
  animal. <br>
  <br>
  I am no sentimental admirer of the savage state. I do not get my ideas
  of the untutored children of nature from Rousseau, or Chateaubriand, or
  Cooper. I am conscious of its material and mental poverty, and its low
  and narrow range. I believe that civilization is not only the natural
  destiny of man, but the enfranchisement, elevation, and refinement of
  all his powers, and think that it is only in such moods as may lead him
  to envy the cud-chewing cattle, that a man who is free to the
  advantages of civilization could look with regret upon the savage
  state. But, nevertheless, I think no one who will open his eyes to
  the facts, can resist the conclusion that there are in the heart of our
  civilization large classes with whom the veriest savage could not
  afford to exchange. It is my deliberate opinion that if, standing on
  the threshold of being, one were given the choice of entering life as a Terra
  del Fuegan, a black fellow of Australia, an Esquimaux in the Arctic Circle,
  or among the lowest classes in such a highly civilized country as Great
  Britain, he would make infinitely the better choice in selecting the
  lot of the savage. For those classes who in the midst of wealth are
  condemned to want, suffer all the privations of the savage, without his
  sense of personal freedom; they are condemned to more than his
  narrowness and littleness, without opportunity for the growth of his
  rude virtues; if their horizon is wider, it is but to reveal blessings
  that they cannot enjoy. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress

  WE are so accustomed to poverty that even in the most advanced
  countries we regard it as the natural lot of the great masses of the people;
  that we take it as a matter of course that even in our highest civilization
  large classes
  should want the necessaries of healthful life, and the vast majority
  should only get a poor and pinched living by the hardest toil.&nbsp;
  There are
  professors of political economy who teach that this condition of things
  is the result of social laws of which it is idle to complain!&nbsp; There
  are ministers of religion who preach that this is the condition which
  an all-wise, all-powerful Creator intended for His children! If an
  architect were to build a theater so that not more than one-tenth of
  the audience could see and hear, we should call him a bungler and a
  botcher. If a man were to give a feast and provide so little food that
  nine-tenths of his guests must go away hungry, we should call him a
  fool, or worse. Yet so accustomed are we to poverty, that even the
  preachers of what passes for Christianity tell us that the great
  Architect of the Universe, to whose infinite skill all nature
  testifies, has made such a botch job of this world that the vast
  majority of the human creatures whom He has called into it are
  condemned by the conditions he has imposed to want, suffering, and
  brutalizing toil that gives no opportunity for the development of

  THAT man cannot exhaust or lessen the powers of nature follows from the
  indestructibility of matter and the persistence of force. Production and consumption
  are only relative terms. Speaking absolutely, man neither produces nor
  consumes. The whole human race, were they to labor to infinity, could
  not make this rolling sphere one atom heavier or one atom lighter,
  could not add to or diminish by one iota
  the sum of the forces whose everlasting circling produces all motion
  and sustains all life. As the water that we take from the ocean must
  again return to the ocean, so the food we take from the reservoirs of
  nature is, from the moment we take it, on its way back to those
  reservoirs. What we draw from a limited extent of land may temporarily
  reduce the productiveness of that land, because the return may be to
  other land, or may be divided between that land and other land, or
  perhaps, all land; but this possibility lessens with increasing area,
  and ceases when the whole globe is considered. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp023.html">Progress

  LIFE does not use up the forces that maintain life. We come into the

  human being, physically considered, is but a transient form of matter, a changing

  lessened, nothing is weakened. And from this it follows that the limit

  conditions
  which limit its further increase, yet these conditions are nowhere
  fixed and final. No species reaches the ultimate limit of soil, water,
  air, and sunshine; but the actual limit of each is in the existence of
  other species, its rivals, its enemies, or its food. Thus the
  conditions which limit the existence of such of these species as

  cannot rival. If he but shoot hawks, food-birds will increase: if he

  IF bears instead of men had been shipped from Europe to the North

    I BELIEVE that in a really Christian community, in a society that
    honored, not with the lips but with
    the act, the doctrines of Jesus, no one would have occasion to
    worry about physical needs any more than do the lilies of the field.
    There is enough and to spare. The trouble is that, in this mad

    who would bring cholera to this country, or the man who, having the
    power to prevent its coming here, would make no effort to do so, would
    be guilty of a crime. Poverty is worse than cholera; poverty kills more
    people than pestilence, even in the best of times. Look at the death
    statistics of our cities; see where the deaths come quickest; see where
    it is that the little children die like flies &#8212; it is in the poorer
    quarters. And the man who looks with careless eyes upon the ravages of

    POLITICAL economy is the simplest of the sciences. It is but the
    intellectual recognition, as related to social life, of laws which in
    their moral aspect men instinctively recognize, and which are embodied
    in the simple teachings of him whom the common people heard gladly. But,
    like Christianity, political economy has been warped by institutions
    which, denying the equality and brotherhood of man, have enlisted

    is a great fact, without which neither the political history of our own time

    that of other times and peoples, can be understood. A comparatively
    small number of individuals brought into virtual though not necessarily
    formal agreement of thought and action by something that makes them individually
    wealthy without adding to the general wealth, may exert an influence out
    of all proportion to their
    numbers. A special interest of this kind is, to the general interests
    of society, as a standing army is to an unorganized mob. It gains
    intensity and energy in its specialization, and in the wealth it
    takes from the general stock finds power to mold opinion. Leisure and
    culture and the circumstances and conditions that command respect
    accompany wealth, and intellectual ability is attracted by it. On the
    other hand, those who suffer from the injustice that takes from the
    many to enrich the few, are in that very thing deprived of the leisure
    to think, and the opportunities, education, and graces necessary to
    give their thought acceptable expression. They are necessarily the "unlettered," the "ignorant," the "vulgar," prone

    this principle changed or avoided when we use the word land as

    <br>
    That the persons whom we call landowners may contribute their labor
    or
    their capital to production is of course true, but that they should
    contribute to production as landowners, and by virtue of that
    ownership, is as ridiculously impossible as that the belief of a

<p>    I AM writing these pages on the shore of Long Island, where the Bay of
    New York contracts to what is called the Narrows, nearly opposite the
    point where our legalized robbers, the Custom-House officers, board
    incoming steamers to ask strangers to take their first American swear,
    and where, if false oaths really colored the atmosphere the air would
    be bluer than is the sky on this gracious day. I turn from my
    writing-machine to the window, and drink in, with a pleasure that never
    seems to pall, the glorious panorama. <br>
    <br>
"What do you see?"&nbsp; If in ordinary talk I were asked this, I should of
    course say, "I see land and water and sky, ships and houses, and light
    clouds, and the sun drawing to its setting over the low green hills of
    Staten Island and illuminating all." <br>
    <br>
    But if the question refer to the terms of political economy, I should
    say, "I see land and wealth." Land,  which is the natural factor of production; and wealth, which is the
    natural factor so changed by the exertion of the human factor, labor,
    as to fit it for the satisfaction of human desires. For water and
    clouds, sky and sun, and the stars that will appear when the sun is
    sunk, are, in the terminology of political economy, as much land as is
    the dry surface of the earth to which we narrow the meaning of the
    word in ordinary talk. And the window through which I look; the
    flowers in the garden; the planted trees of the orchard; the cow that
    is browsing beneath them; the Shore Road under the window; the
    vessels that lie at anchor near the bank, and the little pier that juts
    out from it; the trans-Atlantic liner steaming through the channel; the
    crowded pleasure-steamers passing by; the puffing tug with its line of
    mud-scows; the fort and dwellings on the opposite side of the
    Narrows; the lighthouse that will soon begin to cast its far-gleaming
    eye from Sandy Hook; the big wooden elephant of Coney Island; and the
    graceful sweep of the Brooklyn Bridge, that may be discovered from a
    little higher up; all alike fall into the economic term wealth &#8212; land
    modified by labor so as to afford satisfaction to human desires. All
    in this panorama that was before man came here, and would remain were
    he to go, belongs to the economic category land; while all that has
    been produced by labor belongs to the economic category wealth, so
    long as it retains its quality of ministering to human desire. <br>
    <br>
    But on the hither shore, in view from the window, is a little
    rectangular piece of dry surface, evidently reclaimed from the line of
    water by filling in with rocks and earth. What is that? In ordinary
    speech it is land, as distinguished from water, and I should
    intelligibly indicate its origin by speaking of it as "made land." But
    in the categories of political economy there is no place for such a
    term as "made land." For the term land refers only and exclusively to
    productive powers derived wholly from nature and not at all from
    industry, and whatever is, and in so far as it is, derived from land by
    the exertion of&nbsp;&nbsp;labor, is wealth. This bit of dry surface raised
    above the level of the water by filling in stones and soil, is, in the economic
    category,
    not land but wealth. It has land below it and around it, and the
    material of which it is composed has been drawn from land; but in
    itself it is, in the proper speech of political economy, wealth; just
    as truly as the ships I behold are not land but wealth, though they too
    have land below them and around them and are composed of material drawn
    from land. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em>  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe406.html">unabridged:

    and hand labor as though they were entirely distinct kinds of exertion,
    and labor is
    often spoken of as though it involved only muscular exertion. But in
    reality any form of labor, that is to say, any form of human exertion in
    the production of wealth above that which cattle may be applied to
    doing, requires the human brain as truly as the human hand, and would be
    impossible without the exercise of mental faculties on the part of the
    laborer. Labor in fact is only physical in external form. In its
    origin it is mental or on strict analysis spiritual. &#8212; <em>The Science

    IT seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in
    intimating that Christ in becoming the son of a carpenter and Himself working
    as a carpenter showed merely that "there is nothing to be ashamed of in seeking one's bread by
    labor." To say that is almost like saying that by not robbing people
    He showed that there is nothing to be ashamed of in honesty. If you
    will consider how true in any large view is the classification of all
    men into working-men, beggar-men and thieves, you will see that it was
    morally impossible that Christ during His stay on earth should have
    been anything else than a working-man, since He who came to fulfill
    the law must by deed as well as word obey God's law of labor.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  See how fully and how beautifully Christ's life on earth
    illustrated this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness
    of infancy, as it is appointed that all should enter it, He lovingly
    took what in the natural order is lovingly rendered, the sustenance,
    secured by labor, that one generation owes to its immediate
    successors. Arrived at maturity, He earned His own subsistence by that
    common labor in which the majority of men must and do earn it. Then
    passing to a higher &#8212; to the very highest-sphere of labor. He earned
    His
    subsistence by the teaching of moral and spiritual truths, receiving
    its material wages in the love offerings of grateful hearers, and not
    refusing the costly spikenard with which Mary anointed his feet. So,
    when He chose His disciples, He did not go to land-owners or other
    monopolists who live on the labor of others but to common laboring
    men. And when He called them to a higher sphere of labor and sent them
    out to teach moral and spiritual truths He told them to take,
    without condescension on the one hand, or sense of degradation on
    the other, the loving return for such labor, saying to them that the "laborer
    is worthy of his hire," thus
    showing, what we hold, that all labor does not consist in what is called
    manual labor, but that
    whoever helps to add to the material, intellectual, moral, or spiritual
    fulness of life is also a laborer. - <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

    NOR should it be forgotten that the investigator, the philosopher, the
    teacher, the artist, the poet, the priest, though not engaged in the production
    of wealth, are not only engaged in the production of utilities and satisfactions
    to which
    the production of wealth is only a means, but by acquiring and
    diffusing knowledge, stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral
    sense, may greatly increase the ability to produce wealth. For man
    does not live by bread alone. He is not an engine, in which so much
    fuel gives so much power. On a capstan bar or a topsail halyard a good
    song tells like muscle, and a "Marseillaise" or a "Battle Hymn of the
    Republic" counts for bayonets. A hearty laugh, a noble thought, a
    perception of harmony, may add to the power of dealing even with
    material things. <br>
    <br>
    He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the aggregate of
    enjoyable wealth, increases the sum of human knowledge or gives to
    human life higher elevation or greater fulness &#8212; he is, in the large
    meaning of the words, a "producer," a "working-man," a "laborer," and is honestly
    earning honest wages. But he who without doing aught to make mankind richer,
    wiser, better, happier, lives on the toil of
    others &#8212; he, no matter by what name of honor he may be I called, or
    how lustily the priests of Mammon may swing their censers before him, is
    in the last analysis but a beggarman or a thief. &#8212; <em>Protection or

    CAPITAL, which is not in itself a distinguishable element, but
    which it must always be kept in mind consists of wealth applied to the
    aid of labor in further production, is not a primary factor. There can
    be production without it, and there must have been production without
    it, or it could not in the first place have appeared. It is a secondary
    and compound factor, coming after and resulting from the union of
    labor and land in the production of wealth. It is in essence labor
    raised by a second union with land to a third or higher power. But it
    is to civilized life so necessary and important as to be rightfully
    accorded in political economy the place of a third factor in
    production. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:

    IT is to be observed that capital of itself can do nothing. It is
    always a subsidiary, never an initiatory, factor. The initiatory
    factor is always labor. That is to say, in the production of wealth
    labor always uses capital, is never used by capital. This is not
    merely literally true, when by the term capital we mean the thing
    capital. It is also true when we personify the term and mean by it not
    the thing capital, but the men who are possessed of capital. The
    capitalist pure and simple, the man who merely controls capital, has in
    his hands the power of assisting labor to produce. But purely as capitalist
    he cannot exercise that power. It can be exercised only by labor. To utilize
    it
    he must himself exercise at least some of the functions of labor, or
    he must put his capital, on some terms, at the use of those who do. &#8212; <em>The

    THUS we must exclude from the category of capital everything that may
    be included either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain only
    things which are neither land nor labor, but which have resulted from
    the union of these two original factors of production. Nothing can be
    properly capital that does not consist of these &#8212; that is to say, nothing
    can be capital that is not wealth. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

    <br>
    THUS, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the
    representative of capital. The capital that was once received for it by
    the government has been consumed unproductively &#8212; blown away from the
    mouths of cannon, used up in war ships, expended in keeping men
    marching and drilling, killing and destroying. The bond cannot
    represent capital that has been destroyed. It does not represent
    capital at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that the government
    will, some time or other, take by taxation from the then existing stock
    of the people, so much wealth, which it will turn over to the holder of
    the bond; and that, in the meanwhile, it will, from time to time, take,
    in the same way, enough to make up to the holder the increase which
    so much capital as it some day promises to give him would yield him
    were it actually in his possession. The immense sums which are thus
    taken from the produce of every modern country to pay interest on
    public debts are not the earnings or increase of capital &#8212; are not
    really interest in the strict sense of the term, but are taxes
    levied on the produce of labor and capital, leaving so much less for
    wages and so much less for real
    interest. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">&#8212; Book

<p>CAPITAL, as we have seen, consists
          of wealth used for the procurement of more wealth, as distinguished from
          wealth used for the direct satisfaction of desire; or,
          as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange. <br>
        <br>
        Capital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth:
          (1) By enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as
          by digging up clams with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a
          vessel by shoveling coal into a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar.
          (2) By enabling labor to avail itself of the reproductive forces of
          nature, as to obtain corn by sowing it, or animals by breeding them.
          (3) By permitting the division of labor, and thus, on the one hand,
          increasing the efficiency of the human factor of wealth, by the
          utilization of special capabilities, the acquisition of skill, and the
          reduction of waste; and, on the other, calling in the powers of the
          natural factor at their highest, by taking advantage of the diversities
          of soil, climate and situation, so as to obtain each particular species
          of wealth where nature is most favorable to its production. <br>
        <br>
        Capital does not supply the materials which labor works up into
          wealth, as is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied
          by nature. But such materials partially worked up and in the course
          of exchange are capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html">Progress

          not
          produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible of ownership, is, in
          the same way, resolvable into an equivalent of the labor which the

          common character of these things is that they consist of natural
          substances or products which have been adapted by human labor to human
          use or gratification, their value depending on the amount of labor
          which upon the average would be required to produce things of like

        IT will be well for a moment to consider this idea of accumulated
          wealth. The truth is, that wealth can be accumulated but to a slight
          degree, and that communities really live, as the vast majority of
          individuals live, from hand to mouth. Wealth will not bear much
          accumulation; except in a few unimportant forms it will not keep. The
          matter of the universe, which, when worked up by labor into desirable
          forms, constitutes wealth, is constantly tending back to its original
          state. Some forms of wealth will last for a few hours, some for a few
          days, some for a few months, some for a few years; and there are very
          few forms of wealth that can be passed from one
          generation to another. Take wealth in some of its most useful and
          permanent forms &#8212; ships, houses,
          railways, machinery. Unless labor is constantly exerted in preserving
          and renewing them, they will almost immediately become useless. Stop
          labor in any community, and wealth would vanish almost as the jet of
          a fountain vanishes when the flow of water is shut off. Let labor again
          exert itself, and wealth will almost as immediately reappear.
          Accumulated wealth seems to play just about such a part in relation
          to
          the
          social organism as accumulated nutriment does to the physical organism.
          Some accumulated wealth is necessary, and to a certain extent it may
          be drawn upon in exigencies; but the wealth produced by past generations
          can no more account for the consumption of the present than the dinners
          he ate last year can supply a man with present strength. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp024.html">Progress

          includes all reward for such exertion. There is, therefore, in the

        <br>
        THE fundamental truth, that in all economic reasoning must be firmly
          grasped and never let go, is that society in its most highly developed
          form is but an elaboration of society in its rudest beginnings, and
          that principles obvious in the simpler relations of men are merely
          disguised and not abrogated or reversed by the more intricate relations
          that result from the division of labor and the use of complex tools
          and methods. . . . And so, if we reduce to their lowest terms all the
          complex operations of modern production, we see that each individual
          who takes part in this infinitely subdivided and intricate network
          of production and exchange is really doing what the primeval man did
          when
          he climbed the trees for fruit or followed the receding tide for
          shellfish &#8212; endeavoring to obtain from nature by the exertion of
          his powers the satisfaction of his desires. If we keep this firmly in mind,
          if we look upon production as a whole &#8212; as the co-operation of
          all embraced in any of its great groups to satisfy the various desires
          of
          each, we plainly see that the reward each obtains for his exertions
          comes as truly and as directly from nature as the result of that
          exertion, as did that of the first man. <br>
        <br>
        To illustrate: In the simplest state of which we can conceive, each
          man digs his own bait and catches his own fish. The advantage of the
          division of labor soon becomes apparent, and one digs bait while the
          others fish. Yet evidently the one who digs bait is in reality doing
          as
          much toward the catching of fish as any of those who actually take
          the fish. So when the advantages of canoes are discovered, and instead
          of
          all going a-fishing, one stays behind and makes and repairs canoes,
          the canoe-maker is in reality devoting his labor to the taking of fish
          as
          much as the actual fishermen, and the fish which he eats at night when
          the fishermen come home, are as truly the product of his labor as of
          theirs. And thus when the division of labor is fairly inaugurated,
          and instead of each attempting to satisfy all of his wants by direct
          resort to nature, one fishes, another hunts, a third picks berries,
          a fourth gathers fruit, a fifth makes tools, a sixth builds huts, and
          a seventh
          prepares clothing &#8212; each one is, to the extent he exchanges the direct
          product of his own labor for
          the direct product of the labor of others, really applying his own
          labor to the production of the things he uses &#8212; is in effect
          satisfying his particular desires by the exertion of his particular
          powers; that
          is to say, what he receives he in reality produces. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp011.html">Progress

        THE laborer who receives his wages in money (coined or printed, it

        LABOR always precedes wages. This is as universally true of wages
          received by the laborer from an employer as it is of wages taken directly
          by the laborer who is his own employee. In the one class of cases as
          in the other, reward
          is conditioned upon exertion. Paid sometimes by the day, oftener by
          the week or month, occasionally by the year, and in many branches of
          production by the piece, the payment of wages by an employer to an
          employee always implies the previous rendering of labor by the
          employee for the benefit of the employer, for the few cases in which
          advance payments are made for personal services are evidently referable
          either to charity or to guarantee and purchase. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html"> &#8212; Book

        <br>
        THE payment of wages always implies the previous rendering of labor.
          Now, what does the rendering of labor in production imply? Evidently
        the production of wealth,
          which, if it is to be exchanged or used in production, is capital.
          Therefore, the payment of capital in wages pre-supposes a production
          of capital by the labor for which the wages are paid. And as the
          employer generally makes a profit, the payment of wages is, so far
        as he is concerned, but the return to the laborer of a portion of the
          capital he has received from the labor. So far as the employee is
          concerned, it is but the receipt of a portion of the capital his labor
          has previously produced. As the value paid in the wages is thus
          exchanged for a value brought into being by the labor, how can it be
          said that wages are drawn from capital or advanced by capital? As in
          the exchange of labor for wages the employer always gets the capital
          created by the labor before he pays out capital in the wages, at what
          point is his capital lessened even temporarily? &#8212;<em> <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html"> &#8212; Book

        <br>
        To recapitulate: The man who works for himself gets his wages in the
          things he produces, as he produces them, and exchanges this value into
          another form whenever he sells the produce. The man who works for another
          for stipulated
          wages in money, works under a contract
          of exchange. He also creates his wages as he renders his labor, but
          he does not get them except at stated times, in stated amounts and
          in a
          different form. In performing the labor he is advancing in exchange;
          when he gets his wages the exchange is completed. During the time he
          is earning the wages he is advancing capital to his employer, but at
          no
          time, unless wages are paid before work is done, is the employer
          advancing capital to him. Whether the employer who receives this
          produce in exchange for the wages, immediately re-exchanges it, or
          keeps it for awhile, no more alters the character of the transaction
          than does the final disposition of the product made by the ultimate
          receiver, who may, perhaps, be in another quarter of the globe and
          at the end of a series of exchanges numbering hundreds. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp013.html"> &#8212; Book

        <br>
        THE
          fundamental principle of human action &#8212; the law that is to political
          economy what the law of gravitation is to physics &#8212; is that men
          seek to gratify their desires with the least exertion. . . . Now, under
          this
          principle, what, in conditions of freedom, will be
          the terms at which one man can hire others to work for him? 
          Evidently, they will be fixed by what the men could make if laboring
          for themselves. The principle which will prevent him from having to
          give anything above this except what is necessary to induce the change,
          will also prevent them from taking less. Did they demand more, the
          competition of others would prevent them from getting employment. Did
          he offer less, none would accept the terms, as they could obtain
          greater results by working for themselves. Thus, although the employer
          wishes to pay as little as possible, and the employee to receive as
          much as possible, wages will be fixed by the value or produce of such
          labor to the laborers themselves. If wages are temporarily carried
          either above or below this line, a tendency to carry them back at once
          arises. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp;

        <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> THE effect of all the circumstances
          which give rise to the differences between wages in different occupations
          may be included as supply and demand, and it is perfectly
          correct to say that the wages in different occupations will vary
          relatively according to differences in the supply and demand of labor &#8212; meaning
          by demand the call which the community as a whole makes for services
          of the particular kind, and by supply the relative amount of
          labor which, under the existing conditions, can be determined to the
          performance of those particular services. But though this is true as
          to the relative differences of wages, when it is said, as is commonly
          said, that the general rate of wages is determined by supply and
          demand, the words are meaningless. For supply and demand are but
          relative terms. The supply of labor can only mean labor offered in
          exchange for labor, or the produce of labor, and the demand for
          labor can only mean labor or the produce of labor offered in
          exchange for labor. Supply is thus demand, and demand supply, and in
          the whole community, one must be coextensive with the other. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html"> Book

        THUS, although they may from time to time alter in relation to each
          other, as the circumstances which determine relative levels change,
          yet it is evident that wages in all strata must ultimately depend upon
          wages
          in
          the lowest and widest
          stratum &#8212; the general rate of wages rising or falling as these
          rise or fall. <br>
        <br>
        Now, the primary and fundamental occupations, upon which, so to
          speak, all others are built up, are evidently those which procure
          wealth directly from nature; hence the law of wages in them must be
          the general law of wages. And, as wages in such occupations clearly
          depend upon what labor can produce at the lowest point of natural
          productiveness to which it is habitually applied; therefore, wages
          generally depend upon the margin of cultivation, or, to put it more
          exactly, upon the highest point of natural productiveness to which
          labor
          is free to apply itself without the payment of rent. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp036.html"> Book

        WHEREVER land has an exchange value there is rent in
                          the economic meaning of the term. Wherever land having
                          a value is used,
                either by owner or hirer, there is rent actual; wherever it is
                not used, but still
          has a value, there
          is rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent which gives
          value to land. . . . No matter what are its capabilities, land can
          yield no rent and have no value until some one is willing to give
          labor or the results of labor for the privilege of using it; and what
          anyone will thus give, depends not upon the capacity of the land, but
          upon its capacity as compared with that of land that can be had for
                nothing. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html">Progress

        HERE, let us imagine, is an unbounded savannah, stretching off in
          unbroken sameness of grass and
          flower, tree and rill, till the traveler tires of the monotony.
          Along comes the wagon of the first immigrant. Where to settle he
          cannot tell &#8212; every acre seems as good as every other acre. As to
          wood,
          as to water, as to fertility, as to situation, there is absolutely no
          choice, and he is perplexed by the embarrassment of richness. Tired out
          with the search for one place that is better than another, he stops  &#8212; somewhere,
          anywhere &#8212;  and starts to make himself a home. The soil is virgin
          and rich, game
          is abundant, the streams flash with the finest
          trout. Nature is at her very best. He has what, were he in a populous
          district, would make him rich; but he is very poor. To say nothing of
          the mental craving, which would lead him to welcome the sorriest
          stranger, he labors under all the material disadvantages of solitude.
          He can get no temporary assistance for any work that requires a greater
          union of strength than that afforded by his own family, or by such help
          as he can permanently keep. Though he has cattle, he cannot often have
          fresh meat, for to get a beefsteak he must kill a bullock. He must be
          his own blacksmith, wagonmaker, carpenter, and cobbler &#8212; in short
          a
"jack of all trades and master of none." He cannot have his children
          schooled, for, to do so, he must himself pay and maintain a teacher.
          Such things as he cannot produce himself, he must buy in quantities
and keep on hand, or else go without, for he cannot be constantly leaving
          his work and making a long journey to the verge of civilization; and
          when forced to do so, the getting of a vial of medicine or the
          replacement of a broken auger may cost him the labor of himself and
          horses for days. Under such circumstances, though nature is prolific,
          the man is poor. It is an easy matter for him to get enough to eat;
but beyond this, his labor will only suffice to satisfy the simplest wants
          in the rudest way. <br>
        <br>
        Soon there comes another immigrant. Although every quarter section
          of
          the boundless plain is as good as every other quarter section, he is
          not beset by any embarrassment as to where to settle. Though the land
          is the same, there is one place that is clearly better for him than any
          other place, and that is where there is already a settler and he may
          have a neighbor. He settles by the side of the first comer, whose
          condition is at once greatly improved, and to whom many things are now
          possible that were before impossible, for two men may help each other
          to do things that one man could never do. <br>
        <br>
        Another immigrant comes, and, guided by the same attraction,
          settles
          where there are already two. Another and another, until around our
          first comer there are a score of neighbors. Labor has now an
          effectiveness which,
          in the solitary state, it could not approach. If heavy work is to be
          done, the settlers have a log-rolling, and together accomplish in a
          day what singly would require years. When one kills a bullock the others
          take part of it, returning when they kill, and thus they have fresh
          meat all the time. Together they hire a schoolmaster, and the children
          of each are taught for a fractional part of what similar teaching would
          have cost the first settler. It becomes a comparatively easy matter
          to
          send to the nearest town, for some one is always going. But there is
          less need for such journeys. A blacksmith and a wheelwright soon set
          up shops, and our settler can have his tools repaired for a small part
          of
          the labor they formerly cost him. A store is opened and he can get
          what he wants as he wants it; a post-office, soon added, gives him
          regular communication with the rest of the world. Then comes a cobbler,
          a carpenter, a harnessmaker, a doctor; and a little church soon arises.
          Satisfactions become possible that in the solitary state were
          impossible. There are gratifications for the social and the
          intellectual nature &#8212; for that part of the man that rises above the
          animal. The power of sympathy, the sense of companionship, the
          emulation of comparison and contrast, open a wider and fuller and more
          varied life. In rejoicing, there are others to rejoice; in sorrow,
          the mourners do not mourn alone. There are husking bees, and apple
          parings, and quilting parties. Though the ballroom be unplastered and
          the orchestra but a fiddle, the notes of the magician are yet in the
          strain, and Cupid dances with the dancers. At the wedding, there are
          others to admire and enjoy; in the house of death, there are watchers;
          by the open grave, stands human sympathy to sustain the mourners.
          Occasionally, comes a straggling lecturer to open up glimpses of the
          world of science, of literature, or of art; in election times, come
          stump speakers, and the citizen rises to a sense of dignity and power,
          as the cause of empires is tried before him in the struggle of John Doe
          and Richard Roe for his support and vote. And, by and by, comes the
          circus, talked
          of months before, and opening to children, whose horizon has been the
          prairie, all the realms of the imagination &#8212; princes and princesses
          of fairy tale, mail-clad crusaders and turbaned Moors, Cinderella's
          fairy coach, and the giants of nursery lore; lions such as
          crouched before Daniel, or in circling Roman amphitheater tore the
          saints of God; ostriches who recall the sandy deserts; camels such
          as stood around
          when the wicked brethren raised Joseph from the well and sold him into
          bondage; elephants such as crossed the Alps with Hannibal, or felt
          the sword of
          the Maccabees; and glorious music that thrills and builds in the
          chambers of the mind as rose the sunny dome of Kubla Khan.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Go to our settler now, and say to him: "You have so many fruit trees
          which you planted; so much fencing, such a well, a barn, a house &#8212; in
          short, you have by your labor added so much value to this farm. Your
          land itself is not quite so good. You have been cropping it, and by and
          by it will need manure. I will give you the full value of all your
          improvements if you will give it to me, and go again with your family
          beyond the verge of settlement." He would laugh at you. His land yields
          no more wheat or potatoes than before, but it does yield far more of
          all the necessaries and comforts of life. His labor upon it will bring
          no heavier crops, and, we will suppose, no more valuable crops, but it
          will bring far more of all the other things for which men work. The
          presence of other settlers &#8212;  the increase of population &#8212; has
          added to the productiveness, in these things, of labor bestowed upon
          it, and this
          added productiveness gives it a superiority over land of equal natural
          quality where there are yet no settlers. If no land remains to be
          taken up, except such as is as far removed from population as was our
          settler's land when he first went upon it, the value or rent of this
          land will be measured by the whole of this added capability. If,
          however, as we have supposed, there is a continuous stretch of equal
          land, over which population is now spreading, it will not be necessary
          for the new settler to go into the wilderness, as did the first. He
          will settle
          just
          beyond the other
          settlers, and will get the advantage of proximity to them. The value
          or rent of our settler's land will thus depend on the advantage which
          it
          has, from being at the center of population, over that on the verge.
          In the one case, the margin of production will remain as before; in
          the
          other, the margin of production will be raised. <br>
        <br>
        Population still continues to increase, and as it increases so do the
          economies which its increase permits, and which in effect add to the
          productiveness of the land. Our first settler's land, being the center
          of population, the store, the blacksmith's forge, the wheelwright's
          shop, are set up on it, or on its margin, where soon arises a village,
          which rapidly grows into a town, the center of exchanges for the people
          of the whole district. With no greater agricultural productiveness
          than it had at first, this land now begins to develop a productiveness
          of a higher kind. To labor expended in raising corn, or wheat, or
          potatoes, it. will yield no more of those things than at first; but
          to labor expended in the subdivided branches of production which require
          proximity to other producers, and, especially, to labor expended in
          that final part of production, which consists in distribution, it will
          yield much larger returns. The wheat-grower may go further on, and
          find
          land on which his labor will produce as much wheat, and nearly as much
          wealth; but the artisan, the manufacturer, the storekeeper, the
          professional man, find that their labor expended here, at the center
          of exchanges, will yield them much more than if expended even at a
          little distance away from it; and this excess of productiveness for
          such purposes the landowner can claim, just as he could an excess in
          its wheat-producing power. And so our settler is able to sell in
          building lots a few of his acres for prices which it would not bring
          for wheat growing if its fertility had been multiplied many times.
          With the proceeds he builds himself a fine house, and furnishes  it
          handsomely. That is to say, to reduce the transaction to its lowest
          terms, the people
          who wish to use the land, build and furnish
          the house for him, on condition that he will let them avail themselves
          of the superior productiveness which the increase of population has
          given the land. <br>
        <br>
        Population still keeps on increasing, giving greater and greater
          utility to the land, and more and more wealth to its owner. The town
          has grown into a city &#8212; a St. Louis, a Chicago, or a San Francisco &#8212; and
          still it grows. Production is here carried on upon a great scale, with
          the best machinery and the most favorable facilities; the division
          of labor becomes extremely minute, wonderfully multiplying efficiency;
          exchanges are of such volume and rapidity that they are made with the
          minimum of friction and loss. Here is the heart, the brain, of the
          vast
          social organism that has grown up from the germ of the first
          settlement; here has developed one of the great ganglions of the human
          world. Hither run all roads, hither set all currents, through all the
          vast regions round about. Here, if you have anything to sell, is the
          market; here, if you have anything to buy, is the largest and the
          choicest stock. Here intellectual activity is gathered into a focus,
          and here springs that stimulus which is born of the collision of mind
          with mind. Here are the great libraries, the storehouses and granaries
          of knowledge, the learned professors, the famous specialists. Here
          are museums and art galleries, collections of philosophical apparatus,
          and
          all things rare and valuable, the best of their kind. Here come great
          actors, and orators, and singers, from all over the world. Here, in
          short, is a center of human life, in all its varied manifestations. <br>
        <br>
        So enormous are the advantages which this land now offers for the
          application of labor, that, instead of one man with a span of horses
          scratching over acres, you may count in places thousands of workers
          to the acre, working tier on tier, on floors raised one above the other,
          five, six, seven, and eight stories from the ground, while underneath
          the surface of the earth engines are
          throbbing with pulsations that exert the force of thousands of horses.
          All these advantages adhere to the land; it is on this land, and no
          other, that they can be utilized, for here is the center of
          population &#8212; the focus of exchanges, the market-place and workshop
          of the
          highest forms of industry. The productive powers which density of
          population has attached to this land are equivalent to the
          multiplication of its original fertility by the hundredfold and the
          thousandfold. And rent, which measures the difference between this
          added productiveness and that of the least productive land in use, has
          increased accordingly. Our settler, or whoever has succeeded to his
          right to the land, is now a millionaire. Like another Rip Van Winkle,
          he may have lain down and slept; still he is rich &#8212; not from anything
          he
          has done, but from the increase of population. There are lots from
          which for every foot of frontage the owner may draw more than an
          average mechanic can earn; there are lots that will sell for more than
          would suffice to pave them with gold coin. In the principal streets are
          towering buildings, of granite, marble, iron, and plate-glass, finished
          in the most expensive style, replete with every convenience. Yet they
          are not worth as much as the land upon which they rest &#8212; the
          same land,
          in nothing changed, which, when our first settler came upon it, had
          no value at all. That this is the way in which the increase of population
          powerfully acts in increasing rent, whoever, in a progressive
          country, will look around him, may see for himself. The process is
          going on under his eyes. The increasing difference in the
          productiveness of the land in use, which causes an increasing rise
          in
          rent, results not so much from the necessities of increased population
          compelling the resort to inferior land, as from the increased
          productiveness which increased population gives to the lands already
          in use. The most valuable lands on the globe, the lands which yield
          the
          highest rent, are not lands of surpassing natural fertility, but lands
          to which a
          surpassing utility has been given by the increase of population. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp042.html">Progress

          land, labor, and capital, and profits is not a term that refers
          exclusively to anyone of these three divisions. Of the three parts
          into which profits are divided by political economists &#8212;  namely,
          compensation for risk, wages of superintendence, and return for the use
          of
          capital &#8212; the latter falls under the term interest, which includes
          all the returns for the use of capital, and excludes everything else; wages
          of superintendence falls under the term wages, which includes all
          returns for human exertion, and excludes everything else; and

<p>    INTEREST, as an abstract term in the distribution of wealth, differs in
        meaning from the word as commonly used, in this: That it includes all
        returns for the use of capital, and not merely those that pass from
        borrower to lender; and that it excludes compensation for risk, which
        forms so great a part of what is commonly called interest. Compensation
        for risk is evidently only an equalization of return between different
        employments of capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html">Progress &amp;

        knows how to make money. Say to him: "Here is a little village; in ten years
        it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the railroad will have taken
        the place of the stagecoach, the electric light of the candle; it
        will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously

        <br>
        He will tell you, "No!" <br>
        <br>
"Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for a
        man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?" <br>
        <br>
        He will tell you, "No; the wages of common labor will not be any
        higher; on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower;
        it will not be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent
        living; the chances are that it will be harder." <br>

        POLITICAL economy is not a set of dogmas. It is the explanation of
          a certain set of facts. It is the science which, in the sequence of
          certain phenomena, seeks to trace mutual relations and to identify
          cause and effect, just as the physical sciences seek to do in other
          sets of phenomena. It lays its foundations upon firm ground. The
          premises from which it makes its deductions are truths which have the
          highest sanction; axioms which we all recognize; upon which we safely
          base the reasoning and actions of every-day life, and which may be
          reduced to the metaphysical expression of the physical law that motion
          seeks the line of least resistance &#8212; viz. that men seek to gratify
          their desires with the least exertion. Proceeding from a basis thus
          assured, its processes, which consist simply in identification, and
          separation,
          have the same certainty. In this sense it is as exact a science as
          geometry, which, from similar truths relative to space, obtains its
          conclusions by similar means, and its conclusions when valid should
          be as self-apparent. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp011.html">Progress

        WHETHER it proceed from experience of the irksomeness of labor and
          the desire to avoid it, or, further back than that, have its source
          in some innate principle of the human constitution, this disposition
          of
          men to seek the satisfaction of their desires with the minimum of
          exertion is so universal and unfailing, that it constitutes one of
          those invariable sequences that we denominate laws of nature, and from
          which we may safely reason. It is this law of nature that is the
          fundamental law of political economy &#8212; the central law from which
          its deductions and explanations may with certainty be drawn, and, indeed,
          by which alone they become possible. It holds the same place in the
          sphere of political economy that the law of gravitation does in
          physics. Without it there could be no recognition of order, and all
          would be chaos. . . . It is no more affected by the selfishness or
          unselfishness of our desires than is the law of gravitation. It is
          simply a fact. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212;<a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe112.html"> unabridged:

        <br>
        THE famous treatise in which the English philosopher Hobbes, during
          the revolt against the tyranny of the Stuarts in the seventeenth century,
          sought to give the sanction of reason to the doctrine of the absolute
          authority of
          kings,
          is entitled <em>Leviathan</em>. It thus begins: "Nature, the art whereby God
          hath made and governs the world, is by the art of man, as in many other
          things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an artificial
          animal. . . For by art is created that great Leviathan called a commonwealth
          or state, in Latin <span style="font-style: italic;">civitas</span>,
          which is but an artificial man; though of greater stature and strength
          than the
          natural, for whose protection and
          defense it was intended. . ." <br>
        <br>
        Without stopping now to comment further on Hobbes's suggestive analogy,
          there is, it seems to me, in the system or arrangement into which men
          are brought in social life by the effort to satisfy their material
          desires &#8212; an integration which goes on as civilization advances &#8212; something
          which even more strongly and more clearly suggests the idea of a
          gigantic man, formed by the union of individual men, than any merely
          political integration. This Greater Leviathan is to the political
          structure or conscious commonwealth what the unconscious functions
          of the body are to the conscious activities. It is not made by pact
          or
          covenant, it grows; as the tree grows, as the man himself grows, by
          virtue of natural laws inherent in human nature and in the
          constitution of things. . . . It is this natural system or arrangement,
          this adjustment of means to ends, of the parts to the whole and the
          whole to the parts, in the satisfaction of the material desires of
          men living in society, which, in the same sense as that in which we
          speak
          of the economy of the solar system, is the economy of human society,
          or what in English we call political economy. It is as human units,
          individuals or families, take their place as integers of this higher
          man, this Greater Leviathan, that what we call civilization begins
          and advances. . . . The appearance and development of the body politic,
          the
          organized state, the Leviathan of
          Hobbes, is the mark of civilization already in existence. &#8212; <em>The

          </span> LET us try to trace the genesis of civilization. Gifted alone
          with the power of relating cause and effect, man is among all animals
          the only
          producer in the true sense of the term. . . . But the same quality
          of reason which makes him the producer, also, wherever exchange becomes
          possible, makes him the exchanger. And it is along this line of
          exchanging that the body economic is evolved and develops, and that
          all
          the advances of civilization are primarily made. . . . With the
          beginning of exchange or trade among men this body economic begins
          to form, and in its beginning civilization begins. . . . To find an
          utterly uncivilized people, we must find a people among whom there
          is
          no exchange or trade. Such a people does not exist, and, as far as
          our knowledge goes, never did. To find a fully civilized people, we
          must
          find a people among whom exchange or trade is absolutely free, and
          has reached the fullest development to which human desires can carry
          it.
          There is, as yet, unfortunately, no such people. &#8212; <em>The Science

        WHEN we, come to analyze production, we find it to fall into three
          modes, viz:: <br>
        ADAPTING, or changing natural products either in form or in place so
          as to fit them for the satisfaction of human desire. <br>
        GROWING, or utilizing the vital forces of nature, as by raising
          vegetables or animals. <br>
        EXCHANGING, or utilizing, so as to add to the general sum of wealth,
          the higher powers of those natural forces which vary with locality,
          or of those human forces which vary with situation, occupation, or
          character. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp033.html">Progress

        <br>
        THESE modes seem to appear and to assume importance, in the
          development of human society, much in the order here given. They
          originate from the increase of the desires of men with the increase
          of the means of satisfying them, under pressure of the fundamental
          law of
          political economy, that men seek to satisfy their desires with the
          least exertion. In the primitive stage of human life the readiest way
          of satisfying desires is by adapting to human use what is found in
          existence. In a later and more settled stage it is discovered that
          certain desires can be more easily and more fully satisfied by
          utilizing the principle of growth and reproduction, as by cultivating
          vegetables and breeding animals. And in a still later period of
          development, it becomes obvious that certain desires can be better
          and more easily satisfied by exchange, which brings out the principle
          of
          co-operation more fully and powerfully than could obtain among
          unexchanging economic units. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em>  <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe302.html">unabridged:

        <br>
        IN the economic meaning of the term production, the transporter or
          exchanger, or anyone engaged in
          any subdivision of those functions, is as truly engaged in
          production as is the primary extractor or maker. A newspaper-carrier
          or the keeper of a news-stand would, for instance, in common speech
          be styled a distributor. But in economic terminology he is not a
          distributor of wealth, but a producer of wealth. Although his part
          in the process of producing the newspaper to the final receiver comes
          last, not first, he is as much a producer as the paper-maker or
          type-founder, the editor, or compositor, or press-man. For the object
          of
          production is the satisfaction of human desires, that is to say, it
          is
          consumption; and this object is not made capable of attainment, that
          is
          to say, production is not really complete, until wealth is brought
          to the place where it is to be consumed and put at the disposal of
          him
          whose desire it is to satisfy.&nbsp; &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

        PRODUCTION and distribution are not separate things, but two mentally
          distinguishable parts of one thing &#8212; the exertion of human labor
          in the satisfaction of human desire. Though materially distinguishable,
          they
          are as closely related as the two  arms of the syphon. And as it is
          the outflow of water at the longer end of the syphon that is the cause
          of
          the inflow
          of
          water at the shorter
          end, so it is that distribution is really the cause of production,
          not production the cause of distribution. In the ordinary course,
          things are not distributed because they have been produced, but are
          produced in order that they may be distributed. Thus interference with
          the distribution of wealth is interference with the production of
          wealth, and shows its effect in lessened production. &#8212; <em>The

        <br>
        OUR inquiry into the laws of the distribution of wealth is not an
          inquiry into the municipal laws or human enactments which either here
          and now, or in any other time and place, prescribe or have prescribed
          how wealth shall be divided among men. With them we have no concern,
          unless it may be for purposes of illustration. What we have to seek
          are those laws of the distribution of wealth which belong to the natural
          order &#8212; laws which are a part of that system or arrangement which
          constitutes the social organism or body economic, as distinguished
          from the body politic or state, the Greater Leviathan which makes its
          appearance with civilization and develops with its advance. These
          natural laws are in all times and places the same, and though they
          may
          be crossed by human enactment, can never be annulled or swerved by
          it. It is more needful to call this to mind, because, in what have
          passed
          for systematic treatises on political economy, the fact that it is
          with natural laws, not human laws, that the science of political economy
          is
          concerned, has, in treating of the distribution of wealth, been
          utterly ignored, and even flatly denied. &#8212; <em>The Science of

        THE distinction between the laws of production and the laws of
          distribution is not, as is erroneously taught in the scholastic
          political economy, that the one set of laws are natural laws and the
          other human laws. Both sets of laws are laws of nature. The real
          distinction is that the natural laws of pro<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>duction
          are physical laws and the natural laws of distribution are moral laws.
          . . . The moment we turn from a consideration of the laws
          of the production of wealth to a consideration of the laws of
          the distribution of wealth, the idea of ought or duty becomes primary.
          All consideration of distribution involves the ethical principle, is
          necessarily a consideration of ought or duty &#8212; a consideration
          in which the idea of right or justice is from the very first involved. &#8212; <em>The

        Two Modes </span><br>
        <br>
        ALL increase in the productive power of man over that with which
          nature endows the individual comes from the co-operation of
          individuals. But there are two ways in
          which this co-operation may take place. 1. By the combination of
          effort. In this way individuals may accomplish what exceeds the full
          power of the individual. 2. By the separation of effort. In this way
          the individual may accomplish for more than one what does not require
          the full power of the individual. . . . To illustrate: The first way
          of co-operation, the combination of labor, enables a number of men
          to remove a rock or to raise a log that would be too heavy for them
          separately. In this way men conjoin themselves, as it were, into one
          stronger man. Or, to take an example so common in the early days of
          American settlement that "log-rolling" has become a term for
          legislative combination: Tom, Dick, Harry and Jim are building near
          each other their rude houses in the clearings. Each hews his own trees,
          but the logs are too heavy for one man to get into place. So the four
          unite their efforts, first rolling one man's logs into place and then
          another's, until, the logs of all four having been placed, the result
          is the same as if each had been enabled to concentrate into one time
          the force he could exert in four different times. . . . But, while
          great advantages result from the ability of individuals, by the
          combination of labor to concentrate themselves, as it were, into
          one larger man, there are other times and other things in which an
          individual could accomplish more if he could divide himself, as it
          were, into a number of smaller men. . . . What the division of labor
          does,
          is to permit men, as it were, so to divide themselves, thus enormously
          increasing their total effectiveness. To illustrate from the example
          used before: While at times Tom, Dick, Harry and Jim might each wish
          to move logs, at other times they might each need to get something
          from a village distant two days' journey. To satisfy this need
          individually would thus require two days' effort on the part of each.
          But if Tom alone goes, performing the errands for all, and the others
          each do half a days' work for him, the result is that all get at the
          expense of half a day's effort on the part of each what otherwise would
          have required two days' effort. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

          <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Co-operation &#8212; its Two Kinds </span><br>
        <br>
        WE have seen that there are two ways or modes in which co-operation
          increases productive power. If we ask how co-operation is itself
          brought about, we see that there is in this also a distinction, and
          that co-operation is of two essentially different kinds. . .. There
          is one kind of co-operation, proceeding, as it were, from without,
          which
          results from the conscious direction of a controlling will to a
          definite end. This we may call directed or conscious co-operation.
          There is another kind of co-operation, proceeding, as it were, from
          within, which results from a correlation in the actions of independent
          wills, each seeking but its own immediate purpose, and careless, if
          not indeed ignorant, of the general result. This we may call
          spontaneous or unconscious co-operation. The movement of a great
          army is a good type of co-operation of the one kind. Here the actions
          of many individuals are subordinated to, and directed by, one conscious
          will, they becoming, as it were, its body and executing its thought.
          The providing of a great city with all the manifold things which are
          constantly needed by its inhabitants is a good type of co-operation
          of the other kind. This kind of co-operation is far wider, far finer,
          far
          more strongly and delicately organized, than the kind of co-operation
          involved in the movements of an army, yet it is
          brought about not by subordination to the direction of one conscious
          will, which knows the general result at which it aims, but by the
          correlation of actions originating in many independent wills, each
          aiming at its own small purpose without care for, or thought of; the
          general result. The one kind of co-operation seems to have its analogue
          in those related movements of our body which we are able consciously
          to direct. The other kind of co-operation seems to have its analogue      in
          the correlation of the innumerable movement, of which we are unconscious,
          that maintain the bodily frame &#8212; motions which in
          their complexity, delicacy and precision far transcend our powers of
          conscious direction, yet by whose perfect adjustment to each other
          and to the purpose of the whole, that co-operation of part and function,
          that makes up the human body and keeps it in life and vigor, is
          brought about and supported. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em>&nbsp;&#8212;

        To attempt to apply that kind of co-operation which requires direction

        Co-operation and Commerce<a name="commerce"></a></span><br>
        <br>
        ALL living things that we know of co-operate in some kind and to some
          degree. So far as we can
          see, nothing that lives can live in and for itself alone. But man
          is the only one who co-operates by exchanging, and he may be
          distinguished from all the numberless tribes that with him tenant the
          earth as the exchanging animal. . . . Exchange is the great agency
          by which what I have called the spontaneous or unconscious
          co-operation of men in the production of wealth is brought about, and
          economic units are welded into that social organism which is the
          Greater Leviathan. To this economic body, this Greater Leviathan, into
          which it builds the economic units, it is what the nerves or perhaps
          the ganglions are to the individual body. Or, to make use of another
          illustration, it is to our material desires and powers of satisfying
          them what the switchboard of a telegraph or telephone, or other
          electric system, is to that system, a means by which exertion of one
          kind in one place may be transmitted into satisfaction of another
          kind in another place, and thus the efforts of individual units be
          conjoined and correlated so as to yield satisfactions in most useful
          place and form, and to an amount enormously exceeding what otherwise
          would be possible. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe311.html">unabridged:

          exchange as a part of distribution. On the contrary, it belongs to
          production. It is by exchange, and through exchange, that man
          obtains, and is able to exert, the power of co-operation which, with
          the advance of civilization, so enormously increases his ability to
          produce wealth. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe311.html">unabridged:

        THEY who, seeing how men are forced by competition to the extreme of
          human wretchedness, jump to the conclusion that competition should be
          abolished, are like those who, seeing a house burn down, would prohibit
          the use of fire. <br>
        <br>
        The air we breathe exerts upon every square inch of our bodies a
          pressure of fifteen pounds. Were this pressure exerted only on one
          side, it would pin us to the ground and crush us to a jelly. But being
          exerted on all sides, we move under it with perfect freedom. It not
          only does not inconvenience us, but it serves such indispensable
          purposes that, relieved of its pressure, we should die. <br>
        <br>
        So it is with competition. Where there exists a class denied all right
          to the element necessary to life arid labor, competition is one-sided,
          and as population increases must press the lowest class into virtual
          slavery, and even starvation. But where the natural rights of all are
          secured, then competition, acting on every hand &#8212; between employers as
          between employed, between buyers as between sellers &#8212; can injure
          no one. <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
        On the contrary it becomes the most simple, most extensive, most
          elastic, and most refined system of co-operation that, in the present
          stage of social development, and in the domain where it will freely
          act, we can rely on for the co-ordination of industry and the
          economizing of social forces. <br>
        <br>
        In short, competition plays just such a part in the social organism
          as those vital impulses which are beneath consciousness do in the bodily
          organism. With it, as with them, it is only necessary that it should
          be free. The line at which the state should come in is that where free
          competition becomes impossible &#8212; a line analogous to that which
          in the individual organism separates the conscious from the unconscious
          functions. There is such a line, though extreme socialists and extreme
          individualists both ignore it. The extreme individualist is like the
          man who would have his hunger provide him food; the extreme socialist
          is like the man who would have his conscious will direct his stomach
          how to digest it. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, chapter

          For the intelligent direction thus required an individual man or
          individual men must be selected, for even if there be angels and

          command. Taking no note of the difficulties which universal experience
          shows always to attend the choice of the depositories of power, and
          ignoring the inevitable tendency to tyranny and oppression, of command
          over the actions of others, simply consider, even if the very wisest
          and best of men were selected for such purposes, the task that would
          be put upon them in the ordering of the when, where, how and by whom,

        THE ideal of socialism is grand and noble; and it is, I am convinced,
          possible of realization, but such a state of society cannot be
          manufactured &#8212; it must grow. Society is an organism, not a machine.
          It can only live by the individual life of its parts. And in the free

              (a name which

            industrial relations of men not a machine which requires construction,
            but an organism which needs only to be suffered to grow. We
            see in the natural, social and industrial laws such harmony as we
              see in the adjustments of the human body, and that as far transcends
              the
            power of man's intelligence to order and direct as it is beyond man's
            intelligence to order and direct the vital movements of his frame.
            We see in these social and industrial laws so close a relation to
              the moral law as must spring from the same Authorship, and that

            discharged by the conscious intelligence while the play of individual
            impulse and interest performs functions akin to those discharged
              in the bodily organisms by the unconscious instincts and involuntary
            motions, the Anarchists seem to us like men who would try to get
              along
            without heads, and the Socialists like men who would try to rule
              the wonderfully complex and delicate internal relations of their

        BUT it seems to us the vice of Socialism in all its degrees is its
            want of radicalism, of going to the root. . .. It assumes that the
            tendency
            of wages to a minimum is the natural law, and seeks to abolish wages;
            it assumes
            that
            the natural
            result of competition is to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish
            competition by restrictions, prohibitions, and extensions of
            governing power. Thus mistaking effects for causes, and childishly
            blaming the stone for hitting it, it wastes strength in striving
            for remedies that when not worse are futile. Associated though it
            is in

        JUMPING to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it fails
            to see that oppression does not come from the nature of capital,
            but from
            the wrong that robs labor of capital by divorcing it from land, and
            that creates a fictitious capital that is really capitalized monopoly.
            It fails to see that it would be impossible for capital to oppress
            labor were labor free to the natural material of production; that
            the wage system in itself springs from mutual convenience, being
            a form
            of co-operation
            in
            which one of the parties prefers a certain to a contingent result;
            and that what it calls the "iron law of wages," is not the natural law of
            wages, but only the law of wages in that unnatural condition in which
            men are made helpless by being deprived of the materials for life and
            work. It fails to see that what it mistakes for the evils of
            competition are really the evils of restricted competition &#8212; are
            due to a one-sided competition to which men are forced when deprived
            of land.
            While its methods, the organization of men into industrial armies,
            the direction and control of all production and exchange by governmental
            or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried to full expression,
            mean

        IN socialism as distinguished from individualism there is an
            unquestionable truth &#8212; and that a truth to which (especially
            by those most identified with free-trade principles) too little attention
            has
            been paid. Man is primarily an individual &#8212; a separate entity,
            differing
            from his fellows in desires and powers, and requiring for the exercise
            of those powers and the gratification of those desires individual
            play and freedom. But he is also a social being, having desires that
            harmonize with those of his fellows, and powers that can only be
            brought out in concerted action. There is thus a domain of individual
            action and a domain of social action &#8212; some things which can
            best be done
            when each acts for himself, and some things which can best be done
            when society acts for all its members. And the natural tendency of
            advancing
            civilization is to make social conditions relatively more
            important, and more and more to enlarge the domain of social action.
            This has not been sufficiently regarded, and at the present time,
            evil unquestionably results from leaving to individual action functions
            that by reason of the growth of society and the developments of the
            arts have passed into the domain of <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> social
            action; just as, on the other hand, evil unquestionably results from
            social interference with what properly belongs to the
            individual. Society ought not to leave the telegraph and the railway
            to the management and control of individuals; nor yet ought society
            to step in and collect individual debts or attempt to direct individual
            industry. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, Chapter 28 <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT28.html#Chapter%2028">econlib</a><br>

            in the

            in the history of the world in which the "protection" of the
            laboring masses has not meant their oppression? The protection that
            those who have got the law-making power into their hands have given

        WHAT should we think of human laws framed for the government of a
            country which should compel each family to keep constantly on their
            guard against every other family, to expend a large part of their
            time and labor in preventing exchanges with their neighbors, and
            to seek
            their own prosperity by opposing the natural efforts of other families
            to become prosperous? Yet the protective theory implies that laws
            such as these have been imposed by the Creator upon the families
            of men
            who tenant this earth. It implies that by virtue of social laws,

        TO attempt to make a nation prosperous by preventing it from buying
            from other nations is as absurd as it would be to attempt to make
            a man prosperous by preventing him from buying from other men. How
            this
            operates in the case of the individual we can see from that practice
            which, since its application in the Irish land agitation, has come
            to
            be called "boycotting." Captain Boycott, upon whom has been thrust the

"protected." He had a protective tariff of the most efficient kind
            built around him by a neighborhood decree more effective than act
of Parliament. No one would sell him labor, no one would sell him milk
  or bread or meat or any service or commodity whatever. But instead of
            growing prosperous, this much-protected man had to fly from a place
            where his own market was thus reserved for his own productions. What
            protectionists ask us to do to ourselves in reserving our home market
            for home producers, is in kind what the Land Leaguers did to Captain
            Boycott. They ask us to boycott ourselves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

        WHEN not caused by artificial obstacles, any tendency in trade to
            take a certain course is proof that it ought to take that course,
            and
            restrictions are harmful because they restrict, and in proportion
            as they restrict. To assert that the way for men to become healthy
            and
            strong is
            for them
            to force into their stomachs what nature tries to reject, to regulate
            the play of their lungs by bandages, or to control the circulation
            of their blood by ligatures, would be not a whit more absurd than
            to assert that the way for nations to become rich is for them to
            restrict

        TRADE is not invasion. It does not involve aggression on one side
            and resistance on the other, but mutual consent and gratification.
            There
            cannot be a trade unless the parties to it agree, any more than there
            can be a quarrel unless the parties to it differ. England, we say,
            forced trade with the outside world upon China and the United States
            upon Japan. But, in both cases, what was done was not to force the
            people to trade, but to force their governments to let them. If the
            people had not wanted to trade, the opening of the ports would have
            been useless. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, Chapter 6: Trade

  TRADE does not require force. Free trade consists simply in letting

        IF all the material things needed by man could be produced equally
            well at all points on the earth's surface, it might seem more convenient
            for
            man the animal, but how would he have risen above the animal level?
            As we see
            in the
            history of
            social development, commerce has been and is the great civilizer
            and educator. The
            seemingly infinite diversities in the capacity of different parts
            of the earth's surface lead to that exchange of productions which
            is the
            most powerful agent in preventing isolation, in breaking down
            prejudice, in increasing knowledge and widening thought. These
            diversities of nature, which seemingly increase with our knowledge
            of nature's powers, like the diversities in the aptitudes of individuals
            and communities, which similarly increase with social development,
            call forth powers and give rise to pleasures which could never arise
            had man been placed like an ox in a boundless field of clover. The "international
            law of God" which we fight with our tariffs &#8212; so
            shortsighted are the selfish prejudices of men &#8212; is the law
            which stimulates mental and moral progress; the law to which civilization
            is due. &#8212; <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp19.html">Social

"COME with me," said Richard Cobden, as John Bright turned
            heart-stricken from a new-made grave. "There are in England women and children
            dying with hunger  &#8212; with
            hunger made by the laws. Come with me, and we will not rest until
            we repeal those laws." <br>
        <br>
        In this spirit the free trade movement waxed and grew, arousing an
            enthusiasm that no mere fiscal reform could have aroused. And
            intrenched though it was by restricted suffrage and rotten boroughs and
            aristocratic privilege, protection was overthrown in Great Britain. <br>
        <br>
        And &#8212; there is hunger in Great Britain still, and women and
            children yet die of it. <br>
        <br>
        But this is not the failure of free trade. When protection had been
            abolished and a revenue tariff substituted for a protective tariff,
            free trade had only won an outpost. That women and children still
            die of hunger in Great Britain arises from the failure of the reformers
            to go on. Free trade has not yet been tried in Great Britain. Free
            trade
            in its fulness and entirety would indeed abolish hunger. &#8212; <em>Protection

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">True Free Trade<a name="truefreetrade"></a> </span><br>
        <br>
        THE mere abolition of protection &#8212; the mere substitution of a revenue
            tariff for a protective tariff &#8212; is such a lame and timorous
            application of the free-trade principle that it is a misnomer to
            speak of it as free
            trade. A revenue tariff is
            only a somewhat milder restriction on trade than a protective tariff.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  Free trade, in its true meaning, requires not merely the abolition of
            protection but the sweeping away of all tariffs &#8212; the abolition
            of all restrictions (save those imposed in the interests of public
            health or morals) on the bringing of things into a country or the
            carrying of
            things out of a country. <br>
        <br>
        But free trade cannot logically stop with the abolition of
            custom-houses. It applies as well to domestic as to foreign trade, and
            in its true sense requires the abolition of all internal taxes that
            fall on buying, selling, transporting or exchanging, on the making of
            any transaction or the carrying on of any business, save of course
            where the motive of the tax is public safety, health or morals. Thus
            the adoption of true free trade involves the abolition of all
            indirect taxation of whatever kind, and the resort to direct taxation
            for all public revenues. <br>
        <br>
        But this is not all. Trade, as we have seen, is a mode of production,
            and the freeing of trade is beneficial because it is a freeing of
            production. For the same reason, therefore, that we ought not to
            tax anyone for
            adding to the wealth
            of a country by bringing valuable things into it, we ought not to
            tax anyone for adding to the wealth of a country by producing within
            that
            country valuable things. Thus the principle of free trade requires
            that we should not merely abolish all indirect taxes, but that we
            should abolish as well all direct taxes on things that are the produce
            of
            labor; that we should, in short, give full play to the natural
            stimulus to production &#8212; the possession and enjoyment of the things
            produced &#8212; by imposing no tax whatever upon the production,
            accumulation or possession of wealth (the things produced by labor),
            leaving
            everyone free to make exchange, give, spend or bequeath. &#8212; <em>Protection

        THEY [the Physiocrats) were &#8212; what the so-called "English free-traders"
        who have followed Adam Smith never yet have been &#8212; free traders in the
            full sense of the term. In their practical proposition, the single tax,
            they proposed the only means by which the free trade principle can ever
            be carried to its logical conclusion &#8212; the freedom not merely of trade
            but of all other forms and modes of production, with full freedom of
            access to the natural element which is essential to all production.
            They were the authors of the motto that in the English use of the
            phrase "Laissez faire!" "Let things alone," has been so emasculated
            and perverted, but which on their lips was "Laissez faire, laissez
            aller!" "Clear the ways and let things alone." This is said to come
            from the cry that in medieval tournaments gave the signal for combat,
            The English motto which I take to come closest to the spirit of the
            French phrase is, "A fair field and no favor!" &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

        HERE is a traveler who, beset by robbers, has been left bound,

            whether to put a piece of court-plaster on his cheek or a new patch on
            his coat, or shall we dispute with each other as to what road he ought
            to take, and whether a bicycle, a tricycle, a horse and wagon, or a
            railway, would best help him on? Should we not rather postpone such
            discussion until we have cut the man's bonds? Then he can see for himself,
            speak for himself, and help himself. Though with a scratched cheek and
            a torn coat, he may get on

        </span> WE talk about the supply of labor, and the demand for labor,
            but, evidently, these are only relative terms. The supply of labor
            is everywhere the same &#8212; two hands always come into the world with one
            mouth, twenty-one boys to every twenty girls; and the demand for labor
            must always exist as long as men want things which labor alone can
            procure. We talk about the "want of work," but, evidently it is not
            work that is short while want continues; evidently, the supply of
            
labor cannot be too great, nor the demand for labor too small, when
            people suffer for the lack of things that labor produces. The real
            trouble must be that the supply is somehow prevented from satisfying
            demand, that somewhere there is an obstacle which prevents labor
            from producing the things that laborers want. <br>
        <br>
        Take the case of anyone of these vast masses of unemployed men, to
            whom, though he never heard of Malthus, it today seems that there
            are too many people in the world. In his own wants, in the needs
            of his
            anxious wife, in the demands for his half cared for, perhaps even
            hungry and shivering, children, there is demand enough for labor,
            Heaven knows! In his own willing hands is the supply. Put him on
            a solitary island, and though cut off from all the enormous advantages
            which the co-operation, combination, and machinery of a civilized
            community give to the productive powers of man, yet his two hands
            can
            fill the mouths and keep warm the backs that depend upon them. Yet
            where productive power is at its highest development, he cannot.
            Why? Is it not because in the one case he has access to the material
            and
            forces of nature, and in the other this access is denied? &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Progress

NOW, why is it that men, have to work for such low wages? Because, if
            they were to demand higher
            wages, there are plenty of unemployed men ready to step into
            their places. It is this mass of unemployed men who compel that

            subsistence. Why is it that there are men who cannot get employment?
            Did you ever think what a strange thing it is that men cannot
            find employment?&nbsp; If men cannot find an employer, why can they
            not employ themselves? Simply because they are shut out from the
            element on which human labor can alone be exerted; men are compelled
            to compete
            with each other for the wages of an employer, because they have been
            robbed of the natural opportunities of employing themselves; because
            they cannot find a piece of God's world on which to work without
            paying some other human creature for the privilege. &#8212; <a href="crime_of_poverty.html">The

            To listen to much that is talked and much that is written, one would
            think
            that the cause of poverty is that there is not work enough for so

            less fertile, iron as scarce as gold, and gold as diamonds; or if

            we are all here with an equal title to the enjoyment of His bounty &#8212; with
            an equal right to the use of all that nature so impartially offers.
            This is a
            right which is natural and inalienable; it is a right which vests
            in every human being as he enters the world, and which, during his
            continuance
            in the world, can be limited only by the equal rights of others.
            There is in nature
            no such thing as
            a fee simple in land. There is on earth no power which can rightfully
            make a grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing men
            were to unite to grant away their equal rights, they could not grant
            away
            the right of those who follow them. For what are we but tenants for
            a day? Have we made the earth that we should determine the rights
            of
            those who after us shall tenant it in their turn? The Almighty, who
            created the earth for man and man for the earth, has entailed it
            upon all the generations of the children of men by a decree written
            upon the
            constitution of all things &#8212; a decree which no human action

<p>        HAS the first comer at a banquet the right to turn back all the chairs
            and claim that none of the other guests shall partake of the food
            provided, except as they make terms with him? Does the first man
            who presents a

            title, because (1st) there is no other natural right from which any
            other title can be derived, and (2nd) because the recognition of

        HERE are two simple principles, both of which are self-evident: <br>
        I.- That all men have equal rights to the use and enjoyment of the
            elements provided by nature. <br>
        II.- That each man has an exclusive right to the use and enjoyment
            of what is produced by his own labor. <br>
        There is no conflict between these principles. On the contrary they
            are correlative. To fully secure the individual right of property
            in the

        <br>
        NATURE acknowledges no ownership or control in man save as the result
            of exertion. In no other way can her treasures be drawn forth, her
            powers directed, or her forces utilized or controlled. She makes
          no discriminations
            among men,
            but is to all absolutely impartial. She knows no distinction between
            master and slave, king and subject, saint and sinner. All men to
          her stand upon an equal footing and have equal rights. She recognizes
          no
            claim but that of labor, and recognizes that without respect to the
            claimant. If a pirate spread his sails, the wind will fill them as
            well as it will fill those of a peaceful merchantman or missionary
            bark; if
            a king and a common man be thrown overboard, neither can keep his
          head above the water except by swimming; birds will not come to be
          shot
            by the proprietor of the soil any quicker than they will come to

          utter
            disregard as to whether it is offered them by a good little boy who
            goes to Sunday school, or a bad little boy who plays truant; grain
            will grow only as the ground is prepared and the seed is sown; it
          is only
            at the call of labor that ore can be raised from the mine; the sun
            shines and the rain falls alike upon just and unjust. The laws of
          nature are
            the decrees of the Creator. There is written in them no recognition
            of any right save that of labor; and in them is written broadly and
            clearly the equal right of all men to the use and enjoyment of nature;
            to apply to her by their exertions, and to receive and possess her
            reward. Hence, as nature gives only to labor, the exertion of labor
            in production is the only title to exclusive possession. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

<p>PRIVATE property is not of one species, and moral sanction

  to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all
  of which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this

  HOW then is it that we are called deniers of the right of property? It
  is for the same reason that caused
  nine-tenths of the good people in the United States, north as well as

  property; the same reason that made even John Wesley look on a smuggler
  as a kind of robber, and on a custom-house seizer of other men's goods
  as a defender of law and order.&nbsp; Where violations of the right of
  property
  have been long&nbsp;
  sanctioned by custom and law, it is inevitable that those who really
  assert the right of property will at first be thought to deny it.&nbsp; For
  under such circumstances the idea of property becomes confused, and that is
  thought to be property which is in reality a violation of
  property. &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C10_The_Right_of_Property_and_the_Right_of_Taxation.htm">A

  ROBINSON CRUSOE, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose,
  however, that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe
  had welcomed him as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of
  Independence, an Emancipation Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment,
  and informed him that he was a free and independent citizen, entitled
  to vote and hold office; but had at the same time also informed him
  that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's) private and
  exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since Friday
  could not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if he
  lived at all he must live on the island, he would have been in one case
  as much a slave as in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would
  be equivalent of his ownership of Friday. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social Problems</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html"> &#8212; Chapter

  THEY no longer have to drive their slaves to work; want and the fear of
  want do that more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the
  trouble of looking out for their employment or hiring out their labor,
  or the expense of keeping them when they cannot work. That is thrown
  upon the slaves. The tribute that they still wring from labor seems
  like voluntary payment. In fact, they take it as their honest share of
  the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish the land! And they find

  IF the two young Englishmen I have spoken of had come over here and
  bought so many American citizens, they could not have got from them so
  much of the produce of labor as they now get by having bought land
  which American citizens are glad to be allowed to till for half the
  crop. And so, even if our laws permitted, it would be foolish for an
  English duke or marquis to come over here and contract for ten thousand
  American babies, born or to be born, in the expectation that when able
  to work he could get out of them a large return. For by purchasing or
  fencing in a million acres of land that cannot run away and do not need
  to be fed, clothed or educated, he can, in twenty or thirty years, have
  ten thousand full-grown Americans, ready to give him half of all that
  their labor can produce on his land for the privilege of supporting
  themselves and their families out of the other half. This gives him
  more of the produce of labor than he could exact from so many chattel
  slaves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter 25: The Robber

  OF the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon
  the same moral level, that which makes property of persons is more
  humane than that which results from making private property of land.
  The cruelties which are perpetrated under the system of chattel slavery
  are more striking and arouse more indignation because they are the
  conscious acts of individuals. But for the suffering of the poor under
  the more refined system no one in particular seems responsible. . . .
  But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
  the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings
  are overworked, are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness
  of life, are condemned to ignorance and brutishness, and to the
  infection of physical and moral disease; are driven to crime and
  suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities for which
  it seems that no one in particular is responsible. <br>
  <br>
  To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after day
  transpire unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization, it would be necessary
  to go back to ancient
  slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest in the New World, or to
  stories of the Middle passage. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

  THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with
  wherever society has reached a certain development, has resulted from
  the appropriation of land as individual property. It is the ownership
  of the soil that everywhere gives the ownership of the men that live
  upon it. It is slavery of this kind to which the enduring pyramids and
  the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear witness, and of the
  institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague tradition in the
  biblical story of the famine during which the Pharaoh purchased up the
  lands of the people. It was slavery of this kind to which, in the
  twilight of history, the conquerors of Greece reduced the original
  inhabitants of that peninsula, transforming them into helots by making
  them pay rent for their lands. It was the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
  or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient Italy
  from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered the
  world, into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation of
  the land as the absolute property of their chieftains which gradually
  turned the descendants of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish
  warriors into colonii and villains, and which changed the independent
  burghers of Sclavonic village communities into the boors of Russia and
  the serfs of Poland; which instituted the feudalism of China and Japan,
  as well as that of Europe, and which made the High Chiefs of Polynesia
  the all but absolute masters of their fellows. How it came to pass that
  the Aryan shepherds and warriors who, as comparative philology tells
  us, descended from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic race
  into the lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant and cringing
  Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse  which I have before quoted gives us a hint. The

  TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the
  midst of plenty, ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in
  democracy, weakness in strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a
  one-sided and unstable development, and you will find it something
  which this Hebrew statesman three thousand years ago perceived and
  guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause of the enslavement of
  the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement, the
  possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the
  whole people must live. He saw that to permit in land the same
  unqualified private ownership that by natural right attaches to the
  things produced by labor, would be inevitably to separate the people
  into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave labor &#8212; to
  make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
  forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates
  not for the need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways
  suited to his times and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>

  </span>
  THE poverty to which in advancing civilization great masses of men are
  condemned, is not the freedom from distraction and temptation which
  sages have sought and philosophers have praised: it is a degrading and
  embruting slavery, that cramps the higher nature, dulls the finer
  feelings, and drives men by its pain to acts which the brutes would
  refuse. It is into this helpless, hopeless poverty, that crushes
  manhood and destroys womanhood, that robs even childhood of its
  innocence and joy, that the working classes are being driven by a force
  which acts upon them like a resistless and unpitying machine. The
  Boston collar manufacturer who pays his girls two cents an hour may
  commiserate their condition, but he, as they, is governed by the law of
  competition, and cannot pay more and carry on his business, for exchange
  is not governed by sentiment. And so, through all intermediate
  gradations, up to those who receive the earnings of labor without
  return, in the rent of land, it is the inexorable laws of supply and
  demand, a power with which the individual can no more quarrel or
  dispute than with the winds and the tides, that seem to press down the
  lower classes into the slavery of want. <br>
  <br>
  But, in reality, the cause is that which always has, and always must
  result in slavery &#8212; the monopolization by some of what nature has designed
  for all. . . . Private ownership of land is the nether millstone. Material
  progress is the upper millstone.

<p>    IT is not in the relations of capital and labor; it is not in the
    pressure of population against subsistence that an explanation of the
    unequal development of our civilization is to be found. The great cause
    of inequality in the distribution of wealth is inequality in the
    ownership of land. The ownership of land is the great fundamental fact
    which ultimately determines the social, the political and,
    consequently, the intellectual and moral condition of a people. And
    it must be so. For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon
    which he must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor
    must be applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the
    products of the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or
    any of the forces of nature utilized, without the use of land or its
    products. On the land we are born, from it we live, to it we return
    again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the
    flower of the field. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp052.html"> &#8212; Book

    THERE is nothing strange or inexplicable in the phenomena that are now
    perplexing the world. It is not that material progress is not in itself
    a good, it is not that nature has called into being children for whom
    she has failed to provide; it is not that the Creator has left on
    natural laws a taint of injustice at which even the human mind revolts,
    that material progress brings such bitter fruits. That amid our highest
    civilization men faint and die with want is not due to the
    niggardliness of nature, but to the injustice of man. Vice and misery,
    poverty and pauperism, are not the legitimate results of increase of
    population and industrial development; they only follow increase of
    population and industrial development because land is treated as
    private property &#8212; they are the direct and necessary results of the
    violation of the supreme law of justice, involved in giving to some men the
    exclusive
    possession of that which

    IN the Old Testament we are told that, when the Israelites journeyed
    through the desert, they were hungered, and that God sent down out of
    the heavens &#8212; manna. There was enough for all of them, and they all took
    it and were relieved. But, supposing that desert had been held as
    private property, as the soil of Great Britain is held; as the soil
    even of our new states is being held. Supposing that one of the
    Israelites had a square mile, and another one had twenty square miles,
    and another one had a hundred square miles, and the great majority of
    the Israelites did not have enough to set the soles of their feet upon,
    which they could call their own &#8212; what would become of the manna? What
    good would it have done to the majority? Not a whit. Though God had
    sent down manna enough for all, that manna would have been the property
    of the landholders; they would have employed some of the others,
    perhaps, to gather it up in heaps for them, and would have sold it to
    the hungry brethren. Consider it: this purchase and sale of manna might
    have gone on until the majority of the Israelites had given up all they
    had, even to the clothes off their backs. What then? Well, then they
    would not have had anything left with which to buy manna, and the
    consequence would have been that while they went hungry the manna would
    be lying in great heaps, and the landowners would be complaining about
    the over-production of manna. There would have been a great harvest of
    manna and hungry people, just precisely the Phenomenon that we see
    today. &#8212; <a href="crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime of Poverty</a> <br>

    PROPERTY in land, like property in slaves, is essentially different
    from property in things that are the result of labor. Rob a man or a
    people of money, or goods, or cattle, and the robbery is finished there
    and then. The lapse of time does not, indeed, change wrong into
    right, but it obliterates the effects of the deed. That is done; it is
    over; and, unless it be very soon righted, it glides away into the
    past, with the men who were parties to it, so swiftly that nothing save
    omniscience can trace its effects; and in attempting to right it we
    would be in danger of doing fresh wrong. The past is forever beyond us.
    We can neither punish nor recompense the dead. But rob a people of the
    land on which they must live, and the robbery is continuous. It is a
    fresh robbery of every succeeding generation &#8212; a new robbery every
    year
    and every day; it is like the robbery which condemns to slavery the
    children of the slave.&nbsp; To apply to it the statute of limitations,
    to
    acknowledge for it the title of prescription, is not to condone the
    past; it is to legalese robbery in the present, to justify it in the
    future. &#8212; <a href="irish_land_question.html">The (Irish) Land Question</a> <br>

    MAN is driven by his instincts and needs to form society.
    Society, thus

    These needs and functions increase with social development, requiring

        THE way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production, and
        checking supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes
        upon rent cannot check supply. Therefore though a tax on rent compels
        the landowners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for
        the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of
        land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on speculation
        to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land values tends to
        increase the competition between owners, and thus to reduce the price
        of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

<p>NOT only do all economic considerations point to a tax on land

        as the proper source of public revenues; but so do all British

        is still nominally enforced in England, but being levied on a valuation
        made in the reign of William III, it amounts in reality to not much
        over a penny in the pound. With the abolition of indirect taxation this
        is the tax to which men would naturally turn. The resistance of
        landholders would bring up the question of title, and thus any movement
        which went so far as to propose the substitution of direct for indirect
        taxation must inevitably end in a demand for the restoration

        THE feudal system, which is not peculiar to Europe but seems to be the
        natural result of the conquest of a settled country by a race among
        whom equality and individuality are yet strong, clearly recognized,
        in theory at least, that the land belongs to society at large, not to
        the individual. Rude outcome of an age in which might stood for right
        as nearly as it ever can (for the idea of right is ineradicable from
        the human mind, and must in some shape show itself even in the
        association of pirates and robbers), the feudal system yet admitted in
        no one the uncontrolled and exclusive right to land. A fief was
        essentially a a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed obligation. The
        sovereign, theoretically the representative of the collective power and
        rights of the whole people, was in feudal view the only absolute owner
        of land. And though land was granted to individual possession, yet in
        its possession were involved duties, by which the enjoyer of its
        revenues was supposed to render back to the commonwealth an equivalent
        for the benefits which from the delegation of the common right he
        received. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

<p>THE abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long
          Parliament, ratified after the accession of Charles II, though simply
          an appropriation of public revenues by the feudal landowners, who
          thus got rid of the consideration on which they held the common
          property of the nation, and saddled it on the people at large in the
          taxation of all consumers, has been long characterized, and is still
          held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom. Yet
          here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of England.
          Had the form of these feudal dues been simply changed into one better
          adapted to the changed times, English wars need never have occasioned
          the incurring of debt to the amount of a  single pound, and the labor
          and capital of England need not have been taxed a single farthing for
          the maintenance
          of
          a military
          establishment. All this would have come from rent, which the
          landholders since that time have appropriated to themselves &#8212; from
          the tax which land ownership levies on the earnings of labor and capital.
          The landholders of England got their land on terms which required them
          even in the sparse population of Norman days to put in the field, upon
          call, sixty thousand perfectly equipped horsemen, and on the further
          condition of various fines and incidents which amounted to a
          considerable part of the rent. It would probably be a low estimate
          to put the pecuniary value of these various services and dues at one-half
          the rental value of the land. Had the landholders been kept to this
          contract and no land been permitted to be inclosed except upon
          similar terms, the income accruing to the nation from English land
          would today be greater by many millions than the entire public
          revenues of the United Kingdom. England today might have enjoyed
          absolute free trade. There need not have been a customs duty, an
          excise, license or income tax, yet all the present expenditures could
          be met, and a large surplus remain to be devoted to any purpose which
          would conduce to the comfort or well-being of the whole people. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html">Progress &amp;Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp074.html"> &#8212; Book

        MANY landholders are laborers of one sort or another. And it would
          be
          hard to find a landowner not a laborer, who is not also a capitalist &#8212; while
          the general rule is, that the larger the landowner the greater the
          capitalist. So true is this that in common thought the characters
          are confounded. Thus, to put all taxes on the value of land, while
          it would be to largely reduce all great fortunes, would in no case

          the rich man penniless. The Duke of Westminster, who owns a
          considerable part of the site of London, is probably the richest

          largely reduce his enormous income, but would still leave him his

          by any possibility enjoy, and a much better state of society in which

        <br>
    THE existence of private property in land is a great social wrong
            from which society at large suffers and of which the very rich and
            the very poor are alike victims, though at the opposite extremes. <br>
        <br>
        Seeing this, it seems to us like a violation of Christian charity
            to speak of the rich as though they individually were responsible
            for
            the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while you do this, you insist that
            the
            cause of monstrous wealth and degrading poverty shall not be touched.
            Here is a man with a disfiguring and dangerous excrescence. One
            physician would kindly, gently, but firmly remove it. Another insists
            that it shall not be removed, but at the same time holds up the poor
            victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right- ? &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

          </span> THE evil is not in wealth in itself &#8212; in its
                  command over material things; it is in the possession of wealth
                  while others
            are steeped
            in
            poverty; in being raised above touch with the life of humanity, from
            its work and its struggles, its hopes and its fears, and above all,
            from the love that sweetens life, and the kindly sympathies and
            generous acts that strengthen faith in man and trust in God. Consider
            how the rich see the meaner side of human nature; how they are
            surrounded by flatterers and sycophants; how they find ready
            instruments not only to gratify vicious impulses, but to prompt and
            stimulate them; how they must constantly be on guard lest they be
            swindled; how often they must suspect an ulterior motive behind kindly
            deed or friendly word; how, if they try to be generous, they are
                  beset by shameless beggars and scheming impostors; how often
                  the family
            affections are chilled for them, and their deaths anticipated with
            the ill-concealed joy of expectant possession. The worst evil of
                  poverty is not in the want of material things, but in the stunting
                  and distortion
            of the higher qualities. So, though in another way, the possession
            of
            unearned wealth likewise stunts and distorts what is noblest in man. <br>
        <br>
        God's commands cannot be evaded with impunity. If it be God's command
            that men shall earn their bread by labor, the idle rich must suffer.
            And they do. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition

        <br>
        IT seems to me that in a condition of society in which no one need
            fear poverty, no one would desire great wealth &#8212; at least no
            one would take the trouble to strive and to strain for it as men
            do now. For,
            certainly, the spectacle of men who have only a few years to live,
            slaving away their time for the sake of dying rich, is in itself
            so unnatural and absurd, that in a state of society where the abolition
            of the fear of want had dissipated the envious admiration with which
            the
            masses of men now regard the possession of great riches, whoever
            would
            toil to acquire more than he cared to use would be looked upon as
            we would now look on a man who would thatch his head with half a
            dozen
            hats, or walk around in the hot sun with an overcoat on. When everyone
            is sure of being able to get enough, no one will care to make a
            packhorse of himself. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp092.html"> &#8212; Book

        MEN instinctively admire virtue and truth, but the sting of want
            and the fear of want make them even more strongly admire the rich
            and
            sympathize with the fortunate. It is well to be honest and just,
            and men will commend it; but he who by fraud and injustice gets him
            a
            million dollars will have more respect and admiration and influence,
            more eye service and lip service, if not heart service, than he who
            refuses it. The one may have his reward in the future; he may know
            that his name is writ in the Book of Life, and that for him is the

            robe and the palm branch of the victor against temptation; but the

            of "our substantial
            citizens;" he
            has the courtship of men and the flattery of women; the best pew
            in the church and the personal regard
            of the eloquent clergyman, who in the name of Christ preaches the
            Gospel of Dives, and tones down into a meaningless flower of. eastern
            speech the stern metaphor of the camel and the needle's eye. He may
            be a patron of arts, a Maecenas to men of letters; may profit by
            the converse of the intelligent, and be polished by the attrition
            of the
            refined. His alms may feed the poor, and help the struggling, and
            bring sunshine into desolate places; and noble public institutions

"THE poor ye have always with you." If ever a scripture has been
            wrested to the devil's service, this is that scripture. How often have
            these words been distorted from their obvious meaning to soothe
            conscience into acquiescence in human misery and degradation &#8212; to
            bolster
            that blasphemy, the very negation and denial of Christ's teachings,
            that the All Wise and Most Merciful, the Infinite Father, has decreed
            that so many of His creatures must be poor&nbsp; in order that others
            of His creatures to whom He wills the good things of life should enjoy
            the please and virtue of doling out alms!&nbsp; "The poor ye have
            always with you," said Christ; but all His teachings supply the
            limitation, "until the coming of the Kingdom."&nbsp; In that kingdom
            of God <span style="font-style: italic;">on earth</span>, that kingdom
            of justice and love for which He taught His followers to strive and
            pray, there will
            be no poor. &#8212;<a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp08.html"> Social
            Problems &#8212; Chapter 8: That We All Might Be Rich.</a><br>
        <br>
        WE naturally despise poverty; and it is reasonable that we should.
            I do not say &#8212; I distinctly repudiate it &#8212; that the people
            who are poor
            are poor always from their own fault, or even in most cases; but
            it ought to be so. If any good man or woman had the power to create
            a
            world, it
            would be a sort of a world in which no one would be poor unless he
            was lazy or vicious. But that is just precisely the kind of a world
            that
            this is; that is just precisely, the kind of a world that the Creator
            has made. Nature gives to labor, and to labor alone; there must be
            human work before any article of wealth can be produced; and, in
            a natural state of things, the man who toiled honestly and well would
            be the rich
            man, and he
            who did not work would be poor. We have
            so reversed the order of nature, that we are accustomed to think
            of
            a working-man as a poor man. &#8212; <a href="crime_of_poverty.html">The
            Crime of Poverty</a> <br>
        <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Rich<a name="Rich"></a>" and "Poor" Defined</span><br>
        <br>
        BUT is there not some line the recognition of which will enable us
            to say with something like scientific precision that this man is
            rich and that man is poor; some line of possession which will enable
            us
            truly to distinguish between rich and poor in all places and conditions
            of society; a line of the natural mean or normal possession, below
            which in varying degrees is poverty, and above which in varying degrees
            is wealthiness? It seems to me that there must be. And if we stop
            to think of it, we may see that there is. If we set aside for the
            moment
            the narrower economic meaning of service, by which direct service
            is conveniently distinguished from the indirect service embodied
            in
            wealth, we may resolve all the things which directly or indirectly
            satisfy human desire into one term service, just as we resolve
            fractions into a common denominator. Now is there not a natural or
            normal line of the possession or enjoyment of service? Clearly there
            is. It is that of equality between giving and receiving. This is
            the equilibrium which Confucius expressed in the golden word of his
            teaching that in English we translate into "reciprocity."&nbsp;
        Naturally
            the services which a member of a human society is entitled to receive
            from other members are the equivalents of those he renders to others.
            Here is the normal line from which what we call wealthiness and what
        we call poverty take their start. He who can command more service than
        he
            need render, is rich. He is poor, who can command less service than
        he does render or is willing to render: for in our civilization of
            today we must take note of the monstrous fact that men willing to
        work cannot always find opportunity to work. The one has more than he
        ought
            to have; the other has less. Rich and poor are thus correlatives
        of each other; the existence of a class of rich involves
            the existence of a class of poor, and the reverse; and abnormal luxury
            on the one side and abnormal want on the other have a relation of
            necessary sequence. To
            put this relation into terms of morals, the rich are the robbers,
        since they are at least sharers in the proceeds of robbery; and the poor
        are
            the robbed. This is the reason, I take it, why Christ, Who was not
            really a man of such reckless speech as some Christians deem Him
        to have been, always expressed sympathy with the poor and repugnance
        of
            the rich. In His philosophy it was better even to be robbed than
        to rob. In the kingdom of right doing which He preached, rich and poor
            would be impossible, because rich and poor in the true sense are
        the
            results of wrong-doing. And when He said, "It is easier for a camel
            to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter
            the
            kingdom of heaven," He simply put in the emphatic form of Eastern
            metaphor a statement of fact as coldly true as the statement that
            two parallel lines can never meet. Injustice cannot live where justice
            rules, and even if the man himself might get through, his riches &#8212; his
            power of compelling service without rendering service &#8212; must
            of necessity
            be left behind. If there can be no poor in the kingdom of heaven,
            clearly there can be no rich. And so it is utterly impossible in
            this, or in any other conceivable world, to abolish unjust poverty,
            without
            at the same time abolishing unjust possessions. This is a hard word
            to the softly amiable philanthropists, who, to speak metaphorically,
            would
            like to get on the good side of God without angering the devil. But
            it is a true word nevertheless. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political

            Else
            he could never have written this sentence: "The land of Ireland,
            the land of every country, belongs to the
            people of that country. The individuals called landowners have no
            right in morality and justice to anything but the rent, or compensation
            for its salable value." <br>
        <br>
        In the name of the Prophet &#8212; figs! If the land of any country
            belong to the people of that country, what right, in morality and
            justice, have
            the individuals called landowners to the rent? If the land belong
            to the people, why in the name of morality and justice should the

            pay its salable value for their own? <br>

        Herbert Spencer says: "Had we to deal with the parties who originally
            robbed the human race of its heritage, we might make short work of
        the matter?" Why not make short work of the matter anyhow? For this robbery
            is not like the robbery of a horse or a sum of money, that ceases
            with the act. It is a fresh and continuous robbery, that goes on
            every day
            and every hour. It is not from the produce of the past that rent
            is drawn; it is from the produce of the present. It is a toll levied
            upon
            labor constantly and continuously. Every blow of the hammer, every
            stroke of the pick, every thrust of the shuttle, every throb of the
            steam engine pay it tribute. It levies upon the earnings of the men
            who, deep underground, risk their lives, and of those who over white
            surges hang to reeling masts; it claims the just reward of the
            capitalist and the fruits of the inventor's patient effort; it takes
            little children from play and from school, and compels them to work
            before their bones are hard or their muscles are firm; it robs the
            shivering of warmth; the hungry, of food; the sick, of medicine;
            the anxious, of peace. It debases, and embrutes, and embitters. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp073.html">Progress

          expectation of war. If it
            open a shorter highway, is it morally bound to compensate those who
            may lose by the diversion of travel from the old one? If it promote
          the discovery of a cheap means of producing electricity directly from
          heat,
            is it morally bound to compensate the owners of all the steam engines
            thereby thrown out of use and all who are engaged in making them?
          If

        Yet the contention we are considering is worse. It is that the State

        COMPENSATION implies equivalence. To compensate for the
            discontinuance of a wrong is to give those who profit by the wrong
            the pecuniary equivalent of its continuance. Now the State has nothing
            that does not belong to the individuals who compose it. What it gives
            to some it must take from others. Abolition with compensation is
            therefore not really abolition, but continuance under a different
            form &#8212; on one side of unjust deprivation, and on the other side of unjust
            appropriation.  &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

        WHEN a man exchanges property of one kind for property of another
            kind he gives up the one with all its incidents and takes in its
            stead the
            other with its incidents. He cannot sell bricks and buy hay, and
            then complain because the hay burned when the bricks would not. The
            greater
            liability of the hay to burn is one of the incidents he accepted
            in buying it. Nor can he exchange property having moral sanction
            for
            property having only legal sanction, and claim that the moral sanction
            of the thing he sold attaches now to the thing he bought. That has
            gone with the thing to the other party in the exchange. Exchange
            transfers, it cannot create. Each party gives&nbsp;up
            what right he had and takes what right the other party had. The last
            holder obtains no moral right that the first holder did not have. &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

"CAVEAT emptor" is the maxim of the law &#8212; "Let
            the buyer beware!" If
            a man buys a structure in which the law of gravity is disregarded
            or mechanical laws
            ignored, he takes the risk of those laws asserting their sway. And
            so he takes the risk in buying property which contravenes the moral
            law.
            When he ignores the moral sense, when he gambles on the continuance
            of a wrong, and when at last the general conscience rises to the
            point of
            refusing to continue that wrong, can he then claim that those who
            have refrained from taking part in it, those who have suffered from
            it,
            those who have borne the burden and heat and contumely of first moving
            against it, shall share in his losses on the ground that as members
            of the same state they are equally responsible for it? And must not
            the
            acceptance of this impudent plea tend to prevent that gradual weakening
            and dying out of the wrong, which would otherwise occur as the rise
            of the moral sense against it lessened the prospect of its continuance;
            and by promise of insurance to investors tend to maintain it in
            strength and energy till the last minute? &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

        ALL pleas for compensation on the abolition of unequal rights to
            land are excuses for avoiding right and continuing wrong; they all,
            as fully
            as the original wrong, deny that equalness which is the essential
            of justice. Where they have seemed plausible to any honestly-minded
            man,
            he will, if he really examines his thought, see that this has been
            so because he has, though perhaps unconsciously, entertained a sympathy
            for those who seem to profit by injustice which he has refused to
            those who have been injured by it. He has been thinking of the few
            whose
            incomes would be cut off by the restoration of equal right. He has
            forgotten the many, who are being impoverished, degraded, and driven
            out of life by its denial. If he once breaks through the tyranny
            of accustomed
            ideas and
            truly realizes that all men are equally entitled to the use of the
            natural opportunities for the living of their lives and the development
            of their powers, he will see the injustice, the wickedness, of
            demanding compensation for the abolition of the monopoly of land.
            He will see that if anyone is to be compensated on the abolition
            of a
            wrong, it is those who have suffered by the wrong, not those who
            have profited by it. &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C11_Compensation.htm">A

        JUSTICE in men's mouths is cringingly humble when she first
                  begins a protest against a time-honored wrong, and we of the
                  English-speaking
            nations still wear the collar of the Saxon thrall, and have been
            educated to look upon the "vested rights" of landowners with all
            the superstitious reverence that ancient Egyptians looked upon the
            crocodile. But when the times are ripe for them, ideas grow, even
            though insignificant in their first appearance. One day, the Third
            Estate covered their heads when the king put on his hat. A little
            while
            thereafter, and the head of a son of St. Louis rolled from the scaffold.
            The anti-slavery movement in the United States commenced with talk
            of compensating owners, but when four millions of slaves were emancipated,
            the owners got no compensation, nor did they clamor for any. And
            by the time the people of any such country as England or the United
            States
            are sufficiently aroused to the injustice and disadvantages of
            individual ownership of land to induce them to attempt its
            nationalization, they will be sufficiently aroused to nationalize
            it in a much more direct and easy way than by purchase. They will

<p>IT requires reflection to see that manifold effects result from a
              single cause, and that the remedy for a multitude of evils may
  lie in one simple reform. As in the infancy of medicine, men were disposed
              to
              think each distinct symptom called for a distinct remedy, so when
              thought begins to turn to social subjects there is a disposition
              to seek a special cure for every ill, or else (another form of
  the same
              short-sightedness) to imagine the only adequate remedy to be something
              which presupposes the absence of those ills; as, for instance,
  that all men should be good, as the cure for vice and crime; or that all
              men
              should be provided for by the State, as the cure for poverty. &#8212;

        The Single Tax<a name="thesingletax"></a> </span><br>
        <br>
        TO abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every
              wheel of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would
            be like removing an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued
          with fresh energy, production would start into new life, and trade
          would
              receive a stimulus which would be felt to the remotest arteries.
            The
              present method of taxation operates upon exchange like artificial
              deserts and mountains; it costs more to get goods through a custom
              house than it does to carry them around the world. It operates
          upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a fine upon
          those
              qualities. If I have worked harder and built myself a good house
            while you have been contented to live in a hovel, the tax-gatherer
            now comes
              annually to make me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by
            taxing me more than you. If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct,
            while
              you are exempt. If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity,
              as though he had done an injury to the state; if a railroad be
              opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though it were
          a public nuisance; if a manufactory be erected, we levy upon it an
            annual sum which would go far towards making a handsome profit. We
            say we
              want capital, but if anyone accumulate it, or bring it among us,
            we charge
              him for it as though we were giving him a privilege. We punish
          with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening grain; we
          fine
              him
              who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp091.html">Progress

        AND will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose
            that lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox
            that
            treadeth out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and
            skill, their natural reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to
            the community also a natural reward. The law of society is, each
            for all,
            as well as all for each. No one can keep to himself the good he may
            do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive enterprise,
            besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
            advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that
            he gathers the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his
            gain,
            there is a gain to the whole community. Others than the owner are
            benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters
            fly far and wide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone
            on his field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance,
            it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building
            of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides
            those who get the direct profits. Nature laughs at a miser. He is
            like the squirrel who buries his nuts and refrains from digging them
            up
            again. Lo! they sprout and grow into trees. In fine linen, steeped
            in costly spices, the mummy is laid away. Thousands and thousands
            of years
            thereafter, the Bedouin cooks his food by a fire of its encasings,
            it generates the steam by which the traveler is whirled on his way,
            or it
            passes into far-off lands to gratify the curiosity of another race.

<p>CONSIDER the effect of such a change upon the labor market.
            Competition would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers
            competing with each other for employment, and in their competition
            cutting down wages to the point of bare subsistence, employers would
            everywhere be competing for laborers, and wages would rise to the
            fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market would have entered
            the
            greatest of all competitors for the employment of labor, a competitor
            whose demand

            satisfied &#8212; the demand of labor itself. The employers of labor
            would not have merely to bid against other employers, all feeling
            the stimulus of greater trade and increased profits, but against
            the
            ability of laborers to become their own employers upon the natural
            opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented

              the master motive of human action. It is blind to facts of which
              the
              world is full. It sees not the present, and reads not the past
              aright. If
              you would move men to action, to what shall you appeal? Not to
              their pockets, but to their patriotism; not to selfishness but
              to sympathy.
              Self-interest is, as it were, a mechanical force &#8212; potent, it is true;
              capable of large and wide results. But there is in human nature what
              may be likened to a chemical force; which melts and fuses and overwhelms; to
              which nothing seems impossible. "All
              that a man hath will he give for his life" &#8212; that is self-interest.
              But in loyalty to higher impulses men will give even life. <br>
        <br>
        It is not selfishness that enriches the annals of every people
              with heroes and saints. It is not selfishness that on every page
              of the
              world's history; bursts out in sudden splendor of noble deeds or
              sheds the soft radiance of benignant lives. It was not selfishness
              that
              turned Gautama's back to his royal home or bade the Maid of Orleans
              lift the sword from the altar; that held the Three Hundred in the
              Pass of Thermopylae, or gathered into Winkelried's bosom the sheaf
              of
              spears; that chained Vincent de Paul to the bench of the galley,
              or brought little starving children during the Indian famine tottering
              to the relief stations with yet weaker starvelings in their arms!
              Call
              it
              religion, patriotism, sympathy, the enthusiasm for humanity, or
              the love of God &#8212; give it what name you will; there is yet a force which
              overcomes and drives out selfishness; a force which is the electricity
              of the moral universe; a force beside which all others are weak.
              Everywhere that men have lived it has shown its power, and today, as
              ever, the world is full of it. To be pitied is the man who has never
              seen and never felt it. Look around! among common men and women, amid
              the care and the struggle of daily life in the jar of the noisy street
              and amid the squalor where want hides &#8212; everywhere, and there is the
              darkness lighted with the tremulous play of its lambent flames. He who
              has not seen it has walked with shut eyes. He who looks may see, as
              says Plutarch, that "the soul has a principle of kindness in itself,
              and is born to love, as well as to perceive, think, or remember." <br>
        <br>
        And this force of forces &#8212; that now goes to waste or assumes perverted
              forms &#8212; we may use for the strengthening and building up
              and ennobling of
              society, if we but will, just as we now use physical forces that
              once seemed but powers of destruction. All we have to do is but
              to give
              it freedom and scope. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp094.html"> &#8212; Book

        THE efficiency of labor always increases with the habitual wages
              of labor &#8212; for high wages mean increased self-respect, intelligence,
              hope and energy. Man is not a machine, that will do so much and no
              more; he
              is not an animal, whose powers may reach thus far and no further.
              It is mind, not muscle, which is the great agent of production. The
              physical
              power evolved in the human frame is one of the weakest of forces,
              but for the human intelligence the resistless currents of nature
              flow, and
              matter becomes plastic to the human will. To increase the comforts,
              and leisure, and independence of the masses is to increase their
              intelligence; it is to bring the brain to the aid of the hand; it
              is to engage in the common work of life the faculty which measures

<p>OUT upon nature, in upon
            him himself, back through the mists that shroud the past, forward
            into
            the darkness
            that overhangs the future,
            turns the restless desire that arises when the animal wants slumber
            in satisfaction. Beneath things he seeks the law; he would know how
            the
            globe was forged, and the stars were hung, and trace to their sources
            the springs of life. And then, as the man develops his nobler nature,
            there arises the desire higher yet &#8212; the passion of passions, the hope
            of
            hopes &#8212; the desire that he, even he, may somehow aid in making
            life better and brighter, in destroying want and sin, sorrow and
            shame. He
            masters and curbs the animal; he turns his back upon the feast and
            renounces the place of power; he leaves it to others to accumulate
            wealth, to gratify pleasant tastes, to bask themselves in the warm
            sunshine of the brief day. He works for those he never saw and never
            can see; for a fame, or it may be but for a scant justice, that can
            only come long after the clods have rattled upon his coffin lid.
            He toils in the advance, where it is cold, and there is little cheer
            from
            men, and the stones are sharp and the brambles thick. <br>
        <br>
        Amid the scoffs of the present and the sneers that stab like knives,
            he builds for the future; he cuts the trail that progressive humanity
            may
            hereafter broaden into a highroad. Into higher, grander spheres desire
            mounts and beckons, and a star that rises in the east leads him on.

        To compare society to a boat.&nbsp; Her progress through the water
            will not depend upon the exertion of her crew, but upon the exertion
            devoted
            to
            propelling her. This will be lessened by any expenditure of force
            required for baling, or any expenditure of force in fighting among
            themselves or in pulling in different directions. <br>
        <br>
        Now, as in a separated state the whole powers of man are required
            to maintain existence, and mental power is only set free for higher
            uses
            by the association of men in communities, which permits the division
            of labor and all the economies which come with the co-operation of
            increased numbers, association is the first essential of progress.
            Improvement becomes possible as men come together in peaceful
            association, and the wider and closer the association, the greater
            the possibilities of improvement. And as the wasteful expenditure
            of mental
            power in conflict becomes greater or less as the moral law which
            accords to each an equality of rights is ignored or is recognized,
            equality (or justice) is the second essential of progress. <br>
        <br>
        Thus association in equality is the law of progress. Association
            frees mental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality (or
            justice,
            or freedom &#8212; for the terms here signify the same thing, the
            recognition of the moral law) prevents the dissipation of this power

<p>THE poverty which in the midst of abundance pinches and embrutes
            men, and all the manifold evils which flow from it, spring from a
            denial

            justice &#8212; for, so far as we can see, when we view things upon
            a large scale, justice seems to be the supreme law of the universe.

            based on justice, and include justice, and be reached through justice.
            It is not by accident that, in the Hebraic religious development
                  which through Christianity we have inherited, the declaration, "The
                  Lord thy God is a just God," precedes the sweeter revelation
                  of a God of Love. Until the eternal justice is perceived, the

        WE see that God in His dealings with men has not been a bungler or
            a
            niggard; that He has not brought too many men into the world; that
            He has not neglected abundantly to supply them; that He has not intended
            that bitter competition of the masses for a mere animal existence,
            and
            that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterizes our
            civilization; but that these evils, which lead so many to say there
            is no God,
            or yet more impiously to say that they are of God's ordering, are
          due to our denial of His moral law. We see that the law of justice,
          the
            law of the Golden
            Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed the law of
          social life. We see that, if we were only to observe it, there would
          be work
            for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization
            would tend to give to the poorest not only necessaries, but all
            comforts and reasonable luxuries as well. We see that Christ was
          not a mere dreamer when He told men that, if they would seek the kingdom
            of
            God and its right doing, they might no more worry about material
          things
            than do the lilies of the field about their raiment; but that He
          was only declaring what political economy, in the light of modern

        <br>
        NEAR nineteen hundred years ago, when another civilization was
            developing monstrous inequalities, when the masses everywhere were
            being ground into hopeless slavery, there arose in a Jewish village
            an unlearned carpenter, who, scorning the orthodoxies and ritualisms
            of
            the time, preached to laborers and fishermen the gospel of the
            Fatherhood of God, of the equality and brotherhood of men, who taught
            His disciples to pray for the coming of the kingdom of heaven on
          earth. The college professors sneered at Him, the orthodox preachers
          denounced
            Him. He was reviled as a dreamer, as a disturber, as a "communist," and,
            finally, organized society took the alarm, and He was crucified between
            two thieves.
            But the word went forth, and, spread by fugitives
            and slaves, made its way against power and against persecution till
            it revolutionized the world, and out of the rotting old civilization
            brought the germ of the new. Then the privileged classes rallied
            again, carved the effigy of the man of the people in the courts and
            on the
            tombs of kings, in His name consecrated inequality, and wrested His
            gospel to the defense of social injustice. But again the same great
            ideas of a common fatherhood, of a common brotherhood, of a social
            state in which none shall be overworked and none shall want, begin
            to

            a

            which, amid the blasts of passion, the aberrations of greed and the
            delusions of a short-sighted expediency men may safely steer? What is
            the use of a religion that stands palsied and paltering in the face of

            whatever it may promise for the next world can do nothing to prevent

            would never have encountered the Roman persecutions; else it would
            never have swept the Roman world. The skeptical masters of Rome,
            tolerant of all gods, careless of what they deemed vulgar
            superstitions, were keenly sensitive to a doctrine based on equal
            rights; they feared instinctively a religion that inspired slave and
            proletarian with a new hope; that took for its central figure a

        </span> WE honor Liberty in name and in form. We set up her
                  statues and sound her praises. But we have not fully trusted
                  her. And with
            our growth
            so
            grow her demands. She will have no half service! <br>
        <br>
        Liberty! it is a word to conjure with, not to vex the ear in empty
            boastings. For liberty means justice, and justice is the natural
            law &#8212; the law of health and symmetry and strength, of fraternity and
            co-operation. They who look upon liberty as having accomplished her
            mission when she has abolished hereditary privileges and given men the ballot,
            who think of her as having no further relations to the everyday affairs of life,
            have not seen her real
            grandeur &#8212; to them the poets who have sung of her must seem
            rhapsodists, and her martyrs fools! As the sun is the lord of life
            as well as of
            light; as his beams not merely pierce the clouds, but support all
            growth, supply all motion, and call forth from what would otherwise
            be a cold and inert mass, all the infinite diversities of being and
            beauty, so is liberty to mankind. It is not for an abstraction that
            men
            have toiled and died; that in every age the witnesses of Liberty
            have stood forth, and the martyrs of Liberty have suffered. Only
            in broken
            gleems and partial light has the sun of Liberty yet beamed among
            men, but all progress hath she called forth. Liberty came to a race
            of
            slaves crouching under Egyptian whips, and led them forth from the
            House of Bondage. She hardened them in the desert and made of them
            a race of conquerors. The free spirit of the Mosaic law took
            their thinkers up to heights where they beheld the unity of God,
            and inspired their poets with strains that yet phrase the highest
            exaltations of thought. Liberty dawned on the Phoenician coast, and
            ships passed the Pillars of Hercules to plough the unknown sea. She
            shed a partial light on Greece, and marble grew to shapes of ideal
            beauty, words became the instruments of subtlest thought, and against
            the scanty militia of free cities the countless hosts of the Great
            King broke like surges against a rock. She cast her beams on the
            four-acre
            farms of Italian husbandmen, and born of her strength a power came
            forth that conquered the world. They glinted from shields of German
            warriors, and Augustus wept for his legions. Out of the night that
            followed her eclipse, her slanting rays fell again on free cities,
            and
            a lost learning revived, modem civilization began, a new world was
            unveiled; and as Liberty grew, so grew art, wealth, power, knowledge,
            and refinement. In the history of every nation we may read the same
            truth. It was the strength born of Magna Charta that won Crecy and
            Agincourt. It was the revival of Liberty from the despotism of the
            Tudors that glorified
            the
            Elizabethan age. It was the spirit that brought a crowned tyrant
            to the block that planted here the seed of a mighty tree. It was
            the energy
            of ancient freedom that, the moment it had gained unity, made Spain
            the
            mightiest power of the world, only to fall to the lowest depth of
            weakness when tyranny succeeded liberty. See, in France, all
            intellectual vigor dying under the tyranny of the Seventeenth Century
            to revive in splendor as Liberty awoke in the Eighteenth, and on
            the enfranchisement of French peasants in the Great Revolution basing
            the
            wonderful strength that has in our time defied defeat. <br>
        <br>
        Shall we not trust her? In our time, as in times before, creep on
            the insidious forces that, producing inequality, destroy Liberty.
            On the
            horizon the clouds begin to lower. Liberty calls to us again. We
            must follow her further; we must trust her fully. Either we must
            wholly
            accept her or she will not stay. It is not enough that men should
            vote; it is not enough that they should be theoretically equal before
            the
            law. They must have liberty to avail themselves of the opportunities
            and means of life; they must stand on equal terms with reference
            to the bounty of nature. Either this, or Liberty withdraws her light!
            Either
            this, or darkness comes on, and the very forces that progress has
            evolved turn to powers that work destruction. This is the universal
            law. This is the lesson of the centuries. Unless its foundations
            be
            laid in justice, the social structure cannot stand. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp105.html"> &#8212; Book

            the place of the jealousy and fear that now array men against each

            comfort and leisure; and who shall measure the heights to which our
            civilization may soar? Words fail the thought! It is the Golden Age
            of which poets have sung and high-raised seers have told in metaphor!
            It
            is the glorious vision which has always haunted man with gleams of
            fitful splendor. It is what he saw whose eyes at Patmos were closed

        TO begin and maintain great popular movements, it is the moral
                sense rather than the Intellect that must be appealed to, sympathy
                rather
            than self-interest. For however it may be with any individual, the
            sense of justice is with the masses of men keener and truer than
            intellectual perception, and unless a question can assume the form
            of right and wrong it cannot provoke general discussion and excite
            the
            many to action. And while material gain or loss impresses us less
            vividly the greater the number of those we share it with, the power
            of sympathy increases as it spreads from man to man &#8212; becomes
            cumulative and contagious. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

        </span> I DO not wish to call upon those my voice may reach to demand
            their own rights, so much as to call upon them to secure the rights
            of others
            more helpless. I believe that the idea of duty is more potent for
            social improvement than the idea of interest; that in sympathy is
          a stronger social force than in selfishness. I believe that any great
            social improvement must spring from, and be animated by, that spirit
            which seeks to make life better, nobler, happier for others, rather
            than by that spirit which only seeks more enjoyment for itself. For
            the Mammon of Injustice can always buy the selfish whenever it may
            think
            it worth while

        IN the idea of the Incarnation &#8212; of the God voluntarily descending
        to the help of men, which is embodied not merely in Christianity, but
        in
            other great religions &#8212; lies, I sometimes think, a deeper truth
            than perhaps even the Churches teach. This is certain, that the deliverers,
            the liberators, the advancers of humanity, have always been those
            who were moved by the sight of injustice and misery rather than those
            spurred by their own suffering. As it was a Moses, learned in all
            the
            lore of the Egyptians, and free to the Court of Pharaoh, and not
            a tasked slave, forced to make bricks without straw, who led the
            Children
            of Israel from the House of Bondage: as it was the Gracchi, of
            patrician blood and fortune, who struggled to the death against the
            land-grabbing system which finally destroyed Rome, so has it always
            been that the oppressed, the degraded, the down-trodden have been
            freed and elevated rather by the efforts and the sacrifices of those
            to
            whom fortune had been more kind than by their own strength. For the
            more fully men have been deprived of their natural rights, the less
            their power to regain them. The more men need help, the less can
            they help themselves. &#8212; <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp09.html">Social

        BUT it is in example as in deed that such lives are helpful. It is
            thus that they dignify human nature and glorify human effort, and
            bring to
            those who struggle hope and trust. The life of Moses, like the
            institutions of Moses, is a protest against that blasphemous doctrine,
            current now as it was three thousand years ago; that blasphemous
            doctrine preached ofttimes even from Christian pulpits; that the
            want and suffering of the masses of mankind flow from a mysterious
            dispensation of providence, which we may lament, but can neither
            quarrel with nor alter. Let him who hugs that doctrine to himself,

            civilization abound are not his affair, turn to the example of that

            this? One thing, and only one thing, is absolutely certain for every

            and that we, in taking part in it, are doing something in our humble

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">HENRY GEORGE </span></p>
Henry George, American economist (1839-1897) was born in Philadelphia
on the eastern seaboard of the United States of America amid a built-up
economy. His family had been American for several generations but was
of English, Scottish and Welsh descent. <br>
<br>
When a youth, Henry George made a voyage as a deckhand during which
the ship circumnavigated the earth, visiting Melbourne and Calcutta. At
the age of 19, he voyaged from the eastern seaboard to the western
seaboard of the American continent, via the Strait of Magellan, and
undoubtedly it was the change from an established to a growing economy
which gave him the insight into political economy not shown by other
economists of the nineteenth century. <br>
<br>
In California, he became a printer, editor and journalist, and after
writing <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>, Henry George took an editorship in New
York and by this time he was world-renowned as an author and orator. He
lectured in England, Scotland and Ireland, Paris and South and Western
Australia during his later life. <br>
<br>
Henry George divided government into two parts (a) political and (b)
social. Political government would today consist of the defense of the
realm and the sea and airways; maintenance of a civil police force and
the courts of justice, and suchlike matters, and would be kept at the
minimum necessary to maintain the common right of the public and the
right of the individual to the enjoyment of the Sovereign's peace
under the law of the land. <br><br>
Social government would concern itself with doing on a collective basis
only the things which it is not practicable for the individual to do,
such as irrigation, drainage, trunk roads, etc. <br><br>
Henry George recognized that the ability of an economic unit such as
the United Kingdom to raise taxation is not something dependent only
upon national economic growth but upon its exchanges with the rest of
the world. Thus traders in London by their exchanges are increasing
taxation potential (the wealth producing capacities of land) in New
Zealand and traders in New Zealand are increasing taxation potential in
the United Kingdom. <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
As, when we find that a machine will not work, we infer that in its
construction some law of physics has been ignored or defied, so, when
we find social disease and political evils, may we infer that in the
organization of society moral law has been defied and the natural
rights of men have been ignored. <br>
<br>
THAT we should do unto others as we would have them do to us &#8212; that we
should respect the rights of others as scrupulously as we would have
our own rights respected, is not a mere counsel of perfection to
individuals, but it is the law to which we must conform social
institutions and national policy if we would secure the blessings of
abundance and peace.  &#8212; Social Problems, Chapter 10<br>
