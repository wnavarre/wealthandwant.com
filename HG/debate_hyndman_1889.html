<center> 
<b>The Great Debate: The Single Tax versus Social
Democracy --<br>
Which will most benefit the
people?</b>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> A debate took place between Henry George
and H. M. Hyndman, in
St. James&#8217;s Hall, London, on Tuesday, July 2nd, 1889. Professor
E. S. Beesly occupied the chair.</p>
<b>The Chairman</b>: It will perhaps conduce to the good order of
this discussion if I inform you of the conditions or regulations
which have been agreed upon between the parties. The object of the
discussion is the proposal of Mr Henry George for a single tax, and
it has therefore been arranged that he should commence by explaining
that proposal of his, but what he will say will be only in the nature
of an exposition, and ten minutes only will be allotted to him for
that purpose.
<p> He will then be followed by Mr Hyndman, who will take
half-an-hour; after that Mr George &#8211; will reply for twenty
minutes to make up his half-an-hour. The remainder of the time will
be divided in this way: &#8211; Each of these two gentlemen will take
first a period of twenty minutes, and then a period of ten minutes,
Mr George having the last word.</p>
<p> That will make up two hours. I am quite aware that it would be
out of place for me to occupy your time, as you have come here to
hear these two disputants, and not to hear me. Moreover, although it
is usual at the meetings which are held here for the chairman to be
appointed because he holds strong views in respect to the subject to
be brought before the meeting, and a strong party speech is naturally
expected from him, we are not here for that purpose tonight. We are
here to have a discussion on which no vote is to be taken; so it
would be evidently out of place if I were to show any partiality by
arguing one way or other at the commencement of the debate. I shall
endeavour to discharge my duties as fairly and as impartially as
possible, and I have no doubt I shall receive every assistance from
this meeting. (Hear, hear.) We have here, no doubt, a great many who
sympathise with Mr George, and a great many who sympathise with Mr
Hyndman; but there are also, no doubt, a great many who have not made
up their minds at all, and who are naturally seeking to be informed.
It would, of course, be impossible, to prevent all expression of
feeling, but I trust we may expect that the two parties will attempt
to rival one another, not in the loudness of their expressions of
approbation or disapprobation, and still less in the length to which
those expressions of opinion are kept up; because you will see very
clearly that if there were to be anything of that sort it would add
considerably to the difficulties your chairman will be under in
carrying out the arrangements that have been agreed upon. (Hear,
hear.) There appear before you tonight two very able men, both
thoroughly well acquainted with the subject which they are going to
discuss; both of them completely familiar with its discussion.</p>
<p> We shall therefore have, I feel sure, a most interesting and
instructive debate. I am looking forward to that, and you are also,
and, therefore, without wasting your time any longer, I will call
upon Mr George to open the discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <b>Mr Henry George</b>: As to the injustice and wrong of present
social conditions, the parties who are here represented tonight
both agree. We both agree, moreover, as to the end to be sought
&#8211; a condition of things in which there shall be opportunities
for work for all, leisure for all, a sufficiency of the necessities
of life for all, an abundance of the reasonable luxuries of life for
all. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>We differ as to the means by which that end is to attained. Mr
Hyndman styles himself a Social Democrat: I a Single Tax man. Let me
state why we have adopted that name and what we mean by it. Looking
over the civilised world today,</p>
<ul>
  <li>we see that labour nowhere gets its
just dues. (Hear, hear.)</li>
  <li>We see there is everywhere a fringe of unemployed labour.  </li>
  <li>We see
all the phenomena that are called sometimes over-production and
industrial depression;  </li>
  <li>we reject as superficial the theory that this
is caused by there being too many people; that this is caused by
there not being enough work; that this is caused by the
multiplication of labour-saving machinery.</li>
  <li>We say that until human wants are satisfied there can be no such
thing as over-production (applause) that until all have enough there
is yet plenty of work. (Hear, hear.)</li>
  <li>We trace the cause of all these phenomena to one great
fundamental
wrong. We ask what work is, and we see that what we call productive
work is alteration in place or in form of the raw material of the
universe that we call land. We see that man is a land animal; that
his very body comes from the land; that all his productions consist
in but the working up of the land; and that land to him is absolutely
necessary; and we behold everywhere the phenomena of which I have
spoken. We see everywhere that this element, indispensable to all,
has been made the property of some. (Hear, hear) </li>
</ul>
<p>To that wrong we trace all the great social evils of which we
complain today, and we propose to right them by going to the root
and removing that wrong. (Loud applause) </p>
<p>It is perfectly clear that we are all here with equal rights to
the use of the universe. We are all here equally entitled to the use
of land.</p>
<p>How can we secure that equal right? Not by the dividing up of land
equally; that in the present stage of civilisation is utterly
impossible. Equality could not be secured in that way, nor could it
be maintained. The ideal way, the way which wise men, desirous of
according to each his equal right, would resort to in a new country,
would be to treat the land as the property of the whole, to allow
individuals to possess and to use it, paying for the whole a proper
rent for any superiority in the piece of land they were using.
(Hear.) </p>
<p>The ideal plan would allow every man who wished to use land to
obtain it, and to possess what he wished to use so long as no one
else wished to use it, and if the land be so superior that more than
one wanted to use it, a proper payment according to its superiority
should be made to the community, and by that community used for the
common benefit. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>Whether it would be better wherever circumstances change, to
change the rent every year; whether it would be better to secure
payment at a fixed rent for a certain time; there may be some
differences of opinion. In my opinion it would be better to adopt a
flexible system which would allow a change every year.</p>
<p> Now if that were done, if the land were let out, those using it
paying its premium value to the community, it would amount to
precisely the same thing if, instead of calling the payment rent, we
called it taxes. &#8220;A rose by any other name would smell as
sweet.&#8221; In an old country, however, there is a very great
advantage in calling the rent a tax. In an old country there is a
very great advantage in moving on that line. People are used to the
payment of taxes. They are not used to the formal ownership of land
by the community; and to the letting of it out in that way.
Therefore, as society is now constituted, and in our communities as
they now exist, we propose to move towards our ideal along the line
of taxation. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>If we were to take the rent of land for the community, one of the
first and best uses which would be commended to us would be that of
abolishing of taxes that bear in any way upon production, or in any
way hamper industry, or in any way increase the price of those things
that people wish to use and can use without injury to others.
Therefore, as bringing in the idea of abolishing these taxes we call
our measure the Single Tax. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>We would abolish all taxation that falls on industry, and raise
public revenue by this means, and move to our end, the taking of the
full rental value of land for the use of the community, in this way.
This name, Single Tax, expresses our method; not our ideal. What we
are really is liberty men; what we believe in is perfect freedom:
What we wish to do is to give each individual in the community the
liberty to exert his powers in any way he pleases, bounded only by
the equal liberty of others. (Applause.) </p>
<p>We would abolish all taxes, and begin with the most important of
all monopolies, the fruitful parent of lesser monopolies, that
monopoly which disinherits men of their birthright; that monopoly
which puts in the hands of <span style="font-style: italic;">some </span>that,
element absolutely indispensable
to the use of <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span>; and we
believe not that labour is a poor weak
thing that must be coddled or protected by Government. We believe
that labour is the producer of all wealth &#8211; (applause) &#8211;
that all labour wants is a fair field and no favour, and, therefore,
as against the doctrines of restriction we raise the banner of
liberty and equal right in the gospel of free, fair play. (Loud
cheers.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <b>Mr H. M. Hyndman:</b> Mr Chairman, friends and fellow
citizens, &#8211; In rising here tonight to oppose; as a remedy for
the evils of our present society, that proposal for a Single Tax
which Mr George has just laid before you, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I shall first of all
commence by stating those points in which we Social-Democrats &#8211;
and I stand here as a revolutionary Social-Democrat &#8211; (applause)
&#8211; agree with Mr George.</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>At page 20 of Mr George&#8217;s book,
&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>,&#8221; you
will find these words:
&#8220;That wages, instead of being drawn from capital, are in reality
drawn from the product of the labour for which they are paid.&#8221;
Very true. So say we; and we say consequently the profit which enures
results from the unpaid labour of the worker employed by the
capitalist. (Applause.) I say we agree with that statement of Mr
George&#8217;s, and we draw from it that inevitable deduction.</li>
  <li>Secondly, we agree with him in this: that the increase of the
population is not the cause of poverty &#8211; (cheers) &#8211; and
that Malthus, as Mr George has most ably and elaborately shown, is
entirely wrong.</li>
  <li>Thirdly, we agree with him that the remedies proposed for the
present state of things, those which find favour at the present time,
economy in governments, limitation of families, better education for
the working classes (which simply means better wage-slaves for the
capitalists), greater industry by the workers (which simply means an
increase of production for the capitalists to take and the landlords
to share), thrift and temperance. Thrift because, under present
conditions, as Mr George would admit, mere thrift cannot change the
conditions under which the mass of the working population and many of
the middle class have to suffer. Even temperance will not alter the,
economic conditions in which the people live. It may be an individual
virtue; it may be an individual advantage; but it will not make the
wage-slave less a wage-slave; nor the cottier tenant of Ireland less
at the mercy of the landlord. (Hear, hear.) Trade unions will not
attain that object. There Mr George and I would agree. Co-operative
societies which; at present; are merely for distribution, more
general distribution of land by way of peasant proprietary, are also
remedies which are useless under the present condition of things.
That takes our friends who support Mr George a very long way, as I
shall presently show.</li>
  <li>Then, fourthly; that the tendency of the times is towards
production on a larger and larger scale, with larger and larger
capital, alike in agriculture and in manufacture. That you will find
laid down in &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>,&#8221;
and in &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Social
Problems</span>&#8221; at page 300. The consequence of that shall call
attention to.</li>
  <li>Fifthly, that the tendency of wages at the present time is to
fall
in proportion to the amount of wealth created by the workers &#8211;
that as wealth increases wages become a less proportion to the amount
of wealth so created.</li>
  <li>Further, Mr George says that he is in favour of collective
ownership and collective management of monopolies. Now, I say all
this taken together brings us a very long way on the road to that
Social Democracy which, as a matter of fact, I am here to champion as
the delegate of the Social-Democratic Federation. (Applause.) </li>
</ul>
<p>Wherein then, do we differ?</p>
<ul>
  <li> First, that a rise in rent in countries where the capitalist
system of production exists reduces the rate of wages. I say that it
does not. I say that rent does not reduce the wages in countries
where the capitalist system of production prevails; that rent only
reduces the rate of wages in quite exceptional circumstances. I do
not deny that rent reduces what Mr George calls wages, what the
cottier tenant proprietor can get out of the soil of Ireland. But the
condition of Ireland is not the condition of America, nor the
condition of the majority of countries. It is an exceptional
condition, and in this exceptional condition, no doubt, rent reduces
that which the worker retains out of the soil.</li>
  <li>Secondly, that rent absorbs all the difference between wages and
the total wealth produced as that wealth increases. That, we say, is
not so, and you have only got to look around you in this country to
see that it is not so. Figures and facts will prove it unmistakably.
  </li>
  <li>Thirdly, that the taxation of land values up to their limit, the
confiscation of rent namely, and the equivalent reduction would
benefit the people. I maintain that it would not. That, too,
competition can be other than harmful: we hold that competition in
itself is harmful. (Hear, hear.) </li>
  <li>Further, Mr George does not propose to nationalise the land. We
do. (Hear, hear.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr George proposes this. He states on page 364 of &#8220;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span>,&#8221;</p>
<blockquote> &#8220;It is not necessary to confiscate land; it is only
necessary to confiscate rent, to abolish all taxation save that on land
values.&#8221; </blockquote>
<p>Again, we contend that the monopoly of land is not the chief cause
of industrial depression at the present time not the chief cause. Now
why, then, agreeing so far with Mr George as we do, why is it that we
Social-Democrats should in the country and in London oppose him, and
that I should be appointed on this occasion to debate with him upon
this subject? Because, Mr Chairman, we have arrived at a point where
social questions are the questions of the day &#8211; (applause)
&#8211; and where political questions are becoming more and more
insignificant every day. This is due in great part to Mr
George&#8217;s own exertions. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary
that we should proceed upon a true and scientific basis in order that
we may achieve as an organised democracy those results which we both
are aiming at. (Applause.) </p>
<p>I say that the rent of land &#8211; the increase of the rent of
land does not lower wages. It has not lowered them in America. Wages
in America and in Australia have not fallen as the rent of land has
advanced. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>I can speak confidently in relation to Australia, especially in
Victoria, where, since the enactment by the working classes of
practically an eight hours law, wages have risen relatively to what
they had been, and, therefore, the increase of rent in that Country
has not lowered wages. In the early days of California, with which Mr
George is acquainted, no doubt wages were nominally exceedingly high
but the real wages, the purchasing power of wages, are higher today
in America than they were twenty or twenty-five years ago in various
trades. Mr Arnold Toynbee, with whom I was acquainted, went very
carefully into this matter, and although he took a different point of
view from me his statements have never been controverted. He
maintained that the rise of rent in various countries in no case
reduced wages in those countries as wealth increased. But we need
not, as a matter of fact, go from England in order to discover that.
Between 1879 and 1888, as we are all perfectly well aware the rent of
land fell considerably in Great Britain, but while rent has fallen 25
per cent, can anyone say that wages have risen to the same extent?
(Cries of &#8220;No.&#8221;) Certainly not. Yet according to Mr
George&#8217;s law, if rent has fallen wages ought to have risen. I
ask the working men here present, have they risen? (&#8220;No,
no.&#8221;) Then again between 1850 and 1878 rent rose enormously in
England, and during that same time wages rose &#8211; the purchasing
power of wages. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>Therefore, the very basis of Mr George&#8217;s argument; namely,
that rent rises when wages fall and falls when wages rise, is not
borne out in this country, not borne out in America, not borne out in
Australia. What then becomes of his argument as laid down in
&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>&#8221;? But to
go farther. Mr George
proposes to confiscate rent. (Hear, hear.) From our point of view as
Social Democrats we have no objection to that &#8211; not at all.
(Laughter and &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;)</p>
<p> Confiscation, as we contend, is going on today &#8211; (applause)
&#8211; the confiscation of the well-being; the health, and the very
life of the people by the landlords and capitalists. Here I may point
out, Mr Chairman, that so far from my holding any brief to defend the
landlords; such as the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Salisbury, the Duke of
Westminster, the Duke of Sutherland, and the other great landowners
of this country, I sincerely hope that we may yet have the power to
upset these monopolists and other monopolists, and to really
nationalise the land of England. (Applause.)</p>
<p> I am not here under any circumstance whatever to defend the
landlord, but want to get at him &#8211; (laughter) &#8211; not merely
to confiscate rent, but to take the land for the people and to
organise production upon the soil. But, says Mr George, the taking of
economic rent &#8211; the taking, that is to say, of land values
&#8211; will produce a very serious effect. What is the amount in
England? For, after all, we are arguing in England. If ever I have
the good fortune to go to New York, I shall be happy to argue with Mr
George there. But we are arguing at present in England, and what is
the economic rent of England? It is taken at about &pound;60,000,000 a
year which I admit is a large sum. </p>
<p>Mr George says tax that rent. Take it and apply it to what? Mark,
he has not proposed to apply that sum to building better dwellings
for the people, for the providing of better parks and open spaces, or
for the better education of the people; he has proposed these
&pound;60,000,000 to what? To the reduction of the general taxation
upon industry. Now to whom would that general taxation so taken off
go? I say that it would go without a penny&#8217;s worth of deduction
into the pockets of the great capitalists of this country of ours.
(Loud cheers and cries of &#8220;No.&#8221;) </p>
<p>To whom else would it go? Mr George does not propose to interfere
with competition. Mr George says that competition is a right thing,
that the man who has exceptional faculties aught to rise upon the
shoulders of his fellows. (A voice: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;) </p>
<p>If they are foolish enough to bend under the burden so much the
worse for them. (Hear, hear.) So say not we. We say that,
competition, for profit produces more degradation than any form of
production the world has ever seen. He leaves competition untouched.
The labourer who goes to the factory or dockyard gates now begging
for work would have to go to the factory gates under the same
conditions if the Single Tax proposals were carried out. </p>
<p>I maintain that the miserable wage-slaves would be in precisely
the same state ten years hence after rent had been confiscated as the
are at the present moment; and that the only people who would benefit
would be the Rothschilds, the Barings, the Chamberlains, the
Mundellas, and such people who pile up great fortunes out of the
workers of today. (Applause.) Very well, that would be so, and I
challenge contradiction upon it.</p>
<p>I ask how can the Single Tax be a remedy? What is the reason of
this terrible number of unemployed; the existence of which we
deplore? Mr George says it is on account of the land not being taxed.
But mark here again, he does not propose to relieve the land of rent.
He simply proposes to transfer that rent to the State, and,
therefore, the man who desires to go upon the land will have to go
upon it with a deduction for the purpose of getting upon it precisely
the same as he has today. He does not propose to relieve him from
rent, and I do not say that under competition it is just that he
should, But how is the labourer to get at the land? </p>
<p>Tonight Mr George has told us that he is in favour of a yearly
assessment of land, if I do not misunderstand him. Now, there happens
to be upon this platform tonight an Indian gentleman who could tell
you the result of an annual assessment of land in India where the
very proposal which Mr George has laid before you is in operation.
The land in Madras was nationalised in accordance with Mr
George&#8217;s views, and was assessed annually to the amount of its
full rental value. The result was such an enormous increase of
poverty that the Government in India was absolutely obliged to give
it up as a complete failure. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>As I am upon the subject of India, I may mention that Mr George
does me the honour at page 106 of &#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span>&#8221; to
quote some articles of mine that I wrote some years ago, pointing out
the excessive poverty of that country. But how does that excessive
poverty arise? In India the land is taxed in precisely the way that
Mr George proposes. The full economic rent of the land is taken to
the amount of &pound;22,000,000 or &pound;23,000,000 a year, and is the
sheet-anchor of the taxation of India &#8211; (applause) &#8211; and
yet there is no such poverty in the world as in our great and
glorious Empire of India. (Cheers and applause.) There is, therefore,
some other reason than the monopoly of land for this excessive
poverty, and, singular to say, Mr George notices it and then passes
it by. That reason is the draining of produce from that country; the
taking from the people that which they produce under pressure for
capitalist drain. We say whether you confiscate rent or whether you
do not, this appalling poverty would remain so long as you left the
capitalist system untouched. (Cheers.) </p>
<p>Now then, therefore, I say that Mr George&#8217;s remedy is just as
hopeless as any that he denounces. The income of England is variously
estimated, but if I take it from &pound;1,200,000,000 to
&pound;1,300,000,000, I neither overstate it nor understate it. The
total amount of wages which is taken by the working class is
variously estimated. I take it &pound;300,000,000; others take it at
&pound;400,000,000 to &pound;500,000,000. The economic rent of land is
taken at &pound;60,000,000, which I believe is considerably over what
it is. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>Add that amount to the total amount paid in wages, be it
&pound;300,000,000 or &pound;500,000,000, you will still have many
hundreds of millions left between the amount of the rent and wages
added together and the total income of the nation. (Hear, hear.) </p>
<p>To whom does all that go? Mr. George would not deny that most of
it goes to the shareholders in the railways, the shareholders in the
banks, the shareholders and owners of the great instruments of
production. Those are the men to whom that great difference goes, and
I say if Mr George taxes the rent, whatever it may be in this
country, it leaves those hundreds of millions untouched, and the
condition of the working population will remain precisely the same as
it is today (Hear, hear.) Therefore, our object, as Social
Democrats, is not mere burden shifting. (Hear, hear.) We do not
particularly hate landlords more than capitalists, or capitalists
more than landlords. The alligator and the crocodile; it matters not
which it is from the point of view of those upon whom they feed
(Laughter.) We wish to get rid of both, and what we are aiming at is
the abolition of the wages system &#8211; (Hear, hear.) &#8211; and
that aim can only be accomplished by the abolition of private
property in the means and instruments of production including the
land. (Hear, hear.) Mr. George agrees with us that capital is rolling
up into larger and larger masses, and if he would only look at home
in his own country he would find that that is on of the principal
reasons of the number of unemployed whom he himself has seen around
in the streets of San Francisco, as I did myself in 1870 on the sand
lots. The great factory farms are directed and worked it may be by
500 men in the summer and ten in the winter. Where do the 490 go?
They are a body of men discharged to find labour where they can. A
new machine is introduced into any department of industry which ought
to be useful and beneficial to the whole community. The result under
present conditions is that men are thrown out on the streets as
unskilled labourers, while greater wealth is produced with fewer
hands, and the capitalist alone benefits by that monopoly which the
machinery gives him: (Applause.) Mr George says in some parts of his
works that he is in favour of taking over all monopolies by the
State. Very well, then. The State is controlled by the people, is
not, therefore, such a hideous enemy after all. (Hear, hear.) The
State today controlled by the landlords and capitalists is an enemy
to the whole people, and I maintain that even the middle class
themselves and the well-to-do are stunted, in, their faculties and
their power of enjoying life by the miserable system we have to
labour under. (Cheers.) If, then, this concentration of the means of
production in fewer and fewer hands, if the rolling up of capital
into larger and larger masses, renders it more and more impossible
for an individual man to come to the front; as Mr George says in
&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Social Problems</span>&#8221; it does,
then, as a matter of fact, you
have to deal with these larger and a larger growths of capital even
before you touch the land. We Social Democrats do not claim to be
filled with any divine afflatus. We do not believe in any utopia come
down from above. But we build up our ideas from the facts we see
under our eyes every day. (Applause.) What do we see at the present
time? We see that in this very capitalist system, which, based on the
devil-take the-hindmost for the many and economic harmonies for the
few, the capitalists are eating up one another, and that the present
system means monopoly in every direction. You have the salt
&#8220;ring,&#8221; you have the copper &#8220;ring,&#8221; this
&#8220;ring&#8221; and that; and especially on Mr George&#8217;s side of
the Atlantic. Such &#8220;rings&#8221; are being organised every day,
not &#8220;rings&#8221; in relation to the land only, but
&#8220;rings&#8221; in relation to every department of manufacture.
(Hear, hear.) These rings crush the worker far more than the initial
monopoly of the land. (Applause.) Further than this, we see that it
is impossible under present conditions speedily to nationalise or
communalise that which has not already passed into the company form.
I do not say that in countries where you have the communal system
still surviving, as for instance in Russia, it may not be possible to
pass direct into a higher and more elevated form of it. But here, in
this country, circumstances are altogether different, and industries
must pass through the company form. The present system need not have
been accompanied by the horrors it has been, but being historically
inevitable it is working out its complete evolution. At the present
moment the capitalist class has proclaimed its own bankruptcy. The
landlord, after all, in this country, and even in America, is but a
sleeping partner in the process of expropriation which is carried on
at the expense of the workers. (Cheers.) If you kill the sleeping
partner and leave the active on at work what better are you? (Hear,
hear.) We say look at the facts around you. <br>
</p>
<p>Look at the great railway
organizations. This is not a question of the <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">wages of
superintendence</span>. The manager of a railway is paid at the outside
&pound;3,000 or &pound;4,000 a year; the manager of the London and
Westminster Bank is paid at the outside &pound;3;000 or &pound;4,000 a
year; the managers of the coal companies, as of other things, are
paid at the outside a few thousands a year. But those who never
superintend anything, those who can roam around the Mediterranean
superintending nothing, but consuming an enormous deal, take the
lion&#8217;s share. Then I ask you this, Mr Chairman and fellow
citizens, even from the ethical point of view if you are going, as a
matter of fact to tax income from land, why not tax income from all
robbery of labour? Why not put a stop to that confiscation of labour
which makes the mass of the people mere slaves in the hands of the
few? Social Democrats assert that the poverty and misery today are
the necessary result of the capitalist system, and if Mr
George&#8217;s Single Tax were applied our principles would have to be
taken into consideration before one human being who works for his
living would be in any way benefited. These which I advocate are
spreading throughout the length and breadth of our land; not merely
as a result of our agitation, not merely owing to the misery and
poverty that exists, but in accordance with the natural evolution of
society, and when they triumph, as they most assuredly will the
establishment of Social Democracy will give the fullest outlet to
every man and woman. I say that Mr George as he stands on this
platform is a reactionary and not a revolutionist. (Cheers.) I say
that we should combine together in order to work for the co-operative
organization of society in which the railways, the mines, the
machines, which at present dominate the worker, shall be the
handmaids of labour, and where labour shall have its full reward, and
the mental capacity, the physical power, and the health of the people
their full development &#8211; a condition of things now easily within
our, reach but such as the world has never yet seen. (Loud
applause.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Mr George: </span>Mr Hyndman
states that rent does not reduce wages
&#8211; the increase of rent &#8211; and he cites England and the
United States for that. He tells us that in the United States wages
have not fallen as the rent of land has increased. He has referred to
&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>.&#8221; In &#8220;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and
Poverty</span>,&#8221; I attempted to do what is indispensable and necessary
to anyone who would think clearly upon these subjects, to define my
terms. I have, in the first place, never stated anything more than
that the increase of rent produces a tendency to the decrease of
wages, and by wages in all such parts as that, I mean that proportion
which goes to the labourer. Money wages may increase or decrease
without the proportion being affected. In the United States as a
fact, with the rise of land values everywhere we have most exactly
seen the decrease of wages as a proportion. Further than that, while
in some vocations trade unions have raised wages as they have raised
them here, the rise has never been commensurate with the improvement
in production and the increasing wealth; and while land everywhere
has been increasing in value in the United States, so everywhere have
we become accustomed to what a few years ago we knew nothing about
&#8211; the tramp and the pauper. (Hear, hear.) <br>
</p>
<p>Mr Hyndman says that
rent in England amounts to but &pound;60,000,000. He is surely
thinking of agricultural land. Today in England mining rent and
rent of city and town lands is much greater than the rent of
agricultural land. (Cheers.) <span style="font-weight: bold;">We put
the rent of Great Britain today
at from &pound;150,000,000 to &pound;200,000,000 per year.</span> We
propose
to take that for the benefit of the whole community instead of
allowing it to go, as it does now, into the pockets of individuals.
Is not that, a change that ought to amount to something? (Hear;
hear.) But that mere transference is but a little of the good that
will result. What we aim at is not so much the taking of rent for the
use of the community as freeing the land for the use of labour. (Loud
cheers.) Mr. Hyndman says that if rent were taken and taxes abolished
the labourers would be knocking at the factory gates and the gates of
the dockyards as they do now. They would not. (Hear, hear.) <br>
</p>
<p>With
taxes on land values, with taxes on economic rent from land, whether
it was vacant land or the site of a factory, or pleasure ground or
farm, would compel all over this country the &#8220;dogs in the
manger&#8221; to let go their grasp. (Hear, hear and cheers.) It would
give opportunities by which labour could employ itself. <br>
</p>
<p>Mr Hyndman
says that he speaks of labour as it is in the great cities of England
today not as it is among the cottiers of Scotland or the small
farmers of Ireland. Everywhere the social organization rests on these
men. Open the land to the little labourers of Ireland; open the land,
to the crofters of Scotland; open the land to the agricultural
labourers of your own English counties, and how many men would be
knocking at the factory gates? (Applause.) Where do those men come
from? They are driven off the land. (Hear, hear.) I myself have seen
a family evicted in Ireland, and that same family in a manufacturing
town begging for work at any price. (Hear, hear.) Open the land.
There is enough of it; and that is all that is necessary to do. <br>
</p>
<p>Mr
Hyndman speaks of India as though the Single Tax were in operation
there. I heard that the other night from Mr Samuel Smith, and it did
not surprise me, but it does surprise me to hear it tonight from Mr
Hyndman, who, in 1878 and 1879 wrote a series of articles in the
&#8220;Nineteenth Century&#8221; that fully explained the cause of the
poverty of India. (Hear, hear.) Does the Single Tax admit of a salt
tax? Even if the tax on land in India were what we mean by our
proposal we do not say that given the Single Tax there can be no
other evil, any more than a man who believes in temperance would deny
that the people might be temperate and yet be oppressed. It is not
the value of the land that is taxed in India; it is, as Mr Hyndman
has shown, the cultivator. It is as Seymour Keay showed in his series
of articles afterwards, not the value of land, but the ryot, who is
so heavily taxed that when he pays his taxes he has to take the
earnings of his wife and children to supplement his own &#8211;
(shame) &#8211; so taxed that he declares that the Survey Department
of the Indian Government is nothing but a scientific instrument for
squeezing the last drop of sweat out of the ryot; so taxed that he
says if the most rack-rented peasants of Ireland were to go there
they would find in three months that the little finger of the
Anglo-Indian Government was more than the loin of the Irish landlord.
(Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>We say that all it is necessary to do is to give men
their natural rights. We say all it is necessary to do is to open the
land to labour. (Hear, hear.) I do not take the same view of labour
that our friends of the Social Democratic Federation do.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They seem to
have taken holus bolus the arguments of the old political economists
who were writing for the purpose of proving that the poor you must
always have with you. (&#8220;No!&#8221;)  </li>
  <li>They seem to have accepted as
a natural law that the actual wages of labour are merely what the
labourer can subsist on.  </li>
  <li>They seem to have given capital the first
place in the order of production.  </li>
</ul>
Capital does not come first. Land
and labour are the only two absolutely necessary factors to the
production of wealth. (Hear, hear.) Capital is the child of labour
exerted upon land. (Cheers.) Give labour access to land and it will
produce capital. Give labour access to land and the power of the
capitalists to grind the masses must disappear. (Hear, hear.) What
does that power came from? Merely from the fact that men are unable
to employ themselves upon the land. It is the poverty of the
labourers, not the wealth of the capitalist, that is the evil to be
removed. <br>
<br>
Mr Hyndman quarrels with competition. (Hear, hear.) He wants
to abolish it, but to abolish competition would be to abolish
freedom. (Loud applause and cries of &#8220;No, no.&#8221;) How can you
abolish competition except by saying to man, &#8220;Thou shalt
not&#8221;? How can you abolish competition save by preventing men
from doing what they have a perfect right to do &#8211; (&#8220;No,
no,&#8221; and hear, hear) &#8211; and what it is for the interest of
the community that they should do? Why, today, what are the
grievances that the working classes everywhere justly complain of?
The restriction of competition. It is monopoly, and monopoly simply
means the restriction of competition. (Hear, hear.) <br>
<br>
How is
competition to be abolished? We have a right to ask the Social
Democrats what they propose to do, and how they propose to do it. All
I can find in their platform that goes to the social question is
this: &#8220;The production of wealth to be regulated by society in
the common interests of all its members.&#8221; (Cheers.) &#8220;The
means of production, distribution, and exchange to be declared and
treated as collective or common property.&#8221; (Hear, hear.) <br>
<br>
They
propose to take everything &#8211; (laughter and hear, hear) &#8211;
not merely that which belongs of natural right to all men equally
&#8211; namely, the land &#8211; but also that which by natural right
belongs to the man who has produced it. (Hear, hear.) How are they to
get possession of it? By buying it or by taking it? If by taking it,
it is a big job. (Hear, hear and laughter.) If by buying it, what are
you doing but taking the capital from the masses in order to give it
to those people whom you now say hold the capital? <br>
<br>
You say the nation
ought to abolish competition. Why you could not abolish competition
without subjecting man to the worst form of tyranny &#8211; (Hear,
hear and &#8220;No, no&#8221;) &#8211; and without stopping all
progress. 
<ul>
  <li>It is where competition is not permitted that there is
stagnation. (Hear, hear.) It is the competition of manufacturer with
manufacturer that leads to the adoption of inventions in
manufactures.  </li>
  <li>It is the competition of steamship owner with steamship
owner that gives you those greyhounds of the sea.  </li>
  <li>It is the
competition of producer with producer, it is the competition of
tradesman with tradesman that brings to such a city as this all that
is necessary to supply its wants. (Dissent, and cries of
&#8220;Order&#8221; and cheers.)  </li>
</ul>
<p>What we want is full competition.
  (Hear, hear.) What we want to do is to abolish monopolies, and it is
  to these monopolies, and not to the earnings of capital, that the
  great fortunes to which my opponent has alluded are due. <br>
  <br>
  What are the
  causes of these big fortunes? In the United States, go wherever you
  please, you find that the real element is land ownership. It is a
  great mistake to think that the only landlords are those which pose
  as such. today, who are the great owners of the Irish estates? Not
  so much the Irish landlords as the English banks and insurance
  societies. (Hear, hear.) Take our, Jay Gould, the most conspicuous
  example of a great fortune made outside the rise of land values. He
  made his first stride by getting hold of a piece of land and taking
  advantage of its rise in value, and he is today the owner of
  millions of acres. He made his money in what? In a public franchise,
  that we would abolish. <br>
  <br>
  Mr Hyndman speaks of the comparatively small
  amount of rent and the great amount of capital. What does he count as
  capital? Capital is a real thing. Capital is something produced by
  labour from land. Public debts are not capital. Franchises are not
  capital. Look today what is included as capital to swell those
  figures showing how much greater capital is than land ownership.
  There is your public debt. Does that represent any capital? If it
  were wiped out tomorrow, would there be one iota the less capital in
  this country? There are such companies as that in connection with the
  printing machine that is now being introduced. They have a machine
  perhaps worth &pound;100 and they propose to capitalise it at
&pound;100,000. What is there there? Not capital, but the expectation
  of future profits. So it is with the great mass of that which is
  vaguely treated as capital. <br>
  <br>
  Capital is wealth produced by labour from
  land, used again in increasing the production of wealth. And not only
  will it not hurt labour to leave to capital its full reward but we
  must leave to capital its full natural reward, if we would have a
  progressive community &#8211; (cheers) &#8211; and if we would give
  each what is his due. (Hear, hear.) What the labourers have to fight
  against is not competition &#8211; (hear hear and &#8220;Yes&#8221;)
&#8211; but the restriction of production to their injury. Let there
  be competition all around from the highest to the lowest, fencing in
  no class against competition.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abolish
  monopoly everywhere, put all
  men on an equal footing and then trust to freedom.</span> In that way
  we
  would have the most delicate system of co-operation that can possibly
  be devised by the wit of man. <br>
  <br>
  The fight of labour is not against
  capital; it is against monopoly. Why just think of that state of
  things. when all the means of production belong to the community and
  all production is regulated by the State, when every individual would
  have, his work, his time of work, and everything else prescribed for
  him; when it would be utterly impossible for men to employ
  themselves! To abolish competition you must have restriction; you
  must call on the coercive powers of the State. How else are you going
  to do it? Supposing you organise industry in the way our friends
  dream of, if any individuals go outside of this organization and
  propose to compete with it, how are you going to stop their
  competition but by coming in with the strong arm of the law, and
  putting an end to it? Why such a state of society, instead of being
  the ideal to which the Anglo-Saxon community ought to aspire, would
  be going back to a worse despotism than that of ancient Egypt.
  (Applause and cries of &#8220;No, no.&#8221;)&nbsp;
<><br>
  <br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mr Hyndman: </span>What I would
  desire to point out to Mr George, in the
  first instance is that the tramp and the pauper appear periodically
  in the United States, and that at these periods of great depression
  the rent of land is practically permanent. It may rise steadily as he
  says it does, but these depressions occur periodically, and are,
  therefore, caused not by the rise of rent, but by some other cause,
  which I have endeavoured to point out &#8211; namely, this enormous
  concentration of the means of production both in manufactures and
  agriculture. <br>
  <br>
  According to Mr George, the rent of land is a
  permanently growing quantity, and, therefore, I maintain these
  periodic depressions cannot be caused by that, but by something which
  varies; and that variation is the application of ca ital to the
  various industries. I will deal with this question of monopolies
  later on, and I will show that this present capitalist system is
  necessarily a monopoly &#8211; that capital means monopoly. The mean
  of production are monopolised by the capitalists, with the landlords
  as their sleeping partners, and those who have no other property than
  the force of labour in their bodies are compelled by that monopoly to
  sell it for practically a subsistence wage. <br>
  <br>
  Now I am accused by Mr
  George of merely having given the figures for agricultural rent. This
  is a mistake on his part. It is a very remarkable thing to me that
  these figures of Mr Arnold Toynbee&#8217;s having been before the
  public now far six years, Mr George has not taken the trouble to
  criticise them. Mr Toynbee took the greatest pains to get at these
  figures, and their accuracy has never been challenged: According to
  them, the rent of land &#8211; which is now very much reduced &#8211;
  was at that time 69 millions a year. According to Mr Toynbee&#8217;s
  analysis, the economic rent would not be more than 30 millions out of
  the 69 millions; and that is true, because the rest of it is return
  to capital invested in the land. <br>
  <br>
  But again, Mr George says that I
  left out the City lands. I did not do anything of the kind. The
  ground rent of the cities of England taken in the same year as I have
  taken the agricultural rents, amount to 30 millions a year. Those
  figures are unchallengeable; if anything, they are over rather than
  under the mark. But, after all, what does this difference in the
  estimate matter with reference to the present argument. Say that we
  take 150 millions more or less to reduce the taxation of the country,
  what the better is the worker? These figures, 60 millions or 150
  millions, sound very big, but the important question is who gets the
  money? &#8211; (Hear, hear.) &#8211; or, rather, who gets the wealth?
  because money is merely the symbol of wealth. Whether it be 60
  millions or 150 millions which by means of the Single Tax on land is
  to be applied to the reduction of taxation in England or America, the
  capitalist classes will get the benefit of it and not the workers.
  (Applause.) <br>
  <br>
  Mr George says the object is to free the land to the
  influence and the power of labour. (Hear, hear.) But that is exactly
  what he does not do. (&#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221;) It is just as impossible
  for the worker to get upon the land after the Single Tax as before.
  (No, no.&#8221;) I say, &#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221;' because Mr George is
  going to tax the full economic rent, and not only so; but he is going
  to exact it every year. There is to be no permanency of tenure, and
  nothing to encourage this investment of capital which he is so
  anxious to bring about. A man is to be assessed his full economic
  rent every year, so that so far from freeing the land for the
  labourer to get upon it, Mr George will keep him from the land more
  than he is kept today. (&#8220;No, no.&#8221;) How are the unemployed
  knocking at the dock gates and the factory doors to get upon the
  land? <br>
  <br>
  No doubt, as Mr George says, monopolists of land are the dogs
  in the manger &#8211; I do not deny that for a moment, and we are
  anxious to get at them but where is the poor dock labourer, who has
  nothing but the force of labour in his body, to get his tools to go
  upon this land which is thus nominally freed? (Loud applause.) Again,
  when he gets there, how is he to meet the competition of the big
  factory farmers? (Hear, hear.) <br>
  <br>
  If this competition of which Mr George
  speaks is such a glorious thing, I should like to know how the man
  who is working with a spade on ten acres is going to compete with the
  great factory farmer in Dakota who is working 100,000 acres with
  steam ploughs and all the best machinery. (Hear, hear.) If Mr George
  would only try competition under those conditions he would very soon
  find that it would grind him to the earth (&#8220;No.&#8221;) I have
  seen it done. I have seen it myself actually taking place. When I
  landed in America in 1870, the farmers of the West were a fairly
  well-to-do folk, and I have seen them crushed down by their own
  competition and the concentration of capital to such a condition that
  by far the majority of them are now mortgaged to the hilt. <br>
  <br>
  Mr George
  will say that if the full value of the land were taken you could not
  mortgage their land. Ask Mr Dadabhai Naoroji, who is on this
  platform, how the ryots of India mortgage. They mortgage their crops
  when they are unable to mortgage the land. The borrow money upon
  their crops, instead of upon the land, at excessive rates of
  interest. Therefore, I say this system Mr George is proposing does
  not give free access to the land, and that even if it did give free
  access to the land, the effect of competition and the concentration
  of capital would crush out the small man who went on it with inferior
  tools. Further, I maintain that this competition which Mr George
  holds up as a thing to encourage and aim at must necessarily mean the
  degradation of the mass of people (Applause.) <br>
  <br>
  Mr George says that he
  is surprised that I should talk about India in the way I have done. I
  believe that I have truly pointed out what the cause of the poverty
  in India is, but I have also shown that his remedy is applied there,
  the land being taxed up to its full economic value, and therefore
  there are very much greater causes of poverty than merely the
  monopoly of the land. The land of India is owned by the State, but
  the capitalist comes in between the ryot and the State and robs him
  of his production, and the drain of capital to England for interest
  on railways and so forth burdens and oppresses the ryot even more
  than the land tax. <br>
  <br>
  Mr George says that by natural right you ought to
  have the land. We are not arguing about natural rights; we are
  arguing about the condition of society in which we live. We say that
  we are here owing to a series of causes over which we had no control
  whatever. We have to look at the history of this development of this
  development of capitalism in England in order to know how to control
  and overthrow it. That is the way we look at it &#8211; not from any
  notions of natural right. We see in our midst a relentless conflict
  today, the result of which is that the worker lives but half the age
  of the class to which I belong; and hundreds and thousands of
  children are growing up rickety and scrofulous because you fill their
  heads before you fill their bellies. (Applause.) The competition we
  have all around us in every direction must mean the degradation of
  the masses. (Hear, hear.) <br>
  <br>
  Co-operation such as we Social Democrats
  are striving for would afford the means and opportunities for the
  development of the faculties of each and all; and this national and
  international co-operation is necessary for the future of mankind.
  (Loud cheers.) I am asked what capital is. I have before said that
  capital consists of the means and instruments of production,
  including the great railways, shipping, machinery, etc., which men
  have to use to create wealth, concentrated in the, hands of a class.
  Those machines and instruments have come into existence since the
  Middle Ages and they have pushed in between the landlords and the
  people. They came in the first instance as an opposition to the
  landlord; capital appears in every instance in the Middle Ages from
  the period of individual production as the enemy of the landlord. It
  is the enemy of the landlord today, and what Mr George is
  practically proposing and advocating on this platform is the monopoly
  of the capitalist by competition against the monopoly of the landlord
  by rent. (Hear, hear.) <br>
  <br>
  What we as Social Democrats desire to bring
  about is co-operation in production and in distribution. We would
  accept all those points wherein Mr George agrees with us, but we say
  that at the present time the system of competition is falling by its
  own weight. Competition has been tried and found a failure in every
  department, and its bankruptcy has been proclaimed to the world.
  (Hear, hear and &#8220;No, no.&#8221;) <br>
  <br>
  The question is will Social
  Democracy benefit the people? I am glad the word &#8220;people&#8221; has been
  used because I maintain that it will benefit not merely the working classes
  but the capitalists and middle classes also, whose
  interest Mr George, it appears to me, is so anxious to defend, and
  who form, I think, the majority of the audience here tonight. Even
  they would be largely benefited, not by the Single Tax which leaves
  them still competing with one another for the wealth produced by the
  workers; but by the establishment of Social Democracy, and by the
  amount of necessary labour growing less and less with every
  improvement in machinery, which would leave them abundant time to
  cultivate their mental faculties and develop their physical powers
  without that hideous feeling that every advance they make is made at
  the expense of their fellow creatures. (Loud applause.) <br>
  <br>
  There is a
  moral side to this which I cannot deal with fully tonight.&nbsp;Take
  the
  case of the large body of shopkeepers in this city who fancy they
  gain by this competition. Are not our large stores crushing out the
  small shopkeepers? Are not they as a matter of fact at the present
  moment injuring the middle classes? (&#8220;Yes&#8221;)</><>&nbsp; Take the case
  of the stockbrokers and the great masses of barristers, doctors and
  others in a similar positions how far are they allowed the full
  outlet for their faculties by being kept with their noses to the
  grindstone all their lives for the sake of bread and butter? The
  middle classes of this country do not realise how much their
  faculties would be enlarged and their scope of usefulness increased
  if this miserable system of competition by which they can only gain
at somebody else&#8217;s expense were removed. (Loud cheers.)</p>
<p>This system which
  Social Democrats are anxious to see is inevitable, and is coming as we are talking;
  it has gained ground enormously in England in the five years since I debated
  in this hall with Mr Charles Bradlaugh, and has gone on from strength to strength
  until at the present time it is the most rapidly growing movement in the country.
  We are told that it will mean the stunting of men&#8217;s faculties. Are not
  the faculties of most people stunted by competition and the mere desire to
  beat and crush down their fellows? We constantly see men possessed of the finest
  faculties,
  who might be of immense benefit to their own fellows in every possible way,
  overworked and crushed down by this very competition which Mr George
  champions. <br>
  <br>
  Mr George says that we stunt the individual faculties by
  organising the social forces. These social forces have been and are
  being organised today, but they are being organised for the benefit
  of the capitalist class. The Post Office is organised by the State
  today, but for whose benefit? Not for the benefit of those who work
  in it most certainly, for they work under competition many hours a
  day for practically subsistence wages. (Hear, hear.) The same applies
  to the railways Mr George asks us, &#8220;Will you buy them?&#8221;
  Does he intend to buy rent? (Laughter.) Oh no you may confiscate
  rent. (Hear; hear.) It is moral to take the rent of the landlord
  without buying it, but do not touch the capitalist. (Laughter and
  applause.) I say, to use a vulgar phrase, &#8220;What is sauce for the
  goose is sauce for the gander.&#8221; (Hear; hear.) <br>
  <br>
  If Mr George says
  it is immoral to nationalise or socialise the instruments of
  production, then I say it is equally immoral to touch the rent which
  goes to the landlord. (&#8220;No, no&#8221; and cheers.) The one is the
  result of historical causes just as much as the other; the one has
  grown up out of the past just as much as the other; the one means the
  expropriation of labour just as much as the other (Applause.) <br>
  <br>
  We say
  that from the moral point of view our duty should be to take for the
  benefit of all that which comes from the labour of all. (Hear, hear.)
  Again, to return to this objection about crushing down individuality;
  how could individuality be crush down when if the labour of all were
  properly applied none need work more than two hours a day, and thus
  all could have leisure and the opportunity for the full development
  of their faculties? So far from stunting the powers of man it would
  give opportunities for the physical and mental development of'
  mankind which can be obtained in no other way. (Applause.) <br>
  <br>
  It is said
  that to replace competition by co-operation would be to stop
  progress. Nothing of the kind (Cheers.) Why, at the present time
  capitalism stops progress. Electricity might replace steam in many
  cases if it were not for capitalism barring the way. Along the canals
  today you can see women doing work which could be done by steam or
  electricity were it not for this infamous competition. Competition
  may produce the vessels which Mr George terms the greyhounds of the
  sea, and which transfer us so swiftly across the Atlantic; but the
  inside of those vessels s never seen by millions of our people. I
  wonder he should have put it forward here as an instance of the
  progress of mankind, when the very competition that produces the City
  of Paris, New York, Umbria, and other vessels of the kind has
  produced degradation in our cities and the miserable condition of the
  men in stokeholes of those very vessels. Let Mr George stand up for
  the stokers who run these greyhounds on the Atlantic, and whose
  miserable condition will not be relieved by opening to them the land
  which you are going to rack-rent up to its full value. (Cheers.) I am
  glad the discussion has been narrowed to the operation of all which
  we champion. I am glad that on this platform we have the flag of
  Single Tax put up as against the red flag of Social Democracy, which
  I am here to champion tonight. I can hear the measured tramp of the
  millions of people as they march behind our flag to the glorious
  victory which will emancipate the whole human race from the bondage
of capitalism. (Enthusiastic cheers.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Mr George: </span>I will reply as
well as I can <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/Glossary.html">seriatim</a> to
what
Mr Hyndman has advanced. As to Mr Arnold Toynbee&#8217;s figures, I
have never thought it incumbent on me to analyse any figures. I am
not disposed to attach much importance to figures, and especially to
the figures of professed statisticians. (Hear, hear.) I can find
figures and figures until I cannot rest to prove conclusively to the
satisfaction of those who get them up that everybody is all right,
and that there is nothing whatever to complain of; that wages are
good and have been steadily advancing for a long time.</p>
<p>Whether the
rent is large or small is not of importance to the principle. I would
take rent &#8211; always meaning by rent economic rent &#8211; for the
community because it belongs to the community. (Cheers.) I would not
abolish it; I would exact it from anyone who used land wherever it
was used; because that is the only way in which all can be put upon
an equality. (Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>If you are to leave to the man who gets
possession of a piece of land in the centre of London the whole rent
you give him an enormous advantage over the man who for his purposes,
to get his land, has to go to some out of the way district or up to
the Highlands of Scotland. (Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>The importance that we
attribute to this taking of rent is that it is not merely taking that
much from a source that will not restrict industry, will not oppress
labour, will not hamper production; but it will make mere
landownership utterly valueless. (Applause.) By taking the rent</p>
<ul>
  <li>we
make it unprofitable to hold land in expectation of future increase
in its value. (Cheers.)  </li>
  <li>We make it impossible to extort from the
worker a monopoly rent (Hear, hear.)  </li>
  <li>We make it impossible for great
landowners to hold vast tracts of land &#8211; which their fellow
citizens would be glad to make fruitful &#8211; in idleness or for
purposes of pleasure. (Loud cheers.)  </li>
</ul>
Tax land values up to the full
and what would you have? The land that has no value, that is to say,
the land that two men do not want to use could be had by labour not
merely without price, but without tax. The selling value of land
would be destroyed, and all that the user of land need pay would be a
price amounting to the special advantage that he had above his
fellows by the possession and use of a particular piece of land. <br>
<br>
Mr
Hyndman asks who is to supply the tools. That is a striking
illustration of how the Socialists simply take the old dicta of such
political economists as Ricardo; McCulloch, and so on. Just as they
used to say that labour can not be employed unless there is capital
to employ it, and capital must therefore restrict the employment of
labour because labour cannot support itself save upon the proceeds of
past labour, which is capital, so do the Socialists now say that
labour cannot go on land and make any use of it without capital.
(Hear, hear.) That is not the fact in the first place. (Cheers.) Who
was the capitalist who supplied the first man with tools? (Hear, hear
and laughter.)<br>
<br>
And today what would be the effect of opening the
land to labour? Among the unemployed there are very many men who
could get some amount of capital; there is hardly any man who can see
an opportunity of making a profitable use of his powers who cannot
obtain some capital. (Interruption and cries of &#8220;Order.&#8221;)
<br>
<br>
How is labour to get the land? How has labour got the land when it
was much further off? Irish labourers have gone some 3,000 miles
across the sea; and then in many cases 1,000 miles further west, by
saving or by borrowing some member of the family has gone across, and
their earnings have constituted an emigration fund for the rest of
the family. That great emigration has been going on all these years,
not by capital supplied by the Government, but by capital earned by
the strong arm of labour. (Applause.) The whole development of the
United States, the whole development of every new country, proves the
fallacy of this assertion that labour cannot employ itself without
capital, and proves the fallacy of the assertion, that the opening of
land to labour would do nothing to improve wages. Go into a new
country where land is free; go into a country where the price of land
is not yet high, and there, you will find no such thing as an
unemployed man; there you will find no such thing as a man begging
for employment as though it were a boon. (Hear, hear.) <br>
<br>
What has the
deterioration in the condition of our farms been caused by? Not, as
Mr Hyndman says, by any exploiting power of capital, but by the
monopolisation of land, and by the taxes levied on industry (Hear,
hear.) What do these great farms come from? They come from the great
railroad grants. (Hear, hear.) They come from the system permitted
under the land-laws of the United States, under which single
individuals have taken hundreds of thousands of acres. And from the
same cause comes the mortgage on the farms. Wherever the farmer goes
he finds the speculator ahead of him, he finds the land already taken
up, and he must either start with capital and pay a large sum for the
purpose of getting virgin soil to cultivate, or he must mortgage his
labour for years. That is what he does. (Hear; hear.) The real cause
is in the high purchase price, of his land, and that is why times
have been getting harder in the United States. Then I am asked, how
can a man using a spade compete with this great machinery of the
5,000 acre farm? This, at least, he can do; he can make a living and
a good living, too; and when men can make a good living themselves
they will not work for anything less than that for any capitalist.
(Loud cheers.) <br>
<br>
There is in capital no power to oppress labour;
capital is not the employer of labour; labour is the employer of
capital. (Applause.) That is the natural order; labour came before
capital could be; it is labour produces capital; there is no particle
of capital that can properly be styled capital that labour has not
been exerted to produce. (Hear, hear.) Give labour land; let it get
it on equal terms; secure to the labourer the reward of his
exertions, and the distinction between the labourer and the
capitalist will pass away. With the increase in the wages of labour
if there be great organizations of capital they must necessarily be
co-operative organizations in which labour shall have its full share
and its full right. (Applause.) <br>
<br>
Mr Hyndman speaks of the history of
the development of England. What is the history of the development of
England? It is the gradual suppression of the common rights &#8211;
the gradual making of private property out of what was originally
recognised as common property. (Hear, hear.) It is the gradual taking
of the land of England from the whole people, and making the class
originally tenants landowners. (Hear; hear.) The long series of
usurpations was finally consummated by a no-rent manifesto, by which
the landowning class live off the rents they had agreed to pay for
the use of land, and put them in indirect taxes upon labour.
(Cheers.) What we propose to do is to go back the same way. What we
single tax men would do would be to go back to the old system, to
bring it back in a way adapted to our time; to recognise, not
half-heartedly, but fully, that all men are equally entitled to the
use of the land, and its correlative that each man is absolutely
entitled to that which his labour produces. (Applause.) <br>
<br>
Now we have
heard a good deal tonight, as we always do whenever our Socialist
friends talk, a great deal about nationalising all the instruments of
production, a great deal about making capital the property of the
State, and about organising labour by the State; but I have not heard
tonight, and I have yet to hear, of any practical steps in this
direction. (Hear, hear.) How do they propose to begin, and what will
be involved? Here let me say, to interrupt for one moment, that I
have never made any proposition to confiscate the railways. What I
propose to take is the rent of land for the use of the community;
what I propose is to take for the community are all valuable
franchises; but I would take nothing that is the product of labour
for the use of the community without paying its owner its full value.
Now, to take the instruments of production will involve a good deal.
(Hear, hear.) The instruments of production comprise not merely the
railways, not merely the ships of the steamship lines; they go down
to the axe, the spade, and the other tools of the individual workman,
and to the stock of the storekeeper. Are you going to take all that?
(&#8220;Yes.&#8221;) It is a big job. (Laughter and applause.) <br>
<br>
Has it
ever happened in the history of the world that the men that had
nothing took everything from the possessing classes? Never. And when
it is taken, what do you propose to do with it? (&#8220;Use it.&#8221;)
To use it under Governmental directions, and to have a Government
official or a board at the head of every vocation; lawyers, doctors
&#8211; I suppose no lawyers would be needed &#8211; down to milkmen,
costermongers, and bootblacks. Now what does that mean? We are told
it is all to be managed in the interest of the community &#8211; the
whole people &#8211; but is that the history of such organization?
Does not organization always mean a concentration of power in the
hands of a few? Do not you men who belong, as I have belonged, to a
political organization, know that always the tendency is to the
management by a few? Is it not always true that when things are left
to the vote of a large number of people that a few designing men
always have the advantage? <br>
<br>
Here is an example of Government directing
production: under the plea of directing production, of controlling
exchange, you had a system called a protective tariff &#8211; we in
the States have it still. The wisdom of the people freely expressed
by means of manhood suffrage, endeavouring to so direct industry as
to benefit the whole people, and what has been the result? A system
of utter robbery and spoliation; a system that has given to men such
as Andrew Carnegie incomes of five millions of dollars per year, and
has driven our ships off the high seas; a system that has been used
by every corrupt influence to add to the wealth of men who are
willing to spend their money for corrupt purposes. (Hear, hear.)
Think of what would be the result if you were to apply that system to
all industry. (Applause.) You speak about organising an industrial
army; the organising of an army always means tyranny; it means that a
man must be put in the ranks as a machine, and must obey arbitrary
authority. Do you think that there is less tyranny because men claim
to act in the name and by the authority of the people than without
it? Not at all. Do you think that there is any virtue in any party,
or any men, or any system of Government attempting to do things for
the benefit of the whole? (&#8220;No.&#8221;) Why, we know that in the
United States there can be a tyranny of majorities just as bad as the
tyranny of despotism. My time is up. (Loud applause.)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mr Hyndman:</span> I maintain that Mr
George has not dealt with my
argument at all. I contended that the system he is proposing &#8211;
namely, taxing land up to its full economic rent, would not give the
people access to the soil. (Hear, hear.) I contended that the
difficulty of their getting upon the land would be very bit as great
then as it is now, because they would have to pay to the state in
taxation the full amount they now have to pay to the landlord. I
pointed out further that even if they got on the land the competition
which would be brought to bear against them by the heavier guns than
their own, by better tools in the shape of steam ploughs and the
like, would gradually but surely grind them down to the condition in
which they are today. Not one of these points has Mr George
answered. (Applause.)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Mr George says that in the new countries where
land was obtainable unemployed men were not to be found. I can only
say this: that I have seen the streets of Sydney crowded unemployed
men with lots of land all around them, and I have seen identically
the same thing in Melbourne, and identically the same thing in San
Francisco. (Hear, hear.) How is it that Mr George does not deal with
the impoverishment of those farmers &#8211; not those who have to get
on the land, but those who are already on the land, and who are
beaten by the competition of cheaper production on a larger scale. <br>
<br>
Mr
George has not shown Mr Chairman, nor any man or woman in this hall,
that if the economic rent of the land of England, be it 60 millions
or 150 millions, were taken and applied to the reduction of taxation
that the people of this country would be benefited in any particular.
I say he has never met my argument in any shape, way, or description,
that the capitalist class would pocket every sixpence of the
difference, and that the people of this country would not be
benefited at all. I would ask you to mark this, that Mr George both
begins and ends this debate, so that he cannot say he has not had a
fair opportunity. I have only a few minutes in which to answer him
and cannot go into the question as fully as I should like to do; but
I will try to make the best of the short time at my disposal. <br>
<br>
Mr
George says that I have put before this meeting tonight no practical
proposals. I will, deal very rapidly with what we do propose. We
propose, as I said before to organise labour on the soil. We are just
as much in favour of the taking away of private property in land as
Mr George is, and in a much more effectual way. We propose to
organise labour on the land in co-operative farms by means of the
communes and county Councils under the control of the whole
industrial community. <br>
<br>
Again he says, &#8220;How do you propose to
act?&#8221; Well by way of palliatives to the existing evils 
<ul>
  <li>we would
shorten the <span style="font-weight: bold;">hours of labour</span> by
law in every employment where it is
possible to do so. On the railways and tramways and in all Government
departments eight hours might be made the normal working day, which
would give the people more leisure to combine, think, and understand
how it is they are expropriated at the present time. <br>
  </li>
  <li>We would have
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">free education</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">free meals in our schools</span> in order
that every
child might be educated &#8211; not merely instructed in the three
R&#8217;s, but educated &#8211; and in order that their physical
condition might rise to the level of their education. (Loud
applause.) <br>
  </li>
  <li>Then as the proper <span style="font-weight: bold;">housing </span>of
the people is of the
greatest importance, we would have healthy buildings erected by the
communes, municipalities and county councils to be let at rents to
cover the cost of construction and maintenance alone. (Cheers.) <br>
  </li>
  <li>Further, we would take this <span style="font-weight: bold;">unemployed
labour</span> of the working classes
and organise it under State and communal effort, and when I speak of
the State I do not mean the State governed by the landlords and
capitalists, but the State organised under the control of the whole
industrial community. (Hear, hear.) <br>
  </li>
  <li>Then as regards the <span style="font-weight: bold;">railways </span>we
say they should belong to the community &#8211; the organised
industrial community as a whole. Mr: George says, &#8220;How are you,
going to take the rent?&#8221;' Well, friends and fellow citizens, by
vote if possible, by force if necessary. (Loud cheers.) And precisely
the same thing applies to rent. How are you going to take the rent?
By vote if possible, by force if necessary. (Applause.) The railways
are now organised by directors on behalf of corporations which have
neither souls to be damned nor bodies to be kicked; we maintain that
they should be organised under the whole community, which will then
be a democratic industrial community, no longer dominated and
dictated to, but able to turn out the present directors who trample
upon them and to put in those whom they can control. (Cheers.) <br>
  </li>
  <li>Then
there are the <span style="font-weight: bold;">mines </span>which at
this present moment might just as well
be organised by the workers, they themselves electing their own
directors. (Hear, hear.) <br>
  </li>
  <li>The same thing applies to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">factories</span>.
today you have the most complete organization of the workers in
production and the most terrible anarchy in exchange. We see boot
manufacturers throwing out as many boots as they possibly can on the
market for the sake of profit &#8211; not for use. (Hear, hear.) Then
when they have in this way brought about a glut in the market, they
throw the men out of employment, and you have men and women going
without boots because, forsooth, there are too many boots! (Loud
applause.) There are men going hatless because there are too many
hats; and coatless because there are too many coats. (Cheers.) <br>
We
would restore by, the co-operation of all, in a State not dominated
and dictated to by the capitalist and the landlord, but in an
organised industrial community, order in place of this chaos which at
the present moment is prevailing all over the civilised world.
(Cheers.)<br>
</li>
</ul>
This is what we would do, and the things we are proposing
the men who come into office are forced to carry out. My master in
political-economy at Cambridge, the late Henry Fawcett, one of tho
most vigorous champions of individualism and non-interference, was
obliged as an administrator to kick himself downstairs as a political
economist. When he became Postmaster General, he was forced to
introduce the control of the State in connection with the Savings
Banks and in other similar measures. Why? Because it is necessary for
the State to come in to organise this miserable system of monopoly
which the capitalists have engendered; they themselves are obliged to
bring in laws to limit their own robbery. We contend that if it is
necessary for the capitalists it is still more necessary for the
labourers. (Hear, hear.) <br>
<br>
I have very little time but I have tried to
present before you what it is that we would bring about. We would
bring about a real beneficial co-operation in place of the hideous
devil-take-the-hindmost competition which now exists. (Applause.) <br>
<br>
We
would substitute for the system where some men work 16 or 17 hours a
day, one where all men working but two hours a day wealth shall
become, as Robert Owen said, as plentiful as water. <br>
<br>
I have enough
patriotism left to hope that this country will take the lead in this
great movement. (Loud applause.) Here is the centre of capitalism;
here the commercial world has its nexus. (Hear, hear.) Tyler and Ball
and Cade and Ket and More and Vane and Blake and Harrison, those are
the names of the men of the past who will be the heroes of the
future. (Cheers.) The Chartists, too, and Bronterre O&#8217;Brien and
Ernest Jones and the rest, with the great Robert Owen. (Renewed
cheers.) If I look to the other side of the Atlantic also, I see that
the men who broke down negro slavery, Lloyd Garrison, Wendell
Phillips, and their friends, were but a despised few, who nobly
struggled and fought on until at last their day of triumph came as
ours is surely coming. (Enthusiastic cheers.) <br>
<br>
We have a greater cause
than theirs: we are fighting for the emancipation of the workers
throughout the whole civilised world. (Applause.) I do beseech you to
read our literature, study our principles, and then endeavour to help
us to benefit the whole people, not by the single tax, but by
establishing permanently a beneficent co-operation which shall be an
untold blessing to generations to come. (Loud and long-continued
applause.)<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Mr George:</span> Mr Hyndman says
that in San Francisco as in other new
countries he has seen men looking vainly for work though there is
unemployed land there. That is true; but he never saw a man looking
vainly for work where the land was not fenced in and monopolised.
(Applause.). What the Single Tax would do would be to break down that
monopoly; to make it impossible for any man to hold valuable land
without putting it into use; compel those who are now holding land
unemployed to use it themselves or sell out to someone else who
would. (Hear, hear.) <br>
</p>
<p>Mr Hyndman says that these industrial
depressions come from too much production &#8211; (&#8220;No&#8221;)
&#8211; that because too many boots are made men go shoeless. That is
not so. There cannot be too much production until all wants are
satisfied. (Loud applause.) It is because the men who would like to
wear boots are unable to apply their labour in producing anything
that they can exchange for the boots. (Hear, hear.) <br>
</p>
<p>The cause of
industrial depressions is not too much production, but it is the
speculative increase in the value of land, and throwing idle men back
to compete with each other for work. (Applause.) That is the cause.
(Hear, hear.)</p>
<p>We have talked here for a little tonight, but for one
I feel that we shall have accomplished nothing unless in so far as we
induce people to think. What I ask you all to do is think about these
things (Hear, hear.) What I would like Mr Hyndman to do is to
seriously set himself to thinking &#8211; (loud laughter) &#8211; how
this organization of labour, this appropriation by the State of all
capital, is to be brought about. I asked the question, and he replies
by saying they propose to take the railways. We Single Tax men also
propose to take the railways.</p>
<p>What I want to know is about the other
things. How are all trades going to be organised? You are going to
begin with one here and there, you are going to end competition a
little at a time&middot;&#8211; a piece here and a piece there. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Wherever
you end competition you give some special privilege. Monopoly in what
does it consist? In the abolition of competition. </span>What are the
things
of which you complain in Government? The absence of competition. Your
House of Lords is not opposed to competition; it is fenced in by
monopoly (Loud applause.) So wherever you find a special privilege,
there you find it a special privilege because competition is
excluded.</p>
<p>What was the essence of slavery to which Mr&middot;Hyndman
has alluded? The prohibition of competition; so no one else could
employ the slave save his owner &#8211; the slave was not free to
compete with owner. (Hear, hear.) If you men seriously think of these
things you will see that the Social Democratic Federation vaguely
proposes, if it were possible to carry it out, would inevitably
result in the worst system of slavery. (Loud cries of &#8220;No;
no,&#8221; and &#8220;Order&#8221;)</p>
<p>Simply imagine a state of things in
which no one could work save under State control, in which no one
could display any energy save under the control of a board of
officials, and ask yourselves who this board of officials are likely
to be. Socialism begins at the wrong end; it pre-supposes pure
government; its dream is simply of a benevolent tyranny (&#8220;No,
no.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Mr Hyndman is proud of England, so, too I am proud of
English blood. I stand tonight claiming membership in the great
Anglo-Saxon race, and I ask you men of England why is it that our
speech in the coming century must be to the world what the tongue of
ancient Rome was to the old world? Why is it that America is ours?
Why is it that great nations of the English speech are growing up
under the Southern Cross? Why is it that we have succeeded in
colonising where Germany and France have failed? I will tell you; it
is because the English people have trusted very little to Government,
and it is because, more than any other people they have allowed free
scope to individuality (Cheers.) French colonies, Spanish colonies,
and the German colonies are all far more deftly arranged so far as
organization and direction are concerned; but English colonies have
had but the individuality of the Anglo-Saxon race, and that is the
reason why the Anglo-Saxon race is the dominant race of the future.
(Applause.)</p>
<p>I ask you to follow your traditions, to more and more
remember that this German Socialism is nothing but an attempt to
establish tyranny &#8211; (&#8220;Oh!&#8221;) &#8211; in the interests of
the people. (&#8220;No, no.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The interests of the people are
always in freedom. (Applause.) Let the people have their natural
rights; let them stand on an equal plane with regard to the
opportunities of nature, and then they will have a full, fair, and
free field. (Cheers.) Then if one is more active, more industrious,
more enterprising than another, then in God&#8217;s name let them go
ahead.</p>
<p>The notion of reducing everyone to one level is a preposterous
notion; it is the notion of ancient Egypt, not of the 19th century.
This is the watchword: freedom, freedom, always freedom. To each the
fullest opportunity to develop his own powers; to all that which
belongs to all &#8211; that which God above has given to all equally
&#8211; that which the community, as distinguished from the
individual, produces. That is the doctrine of the Single Tax. (Great
applause.)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Mr Hyndman:</span> I rise to
propose a vote of thanks to our chairman tonight. I do so with the very
sincerest pleasure, and feeling I am
honoured in so doing. Twenty five years ago when the working classes
of England were making some sort of effort to obtain freedom in the
form of trade unions and other combinations for their benefit, our
chairman, in the face of the most hideous obloquy, stood forward with
his fellows in the face of the World to champion their cause.
(Cheers.) Again, in 1871, when the whole of the capitalist press of
Europe howled down the Commune of Paris, when the men who had striven
for the enfranchisement of the workers landed in this country in rags
and in misery, Edward Spencer Beesly, in spite of all the
obloquy, vilification and abuse of the press, came forward and lent a
helping hand to them. (Loud cheers.) I wish in these days of
political tricksters, turncoats, office seekers, and wind-bags, we
had more men like our chairman (Cheers.) Again, when the Liberal
Party went in for miserable coercion in Ireland, and he is a Liberal,
stood out against it. (Applause.) I have the greatest pleasure in
proposing a vote of thanks to our chairman, who has conducted this
meeting so fairly and held the balance so well between us.</p>
Mr George: I most heartily second that vote of thanks.<br>
<br>
The resolution was put to the meeting and carried unanimously
amidst loud cheers.
