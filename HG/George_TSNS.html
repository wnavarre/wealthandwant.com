<b>Thou Shalt Not Steal</b>
<br>
&nbsp;By Henry George
</center>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> 
  <div align="center">An Address delivered on 8 May
    1887 to the Anti-Poverty
  Society, New York, USA&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><i>...of those little children who, in this city of New
York, are being sent out of the world by thousands when they have
scarcely entered it &#8212; because they do not get food enough, nor air
enough; because they are crowded together in these tenement districts
under conditions in which all diseases rage and destroy.</i></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr McGlynn, in Chickering Hall last Sunday night, said it
was a historic occasion. He was right. That a priest of Christ,
standing on Sunday night on a public platform and addressing a great
audience &#8212; an audience embracing men and women of all creeds and
beliefs &#8212; should proclaim <span style="font-weight: bold;">a crusade
for the abolition of
poverty</span>, and call on men and women to join together and work
together, to bring the kingdom of God on earth, did mark a most
important event.</p>
<p>Great social transformations, said Mazzini, never have been and
never will be other than the application of great religious
movements. The day on which democracy shall elevate itself to the
position of a religious party, that day will its victory begin. And
the deep significance of the meeting last Sunday night, the meaning
of this Anti-Poverty Society that we have joined together to
inaugurate, is the bringing into the struggle of democracy the
religious sentiment &#8211; the sentiment alone of all sentiments
powerful enough to regenerate the world.</p>
<p>The comments made on that meeting and on the institution of this
Society are suggestive. <b>We are told, in the first place, by the
newspapers, that you cannot abolish poverty because there is not
wealth enough to go around. We are told that if all the wealth of the
United States were divided up there would only be some eight hundred
dollars apiece. Well, if that is the case, all the more monstrous is
the injustice which today gives some people millions and tens of
millions, and even hundreds of millions. If there really is so
little, then the more injustice in these great fortunes.</b></p>
<p><b>But we do not propose to abolish poverty by dividing up
wealth.</b> We propose to abolish poverty by setting at work that
vast army of men &#8212; estimated last year to amount in this country
alone to one million &#8212; that <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/how_to_help_the_unemployed.htm">vast
army of men only anxious to
create wealth</a>, but who are now, by a system which permits
<font color="#ff6600"><a href="../glossary.html">dogs-in-the-manger</a></font> to<b><i> monopolize
God&#8217;s bounty</i></b>, deprived of the opportunity to toil.</p>
<p>Then, again, they tell us you cannot abolish poverty, because
poverty always has existed. Well, if poverty always has existed, all
the more need for our moving for its abolition. It has existed long
enough. We ought to be tired of it; let us get rid of it. But I deny
that poverty, such poverty as we see on earth today, always has
existed.</p>
<p>Never before in the history of the world was there such an
abundance of wealth, such power of producing wealth. So marked is
this that the very people who tell us that we cannot abolish poverty
attribute it in almost the next breath to overproduction. They
virtually tell us it is because humankind produces so much wealth
that so many are poor; that it is because there is so much of the
things that satisfy human desires already produced, that men cannot
find work, and that women must stint and strain.</p>
<p><b>Poverty attributed to overproduction; poverty in the midst of
wealth; poverty in the midst of enlightenment; poverty, when steam
and electricity and a thousand laborsaving inventions that never
existed in the world before have been called to the aid of humanity.
There is manifestly no good reason for its existence, and it is time
that we should do something to abolish it.</b></p>
<p><b>There are not charitable institutions enough to supply the
demand for charity; that demand seems incapable of being
supplied.</b> But there are enough, at least, to show every thinking
woman and every thinking man that it is utterly impossible to
eradicate poverty by charity; to show everyone who will trace to its
root the cause of the disease that what is needed is not charity, but
justice &#8212; the conforming of human institutions to the eternal
laws of right.</p>
<p>But when we propose this, when we say that <b>poverty exists
because of the violation of God&#8217;s laws</b>, we are taunted with
pretending to know more than humans ought to know about the designs
of Omnipotence. <font color="#ff6600"><b>They have set up for
themselves a god who rather likes poverty, since it affords the rich
a chance to show their goodness and benevolence; and they point to
the existence of poverty as a proof that God wills it.</b></font> Our
reply is that poverty exists not because of God&#8217;s will, but
because of humanity&#8217;s disobedience. We say that we do know that
it is God&#8217;s will that there should be no poverty on earth, and
that we know it as we may know any other natural fact.</p>
The laws of this universe are the laws of God, the social laws as
well as the physical laws, and He, the Creator of all, has given us
room for all, work for all, plenty for all. If today people are in
places so crowded that it seems as though there were too many people
in the world; if today thousands of men who would gladly be at work
do not find the opportunity to go to work; if today the competition
for employment crowds wages down to starvation rates; if today,
amidst abounding wealth, there are in the centers of our civilization
human beings who are worse off than savages in any normal times, it
is not because the Creator has been niggardly; <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">it is simply because
of our own injustice &#8212; simply because we have not carried the
idea of doing to others as we would have them do unto us into the
making of our statutes.</span>
<p>The Anti-Poverty Society has no patent remedy for poverty. We
propose no new thing. What we propose is simply to do justice. The
principle that we propose to carry into our laws is neither more nor
less than <font color="#ff6600">the golden rule</font>. We propose to
abolish poverty by the sovereign remedy of doing to others as we
would have others do to us, by giving to all their
<font color="#ff6600">just rights</font>. And <b>we propose to begin
by assuring to every child of God who, in our country, comes into
this world, its full and equal share of the common heritage.</b></p>
<p><font color="#ff6600">Crowded</font>! Is it any wonder that people
are crowded together as they are in this city, when we see other
people taking up far more land than they can by any possibility use,
and holding it for enormous prices? <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why, what would have happened if,
when these doors were opened, the first people who came in had
claimed all the seats around them, and demanded a price of others who
afterwards came in by the same equal right? Yet that is precisely the
way we are treating this continent.</span></p>
<p>That is the reason why people are huddled together in tenement
houses; that is the reason why work is difficult to get; the reason
that there seems, even in good times, a surplus of labor, and that
in those times that we call bad, the times of<font color="#ff6600">
industrial depression</font>, there are all over the country
thousands and hundreds of thousands of men tramping from place to
place, unable to find employment.</p>
<p>Not work enough! Why, what is work? <b>Productive work is simply
the application of human labor to land, it is simply the
transforming, into shapes adapted to gratify human desires, of the
raw material that the Creator has placed here.</b> Is there not
opportunity enough for work in this country? Supposing that, when
thousands of men are unemployed and there are hard times everywhere,
we could send a committee up to the high court of heaven to represent
the misery and the poverty of the people here, consequent on their
not being able to find employment.</p>
<p>What answer would we get? "Are your lands all in use? Are your
mines all worked out? Are there no natural opportunities for the
employment of labor?" What could we ask the Creator to furnish us
with that is not already here in abundance? He has given us the globe
amply stocked with raw materials for our needs. He has given us the
power of working up this raw material.</p>
<p><b>If there seems scarcity, if there is want, if there are people
starving in the midst of plenty, is it not simply because what the
Creator intended for all has been made the property of the few?
</b>And in moving against this giant wrong, which denies to labor
access to the natural opportunities for the employment of labor, we
move against the cause of poverty.</p>
<p><b>We propose to abolish poverty, to tear it up by the roots, to
open free and abundant employment for every person.</b> We propose to
disturb no just right of property. We are defenders and upholders of
the sacred right of property &#8212; that right of property which
justly attaches to everything that is produced by labor; that right
which gives to all people a just right of property in what they have
produced &#8212; that makes it theirs to give, to sell, to bequeath,
to do whatever they please with, as long as in using it they do not
injure any one else. That right of property we insist upon; that, we
would uphold against all the world.</p>
<p>To a house, a coat, a book &#8212; anything produced by labor
&#8212; there is a clear individual title, which goes back to the
person who made it. That is the foundation of the just, the sacred
right of property. It rests on the right of people to the use of
their own powers, on their right to profit by the exertion of their
own labor; but who can carry the right of property in land that
far?</p>
<p><b>Who can claim a title of absolute ownership in land?</b> Until
one who claims the exclusive ownership of a piece of this planet can
show a <font color="#ff6600">title </font>originating with the Maker
of this planet; until that one can produce a decree from the Creator
declaring that this city lot, or that great tract of agricultural or
coal land, or that gas well, was made for that one person alone
&#8212; until then we have a right to hold that the land was intended
for all of us.</p>
<p><b>Natural religion and revealed religion alike tell us that God
is no respecter of persons; that He did not make this planet for a
few individuals; that He did not give it to one generation in
preference to other generations, but that He made it for the use
during their lives of all the people that His providence brings into
the world.</b> If this be true, <font color="#ff6600">the child that
is born tonight in the humblest tenement in the most squalid quarter
of New York, comes into life seized with as good a title to the land
of this city as any Astor or Rhinelander.</font></p>
<p><small><small>How do we know that the Almighty is
against
poverty? That it is not in accordance with His decree that poverty
exists? We know it because we know this, that the Almighty has
declared: <i>"Thou shalt not steal."</i> And we know for a truth that
the poverty that exists today in the midst of abounding wealth is the
result of a system that legalizes theft.</small></small></p>
<p>The women who by the thousands are bending over their needles or
sewing machines, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day; these
widows straining and striving to bring up the little ones deprived of
their natural breadwinner; the children that are growing up in
squalor and wretchedness, underclothed, underfed,
undereducated, even in this city, without any place to play &#8212;
growing up under conditions in which only a miracle can keep them
pure &#8212; under conditions which condemn them in advance to the
penitentiary or the brothel &#8212; they suffer, they die, because we
permit them to be robbed, robbed of their birthright, robbed by a
system which disinherits the vast majority of the children that come
into the world.</p>
<p>There is enough and to spare for them. Had they the equal rights
in the estate which their Creator has given them, there would be no
young girls forced to unwomanly toil to eke out a mere existence; no
widows finding it such a bitter, bitter struggle to put bread into
the mouths of their little children; no such misery and squalor as we
may see here in the greatest of American cities; misery and squalor
that are deepest in the largest and richest centers of our
civilization today.</p>
<p>These things are the results of legalized theft, the fruit of a
denial of that commandment that says: "Thou shalt not steal." How is
this great commandment interpreted today, even by men who preach the
Gospel? "Thou shalt not steal." Well, according to some of them, it
means: "Thou shalt not get into the penitentiary." Not much more than
that with some. You may steal, provided you steal enough, and you do
not get caught. Do not steal a few dollars &#8212; that may be
dangerous, but if you steal millions and get away with it, you become
one of our first citizens.</p>
<p><b>"Thou shalt not steal"; that is the law of God. What does it
mean? Well, it does not merely mean that you shall not pick pockets!
It does not merely mean that you shall not commit burglary or highway
robbery! There are other forms of stealing which it prohibits as
well. It certainly means (if it has any meaning) that we shall not
take that to which we are not entitled, to the detriment of
others.</b></p>
<a name="Now, here is a desert."></a>Now, here is a desert. Here
is a caravan going along over the desert. Here is a gang of robbers.
They say: "Look! There is a rich caravan; let us go and rob it, kill
the men if necessary, take their goods from them, their camels and
horses, and walk off." But one of the robbers says:&nbsp; "Oh, no; that
is dangerous; besides, that would be stealing! Let
us, instead of doing that, go ahead to where there is a spring, the
only spring at which this caravan can get water in this desert. Let
us put a wall around it and call it ours, and when they come up we
won&#8217;t let them have any water until they have given us all the
goods they have." That would be more gentlemanly, more polite, and
more respectable; but would it not be theft all the same? <b>And is
it not theft of the same kind when people go ahead in advance of
population and get land they have no use whatever for, and then, as
people come into the world and population increases, will not let
this increasing population use the land until they pay an exorbitant
price?</b>
<p>That is the sort of theft on which our first families are founded.
Do that under the false code of morality which exists here today and
people will praise your forethought and your enterprise, and will say
you have made money because you are a very superior person, and that
all can make money if they will only work and be industrious! But is
it not as clearly a violation of the command: "Thou shalt not steal,"
as taking the money out of a person&#8217;s pocket?</p>
<p><b>"Thou shalt not steal." That means, of course, that we
ourselves must not steal. But does it not also mean that we must not
suffer anybody else to steal if we can help it?</b></p>
<p><b>"Thou shalt not steal." Does it not also mean: "Thou shalt not
suffer thyself or anybody else to be stolen from?" If it does, then
we, all of us, rich and poor alike, are responsible for this social
crime that produces poverty. Not merely the people who monopolize the
land &#8212; they are not to blame above anyone else, but we who
permit them to monopolize land are also parties to the theft.</b></p>
<p>The Christianity that ignores this social responsibility has
really forgotten the teachings of Christ. Where He in the Gospels
speaks of the judgment, the question which is put to the people is
never, "Did you praise me?" "Did you pray to me?" "Did you believe
this or did you believe that?" It is only this: <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">"What did you do to
relieve distress; to abolish poverty?"</span> To those who are
condemned,
the Judge is represented as saying: "I was ahungered and ye gave me
no meat, I was athirst and ye gave me no drink, I was sick and in
prison and ye visited me not." Then they say, "Lord, Lord, when did
we fail to do these things to thee?" The answer is: "Inasmuch as ye
failed to do it to the least of these, so also did ye fail to do it
unto me; depart into the place prepared for the devil and his
angels."</p>
<p>On the other hand, what is said to the blessed is: "I was
ahungered and ye gave me meat, I was thirsty and ye gave me drink, I
was naked and ye clothed me, I was sick and in prison and ye visited
me." And when they say: "Lord, Lord, when did we do these things to
thee?" The answer is: "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of
these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."</p>
<p><b>Here is the essential spirit of Christianity. The essence of
its teaching is not "Provide for your own body and save your own
soul!" but "Do what you can to make this world a better world for
all!"</b> It was a protest against the doctrine of "each for himself
and the devil takes the hindermost!" It was the proclamation of a
common fatherhood of God and a common brotherhood and sisterhood of
men and women. This was why the rich and powerful, the high priests
and the rulers persecuted Christianity with fire and sword. It was
not religion (what in so many of our churches today is called
religion) that pagan Rome sought to tear out &#8212; it was the
doctrine of the equality of human rights!</p>
<p>Now imagine, when we men and women of today go before that awful
bar, that there we should behold the spirits of those who in our time
under this accursed social system were driven into crime; of those
who were starved in body and mind; of those little children who, in
this city of New York, are being sent out of the world by thousands
when they have scarcely entered it &#8212; because they do not get
food enough, nor air enough; because they are crowded together in
these tenement districts under conditions in which all diseases rage
and destroy.</p>
<p><b>Supposing we are confronted with those souls, what will it
avail us to say that we individually were not responsible for their
earthly conditions? What, in the spirit of the parable of Matthew,
would be the reply from the Judgment seat? Would it not be: "I
provided for them all. The earth that I made was broad enough to give
them room. The materials that are placed in it were abundant enough
for all their needs. Did you or did you not lift up your voice
against the wrong that robbed them of their fair share in the
provision made for all?"</b></p>
<p>"Thou shalt not steal!" <b>It is theft, it is robbery that is
producing poverty and disease and vice and crime among us. It is by
virtue of laws that we uphold; and those who do not raise their
voices against that crime, they are accessories.</b> The standard has
now been raised, the cross of the new crusade at last is lifted. Some
of us, aye, many of us, have sworn in our hearts that we will never
rest as long as we have life and strength until we expose and abolish
that wrong. We have declared war upon it. Those who are not with us,
let us count them against us. For us there will be no faltering, no
compromise, no turning back until the end.</p>
<p>There is no need for poverty in this world, and in our
civilization. There is a provision made by the laws of the Creator
which would secure to the helpless all that they require, which would
give enough and more than enough for all social purposes. These
little children that are dying in our crowded districts for want of
room and fresh air, they are the disinherited heirs of a great
estate.</p>
<p><b>Did you ever consider the full meaning of the significant fact
that as progress goes on, as population increases and civilization
develops, the one thing that ever increases in value is land?
</b>Speculators all over the country appreciate that fact. Wherever
there is a chance for population coming; wherever railroads meet or a
great city seems destined to grow; wherever some new evidence of the
bounty of the Creator is discovered, in a rich coal or iron mine, or
an oil well, or a gas deposit, there the speculator jumps in, land
rises in value, and a great boom takes place, and people find
themselves enormously rich without ever having done a single thing to
produce wealth.</p>
<p>Now, it is by virtue of a natural law that land steadily increases
in value; that population adds to it; that invention adds to it; that
the discovery of every fresh evidence of the Creator&#8217;s goodness
in the stores that He has implanted in the earth for our use adds to
the value of land, not to the value of anything else. This natural
fact is by virtue of a natural law, a law that is as much a law of
the Creator as is the law of gravitation.</p>
<p>What is the intent of this natural law of increasing land values?
Is there not in it a provision for social needs? That land values
grow greater and greater as the community grows and common needs
increase: is there not built into this law a manifest provision for
social needs &#8212; a fund belonging to society as a whole, with
which we may take care of those who fall by the wayside &#8212; with
which we may meet public expenses, and do all the things that an
advancing civilization makes more and more necessary for society to
do on behalf of its members?</p>
<p>Today the value of land in New York city is over a hundred million
<font color="#ff6600">annually</font>. Who has created that value? Is
it because a few landowners are here that that land is worth a
hundred million a year? Is it not because the whole population of New
York is here? Is it not because this great city is the center of
exchanges for a large portion of the continent? Does not every child
that is born, every one that comes to settle in New York, does it not
add to the value of this land? Ought it not, therefore, get some
portion of the benefit? And is it not wronged when, instead of being
used for that purpose, certain favored individuals are allowed to
appropriate the fund of land values?</p>
<p>We might take this vast fund for common needs; we might with it
make a city here such as the world has never seen before &#8212; a
city spacious, clean, wholesome, beautiful &#8212; a city that should
be full of parks; a city without tenement houses; and we could do
this, not merely without imposing any tax upon production, without
interfering with the just rights of property, but while at the same
time securing far better than they are now the rights of property,
and abolishing the taxes that now weigh on production.</p>
<p>We have but to throw off our taxes upon things of human
production; to cease to fine a person who puts up a house or makes
anything that adds to the wealth of the community; to cease
collecting taxes from people who bring goods from abroad or make
goods at home; and &#8212; in substitution for all these taxes &#8212;
to collect that enormous revenue due to the growth of the community
for the benefit of the community that produced it.</p>
<p>Dr Nulty, Bishop of Meath, has said in a letter addressed to the
clergy and laity of his diocese that it is this provision of the
Creator, the provision by which the value of land increases as the
community grows, that seems to him the most beautiful of all the
social adjustments; and it is to me that which most clearly shows the
beneficence as well as the intelligence of the Creative Mind; for
here is a provision by which the advance of civilization would, under
the law of equal justice, be an advance towards equality, instead of
being, as it now is, an advance toward a more and more monstrous
inequality.</p>
<p>The same good Catholic Bishop in that same letter says: "Now,
therefore, the land of every country is the common property of the
people of that country, because its real owner, the Creator, who made
it, hath given it as a voluntary gift unto them. &#8216;The earth has
He given to the children of men and women.&#8217; And as every human
being is a creature and a child of God, and as all His creatures are
equal in His sight, any settlement of the land of this or any other
country that would exclude the humblest from an equal share in the
common heritage is not only an injury and a wrong done to that
person, but an impious violation of the benevolent intention of the
Creator."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">And then Bishop Nulty goes on to
show that the way to secure
equal rights to land is not by cutting land up into equal pieces, but
by taking for public use the values attaching to land. </span>That is
the
method this Society proposes. I wish we could get that through the
heads of the editors of this city. We do not propose to divide up
land. What we propose to do is to divide up the rent that comes from
land; and that is a very easy thing.</p>
<p>We need not disturb anybody in possession, we need not interfere
with anybody&#8217;s building or anybody&#8217;s improvement. We only
need to remit taxes on all improvements, on all forms of wealth, and
put the tax on the value of the land, exclusive of the improvements,
so that the dog-in-the-manger who is holding a piece of vacant land
will have to pay the same amount of tax for it as land of similar
value with a building or other improvements upon it. In that way we
would treat the whole land of such a community as being the common
estate of the whole people of the community.</p>
<p>The people of New York could manage their estate just as well as
any corporation, or any private family, for that matter. But for the
people of New York to resume their estate and to treat it as their
own, it is not necessary for them to go to any bother of management.
It is not necessary for them to say to any landowner, this particular
piece of land is ours, and no longer yours.</p>
<p>We can leave land titles just as they are. We can leave the owners
of the land to call themselves its owners; all we want is the annual
value of the land. Not, mark you, that value which the owner has
created, that value which has been given to it by improvements; but
simply that value which is given to the bare land by the fact that we
are all here &#8212;that has attached to the land because of the
growth of this great community. And, when we take that, then all
inducement to monopolize the land will be gone &#8212; then these very
worthy gentlemen who are holding one-half of the area of this city
idle and vacant will find the taxes they have to pay so high that
they will have to go to work and build houses or otherwise use the
land, or give it away to somebody who will build upon it, or put it
to other productive use. And so it will happen all over the
country.</p>
<p>Go into Pennsylvania, and there you will see great stretches of
land, containing enormous deposits of the finest coal, held by
corporations and individuals who are working but little part of it.
On these great estates the common American citizens who mine the coal
are not allowed even to rent a piece of land, let alone buy it. They
can only live in company houses; and they are permitted to stay in
them only on condition (and they have to sign a paper to that effect)
that they can be evicted at any time on five days&#8217; notice. The
companies combine and make coal artificially dear here, and make
employment artificially scarce in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Now, why should not those miners, who work on it half the time,
why shouldn&#8217;t they dig down in the earth and get up coal for
themselves? Who made that coal? There is only one answer &#8212; God
made that coal. Whom did He make it for? Surely you would say that
God made it for the people that would be one day called into being on
this earth. But the laws of Pennsylvania, like the laws of New York,
say God made it for this corporation and that individual; and thus a
few people are permitted to deprive miners of work and make coal
artificially dear.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago when I was traveling in Illinois a young
fellow got into the car at one of the mining towns. Entering into
conversation with him, he said he was going to another place to try
to get work. He told me of the condition of the miners, that they
could scarcely make a living, getting very small wages, and only
working about half the time. I said to him: "There is plenty of coal
in the ground; why don&#8217;t you employ yourselves in digging coal?"
He replied: "We did get up a co-operative company, and we went to see
the owner of the land to ask what he would take to let us sink a
shaft and get out some coal. He wanted $7,500 a year. We could not
raise that much." Tax land up to its full value, and how long can
such dogs-in-the-manger afford to hold that coal land away from these
men? And when people who want work can go and employ themselves, then
there will be no million or no thousand unemployed people in all the
United States.</p>
<p>The relation of employer and employed is a relation of
convenience. It is not one imposed by the natural order. People are
brought into the world with the power to employ themselves, and they
can employ themselves wherever the natural opportunities for
employment are not shut up from them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">People do not have a natural right to
demand employment of
another, but they have a natural right, an inalienable right, a right
given by their Creator, to demand opportunity to employ themselves.
And whenever that right is acknowledged, whenever the people who want
to go to work can find natural opportunities to work upon, then there
will be as much competition among employers who are anxious to get
people to work for them, as there will be among people who are
anxious to get work.</p>
<p>Wages will rise in every vocation to the true rate of wages &#8212;
the full, honest earnings of labor. That done, with this ever
increasing social fund to draw upon, poverty will be abolished, and
in a little while will come to be looked upon &#8212; as we are now
beginning to look upon slavery &#8212; as the relic of a darker and
more ignorant age.</p>
<p>I remember &#8212; this man here remembers (turning to Mr. Redpath,
who was on the platform) even better than I, for he was one of the
men who brought the atrocities of human slavery home to the heart and
conscience of the north &#8212; I well remember, as he well knows, and
all the older men and women in this audience will remember, how
property in human flesh and blood was defended just as private
property in land is now defended; how the same charges were hurled
upon the men and women who protested against human slavery as are now
made against the men and women who are intending to abolish
industrial slavery.</p>
<p>We remember how some dignitaries and rich members of the churches
branded as a disturber, almost as a reviler of religion, any priest
or any minister who dared to get up and assert God&#8217;s truth
&#8212; that there never was and there never could be rightful
property in human flesh and blood.</p>
<p>So, it is now said that people who protest against this system,
which is simply another form of slavery, are people who propose
robbery. Thus the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal," they have made
"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thou shalt not object to
stealing</span>." When we propose to resume our
own again, when we propose to secure its natural right to every child
that comes into being, such people talk of us as advocating
confiscation &#8212; charge us with being deniers of the rights of
property. The real truth is that we wish to assert the just rights of
property, that we wish to prevent theft.</p>
<p>Chattel slavery was incarnate theft of the worst kind. That system
which made property of human beings, which allowed one person to sell
another, which allowed one person to take away the proceeds of
another&#8217;s toil, which permitted the tearing of the child from
the mother, and which permitted the so-called owner to hunt with
bloodhounds the person who escaped from the owner&#8217;s tyranny
&#8212; that form of slavery is abolished. To that extent, the
command, "Thou shalt not steal," has been vindicated; but there is
another form of slavery.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We are selling land now in
large quantities to certain English
lords, who are coming over here and buying greater estates than the
greatest in Great Britain or Ireland.</span> We are selling them land;
they
are buying land. Did it ever occur to you that they do not want that
land? They have no use whatever for American land; they do not
propose to come over here and live on it. They cannot carry it over
there to where they do live.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is not the land that
they want. What they want is the income
from it. </span>They are buying it not because they themselves want to
use
it, but because by and by, as population increases, numbers of
American citizens will want to use it, and then they can say to these
American citizens: "You can use this land provided you pay us
one-half of all you make upon it." <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What we are selling those foreign
lords is not really land; we are selling them the labor of American
citizens; we are selling them the privilege of taking, without any
return for it, the proceeds of the toil of our children.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So, here in New York, you
will read in the papers every day that
the price of land is going up. John Jones or Robert Brown has made a
hundred thousand dollars within a year in the increase in the value
of land in New York. What does that mean? </span>It means he has the
power
of getting many more coats, many more cigars, dry goods, horses and
carriages, houses or much more food and wine. He has gained the power
of taking for his own a great number of these products of human
labor.</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">But what has he done? He has not
done anything. He may have been
off in Europe or out west, or he may have been sitting at home taking
it easy. If he has done nothing to get this increased income, where
does it come from? The things I speak of are all products of human
labor &#8212; someone has to work for them. When a man who does no
work can get them, necessarily the people who do work to produce them
must have less of the products of human labor than they ought to
have.</p>
<p>This is the system that the Anti-Poverty Society has banded
together to war against, and it invites you to come and swell its
ranks. It is the noblest cause in which any human being can possibly
engage. What, after all, is there in life as compared with a struggle
like this? One thing, and only one thing, is absolutely certain for
every man and woman in this hall, as it is to all else of humankind
&#8212; that is death.</p>
<p>What will it profit us in a few years how much we have left? Is
not the noblest and the best use we can make of life to do something
to make better and happier the condition of those who come after us
&#8212; by warring against injustice, by the enlightenment of public
opinion, by the doing of all that we possibly can do to break up the
accursed system that degrades and embitters the lot of so many?</p>
<p>We have a long fight and a hard fight before us. Possibly,
probably, for many of us, we may never see it come to success. But
what of that? It is a privilege to be engaged in such a struggle.
This we may know, that it is but a part of that great worldwide,
long-continued struggle in which the just and the good of every age
have been engaged; and that we, in taking part in it, are doing
something in our humble way to help bring about on earth the kingdom
of God, to make the conditions of life for those who come afterward
alike to those which prevail in heaven.</p>
