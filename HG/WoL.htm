<p><b><a name="First principles"></a></b><strong>First principles.
</strong>
<p>This world is the creation of God!
<p>The men brought into it for the brief period of their earthly lives are the
  equal creatures of His bounty; the equal subjects of His provident care.</p>
<p>By his constitution a man is beset by physical wants on the satisfaction of
  which depends not only the maintenance of his physical life, but also the development
  of his intellectual and spiritual life.</p>
<p>God has made the satisfaction of these wants dependent on man&#8217;s own
  exertions, laying on him the injunction and giving him the power to labor &#8211; a
  power that of itself raises him far above the brute, since we may reverently
  say that it enables him to become, as it were, a helper in the creative work.</p>
<p>God has not put on man the task of making bricks without straw. With the need
  for labor and the power to labor He has also given to man the material for
  labor. This material is land!</p>
<p>Man, physically, can live only on and from land, and can use elements such
  as air, sunshine, and water, only by the use of land.</p>
<p>Being the equal creatures of the Creator, equally entitled under His providence
  to live their lives and satisfy their needs, men are equally entitled to the
  use of land, and any adjustment that denies this equal right to the use of
  land is morally wrong. </p>
<p><a name="The right of property"></a><strong>The right of property</strong></p>
<p>Being created individuals, with individual wants and powers, men are individually
  entitled (subject of course to the moral obligations that arise from such relations
  as that of the family) to the use of their own powers and the enjoyment of
  the results.
<p>There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its validity from the
  law of God, a right of private ownership in things produced by labor &#8211; a
  right that the possessor may transfer, but of which to deprive him without
  his will is theft.</p>
<p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to himself,
  is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches to things produced
  by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</p>
<p>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean, he acquires a right of property
  in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or gift. But he
  cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that he may sell
  it or give it or forbid others to use it.</p>
<p>Or, if he set up a windmill, he acquires a right of property in the things
  such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim a right of property
  in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid others to use it.</p>
<p>Or, if he cultivate grain, he acquires a right of property in the grain his
  labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the
  sun which ripened it or the soil in which it grew.</p>
<p><a
 name="What the term &quot;land&quot; involves."></a><strong>What the term "land" involves.</strong></p>
<p>For these things are of the continuing gifts of God to all generations of
  men, which all may use, but none may claim as his alone.
<p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
  justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny the true
  rights of property. For a man who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
  to pay another man far the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil &#8211; all
  of which are involved in the single term &#8220;land&#8221; &#8211; is in this
  deprived of his rightful property; and thus robbed.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Private possession and private"></a>Private possession and private
ownership</strong></p>
<p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by labor
cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.</p>
<p>God has not granted the earth to mankind in general in the sense that all
  without distinction can deal with it as they please; and regulations necessary
  far its best use may be fixed by human laws. But such regulations must conform
  to the moral law &#8211; must secure to all equal participation in the advantages
  of God&#8217;s general bounty.</p>
<p>The principle is the same as where a father leaves property equally to a number
  of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable of common use or
  of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned to some of the children,
  but only under condition that the equality of benefit among them all be preserved.</p>
<p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing, and
  gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of land is
  not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend their labor
  in Permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor is thus expended
  is needed to secure the right of Property in the products of labor. For who
  would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed to enable him to
  reap? Who would attach costly works to the soil without such exclusive possession
  of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Limited and unlimited rights.

         
         
         "></a>Limited and unlimited rights</strong></p>
<p>This right of private possession in
      things created by God is, however, very different from the right of private
      ownership in things produced
            by labor. The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases
    when the dictate of self-preservation may terminate all other rights. The
            purpose of the one, the exclusive possession of land, is merely to
            secure the other, the exclusive ownership of the products of labor;
            and it can never rightfully be carried so far as to impair or deny
            this. While anyone may hold exclusive possession of land so far as
            it does not interfere with the equal rights of others, he can rightfully
  hold it no further.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Right of the child.

         
         
         "></a>Right of the child.</strong></p>
<p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement divide
  the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive right
  to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue such
  claim against the next child born. For since no one comes into the world without
  God's permission, his presence attests his equal right to the use of God&#8217;s
  bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which they had divided
  between them would therefore be for them to commit murder. And for them to
  refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them or by giving them
  part of the products of his labor he bought It of them, would be for them to
commit theft.</p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Application of first principle"></a> Application of first principles</strong>
<p>God&#8217;s laws do not change! Their applications may alter with altering
  conditions, but the same principles of right and wrong that hold when men are
  few and industry is rude hold amid teeming populations and complex industries.
<p>In our cities of millions and countries of scores of millions, in a civilisation
  where the division of labor has gone so far that large numbers are hardly conscious
  that they are land users, it still remains true that man can live only on land;
  and that land is God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived
  without being murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another
  without being robbed. And even in this state of society, where the elaboration
  of industry and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for
  private possession of land widespread, there is no difficulty in conforming
  individual possession with the equal right to land.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Land values"></a> Land values.</strong></p>
<p>As soon as any piece of land will yield a larger return than is had by similar
  labor on other land, a value attaches to it, which is shown when it is sold
or rented.</p>
<p>This value &#8211; of the land itself, irrespective of any improvements in
  or on it &#8211; always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which
  all are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the improvement value which;
  as producer or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual
  right.</p>
<p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
  ownership it is only necessary, therefore, to take for common uses what value
  attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
  is the same as in the case referred to, where a father leaves equally to his
  children things not susceptible of specific division or common use. In that
  case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Our proposal.

         
         
         "></a>Our proposal</strong></p>
<p>It is on this common sense principle that we, who believe in equal natural
  rights, would have the community act.
<p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common, letting
  any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task, impossible
  in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares; still less
  the ever impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
<p><b>We propose leaving land in the private possession of individuals &#8211; with
    full liberty on their part to transfer or bequeath it &#8211; simply to take
    for public uses the annual value of the land itself, irrespective of the
    use made of it or the improvements on it. And, since this would provide amply
    for the need of Public Revenue, we would accompany this collection of land
    values with the repeal of all taxes now levied on the products and processes
    of industry &#8211; which taxes, since they take from the earnings of labor,
    we hold to be infringements of the right of property.</b></p>
<p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
  of human regulations to the will of God!</p>
<p><a name="Harmony of God&#8217;s Law.

         
         
         "></a><strong>Harmony of God&#8217;s Law</strong></p>
<p>God cannot impose on His creatures laws that clash! If it be His command to
  men that they should not steal &#8211; that they should respect the right of
  property which each one has in the fruits of his labor; and if He be also the
  Father of all men, Who has intended all to have equal opportunities for sharing
  in His common bounty; then, in any possible stage of human civilisation, however
  elaborate, there must be some way in which the exclusive right to the products
of industry may be reconciled with the equal right to land. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Individual and communal rights"></a> Individual and communal rights
secured</strong></p>
<p>It cannot be, as is said by some, that, in order to secure the equal participation
  of men in the opportunities of life and labor, we must ignore the right of
  private property. Nor yet can it be, as others seem to argue, that, to secure
  the right of private property, we must ignore the equality of right in the
opportunities of life and labor.</p>
<p>To say the one thing or the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s
  laws. But the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
  of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
  both laws securing to all equal participation in the bounties of the Creator,
  and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.</p>
<p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
  bounty of the Creator, and the exclusive right to the products of labor, is
  the way intended by God for raising Public Revenue. </p>
<p><strong><a name="State revenue and the moral la"></a> State revenue and the moral
law.</strong></p>
<p>It is truly said &#8211; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8211; &#8220;Man
  is older than the State, and holds the right of providing for the life of his
  body prior to the formation of any State.&#8221; It is also true that the State
  is in the divinely appointed order. For He Who foresaw all things, and provided
  far all things, foresaw and provided that, with the increase of population
  and the development of industry, the organisation of human society into States
or Governments would become both expedient and necessary.</p>
<p>No sooner does the State arise than it needs revenue. This need for revenue
  is small at first, while population is sparse, industry rude, and the functions
  of the State few and simple. But with growth of population and advance of civilisation
  the functions of the State increase, and larger and larger revenues are needed.</p>
<p>Now, the raising of Public Revenue must accord with the moral law. Hence:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals. </li>
    <li>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by, increasing prices
      of what some have to sell and others must buy.</li>
    <li>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by
      making it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</li>
    <li>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
      sanctions of Religion and the State, by creating crimes and punishing men
      for doing what morally they have an undoubted right to do.</li>
    <li>It must not repress industry nor check commerce. It must not punish thrift.
      It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest division
      of wealth.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><a name="Taxes violate the moral law"></a>Taxes violate the moral law</strong>
<p>Consider the taxes on the processes and products of industry by which public
  revenue is collected:&#8211; The monstrous customs duties that hamper intercourse
  between so-called Christian States; the taxes on occupations, on earnings,
  on investments; on the building of houses; on the cultivation of fields; on
industry and thrift in all forms.
<p>Can these be the ways that God has intended that Governments should raise
  the means they need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in
  any plan we can deem a right one?</p>
<p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
  the individual; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the scrupulous;
  their effect is, nay they are largely intended, to increase the price of what
  some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt governments ; they make
  oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and thrift; they
  lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing others. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Christianity and protection"></a>Christianity and protection</strong></p>
<p>What
  most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is the existing system of
raising public revenue is its influence on thought.</p>
<p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
  are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
  that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But, out of the
  system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its effects
  in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must buy, has
  grown the theory of &#8220;Protection,&#8221; which denies this gospel, which
  holds Christ ignorant of political economy, and proclaims laws for the nation
  utterly at variance with His teaching.</p>
<p>This theory sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of
  hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing
  on the productions of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed,
  on their own; and, instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood,
  it makes injury of foreigners a civic virtue. </p>
<p><strong><a name="A Revenue That Conforms to Mor"></a> A Revenue That Conforms to Moral
Law</strong></p>
<p>Can anything more clearly show that to tax the products and processes of industry
is not the way God intended Public Revenue to be raised.</p>
<p><b>But to consider what we propose &#8211; the raising of Public Revenue by
    collecting the annual value of land irrespective of improvements &#8211; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</b></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the value of land does not come from any exertion of labor
  or investment of capital on or in it &#8211; the values produced in this way
  being values of improvements which we would exempt. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Land values belong to the comm"></a> Land values belong to the community</strong></p>
<p>The value of land irrespective of improvements is the value that attaches
  to land by reason of increasing population and social progress. This value
  always goes to the owner as owner, and does not go to the user; for, if the
  user be a different person from the owner, he must always pay the owner for
  it in rent; while if the user be also the owner, it is as owner, not as user,
  that he receives it, and by renting the land he can, as owner, continue to
receive it after he ceases to be a user. </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="The product to the producer.

         
         
         "></a>The product to the producer</strong></p>
<p><b>Thus, to take the annual value of land irrespective of improvements cannot
    lessen the rewards of industry, nor in any way take from the individual what
    belongs to the individual. It can only take the value that attaches to land
    by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the community
as a whole.</b></p>
<p>To take land values for the State, abolishing all taxes on the products of
  labor, would leave to the laborer the full produce of labor; to the individual
  all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would impose no burden on
  industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift; it would secure the
  largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth, by leaving men free
  to produce and to exchange as they please, without any artificial enhancement
  of prices; and by taking far public purposes a value that cannot be carried
  off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is most easily ascertained and
  most certainly and cheaply collected, it would enormously lessen the number
  of officials, dispense with oaths, and do away with temptations to bribery
  and evasion. </p>
<p><strong><a name="How land values grow.

         
         
         "></a>How land values grow</strong></p>
<p>That God has intended the value of the land to serve for public revenue is
  shown by the order and degree in which land values increase with the growth
of the State.</p>
<p>In that primitive condition ere the need for the State arises there are no
  land values. The products of labor have value, but in the sparsity of population
  no value as yet attaches to land itself. But as increasing density of population
  and increasing elaboration of industry necessitate the organisation of the
  State, with its need for revenue, value begins to attach to land. As population
  still increases and industry grows more elaborate, so the need for public revenue
  increases; and at the same time, and from the same causes, land values increase.
  The connection is invariable.</p>
<p><b>The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of process tend
    steadily to reduce their cost.</b></p>
<p><b>But the value of land on which population centres goes up and up.</b> </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Land values in great cities.

         
         
         "></a>Land values in great cities.</strong></p>
<p>Take Rome, or Paris, or London, or New York, or Melbourne. Consider the enormous
  value of land in such cities as compared with the value of land in sparsely
  settled parts of the same countries. To what is this due? Is it not due to
  the density and activity of the populations of those cities &#8211; to the
  very causes that require great public expenditure for streets, drains, public
  buildings, and all the many things needed for the health, convenience, and
  safety of such great cities? See how with the growth of such cities the one
  thing that steadily increases in value is land; how the opening of roads, the
  building of railways, the making of any public improvement, adds to the value
of land. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Wise and beneficent provision."></a> Wise and beneficent
provision</strong></p>
<p>Is it not clear that here is a natural law &#8211; that is to say, a tendency
  willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else than that He Who ordained
  the State, with its needs, has, in the values which attach to land, provided
the means to meet those needs?</p>
<p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
  and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
  If we do so we may see in this natural law, by which land values increase with
  the growth of society, not only such a perfectly adapted provision for the
  needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions, by showing us the
  wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual that gratifies
  our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of His beneficence. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Natural revenue makes for soci"></a> Natural revenue makes
for social equality</strong></p>
<p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
  that increases in value is land &#8211; a natural law by virtue of which all
  growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements of
  whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the dictates
of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.</p>
<p>Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society is
  increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it not
  clear that this law by which land values increase with social advance while
  the values of the products of labor do not increase &#8211; tends, with the
  advance of civilisation, to make the share that goes equally to each member
  of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from his
  individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilisation lessen relatively
  the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between the strong
  and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show the purpose
  of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilisation should be an advance,
  not merely to larger powers, but to a greater and greater equality, instead
  of what we by our ignoring of His intent are making it &#8211; an advance towards
  a more and more monstrous inequality? </p>
<p><strong><a name="Alternatives make for injustic"></a> Alternatives
    make for injustice</strong></p>
<p><b>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for social
    needs is shown by the final proof. For refusal to take for public purposes
    the increasing values that attach to land with social growth is to necessitate
    the getting of public revenues by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution,
and corrupt society.</b></p>
<p>It is to have some <font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"
 color="#ff6600">to</font> take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
  only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilisation to combine the
  security of possession that is necessary to improvement with equality of natural
  opportunity &#8211; the most important of all natural rights.</p>
<p>It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality
  between man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
  for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilisation, for the gifts
  of God. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Land speculation and industrial"></a>Land speculation and
industrial depression</strong></p>
<p>It is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses of men thus suffer
  gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery. For the value that with
  the increase of population and social advance attaches to land being suffered
  to go to individuals who have secured ownership of the land, it prompts to
  a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever there is any prospect of
  advancing population or of coming improvement, thus producing an artificial
  scarcity of the natural element of life and labor, and a strangulation of production
  that shows itself in recurring spasms of industrial depression as disastrous
to the world as destructive wars.</p>
<p>Evil upon evil.</p>
<p>It is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
  only to bring there the same curses.</p>
<p>It is this that causes our material advance not merely to fail to improve
  the condition of the mere worker, but to make the condition of large classes
  positively worse.</p>
<p>It is this that, in our richest Christian countries, is giving us a large
  population whose lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than those
  of the veriest savages.</p>
<p>It is this that leads so many men to think that God is a bungler, and is constantly
  bringing people into the world for whom He has not made provision.</p>
<p><strong><a

<p><b>The poverty amid wealth and
      the seething discontent foreboding civil strife that characterise our civilisation
      of today are the inevitable results of our rejection of God&#8217;s beneficence,

      labor produces, and taking for the community the value that attaches to land

<p><b>Then, without drastic restrictive measures, the forestalling of land would
    cease. For then the possession of land would mean only security for the permanence
    of its use, and there would be no object for anyone to get land or to keep

    had confer any unjust advantage on him, or unjust deprivation on them, since

striking pronouncement</strong></p>
<p>The Right Reverend Dr. Thomas Nulty, Bishop of Meath, Ireland, who sees all
  this very clearly, has made striking testimony to the design of Divine Providence
  that the rent of land should be taken for the community. In a <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Nulty_BttL.html">pastoral
  letter</a> addressed to the clergy and laity of his diocese, April 2, 1881,
he says :</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;This great social fact is of incalculable importance; and,
  on the strictest principles of justice, it is not clouded even by a shadow
  of uncertainty or doubt. There is, moreover, a charm and a peculiar beauty
  in the clearness with which it reveals the wisdom and the benevolence of the
  designs of Providence in the admirable provision He has made for the wants
  and the necessities of that state of social existence in which the very instincts
  of nature tell us we are to spend our lives. A vast public property, a great
  national fund, has been placed under the dominion and at the disposal of the
  nation to supply itself abundantly with resources necessary to liquidate the
  expenses of its government and the administration of its laws.
    <p>&#8220;One of the most interesting peculiarities of this property is that
      its value is constantly progressive and increasing in a direct ratio to
      the growth of the population, and the very causes that increase and multiply
      the demands made on it increase proportionately its ability to meet them.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He says further:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Any settlement of the land of a country that would exclude
  the humblest man in that country from his share of the common inheritance would
  be not only an injustice and a wrong to that man, but, moreover, would be an
  impious resistance to the benevolent intentions of his Creator.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p><strong><a

         "></a> A beautiful economic law</strong></p>
<p>There is, indeed, as Bishop Nulty says, a peculiar beauty in the clearness
  with which the wisdom and benevolence of Providence are revealed in the provision
  made for the common needs of society in what economists call the law of rent.
  Of all the evidence that natural religion gives, it is this that most clearly
shows the existence of a beneficent God!</p>
<p>In this beautiful provision for social needs we see that God has intended
  civilisation; that all our discoveries and inventions do not, and cannot, outrun
  His forethought; and that steam, electricity, and labor-saving appliances only
  make the great moral laws clearer and more important.</p>
<p><strong><a name="The communal fund of land valu"></a> The communal fund of
land values.</strong></p>
<p>In the growth of this great fund, increasing with social advance &#8211; a
  fund that accrues from the growth of the community, and belongs, therefore;
  to the community &#8211; we see, not only that there is no need for the taxes
  that lessen wealth; that engender corruption, and promote inequality, but,
  that to take this fund for the purpose for which it was intended would secure
  to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s bounty &#8211; the abundant opportunity
to satisfy their wants and provide amply for every legitimate need of the State.</p>
<p>We see that God in His dealings with men has not been a bungler or a niggard;
  that He has not brought too many men into the world, that He has not neglected
  abundantly to supply them; that He has not intended that bitter competition
  of the masses for a mere animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of
  wealth
  which characterise our civilisation; but, that these evils, which lead so many
  to say there is no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s
  ordering, are due to our denial of His moral law. </p>
<p><strong>The golden rule.</strong></p>
<p><b>We see that the law of justice, the law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere
    counsel of perfection, but indeed the law of social life. We see that, if
    we were only to observe it, there would be work for ail, leisure for all,
    abundance for all; and that civilisation would tend to give to the poorest
not only necessaries, but all reasonable comforts and luxuries.</b></p>
<p><b>We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer when He told men that if they
    would seek the kingdom of God and its right doing they might no more worry
    about material things that do the lilies of the field about their raiment;
    but that He was only declaring what political economy in the light of modern
    discovery shows to be a sober truth.</b> </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Fallacious and evil methods.

         
         
         "></a>Fallacious and evil methods.</strong></p>
<p>There are many who, feeling bitterly the monstrous wrongs of the present distribution
  of wealth, are animated only by a blind hatred of the rich and fierce desire
  to destroy existing social adjustments. This class is indeed only less dangerous
than those who proclaim that no social improvement is needed or is possible. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Socialism.

         
         
         "></a>Socialism.</strong></p>
<p>The Socialists, as I understand them, and as
  the term has come to apply to anything like a definite theory, do not seek
  the abolition of all private property. Those who do this are properly called
Communists.</p>
<p>The Socialists seek the assumption by the State of capital (in which they
  vaguely and erroneously include land), or, more properly speaking, of large
  capitals, and State management and direction of at least the larger operations
  of industry. In this way they hope to abolish interest, which they regard as
  a wrong and an evil; to do away with the gains of exchangers, speculators,
  contractors, and middlemen, which they regard as waste; to do away with the
  wage system and secure general cooperation; and to prevent competition, which
  they deem the fundamental cause of the impoverishment of labor. The more moderate
  of them, without going so far, go in the same direction, and seek some remedy
  or palliation of the worst forms of poverty by Government regulation.</p>
<p>The essential character of Socialism is that it looks to the extension of
  the functions of the State for the remedy of social evils; that it would substitute
  regulation and direction for competition, and control by organised society
  for the free play of individual desire and effort. </p>
<p><strong><a name="The vice of socialism.

         
         
         "></a>The vice of socialism.</strong></p>
<p>The vice of Socialism in all its degrees is its want of radicalism, of going
to the root.</p>
<p>Its advocates generally teach the preposterous and degrading doctrine that
  slavery was the first condition of labor. It assumes that the tendency of wages
  to a minimum is the natural law, and seeks to abolish wages; it assumes that
  the natural result of competition is to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish
  competition by restrictions, prohibitions, and extensions of governing power.
  Thus, mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the state for hitting
  it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not worse are futile. </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Some phases of Socialism.

         
         
         "></a>Some phases of Socialism</strong></p>
<p>Associated though it is in many places with democratic aspiration, yet its
  essence is the same delusion to which the Children of Israel yielded when,
  against the protest of their prophet, they insisted on a king; the delusion
  that has everywhere corrupted democracies and enthroned, tyrants &#8211; that
  power over the people can be used for the benefit of the people; that there
  may be devised machinery that through human agencies will secure for the management
  of individual affairs more wisdom and mare virtue than the people themselves
  possess. This superficiality and this tendency may be seen in all the phases
of Socialism.</p>
<p>Though not usually classed as Socialists; both the Trade Unionists and the
  Protectionists have the same essential character. Take, for instance, Protectionism.
  The Protectionists seek by governmental prohibitions or taxes on imports to
  regulate the industry and control the exchanges of their country, so as they
  imagine, to diversify home industries and prevent the competition of people
  of other countries.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Protectionism &#8211; an ally of soc"></a> Protectionism &#8211; an
ally of socialism</strong></p>
<p>What support Protectionism has, beyond the mere selfish desire of sellers
  to compel buyers to pay them more than their goods are worth, springs from
  such superficial ideas as that production, not consumption, is the end of effort;
  that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s worth, and to sell more profitable
  than to buy; and, above all, from a desire to limit competition, springing
  from an unanalysing recognition of the phenomena that necessarily follow when
  men who have the need to labor are deprived by monopoly of access to the natural
and indispensable element of all labor.</p>
<p>Its methods involve the idea that Governments can more wisely direct the expenditure
  of labor and the investment of capital than can laborers and capitalists, and
  that the men who control Governments will use this power for the general good
  and not in their own interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict liberty,
  invent crimes. They promote perjury, fraud, and corruption. And they would,
  were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilisation and
  reduce mankind to savagery. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Trades unionism &#8211; another ally"></a> Trades unionism &#8211; another
ally</strong></p>
<p>Take Trades Unionism. The Trade Unionists seek the increase of wages, the
  reduction of working hours, and the general improvement in the condition of
  wage workers by organising them into guilds or associations which shall fix
  the rates at which they will sell their labor, shall deal as one body with
  employers in case of dispute, shall use on occasion their necessary weapon,
  the strike, and shall accumulate funds for such purposes and for the purpose
of assisting members when on strike, or (sometimes) when out of employment.</p>
<p>While within narrow lines trades unionism promotes the idea of the mutuality
  of interests, and often helps to raise courage and further political education,
  and while it has enabled limited bodies of working-men to improve somewhat
  their condition, and gain, as it were, breathing space, yet it takes no note
  of the general causes that determine the condition of labor, and strives for
  the elevation of only a small part of the great body by means that cannot help
  the rest. </p>
<p><strong><a name="A caste system.

         
         
         "></a>A caste system</strong></p>
<p>Aiming at the restriction of competition &#8211; the limitation of the right
  to labor &#8211; its methods are like those of an army, which even in a righteous
  cause are subversive of liberty and liable to abuse, while its weapon, the
  strike, is destructive in its nature both to combatants and non-combatants,
  being a form of passive war. To apply the principle of Trades Unionism to all
industry, as some dream of doing, would be to enthrall men in a caste system.</p>
<p>Or take even such moderate measures as the limitation of working hours and
  of the labor of women and children. They are superficial in looking no further
  than to the eagerness of men and women and little children to work unduly,
  and in proposing forcibly to restrain overwork while utterly ignoring its cause,
  the sting of poverty that forces human beings to it.</p>
<p>And the methods by which these restraints must be enforced, multiply officials,
  interfere with personal liberty, tend to corruption, and are liable to abuse. </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Thorough-going socialism.

         
         
         "></a>Thorough-going socialism</strong></p>
<p>As for through-going Socialism &#8211; which is the more to be honoured as
  having the courage of its convictions &#8211; it would carry these vices to
  full expression jumping to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it
  fails to see that oppression does not come from the nature of capital, but
  from the wrong that robs labor by divorcing it from land, and that creates
a fictitious capital that is really capitalised monopoly.</p>
<p>It fails to see that it would be impossible for capital to oppress labor were
  labor free to the natural material of production; that the wage system itself
  springs from mutual convenience, being a form of cooperation in which one of
  the parties prefers a certain to a contingent result, and that what it calls
  the &#8220;iron law of wages&#8221; is not the natural law of wages; but only
  the law of wages in that unnatural condition in which men are made helpless
  by being deprived of the materials for life and work.</p>
<p>It fails to see that what it mistakes for the evils of competition are really
  the evils of restricted competition are due to a one-sided competition to which
  men are forced when deprived of land; whilst its methods, the organisation
  of men into industrial armies, the direction and control of all production
  and exchange by governmental or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried
  to full expression, mean Egyptian despotism. </p>
<p><strong><a name="The anarchists.

         
         
         "></a>The anarchists</strong></p>
<p>At the opposite extreme are the Anarchists, a term which, though frequently
  applied to mere violent destructionists, refers also to those who, seeing the
  many evils of too much government, regard government in itself as evil, and
  believe that in the absence of coercive power the mutual interests of men would
  secure voluntarily what cooperation is needed. The Philosophical Anarchists
  of whom I speak are few in number. It is with Socialism in its various phases
that we have to do battle. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Enforced and voluntary communi"></a> Enforced and voluntary
communism</strong></p>
<p>Those for whom I would speak, believing that the rights of true property are
  sacred, would regard forcible Communism as robbery that would bring destruction.
  But we would not deny that voluntary Communism might be the highest possible
  state, nor that it is possible for mankind to attain it, since among the early
  Christians and among the Religious Orders we have examples of Communistic Societies
on a small scale.</p>
<p>Knowing these things, we cannot take it on ourselves to say that a social
  condition may not be possible in which an all-embracing love shall have taken
  the place of all other motives. But we see that Communism is only possible
  where there exists a general and intense religious faith, and we see that such
  a state can be reached only through a state of justice. For before a man can
  be a saint he must first be an honest man. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Social and individual natures"></a> Social and individual
natures of Man</strong></p>
<p>From both Anarchists and Socialists we fundamentally differ.
  We regard them as erring in opposite directions &#8211; the one in ignoring
  the social nature of man, the other in ignoring his individual nature. While
  we see
  that man is primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil has come or
  can come from the interference by the State with things that belong to individual
  action, we also see that he is a social being, and that the State is requisite
  to social advance, having an indispensable place in the natural order.</p>
<p>Looking on the bodily organism as the analogue of the social organism, the
  Anarchists seem to us like men who would try to get along without heads, and
  the Socialists like men who would try to rule the wonderfully complex and delicate
  internal relations of their frames by conscious will. </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Difference as to remedies.

         
         
         "></a>Difference as to remedies</strong></p>
<p>We differ from the Socialists in our diagnosis of the evil, and we differ
from them as to remedies.</p>
<p>We have no fear of capital, regarding it as the natural handmaiden of labor;
  we look on interest in itself as natural and just; we would set no limit to
  accumulation; we see no evil in competition, but deem unrestricted competition
  to be as necessary to the health of the industrial and social organism as the
  free circulation of the blood is to the health of the bodily organism &#8211; to
  be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation is to be secured.</p>
<p>We could simply take for the community what belongs to the community, the
  value that attaches to land by the growth of the community; leave sacredly
  to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and treating necessary
  monopolies as functions of the State, abolish all restrictions and prohibitions
  save those required for public health, safety, morals, and convenience. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Government regulation verses n"></a> Government regulation
verses natural law</strong></p>
<p>The fundamental difference is in this: Socialism in all its phases looks on
  the evils of our civilisation as springing from the inadequacy or inharmony
  of natural relations, which must be artificially organised or improved. In
  its idea there develops on the State the necessity of organising the industrial
  relations of men, the construction, as it were, of a great machine whose complicated
parts shall properly work together under the direction of human intelligence.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Socialism tends towards Atheism. Failing to see the
  order and symmetry of natural law, it fails to recognise God!</p>
<p>We, on the other hand, see in the social and industrial relations of men not
  a machine which requires construction, but an organism which needs only to
  be suffered to grow.</p>
<p>We see in the natural social and industrial laws such harmony as we see in
  the adjustments of the human body, and which as far transcends the power of
  man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct as it is beyond: man&#8217;s intelligence
  to order and direct the vital movements of his frame.</p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Do justice and give freedom.

         
         
         "></a>Do justice and give freedom</strong></p>
<p>We see in these social and industrial laws so close a relation to the moral
  law as must spring from the same Authorship, and that proves the moral law
  to be the sure guide of man where his intelligence would wander and go astray.
  This is the reason why our beliefs tend towards, nay, are indeed the only beliefs
  consistent with a recognition of the Supreme Law which men must follow if they
would secure prosperity and avoid destruction.</p>
<p>This is the reason why to us Political Economy only serves to show the depths
  of wisdom in the simple truths which common people heard gladly from the lips
  of the Carpenter of Nazareth!</p>
<p>Thus, to us, all that is needed to remedy the evils of our time is to do justice
  and give freedom.</p>
<p><strong><a

<p><b>It is because that in what we propose &#8211; the securing to all men of
    equal natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers and the removal
    of all legal restriction on the legitimate exercise of those powers we see
    the conformation of human law to the moral law; that we hold with confidence
    not merely that this is a sufficient remedy for the present condition of
labor, but that it is the only possible remedy!</b> </p>
<p><strong><a name="Labour&#8217;s storehouse and worksh"></a>Labor&#8217;s storehouse

<p>Nor is there any other. The organisation of man is such, his relations to
  the world in which he is placed are such &#8211; that is to say, the immutable
  laws of God are such that it is beyond the power of human ingenuity to devise
  any way by which the evils born of the injustice that robs men of their birthright
  can be removed otherwise than by opening to all the bounty that God has provided
for all!</p>
<p><b>Since man can live only on land and from land since land is the reservoir
    of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is taken, and on which
    he must draw for all that he can produce &#8211; does it not irresistibly
    follow that to give the land in ownership to some men and to deny to others
    all right to it is to divide mankind into the rich and the poor, the privileged
    and the helpless?</b></p>
<p><strong><a
 name="The iron law of values.

         
         
         "></a> The iron law of values</strong></p>
<p>Does it not follow that those who have no rights to the use of land can live
only by selling their labor to those who own the land?</p>
<p>Does it not follow that what the Socialists call &#8220;the iron law of wages,&#8221; what
  the political economists term &#8220;the tendency of wages to a minimum,&#8221; must
  take from the landless mass of mere laborers &#8211; who of themselves have
  no power to use their labor &#8211; the benefits of any advance or improvement
  that does not alter this unjust division of land?</p>
<p>Having no Power to employ themselves, they must, either as labor-sellers or
  land-renters, compete with one another for permission to labor; and this competition
  with one another of men shut out from God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse,
  must ultimately force wages to their lowest point, the point at which life
  can just be maintained. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Land monopoly makes labour hel"></a> Land monopoly makes
labor helpless</strong></p>
<p>This is not to say that all wages must fall to this point,
  but that the wages of that necessarily largest stratum of laborers who have only
  ordinary knowledge, skill, and aptitude, must so fall. The wages of special classes,
  who are fenced off from the pressure of competition by peculiar knowledge, skill,
  or other causes, may remain above that ordinary level.</p>
<p>Thus, where the ability to read and write is rare its possession enables a
  man to obtain higher wages than the ordinary laborer. But as the diffusion
  of education makes the ability to read and write general, this advantage is
  lost. So, when a vocation requires special training or skill, or is made difficult
  of access by artificial restrictions, the checking of competition tends to
  keep wages in it at a higher level. But as the progress of invention dispenses
  with peculiar skill, or artificial restrictions are broken dawn, these higher
  wages sink to the ordinary level. And so, it is only so long as they are special
  that such qualities as industry, prudence, and thrift can enable the ordinary
  laborer to maintain a condition above that which gives a mere living. Where
  they become general, the law of competition must eventually reduce the earnings
  or savings of such qualities to the general level. </p>
<p><strong><a

         "></a>Labor-saving improvements</strong></p>
<p>Land being necessary to life and labor, where private property in land has
  divided society into a landowning class and a landless class, there is no possible
  invention or improvement, whether it be industrial, social, or moral, which,
  so long as it does not affect the ownership of land can prevent poverty or
relieve the general conditions of mere laborers.</p>
<p><b>For, whether the effect of any invention or improvement be to increase
    what labor can produce or to decrease what is required to support the laborer,
    it can, so soon as it becomes general, result only in increasing the income
    of the owners of land, without benefiting the mere laborers.</b> </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Where has the benefit gone?

         
         
         "></a>Where has the benefit gone?</strong></p>
<p>How true this is we may see
  in the facts of today. In our own time invention and discovery have enormously
  increased the productive power of labor, and at the same time greatly reduced
the cost of many things necessary to the support of the laborer.</p>
<p>Have not the benefits of these improvements mainly gone to the owners of land &#8211; enormously
  increased land values?</p>
<p>I say mainly, for some part of the benefit has gone to the cost of monstrous
  standing armies and warlike preparations; to the payment of interest on great
  public debts; and, largely disguised as interest on fictitious capital, to
  the owners of monopolies other than that of land.</p>
<p><strong><a name="The paradox.

         
         
         "></a> The paradox</strong></p>
<p>But, were standing armies and all their incidents abolished, were all monopolies
  other than that of land done away with, were Governments to become models of
  economy, were the profits of speculators, of middlemen, of all sorts of exchangers
  saved &#8211; the result would not differ from that which has followed the
increase of productive power.</p>
<p>Is it not true that if there were proposed today, what all Christian men ought
  to pray for, the complete disbandment of all the armies of Europe, the greatest
  fears would be aroused for the consequences of throwing on the labor market
  so many unemployed laborers?</p>
<p>The explanation of this and of similar paradoxes that in our time perplex
  on every side may easily be seen. </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Disinherited from the Earth.

         
         
         "></a>Disinherited from the Earth</strong></p>
<p>The effect of all inventions and improvements that increase productive power
  that save waste and economise effort, is to lessen the labor required for a
  given result, and thus to save labor, so that we speak of them as labor-saving
inventions or improvements.</p>
<p>Now, in a natural state of society, where the rights of all to the use of
  the earth are acknowledged, labor-saving improvements might go to the very
  utmost that can be imagined without lessening the demand for men, since in
  such natural conditions the demand for men lies in their own enjoyment of life
  and the strong instincts that the Creator has implanted in the human breast.</p>
<p>But, in that unnatural state of society where the masses of men are disinherited
  of all but the power to labor when opportunity to labor is given them by others,
  there the demand for them becomes simply the demand for their services by those
  who hold this opportunity &#8211; and man himself becomes a commodity. Hence,
  although the natural effect of labor-saving improvements is to increase wages,
  yet in the unnatural condition which private ownership of the land begets,
  the effect, even of such moral improvements as the disbandment of armies, is,
  by lessening the commercial demand, to lower wages.</p>
<p>If labor-saving inventions and improvements could be carried, to the very
  abolition of the necessity for labor, what would be the result? Would it not
  be that landowners could then get all the wealth that the land was capable
  of producing, and would have no need at all for laborers, who must then either
  starve or live as pensioners on the bounty of the landowners? </p>

<p>So long as private property in land continues &#8211; so long as some men
  are treated as owners of the earth, and other men live on it only by their
  sufferance &#8211; human wisdom can devise no means by which the evils of our
present condition may be avoided.</p>
<p>Could even the wisdom of God do so? How could He? Should He infuse new vigour
  into the sunlight, new virtue into the air; new fertility into the soil, would
  not all this new bounty go to the owners of the land?</p>
<p>Should He open the minds of men to the possibilities of new substances, new
  adjustments, new powers, would this do any more to relieve poverty than steam,
  electricity and all the numberless discoveries and inventions of our time have
  done?</p>
<p>Or, if He were to send down from the heavens above or cause to gush up from
  the subterranean depths, food, clothing &#8211; all the things that satisfy
  man&#8217;s material desires to whom under our laws would all these belong?
  Would not this increase and extension of His bounty merely enable the privileged
  class more riotously to roll in wealth, and bring the disinherited class to
  more widespread pauperism?</p>

 color="#ff6600"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The miserly and wretchedness
      are alike</span> </font>felt in countries of different religions and of
      none; in monarchies and republics; where industry is simple and where it
      is elaborate; and amid all varieties of industrial customs and relations.
And, there is one world-wide common cause!</p>
<p>This common cause is clear when we consider that, since labor must find its
  workshop and reservoir in land, the labor question is but another name for
  the land question! And see how fully adequate is this cause! </p>
<p><strong><a name="Root of the evil.

         
         
         "></a>Root of the evil</strong></p>
<p>The most important of all the material relations of man is his relation to
  the planet he inhabits, and hence, the &#8220;impious resistance to the benevolent
  intentions of his Creator,&#8221; which, as Bishop Nulty says, is involved
  in private property in land, must produce evil, wherever it exists. And, further,
  as by virtue of the law, unto whom much is given, from him much is required, &#8220;the
  very progress of civilisation makes the evils produced by private property
in land more widespread and intense.&#8221;</p>
<p>What is producing throughout the civilised world the present condition of
  things is not this and that local error or minor mistake. It is nothing less
  than the progress of civilisation itself; nothing less than the intellectual
  advance and the material growth in which our century has been so pre-eminent,
  acting in a state of society based on private property in land.</p>
<p>It is nothing less than the newer gifts that in our time have been showered
  on man, being turned into scourges by man&#8217;s impious resistance to the
  benevolent intentions of his Creator. </p>
<p><strong><a

         "></a>Blessings turned into curses</strong></p>
<p>The discoveries of science,
  the gains of invention, have given to us in this wonderful century more than
  has been given to men in any time before, and, in a degree so rapidly accelerating
  as to suggest geometrical progression, are placing in our hands new material
wonders.</p>
<p>But with the benefit comes the obligation: In a civilisation beginning to
  pulse with steam and electricity, where the sun paints pictures and the phonograph
  stores speech, it will not do to be merely as just as were our fathers. Intellectual
  advance and material advance require corresponding moral advance. Knowledge
  and power are neither good nor evil. They are not ends but means evolving forces
  that if not controlled in orderly relations must take disorderly and destructive
  forms.</p>
<p>The increasing perplexity, the growing discontent, mean nothing less than
  that forces of destruction swifter and more terrible than those that have shattered
  every preceding civilisation are already menacing ours; that if it does not
  quickly rise to a higher moral level; if it does not become in deed as in word
  a Christian civilisation on the wall of its splendour must share the doom of
  Babylon: &#8220;Thou are weighed in the balance and found wanting!&#8221; </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Some so-called remedies.

         
         
         "></a>Some so-called remedies</strong></p>
<p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
  remedies for the evil condition of labor. I will now, specifically, but briefly,
refer to some proposals which have a wide and strong appeal.</p>
<p>That the State should step in to prevent overwork; to restrict the employment
  of women and children; to secure sanitary conditions in workshops; to regulate
  wages; to encourage settlement, and the acquisition of land by working-men;
  and the formation of working-men&#8217;s associations.</p>
<p>The tendency and spirit of these remedial suggestions lean unmistakably to
  socialism &#8211; extremely moderate Socialism it is true, yet Socialism still.
  And how little may in this way be accomplished! </p>
<p><strong><a name="Mere palliatives.

         
         
         "></a>Mere palliatives</strong></p>
<p>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate the conditions
  of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward democracy, and democratic
  States are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while, in the industrial slavery
  growing out of private ownership of land that prevails in Christendom today,
  it is not the master who forces the slave to labor, but the slave who urges
the master to let him labor.</p>
<p>Thus, the greatest difficulty in enforcing such regulations comes from those
  whom they are intended to benefit. It is not, far instance, the masters who
  make it difficult to enforce restrictions on child labor in factories, but
  the mothers, who, Prompted by poverty, misrepresent the ages of their children
  even to the masters and teach the children to misrepresent.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Factory laws.

         
         
         "></a>Factory laws</strong></p>
<p>While in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, wages, etc., though
  subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
  may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far wider
branches of industry, where the laborer works for himself or for small employers?</p>
<p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding that is
  generally prescribed with them &#8211; the restriction under penalty of the
  number who may occupy a room and the demolition of insanitary buildings. Since
  these measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation, nor to augment
  ability to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in some places
  goes on in other places, and to a worse degree.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Economic pressure.

         
         
         "></a>Economic pressure</strong></p>
<p>All such remedies begin at the wrong end. They are like putting on brake and
  bit to hold in quietness horses that are being lashed into frenzy; like trying
to stop a locomotive by holding its wheels, instead of shutting off steam.</p>
<p>Men do not overwork themselves because they like it; it is not in the nature
  of the mother&#8217;s heart to send children to work when they ought to be
  at play; not of choice will laborers work in dangerous and insanitary conditions.</p>
<p>These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting of poverty. And so long
  as the poverty of which they are an expression is left untouched, such restrictions
  can have only partial and evanescent results. The cause remaining, repression
  in one place can only bring out its effects in other places, and the task assigned
  to the State is as hopeless as to ask it to lower the level of the ocean by
  bailing out the sea.</p>
<p><strong><a name="State regulation of wages impo"></a> State regulation of
wages impossible</strong></p>
<p>Nor can the State cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond the
  power of the State to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of interest.
  Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect they have ever
  had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay, and for the same
  reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price of goods have always
resulted merely in increasing their price.</p>
<p>The general rate of wages is fixed by the ease or difficulty with which labor
  can obtain access to land, ranging from the full earnings of labor, where land
  is free; to the least on which laborers can live and reproduce, where land
  is fully monopolised.</p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Wages and the land question.

         
         
         "></a>Wages and the land question</strong></p>
<p>Thus, where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
  the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe,
  and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work there for wages
  that they would gladly accept at home; while now, as monopolisation goes on
  under the influence of private property in land, wages tend to fall, and the
social conditions of Europe to appear.</p>
<p>Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land,
  the many attempts of the British Parliaments to reduce wages by regulation
  failed utterly: And so, when the institution of private property in land had
  done its work in England, all attempts of Parliament to raise wages proved
  unavailing.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings
  of laborers by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
  what wages employers paid.
</p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Where state regulation leads.

         
         
         "></a>Where state regulation leads</strong></p>
<p>The State could only maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for,
  as I have shown, labor deprived of land becomes a commodity) by offering employment
  to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and supporting them
with its funds.</p>
<p>Thus it is that the thorough-going Socialists who want the State to take all
  industry into its hands are much more logical than those timid Socialists who
  propose that the State should regulate private industry &#8211; but only a
  little.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Peasant proprietorship no salv"></a> Peasant proprietorship no salvation</strong></p>
<p>The same hopelessness attends the suggestion that working people should be
  encouraged by the State to obtain a share of the land. It is proposed that,
  as is being attempted in Ireland, the State shall buy out large land owners
  in favour of small ones, thus establishing peasant proprietors.
<p>Supposing that this can be done, even to a considerable extent, what will
  be accomplished save to substitute a larger privileged class for a smaller
  privileged class? What will be done for the still larger class that must remain
  the laborers of the agricultural districts, the workmen of the towns, the proletarians
  of the cities?</p>
<p>Is it not true, as Professor De Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium,
  where peasant proprietary exists, the tenants (for there still exist tenants)
  are rack-rented with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that
  in such countries as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is worse than
  it is in Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the State attempts
  to buy up land for peasant proprietors, will not the effect be, what is seen
  today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more
  difficult far those. not so favoured, and for those who will came after, to
  get land?</p>
<p><strong><a name="Subsidised industries unjustif"></a> Subsidised industries
unjustifiable</strong></p>
<p>How, moreover, is it possible to justify State aid to one man to buy a bit
  of land without also insisting on State aid to another man to buy a donkey,
  to another to buy a shop, to another to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8211; State
  aid, in short, to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks
that he could?
<p><strong><a name="Coercion by the State.

         
         
         "></a>Coercion by the State</strong>
<p>And is not this Communism &#8211; not the Communism of the early Religious
  Orders, but Communism that uses the coercive power of the State to take rightful
  property by force from those who have to give to those who have not?
<p>For the State has no purse of Fortunatus; the State cannot repeat the miracle
  of the loaves and fishes; and, whether it gives or lends money, or gives or
  lends credit, it cannot give to those who have not without taking from those
  who have.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Small holdings futile.

         
         
         "></a>Small holdings futile</strong></p>
<p>Aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining private
  property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot co-exist with the treatment
  of land as private property where civilisation is materially advancing and
  wealth augments.
<p>We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient times were the
  main cause that transformed world conquering Italy from a land of small farms
  to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact, that, while two centuries
  ago the majority of English farmers were owners of the land they tilled, tenancy
  has, been for a long time the all but universal condition of the English farmer.
  And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity have come to urge concentration.
  It is in the United States that we may see on the largest scale how their power
  is operating to turn a nation of landowners into a nation of tenants.</p>
<p><strong><a name="The only way.

         
         
         "></a>The only way</strong></p>
<p><b>The principle is clear and irresistible. Material progress makes land more
    valuable, and when this increasing value is left to private owners land must
    pass from the ownership of the poor into the ownership of the rich, just
    as diamonds so pass when poor men find them.</b>
<p><b>There is one way, and only one way, in which working people in our civilisation
    may be secured a share in the land of their country, and that is the way
    that we propose &#8211; the taking of the profits of land ownership for the
    community!</b></p>

<p>Working-men&#8217;s associations may promote fraternity among their members,
  extend social intercourse, and provide assurance in case of sickness or death &#8211; but
if they go no further they are powerless to affect wages even among their members.</p>
<p>As to trade unions proper, the attitude of many good people is one of warm
  approbation provided that they do not go too far. <font
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#ff3300">For these good people abject to
  strikes they reprehend </font>societies that do their best to get into their

  that arbitration might take the place of strikes.</p>
<p><strong><a

         "></a>The strike and the boycott</strong></p>
<p>Yet they express ideas and make assertions that are all that the Trade Unionist
  would ask, not merely to justify the strike and the boycott, but even the use
  of violence where only violence would suffice. For they speak of the insufficient
  wages of workmen as due to the greed of rich employers; they assume the moral
  right of the workman to obtain employment from others at wages greater than
  those others are willing freely to give; and they deny the right of anyone
  to work for such wages as he pleases, in such a way as to give the impression
  that &#8220;<a
 name="blacklegging"></a>blacklegging,&#8221; i.e., the working for less than &#8220;union
wages,&#8221; is a crime.</p>
<p>To men conscious of bitter injustice, to men steeped in poverty, yet mocked
  by flaunting wealth, such words mean more than I think is realised.</p>
<p><strong><a

<p>When fire shall be coal and ice be warm, when armies shall throw away
          lead and iron, to try conclusions by the pelting of rose leaves, such
          labor associations as these goad people are thinking of may be possible.
          But not till then.
<p>For labor associations can do nothing to raise wages but by force. It may
  be force applied passively, or force applied actively, or force held in reserve,
  but it must be force. They must coerce or hold the power to coerce employers;
  they must coerce those among their own members disposed to straggle; they must
  do their best to get into their hands the whole field of labor they seek to
  occupy and to force other working-men either to join them or to starve. Those
  who speak of trade unions bent on raising wages by moral suasion alone are
  like those who would tell you of tigers that live on oranges.</p>
<p><strong><a name="The closed door.

         
         
         "></a>The closed door</strong></p>
<p>The condition of the masses today is that of men pressed together in a hall
  where ingress is open and more are constantly coming, but where the doors for
  egress are closed. If forbidden to relieve the general pressure by throwing
  open those doors, whose bars and bolts are private property in land, they can
  only mitigate the pressure on themselves by forcing back others, and the weakest
  must be driven to the wall! This is the way of labor unions and Trade Guilds.
  Even the most peaceable societies would in their efforts to find employment
for their own members displace others.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Philanthropy helpless.

         
         
         "></a>Philanthropy helpless</strong></p>
<p>Even the philanthropy which, recognising the evil of trying to help labor
  by alms, seeks to help men to help themselves by finding them work, becomes
  aggressive in the blind and bitter struggle that private property in land entails,
and in helping one set of men injures others.</p>
<p>Thus, to minimise the bitter complaints of taking work from others and lessening
  the wages of others in providing their own beneficiaries with work and wages,
  benevolent societies are forced to devices akin to the digging of holes and
  filling them up again.</p>

<p>Those who know of it, I am sure,
    honour the princely generosity of Baron Hirsch towards his suffering co-religionists.
    But, as I write, the daily newspapers contain accounts of an immense meeting
    held in Cooper Union, New York City, at which a number of Hebrew trades unions
    protested in the strongest manner against the loss of work and reduction
  of wages that is being effected by Baron Hirsch&#8217;s generosity in bringing
  their own countrymen here and teaching them to work.</p>
<p>The resolution unanimously adopted at this great meeting thus concludes: &#8220;We
  now demand of Baron Hirsch himself that he release us from his &#8216;charity&#8217; and
  take back the millions, which, instead of a blessing, have proved a curse and
  a source of misery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor does this show that the members of these Hebrew labor unions; who are
  themselves immigrants of the same class as those Baron Hirsch is striving to
  help &#8211; are a whit less generous than other men.</p>

<p>Labor associations of the nature

  they must fight for their own hand, regardless of who is hurt; they ignore
  and must ignore the teaching of Christ that we should do to others as we would
  have them do to us, which a true political economy shows is the only way to
  the full emancipation of the masses; they must do their best to starve workmen
  who do not join them; they must by all means in their power force back the &#8220;<a href="#blacklegging">blackleg</a>&#8221; &#8211; as

<p>And who is the blackleg? A fellow-creature seeking work &#8211; a fellow creature

<p>I speak without prejudice against trade unions, of which for years I was an

  of large and permanent benefits, and that their methods violate natural rights
  and work hardship and injustice, I am only saying what by word of mouth I have
  again and again said to them.</p>
<p>Nor is what I say capable of dispute. Intelligent Trade Unionists know it,
  and the less intelligent vaguely feel it. And even those of the classes of

<p>Some of the results that follow from trades unionism are brought to notice
  in the sequel to the great London dock strike of 1889. They are presaged in
  a volume called &#8220;The Story of the Dockers&#8217; Strike&#8221; (written
  by Messrs. Llewellyn Smith and Vaughan Nash, with an introduction by Sydney
  Buxton, M.P.), which advocates trades unionism as the solution of the labor
  question, and of which large numbers were sent to Australia as a sort of official
recognition of the generous aid received from there by the strikers.</p>
<p><strong><a name=".The worker pressed to the wall"></a>The worker pressed to
the wall</strong></p>
<p>The following passages are taken from the Authors&#8217; summing
  up, on pages 164-5:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;If the settlement lasts, work at the docks will be more regular,
  better paid, and carried on under better conditions than ever before. All this
  will be an unqualified gain to those who get the benefit from it. But another
  result will undoubtedly be to contract the field of employment and lessen the
  number of those for whom work can be found. The lower class casual will, in
  the end, find his position more precarious than ever before, in proportion
  to the increased regularity of work which the fitter of the laborers will secure.
  The effect of the organisation of dock labor, as of all classes of labor, will
  be to squeeze out the residuum. The failures in the industrial race will be
  no gainers by the change, but will rather find another door closed against
  them, and this in many cases the last door to employment.&#8221; </blockquote>

<p>I am far from wishing that any of my readers should join in that pharisaical
  denunciation of trade unions common among those who, while quick to point out
  the injustice of trade unionism denying to others the equal right to work,
  are themselves supporters of that more primary injustice that denies the equal
right to the standing place and natural material necessary to work.</p>
<p>What I wish to point out is that trades unionism, while it may be a partial
  palliative, is not a remedy; that it has not that moral character which could
  alone justify one in urging it as good in itself.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Wage-workers who are often for"></a> Wage-workers who are
often forgotten</strong></p>
<p>It is often assumed that the labor question is a question between wage-workers
  and their employers; but working for an employer is not the primary or exclusive
  occupation of labor. Primarily men work for themselves without the intervention
  of an employer. And the primary source of wages is in the earnings of labor,
  the man who works for himself and consumes his own products receiving his wages
in the fruits of his labor.</p>
<p>Are not fishermen, boatmen, cab-drivers, peddlers, working farmers &#8211; in
  short, all the many workers who get their wages directly by the sale of their
  services or products without the medium of an employer &#8211; as much laborers
  as those who work for the specific wages of an employer?</p>
<p>In considering remedies these workers are seldom thought of. Yet in reality
  the laborers who work for themselves should be first considered, since what
  men will be willing to accept from employers depends manifestly on what they
  can get by working for themselves.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Employers.

         
         
         "></a>Employers</strong></p>
<p>It is assumed that all employers are rich men, who might raise wages much
  higher were they not so grasping. But is it not the fact that the great majority
  of employers are as much pressed by competition as their workmen &#8211; many
  of them constantly on the verge of failure? Such employers could not raise
  the wages they pay, however they might wish to, unless all others were compelled
to do so.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Rich and Poor.

         
         
         "></a>Rich and Poor</strong></p>
<p>It is assumed that there are in the natural order
      two classes, the rich and the poor, and that laborers naturally belong
    to the poor.
            It is true that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
    in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
            however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor.
            The natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not
    greater
            than are natural differences in stature. But while it is only by
    selecting giants and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as others,
    yet
            in the difference between rich and poor that exists today we find
    some men richer than others by the thousand-fold and the million-fold!</p>
<p><strong><a name="Tribute receivers and tribute"></a> Tribute receivers and

<p>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
  in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and poor
  is the difference between those who hold the toll gates and those who pay toll;
between tribute receivers and tribute yielders.</p>
<p><b>To assume that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are naturally poor
    is to ignore the fact that labor is the producer of wealth, and to attribute
    to the Natural Law of the Creator an injustice that comes from man&#8217;s
    impious violation of His benevolent intention.</b></p>
<p>In the rudest stage of the arts it is possible, where justice prevails, for
  all well men to earn a living. With the labor-saving appliances of our time,
  it should be possible for all to earn much more. And so, to say that poverty
  is no disgrace, is to convey an unreasonable implication; since, in a condition
  of social justice, it would, except where sought from religious motives or
  imposed by unavoidable misfortune, imply recklessness or laziness.</p>

<p>Consider how the rich see the meaner side of human nature; how they are surrounded
  by flatterers and sycophants; how they must constantly be on guard lest they
  be swindled; how, often, they must suspect an ulterior motive behind kindly
  deed or friendly word; how, if they try to be generous, they are beset by shameless
  beggars and scheming impostors!</p>
<p><strong><a name="Man&#8217;s higher qualities distort"></a> Man&#8217;s higher
qualities distorted</strong></p>
<p>The worst evil of poverty is not in the want of material
  things, but in the stunting and distortion of the higher qualities. So, in another
  way, the possession of unearned wealth stunts and distorts what is noblest in
  man.</p>
<p>The evil is not in wealth itself &#8211; in its command over material things:
  it is in the possession of wealth while others are steeped in poverty; in being
  raised above touch with the life of humanity; from its work and its struggles,
  its hopes and its fears, and the kind sympathies and generous acts that strengthen
  faith in man and trust in God!</p>
<p>God&#8217;s commands cannot be evaded with impunity. If it be His command
  that men shall earn their bread by labor, the idle rich must suffer. And they
  do!</p>
<p>See the utter vacancy of the lives of those who live for pleasure; see the
  vices bred in a class who, surrounded by poverty, are sated with wealth; see
  the pessimism that grows among them; see that terrible punishment of ennui,
  of which the poor know so little that they cannot understand it! </p>
<p><strong><a name="The rich young man.

         
         
         "></a>The rich young man</strong></p>
<p>When Christ told the rich young man who sought Him to sell all he had and
  to give it to the poor, He was not thinking of the poor, but of the young man.
  And I doubt not that among the rich, and especially among the self made rich,
  there are many who, at times at least, feel keenly the folly of the riches
and fear for the dangers and temptations to which these expose their children.</p>
<p>But the strength of long habit, the promptings of pride, the excitement of
  making and holding what has become for them the counters in a game, the family
  expectations that have assumed the character of rights, and the real difficulty
  they find in making any good use of their wealth, bind them to their burden,
  like a weary donkey to his pack, till they stumble on the precipice that bounds
  this life!</p>
<p><strong><a name="The fear of want.

         
         
         "></a>The fear of want</strong></p>
<p>Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
  dictates. But, with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
  globe, life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the fear
  of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their quest of
  game. And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to seek it &#8211; what
makes it so envied and admired &#8211; the fear of want!</p>
<p><strong><a name="Rich and poor are alike victim"></a> Rich and poor are alike
victims</strong></p>
<p>As the unduly rich are the corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying
  quality of riches but the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades. The
  real evil lies in the injustice from which unnatural possession and unnatural
deprivation both spring.</p>
<p>This injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes. The existence
  of private property in land is a great social wrong from which society at large
  suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are alike victims, though
  at the opposite extremes. Seeing this, if seems like a violation of Christian
  charity to speak of the rich as though they individually were responsible for
  the sufferings of the poor. Yet many do this while at the same time insisting
  that land monopoly, the cause of monstrous wealth and degrading poverty, shall
  not be touched.</p>
<p><strong><a
 name="Equality of opportunity.

         
         
         "></a>Equality of opportunity</strong></p>
<p>In seeking to restore to all men their equal and natural rights we do not
  seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by faith and see
  by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit all.
  Nor do we seek any futile and ridiculous equality. We recognise that there
  must always be differences and inequalities. In so far as these are in conformity
  with the moral law, in so far as they do not violate the command, &#8220;Thou
shalt not steal,&#8221; we are content.</p>
<p>The equality we would bring about is not the equality of fortune, but the
  equality of natural opportunity; the equality that reason and religion alike
  proclaim &#8211; the equality in usufruct of all His children to the bounty
  of Our Father Who art in Heaven!</p>
<p>In doing this, we would not levy the slightest tax on the possessors of wealth,
  no matter how rich they might be.</p>
<p>Not only do we deem such taxes a violation of the right of property, but we
  see that it is impossible for any one to produce wealth for himself without
  adding to the wealth of the world.</p>

<p><strong><a name="The right to life.

         
         
         "></a>The right to life</strong></p>
<p>To persist in a wrong, to refuse to undo it, is always to become involved
in other wrongs!</p>
<p>Those who defend private property in land, and thereby deny the first and
  most important of all human rights, the equal right to the material substratum
  of life, are compelled to one of two courses. Either they must, as do those
  whose gospel is &#8220;Devil take the hindmost,&#8221; deny the equal right
  to life, and, by some theory like that to which Malthus has given his name,
  assert that Nature brings into the world more men than there is provision for;
  or, they must, as do the Socialists, assert as rights what in themselves are
  wrongs. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Mistaken rights.

         
         
         "></a>Mistaken rights</strong></p>
<p>There are many who deny the equality of right to the material basis of life,
  and yet, conscious that there is a right to live, they assert the right of
  laborers to employment and their right to receive from their employers a certain
wage.</p>
<p>No such rights exist. No one has a right to demand employment of another,
  or to demand higher wages than the other is willing to give. There can be no
  better moral justification for such demands on employers by working-men than
  there would be for employers demanding that workingmen be compelled to work
  for them when they do not want to, and to accept wages lower than they are
  willing to take.</p>
<p>Any seeming justification springs from a prior wrong &#8211; the denial to
  working-men of their natural rights &#8211; and can in the last analysis only
  rest on that supreme dictate of self-preservation that under extraordinary
  circumstances makes pardonable what in itself is serious crime.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Rights in extremes.

         
         
         "></a>Rights in extremes</strong></p>
<p>A fugitive slave with the bloodhounds of his pursuers baying at his heels
  would in true Christian morals be held blameless if he seized the first horse
  he came across, even though to take it he had to knock down the rider, But
this is not to justify horse-stealing as an ordinary means of traveling.</p>
<p>When His disciples were hungry Christ permitted them to pluck corn on the
  Sabbath day. But He never denied the sanctity of the Sabbath by asserting that
  it was, under ordinary circumstances, a proper time to gather corn.</p>
<p>He justified David, who when pressed by hunger committed what ordinarily would
  be sacrilege, by taking from the temple the loaves of proposition. But in this
  He was far from saying that the robbing of temples was a proper way of getting
  a living. </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="The true natural right.

         
         
         "></a> The true natural right</strong></p>
<p>The natural right which each man
  has is not that of demanding employment or wages from another man, but that
  of employing himself! That of applying his own labor to the inexhaustible storehouse
which the Creator has in the land provided far all men!</p>
<p>Were that storehouse open &#8211; as we would open it &#8211; the demand for
  labor would keep pace with the supply, the man who sold labor and the man who
  bought it would become free exchangers for mutual advantage, and all cause
  for dispute between workman and employer would be gone.</p>
<p>Then, all being free to employ themselves, the mere opportunity to labor would
  cease to seem a boon; and since no one would work for another for less, all
  things considered; than he could earn by working for himself, wages would necessarily
  rise to their full value, and the relations of workman and employer be regulated
  by mutual interest and convenience.</p>
<p>This is the only way in which they can be satisfactorily regulated! </p>
<p><strong><a
 name="The only just rate of wages.

         
         
         "></a>The only just rate of wages</strong></p>
<p>It is often assumed that there is some just rate of wages that employers ought
  to be willing to pay and that laborers should be content to receive; and it
  is imagined that if this were secured there would be an end of strife. This
  rate is thought of as that which will give workingmen a frugal living, and
perhaps enable them by hard work and strict economy to lay by a little something.</p>
<p>But how can a just rate of wages be fixed without the &#8220;niggling of the
  market,&#8221; any more than the just price of corn, or pigs, or ships, or
  paintings can be so fixed? And would not arbitrary regulation in the one case
  as in the other check that interplay that most effectively promotes the economical
  adjustment of productive forces? </p>
<p><strong><a name="Progress under freedom"></a>Progress under freedom</strong></p>
<p>Why should buyers of labor, any more than buyers of commodities, be called
  on to pay higher prices than in a free market they are compelled to pay? Why
  should the sellers of labor be content with anything less than in a free market
they can obtain?</p>
<p>Why should working-men be content with frugal fare when the world is so rich?
  Why should they be satisfied with a lifetime of toil and stinting when the
  world is so beautiful? Why should not they also desire to gratify the higher
  instincts, the finer tastes? Why should they be for ever content to travel
  in the steerage when others find the cabin more enjoyable? </p>
<p><strong><a name="Man&#8217;s ever-growing wants.

         
         "></a>Man&#8217;s ever-growing wants</strong></p>
<p>Nor will they! The ferment of our time does not arise merely from the fact
  that working-men find it harder to live on the same scale of comfort. It is
  also and perhaps still more largely due to the increase of their desires with
  an improved scale of comfort. This increase of desire must continue. For man
is ever unsatisfied!</p>
<p>He is not an ox, of whom it may be said, so much grass, so much grain, so
  much water, and a little salt, and he will be content. On the contrary, the
  more he gets the more he craves.</p>
<p>When he has enough food, then he wants better food. When he gets a shelter,
  he wants a more commodious and tasty one. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Mental and spiritual desires.

         
         "></a>Mental and spiritual desires</strong></p>
<p>When his animal needs are satisfied, then mental and spiritual desires arise.</p>
<p>This restless discontent is of the nature of man &#8211; of that nobler nature
  that separates him from the animals by so immeasurable a gulf, and shows him
  to be indeed created in the likeness of God!</p>
<p>It is not to be quarreled with, for it is the motor of all progress. It is
  this that has raised St. Peter&#8217;s dome, and on dull, dead canvas made
  the angelic face of the Madonna to glow! It is this that has weighted suns
  and analysed stars, and opened page after page of the wonderful works of creative
  intelligence! It is this that has narrowed the Atlantic to an ocean ferry,
  and trained the lightning to carry our messages to the remotest lands! It is
  this that is opening to us possibilities beside which all that our modern civilisation
  has as yet accomplished seems small! Nor can it be repressed save by degrading
  and embruting men; by reducing Europe to ashes.</p>
<p>Hence, short of what wages may be earned with all restrictions on labor removed
  and access to natural opportunities on equal terms secured to all, it is impossible
  to fix any rate of wages that will be deemed just, or any rate of wages that
  can prevent working-men striving to get more.</p>
<p>So far from it making working-men more contented to improve their condition
  a little, it makes them more discontented. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Give men justice, not charity."></a> Give men justice, not
charity</strong></p>
<p>Nor is it asking justice when employers are asked to pay their working-men
  more than they are compelled to pay &#8211; more than they could get others
  to do the work for. It is asking charity. For the surplus that the employer
thus gives is not in reality wages, it is essentially alms.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Charity cannot cure poverty.

         
         "></a>Charity cannot cure poverty</strong></p>
<p>Among measures suggested for the improvement of the condition of labor much
  stress is sometimes laid upon charity. But there is nothing practical in such
  recommendations as a cure for poverty. If it were possible for the giving of
alms to abolish poverty, there would be no poverty in Christendom!</p>
<p>Charity is indeed a noble and beautiful virtue, grateful to man and approved
  by God. But charity must be built on justice. It cannot supersede justice.</p>
<p>What is wrong with the condition of labor is that labor is robbed. And while
  the continuance of that robbery is sanctioned it is idle to urge charity. </p>
<p><strong><a name="Primary and secondary virtues."></a> Primary and secondary
virtues</strong></p>
<p>All that charity can do where injustice exists is here and there to mollify
the effects of injustice. It cannot cure them.</p>
<p>Nor is even what little it can do to mollify the effects of injustice without
  evil. For what may be called the super-imposed, and, in this sense, secondary
  virtues, work evil where the fundamental or primary virtues are absent.</p>
<p>Thus sobriety is a virtue and diligence is a virtue. But a sober and diligent
  thief is all the more dangerous. Thus patience is a virtue. But patience under
  wrong is the condoning of wrong. Thus it is a virtue to seek knowledge and
  to endeavour to cultivate the mental powers. But the wicked man becomes more
  capable of evil by reason of his intelligence. Devils we always think of as
  intelligent.</p>
<p>Charity based upon injustice works evil.</p>
<p>That pseudo charity that discards and denies justice works evil.</p>
<p>On the one side, it demoralises its recipients, outraging human dignity, and
  turning into beggars and paupers men who, to become self-supporting, self-respecting
  citizens, only need the restitution of what God has given them. </p>
<p><strong><a name="An anodyne to conscience.

         
         "></a>An anodyne to conscience</strong></p>
<p>On the other side, it acts as an <font
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#ff6600">anodyne</font> to the consciences
  of those who are living on the robbery of their fellows, and fosters that moral
  delusion and spiritual pride that Christ doubtless had in mind when He said
  it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich
  man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven! For it leads men steeped in injustice,
  and using their money and their influence to bolster up injustice, to think
  that in giving alms they are doing something more than their duty towards man
and deserve to be very well thought of by God.</p>
<p><strong><a name="The churches and charity.

         
         "></a>The churches and charity</strong></p>
<p>Worse perhaps than all else is the way in which the substituting of injunctions
  to charity for the clear-cut demands of justice opens an easy means for professed
  teachers of the Christian religion of all branches and communions to placate
Mammon while persuading themselves that they are serving God!</p>
<p>Had the English clergy not subordinated the teaching of justice to the teaching
  of charity &#8211; to go no further in illustrating a principle of which the
  whole history of Christendom from Constantine&#8217;s time to our own is witness &#8211; the
  Tudor tyranny would never have arisen; had the clergy of France never substituted
  charity for justice, the monstrous iniquities of the ancient regime would never
  have brought the horrors of the Great Revolution; and in my own country, had
  those who should have preached justice not satisfy themselves with preaching
  kindness, <b>chattel slavery</b> could never have demanded the holocaust of
  our civil war. </p>
<p><strong><a name="No substitute for justice.

         
         "></a>No substitute for justice</strong></p>
<p>No; as faith without works is dead, as men cannot give to God His due while
  denying to their fellows the rights He gave them, so charity, unsupported by
justice, can do nothing to solve the problem of the existing condition of labor.</p>
<p>Though the rich were to &#8220;bestow all their goods to feed the poor and
  give their bodies to be burned,&#8221; poverty would continue while property
  in land continued. </p>
<p><strong><a name="What can the rich man do?

         
         "></a>What can the rich man do?</strong></p>
<p>Take the case of the rich man today who is honestly desirous of devoting his
wealth to the improvement of the condition of labor. What can he do?</p>
<p>Bestow his wealth on those who need it?</p>
<blockquote>He may help some who deserve it, but he will not improve general
  conditions. And against the good he may do will be the danger of doing harm.</blockquote>
<p>Build churches?</p>
<blockquote>Under the shadow of churches poverty festers and the vice that is
  born of it breeds!</blockquote>
<p>Build schools and colleges?</p>
<blockquote>Save as it may lead men to see the iniquity of private property in
  land, increased education can effect nothing for mere laborers, for as education
  is diffused the wages of education sink!</blockquote>
<p>Establish hospitals?</p>
<blockquote>Why, already it seems to laborers that there are too many seeking
  work, and to save and prolong life is to add to the pressure!</blockquote>
<p>Build model tenements?</p>
<blockquote>Unless he cheapens house accommodation he but drives further the
  class he would benefit, and as he cheapens house accommodation he brings more
  to seek employment, and cheapens wages!</blockquote>
<p>Institute laboratories, scientific schools, workshops far physical experiments?</p>
<blockquote>He but stimulates invention and discovery, the very forces that,
  acting on a society based on private property in land, are crushing labor as
  between the upper and the nether millstone!</blockquote>
<p>Promote emigration from places where wages are low to places where they are
  somewhat higher?</p>
<blockquote>If he does, even those whom he at first helps to emigrate will soon
  turn on him and demand that such emigration shall be stopped as reducing their
  wages!</blockquote>
<p>Give away what land he may have, or refuse to take rent for it, or let it
  at lower rents than the market price?</p>
<blockquote>He will simply make new landowners or partial landowners; he may
  make some individuals the richer, but he will do nothing to improve the general
  condition of labor.</blockquote>
<p>Or, bethinking himself of those public-spirited citizens of classic times
  who spent great sums in improving their native cities, shall he try to beautify
  the city of his birth or adoption?</p>
<blockquote>Let him widen and straighten narrow and crooked streets, let him
  build parks and erect fountains, let him open tramways and bring in railways,
  or in any way make beautiful and attractive his chosen city, and what will
  be the result? Must it not be that those who appropriate God&#8217;s bounty
  will take his also? Will it not be that the value of land will go up, and that
  the net result of his benefactions will be an increase of rents and a bounty
  to landowners?
            <p>Why, even the mere announcement that he is going to do such things
              will start speculation and send up the value of land by leaps and
              bounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What, then, can the rich man do to improve the condition of labor?</p>
<p><b>He can do nothing at all except to use his strength for the abolition of
    the great primary wrong that robs men of their birthright.</b></p>
<p>The justice of God laughs at the attempts of men to substitute anything else
  for it! </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><a name="The land question a moral ques"></a> The land question a
      moral question</strong></p>
<p>In speaking of measures for improving social conditions, it seems to us that
  in the teachings of morality is to be found the highest practicality, and that
  the question, What is wise may always safely be subordinated to the question,
what is right?</p>
<p>But expressed moral truths are deprived of all practical meaning when accompanied
  by unjust sanctions as when the American people, while they legalised chattel
  slavery, were accustomed to read solemnly on every national anniversary the
  declaration which asserts: &#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident that
  all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
  rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>What did this truth mean on the lips of men who asserted that one man was
  the rightful property of another man who had bought him, who asserted that
  the slave was robbing the master in running away, and that the man or the woman
  who helped the fugitive to escape, or even gave him a cup of cold water in
  Christ&#8217;s name, was an accessory to theft, on whose head the penalties
  of the State should be visited?</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><a name="The question of the hour.

         
         "></a>The question of the hour</strong></p>
<p>Now, consider the moral aspect of the present condition of labor.</p>
<p>What is &#8220;the question of the hour,&#8221; the question that is filling
  minds with painful apprehension? Reduced to its lowest expression it is the
  poverty of men willing to work. And what is the lowest expression of this phrase?
  It is that they lack bread &#8211; for in that one word we most concisely and
  strongly express all the manifold material satisfactions needed by humanity,
  the absence of which constitutes poverty.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Give us this day.

         
         "></a> Give us this day</strong></p>
<p>Now, what is the prayer of Christendom &#8211; the universal prayer; the prayer
  that goes up daily and hourly wherever the name of Christ is honoured; that
  ascends from the high altar of St. Peter&#8217;s at Rome, and that is repeated
  by the youngest child that the poorest Christian mother has taught to lisp
  a request to her Father in Heaven? It is: &#8220;<b><i>Give us this day our
  daily bread!</i></b>&#8221; Yet, where this prayer goes up, daily and hourly,
men lack bread! Why? </p>
<p><strong><a name="Why men lack bread.

         
         "></a> Why men lack bread</strong></p>
<p><b>Here is the answer, the only true answer! If men lack bread, it is not
    that God has not done His part in providing it. If men willing to labor are
    cursed with poverty, it is not that the storehouse has failed, that the supply
He has promised for the daily wants of His children is not here in abundance.</b></p>
<p><b>It is, that, &#8220;impiously violating the benevolent intentions of their

  on what to American tradition was our Marathon of freedom, the slave master
boasted that he would yet call the roll of his chattels.</p>
