      <strong>The Condition of Labor &#8212; <br>

          1879 book, <em>Progress
          and Poverty</em>,
        which was very well known in the English-speaking world in the 1880s,
        had been
        well and fully translated
         into Italian by the time the Encyclical <em>Rerum Novarum</em> was
        written in 1891. A New York Times obituary (1897) for HG indicates
         that &quot;all of his important works have been translated into German
         and French;&quot; by 1925, Italian was included in the list of languages
         into which <em>some</em> of HG's work had been translated. I
         was surprised to learn that by the time of Karl Marx's death,
         <em>Das Kapital</em> had not yet been translated into English, and so,
         in writing a tribute to Marx to be read at a memorial gathering in Manhattan,
          George was
        careful to point out that, while he had not yet had an opportunity to
        read the original, what he understood of Marx's ideas was not at all
        consistent
        with his own ideas. </font></p>

          the Encyclical failed to understand  the huge differences
          between George's ideas and those
        of the socialists of the day, and makes clear the distinctions. </font></p>
      <p><font size="-1">I must assume that at the time the Encyclical was issued,
          the Vatican was simply not acquainted first-hand with Henry George's
          ideas. </font></p></td>

<p>To Pope Leo XIII.</p>
<p>YOUR HOLINESS: I have read with care your Encyclical letter on the condition
  of labor, addressed, through the Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops and Bishops
  of your faith, to the Christian World. Since its most strikingly pronounced
  condemnations are directed against a theory that we who hold it know to be
  deserving of your support, I ask permission to lay before your Holiness the
  grounds of our belief, and to set forth some considerations that you have unfortunately
  overlooked. The momentous seriousness of the facts you refer to, the poverty,
  suffering and seething discontent that pervade the Christian world, the danger
  that passion may lead ignorance in a blind struggle against social conditions
  rapidly becoming intolerable, are my justification.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>I.</strong></p>
<p>Our postulates are all stated or implied in your Encyclical. They are the
  primary perceptions of human reason, the fundamental teachings of the Christian
  faith: </p>
<p>We hold: That&#8212;</p>
<p>This world is the creation of God.</p>
<p>The men brought into it for the brief period of their earthly lives are the
  equal creatures of his bounty, the equal subjects of his provident care.</p>
<p>By his constitution man is beset by physical wants, on the satisfaction of
  which depend not only the maintenance of his physical life but also the development
  of his intellectual and spiritual life.</p>
<p>God has made the satisfaction of these wants dependent on man&#8217;s own
  exertions, giving him the power and laying on him the injunction to labor &#8212; a
  power that of itself raises him far above the brute, since we may reverently
  say that it enables him to become as it were a helper in the creative work.</p>
<p>God has not put on man the task of making bricks without straw. With the need
  for labor and the power to labor he has also given to man the material for
  labor. This material is land &#8212; man physically being a land animal, who can live
  only on and from land, and can use other elements, such as air, sunshine and
  water, only by the use of land.</p>
<p>Being the equal creatures of the Creator, equally entitled under his providence
  to live their lives and satisfy their needs, men are equally entitled to the
  use of land, and any adjustment that denies this equal use of land is morally
  wrong.</p>
<p><br />
  <em><strong>As to the right of ownership</strong></em>, we hold: That &#8212; </p>
<p>Being created individuals,
    with individual wants and powers, men are individually entitled (subject
  of course to the moral obligations that arise from such relations as that of
  the
    family) to the use of their own powers and the enjoyment of the results.
  There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its validity from the
  law
    of God, a right of private ownership in things produced by labor &#8212; a right
  that the possessor may transfer, but of which to deprive him without his will
  is
    theft.</p>
<p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to himself,
  is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches to things produced
  by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</p>
<p>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean he acquires a right of property
  in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or gift. But he
  cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that he may sell
  it or give it or forbid others to use it.</p>
<p>Or, if he set up a windmill he acquires a right of property in the things
  such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim a right of property
  in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid others to use it.</p>
<p>Or, if he cultivate grain he acquires a right of property in the grain his
  labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the
  sun which ripened it or the soil on which it grew. For these things are of
  the continuing gifts of God to all generations of men, which all may use, but
  none may claim as his alone.</p>
<p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
  justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny the true
  rights of property. For a man who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
  to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
  which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of his
  rightful property and thus robbed.</p>
<p><strong><br />
    <em>As to the use of land</em></strong>, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
<p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by labor
  cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession. As your
  Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in general in
  the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they please,&#8221; and
  regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by human laws. But such
  regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must secure to all equal
  participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general bounty. The principle
  is the same as where a human father leaves property equally to a number of
  children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable of common use or of
  specific division. Such things may properly be assigned to some of the children,
  but only under condition that the equality of benefit among them all be preserved.</p>
<p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing, and
  gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of land is
  not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend their labor
  in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor is thus expended
  is needed to secure the right of property in the products of labor. For who
  would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed to enable him to
  reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without such exclusive possession
  of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
<p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
  different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
  The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
  self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
  exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
  ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
  so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
  of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others, he
  can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
<p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement divide
  the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive right
  to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue such
  claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world without
  God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the use of
  God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which they
  had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit murder. And
  for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them or
  by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them, would
  be for them to commit theft.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with altering
  conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when men are few
  and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex industries.
  In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions, in a civilization
  where the division of labor has gone so far that large numbers are hardly conscious
  that they are land-users, it still remains true that we are all land animals
  and can live only on land, and that land is God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which
  no one can be deprived without being murdered, and for which no one can be
  compelled to pay another without being robbed. But even in a state of society
  where the elaboration of industry and the increase of permanent improvements
  have made the need for private possession of land wide-spread, there is no
  difficulty in conforming individual possession with the equal right to land.
  For as soon as any piece of land will yield to the possessor a larger return
  than is had by similar labor on other land a value attaches to it which is
  shown when it is sold or rented. Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective
  of the value of any improvements in or on it, always indicates the precise
  value of the benefit to which all are entitled in its use, as distinguished
  from the value which, as producer or successor of a producer, belongs to the
  possessor in individual right.</p>
<p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
  ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
  attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
  is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
  to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
  In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
<p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
  men, would have the community act.We do not propose to assert equal rights
  to land by keeping land common, letting any one use any part of it at any time.
  We do not propose the task, impossible
  in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares; still less
  the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
<p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
  with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
  to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of the
  land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on it.
  And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we would
  accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now levied on
  the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since they take
  from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the right of property.</p>
<p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
  of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
<p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
<p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
  is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one has
  in the fruits of his labor;</p>
<p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
  all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
<p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
  be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may be
  reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
<p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
  referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
  in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
  property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
  that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality of
  right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or the other
  is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
<p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
  of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
  both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
  and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor.</p>
<p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
  bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is the
  way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists, who
  deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics and
  legislation.</p>
<p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
  is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life of
  his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
  it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He who
  foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided that with
  the increase of population and the development of industry the organization
  of human society into states or governments would become both expedient and
  necessary.</p>
<p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues. This
  need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry rude
  and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
  and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
  and larger revenues are needed.</p>
<p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
  as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and more
  conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing need
  for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The increasing
  need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural, God-ordained
  need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some way that we can
  truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this right way of raising
  public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
<p>Hence:</p>
<p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
<p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
  of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
<p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
  it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
<p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the sanctions
  of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins, and punishing
  men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to do.</p>
<p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
  thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
  division of wealth.</p>
<p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
  of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
  octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
  duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
  on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
  the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these be
  the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they need?
  Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we
  can deem a right one?</p>
<p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
  the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the scrupulous;
  they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the price of what
  some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government; they make oaths
  a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and thrift; they lessen
  the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing others.</p>
<p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
  of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
<p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
  are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
  that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of the
  system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its effects
  in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must buy, has
  grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this gospel, which
  holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws of national well-being
  utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory sanctifies national hatreds;
  it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their
  prosperity lies in imposing on the productions of other peoples restrictions
  they do not wish imposed on their own; and instead of the Christian doctrine
  of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
<p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
  show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
  intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
<p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
  a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is to
  see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
<p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
  the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
  of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced in
  this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value of land
  irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by reason of
  increasing population and social progress. This is a value that always goes
  to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the user; for if
  the user be a different person from the owner he must always pay the owner
  for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also the owner, it
  is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling or renting the
  land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases to be a user.</p>
<p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
  of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual what
  belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches to land
  by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the community
  as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or what in
            the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished from
            the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments for the
            use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot be shifted
            by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given in the
            text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the will of
            the buyer,
            but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore as to things
            constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point determined
            by the cost
            of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase the cost of bringing fresh
            quantities
            of such articles to the consumer increasing price by checking supply,
            and whatever tends to reduce such cost decreasing price by increasing
            supply.
            Thus taxes
            on wheat or tobacco or cloth add to the price that the consumer must
            pay, and thus the cheapening in the cost of producing steel which improved
            processes
            have made in recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But
            land has no cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced
            by
            man.
            Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">            1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly, by what the
                owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation and
                consequently of
                  starvation, and amounts to all that common labor can earn on it
                beyond what is necessary to life;<br />
            2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by
                  what the particular land will yield to common labor over and above
                  what may be had by like expenditure
                  and exertion on land having no special advantage and for which
                  no rent is paid; and,<br />
            3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling
                  particularly in selling price), by the expectation of future increase
                  of value from social
                  growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
                  withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never be shifted by the
            landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase the demand for land
            or enable landowners to check supply by withholding land from use. Where rent
            depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention because rent may in this way
            be demanded for the use of land even before economic or natural rent arises,
            the taking by taxation of what the landowners were able to extort from labor
            could not enable them to extort any more, since laborers, if not left enough
            to live on, will die. So, in the case of economic rent proper, to take from
            the landowners the premiums they receive, would in no way increase the superiority
            of their land and the demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by
            speculative rent, to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land
            whether they were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
            for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not merely
            destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products of
        labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor; to the
        individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would impose no
        burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift; it would
        secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth, by leaving
        men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any artificial
        enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value that cannot
        be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is most easily ascertained
        and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would enormously lessen the number
        of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with temptations to bribery and
      evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves innocent.</p>
<p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it needs
  by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree of evidence
  that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the nourishment
  of the babe.</p>
<p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
  the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
  but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
  But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
  necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
  begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
  more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
  time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
  The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
  since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
  steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population centers
  goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne. Consider
  the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value of land
  in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this due? Is it
  not due to the density and activity of the populations of those cities &#8212; to
  the very causes that require great public expenditure for streets, drains,
  public buildings, and all the many things needed for the health, convenience
  and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth of such cities the
  one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how the opening of roads,
  the building of railways, the making of any public improvement, adds to the
  value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural law &#8212; that is to
  say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean anything else than that He
  who ordained the state with its needs has in the values which attach to land
  provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase with
    the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for the needs
    of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing us the wisdom
    of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual that gratifies
    our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
<p>Consider: Here is a natural law by which as society advances the one thing
  that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue of which all
  growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general improvements of
  whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the dictates
  of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society. Now, since
  increase in the fund available for the common uses of society is increase in
  the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it not clear that
  the law by which land values increase with social advance while the value of
  the products of labor does not increase, tends with the advance of civilization
  to make the share that goes equally to each member of society more and more
  important as compared with what goes to him from his individual earnings, and
  thus to make the advance of civilization lessen relatively the differences
  that in a ruder social state must exist between the strong and the weak, the
  fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show the purpose of the Creator
  to be that the advance of man in civilization should be an advance not merely
  to larger powers but to a greater and greater equality, instead of what we,
  by our ignoring of his intent, are making it, an advance toward a more and
  more monstrous inequality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for social
  needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God in the sense
  that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort of men to do things
  other than in the way he has intended; in the sense that where the blessings
  he proffers to men are refused or misused they turn to evils that scourge us.
  And just as for the mother to withhold the provision that fills her breast
  with the birth of the child is to endanger physical health, so for society
  to refuse to take for social uses the provision intended for them is to breed
  social disease.</p>
<p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
  to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
  by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
  It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
  only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to combine the
  security of possession that is necessary to improvement with the equality of
  natural opportunity that is the most important of all natural rights. It is
  thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality between
  man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living, for
  the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for the gifts of
  their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses
  of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery. For
  the value that with the increase of population and social advance attaches
  to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured ownership of the
  land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever there
  is any prospect of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus producing
  an artificial scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor, and a strangulation
  of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of industrial depression
  as disastrous to the world as destructive wars. It is this that is driving
  men from the old countries to the new countries, only to bring there the same
  curses. It is this that causes our material advance not merely to fail to improve
  the condition of the mere worker, but to make the condition of large classes
  positively worse. It is this that in our richest Christian countries is giving
  us a large population whose lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded
  than those of the veriest savages. It is this that leads so many men to think
  that God is a bungler and is constantly bringing more people into his world
  than he has made provision for; or that there is no God, and that belief in
  him is a superstition which the facts of life and the advance of science are
  dispelling.</p>
<p>The darkness in light, the weakness in strength, the poverty amid wealth,
  the seething discontent foreboding civil strife, that characterize our civilization
  of today, are the natural, the inevitable results of our rejection of God&#8217;s
  beneficence, of our ignoring of his intent. Were we on the other hand to follow
  his clear, simple rule of right, leaving scrupulously to the individual all
  that individual labor produces, and taking for the community the value that
  attaches to land by the growth of the community itself, not merely could evil
  modes of raising public revenues be dispensed with, but all men would be placed
  on an equal level of opportunity with regard to the bounty of their Creator,
  on an equal level of opportunity to exert their labor and to enjoy its fruits.
  And then, without drastic or restrictive measures the forestalling of land
  would cease. For then the possession of land would mean only security for the
  permanence of its use, and there would be no object for any one to get land
  or to keep land except for use; nor would his possession of better land than
  others had confer any unjust advantage on him, or unjust deprivation on them,
  since the equivalent of the advantage would be taken by the state for the benefit
  of all.</p>
<p>The Right Reverend Dr. Thomas Nulty, Bishop of Meath, who sees all this as
        clearly as we do, in pointing out to the clergy and laity of his diocese* the
        design of Divine Providence that the rent of land should be taken for the community,
      says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I think, therefore, that I may fairly infer, on the strength of authority as
          well as of reason, that the people are and always must be the real owners of
          the land of their country. This great social fact appears to me to be of incalculable
          importance, and it is fortunate, indeed, that on the strictest principles of
          justice it is not clouded even by a shadow of uncertainty or doubt. There is,
          moreover, a charm and a peculiar beauty in the clearness with which it reveals
          the wisdom and the benevolence of the designs of Providence in the admirable
          provision he has made for the wants and the necessities of that state of social
          existence of which he is author, and in which the very instincts of nature
          tell us we are to spend our lives. A vast public property, a great national
          fund, has been placed under the dominion and at the disposal of the nation
          to supply itself abundantly with resources necessary to liquidate the expenses
          of its government, the administration of its laws and the education of its
          youth, and to enable it to provide for the suitable sustentation and support
          of its criminal and pauper population. One of the most interesting peculiarities
          of this property is that its value is never stationary; it is constantly progressive
          and increasing in a direct ratio to the growth of the population, and the very
          causes thatincrease and multiply the demands made on it increase proportionately
          its ability to meet them.<br />
          <font size="-1">*<a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"> Letter addressed
          to the Clergy and Laity of the Diocese of Meath</a>, Ireland,
        April 2, 1881.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is, indeed, as Bishop Nulty says, a peculiar beauty in the clearness
  with which the wisdom and benevolence of Providence are revealed in this great
  social fact, the provision made for the common needs of society in what economists
  call the law of rent. Of all the evidence that natural religion gives, it is
  this that most clearly shows the existence of a beneficent God, and most conclusively
  silences the doubts that in our days lead so many to materialism.</p>
<p>For in this beautiful provision made by natural law for the social needs of
  civilization we see that God has intended civilization; that all our discoveries
  and inventions do not and cannot outrun his forethought, and that steam, electricity
  and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer and more
  important. In the growth of this great fund, increasing with social advance &#8212; a
  fund that accrues from the growth of the community and belongs therefore to
  the community &#8212; we see not only that there is no need for the taxes that lessen
  wealth, that engender corruption, that promote inequality and teach men to
  deny the gospel; but that to take this fund for the purpose for which it was
  evidently intended would in the highest civilization secure to all the equal
  enjoyment of God&#8217;s bounty, the abundant opportunity to satisfy their
  wants, and would provide amply for every legitimate need of the state. We see
  that God in his dealings with men has not been a bungler or a niggard; that
  he has not brought too many men into the world; that he has not neglected abundantly
  to supply them; that he has not intended that bitter competition of the masses
  for a mere animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which
  characterize our civilization; but that these evils which lead so many to say
  there is no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s
  ordering, are due to our denial of his moral law. We see that the law of justice,
  the law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed
  the law of social life. We see that if we were only to observe it there would
  be work for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization
  would tend to give to the poorest not only necessities, but all comforts and
  reasonable luxuries as well. We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer when
  he told men that if they would seek the kingdom of God and its right-doing
  they might no more worry about material things than do the lilies of the field
  about their raiment; but that he was only declaring what political economy
  in the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth.</p>
<p>Your Holiness, even to see this is deep and lasting joy. For it is to see
  for one&#8217;s self that there is a God who lives and reigns, and that be
  is a God of justice and love &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven. It is to open a
  rift of sunlight through the clouds of our darker questionings, and to make
  the faith that trusts where it cannot see a living thing.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>II.</strong></p>
<p>    Your Holiness will see from the explanation I have given that the reform
      we propose, like all true reforms, has both an ethical and an economic
      side.
      By ignoring the ethical side, and pushing our proposal merely as a reform
      of taxation, we could avoid the objections that arise from confounding
      ownership with possession and attributing to private property in land that
      security
      of use and improvement that can be had even better without it. All that
      we seek practically is the legal abolition, as fast as possible, of taxes
      on
      the products and processes of labor, and the consequent concentration of
      taxation on land values irrespective of improvements. To put our proposals
      in this way would be to urge them merely as a matter of wise public expediency.</p>
<p>There are indeed many single-tax men who do put our proposals in this way;
  who seeing the beauty of our plan from a fiscal standpoint do not concern themselves
  further. But to those who think as I do, the ethical is the more important
  side. Not only do we not wish to evade the question of private property in
  land, but to us it seems that the beneficent and far-reaching revolution we
  aim at is too great a thing to be accomplished by &#8220;intelligent self-interest,&#8221; and
  can be carried by nothing less than the religious conscience.</p>
<p>Hence we earnestly seek the judgment of religion. This is the tribunal of
  which your Holiness as the head of the largest body of Christians is the most
  august representative.</p>
<p>It therefore behooves us to examine the reasons you urge in support of private
  property in land &#8212; if they be sound to accept them, and if they be not sound
  respectfully to point out to you wherein is their error.</p>
<p>To your proposition that &#8220;Our first and most fundamental principle when
  we undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses must be the inviolability
  of private property&#8221; we would joyfully agree if we could only understand
  you to have in mind the moral element, and to mean rightful private property,
  as when you speak of marriage as ordained by God&#8217;s authority we may understand
  an implied exclusion of improper marriages. Unfortunately, however, other expressions
  show that you mean private property in general and have expressly in mind private
  property in land. This confusion of thought, this non-distribution of terms,
  runs through your whole argument, leading you to conclusions so unwarranted
  by your premises as to be utterly repugnant to them, as when from the moral
  sanction of private property in the things produced by labor you infer something
  entirely different and utterly opposed, a similar right of property in the
  land created by God.</p>
<p>Private property is not of one species, and moral sanction can no more be
  asserted universally of it than of marriage. That proper marriage conforms
  to the law of God does not justify the polygamic or polyandric or incestuous
  marriages that are in some countries permitted by the civil law. And as there
  may be immoral marriage so may there be immoral private property. Private property
  is that which may be held in ownership by an individual, or that which may
  be held in ownership by an individual with the sanction of the state. The mere
  lawyer, the mere servant of the state, may rest here, refusing to distinguish
  between what the state holds equally lawful. Your Holiness, however, is not
  a servant of the state, but a servant of God, a guardian of morals. You know,
  as said by St. Thomas of Aquin, that &#8212; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Human law is law only in virtue of its accordance with right reason and it
      is thus manifest that it flows from the eternal law. And in so far as it deviates
      from right reason it is called an unjust law. In such case it is not law at
      all, but rather a species of violence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, that any species of property is permitted by the state does not of itself
  give it moral sanction. The state has often made things property that are not
  justly property, but involve violence and robbery. For instance, the things
  of religion, the dignity and authority of offices of the church, the power
  of administering her sacraments and controlling her temporalities, have often
  by profligate princes been given as salable property to courtiers and concubines.
  At this very day in England an atheist or a heathen may buy in open market,
  and hold as legal property, to be sold, given or bequeathed as he pleases,
  the power of appointing to the cure of souls, and the value of these legal
  rights of presentation is said to be no less than &pound;17,000,000.</p>
<p>Or again: Slaves were universally treated as property by the customs and laws
  of the classical nations, and were so acknowledged in Europe long after the
  acceptance of Christianity. At the beginning of this century there was no Christian
  nation that did not, in her colonies at least, recognize property in slaves,
  and slaveships crossed the seas under Christian flags. In the United States,
  little more than thirty years ago, to buy a man gave the same legal ownership
  as to buy a horse, and in Mohammedan countries law and custom yet make the
  slave the property of his captor or purchaser.</p>
<p>Yet your Holiness, one of the glories of whose pontificate is the attempt
  to break up slavery in its last strongholds, will not contend that the moral
  sanction that attaches to property in things produced by labor can, or ever
  could, apply to property in slaves.</p>
<p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
  of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
  if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
  a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in land
  shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With this interpretation,
  I find that the reasons you urge for private property in land are eight. Let
  us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
<p><em><strong><br />
    1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (5.)*</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>* To facilitate references the paragraphs of the Encyclical are indicated
        by number.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, purchase and sale cannot give, but can only transfer ownership.
      Property that in itself has no moral sanction does not obtain moral sanction
      by passing
      from seller to buyer.</p>
<p>If right reason does not make the slave the property of the slave-hunter it
  does not make him the property of the slave-buyer. Yet your reasoning as to
  private property in land would as well justify property in slaves. To show
  this it is only needful to change in your argument the word land to the word
  slave. It would then read:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor, the
      very reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and to hold it as
      his own private possession.</p>
  <p>If one man hires out to another his strength or his industry, he does this
      for the purpose of receiving in return what is necessary for food and living;
      he thereby expressly proposes to acquire a full and legal right, not only to
      the remuneration, but also to the disposal of that remuneration as he pleases.</p>
  <p>Thus, if he lives sparingly, saves money, and invests his savings, for greater
      security, in a slave, the slave in such a case is only his wages in another
      form; and consequently, a working-man&#8217;s slave thus purchased should
      be as completely at his own disposal as the wages he receives for his labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor in turning your argument for private property in land into an argument
  for private property in men am I doing a new thing. In my own country, in my
  own time, this very argument, that purchase gave ownership, was the common
  defense of slavery. It was made by statesmen, by jurists, by clergymen, by
  bishops; it was accepted over the whole country by the great mass of the people.
  By it was justified the separation of wives from husbands, of children from
  parents, the compelling of labor, the appropriation of its fruits, the buying
  and selling of Christians by Christians. In language almost identical with
  yours it was asked, &#8220;Here is a poor man who has worked hard, lived sparingly,
  and invested his savings in a few slaves. Would you rob him of his earnings
  by liberating those slaves?&#8221; Or it was said: &#8220;Here is a poor widow;
  all her husband has been able to leave her is a few negroes, the earnings of
  his hard toil. Would you rob the widow and the orphan by freeing these negroes?&#8221; And
  because of this perversion of reason, this confounding of unjust property rights
  with just property rights, this acceptance of man&#8217;s law as though it
  were God&#8217;s law, there came on our nation a judgment of fire and blood.</p>
<p>The error of our people in thinking that what in itself was not rightfully
  property could become rightful property by purchase and sale is the same error
  into which your Holiness falls. It is not merely formally the same; it is essentially
  the same. Private property in land, no less than private property in slaves,
  is a violation of the true rights of property. They are different forms of
  the same robbery; twin devices by which the perverted ingenuity of man has
  sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape God&#8217;s requirement
  of labor by forcing it on others.</p>
<p>What difference does it make whether I merely own the land on which another
  man must live or own the man himself? Am I not in the one case as much his
  master as in the other? Can I not compel him to work for me? Can I not take
  to myself as much of the fruits of his labor; as fully dictate his actions?
  Have I not over him the power of life and death?</p>
<p>For to deprive a man of land is as certainly to kill him as to deprive him
  of blood by opening his veins, or of air by tightening a halter around his
  neck.</p>
<p>The essence of slavery is in empowering one man to obtain the labor of another
  without recompense. Private property in land does this as fully as chattel
  slavery. The slave-owner must leave to the slave enough of his earnings to
  enable him to live. Are there not in so-called free countries great bodies
  of working-men who get no more? How much more of the fruits of their toil do
  the agricultural laborers of Italy and England get than did the slaves of our
  Southern States? Did not private property in land permit the landowner of Europe
  in ruder times to demand the jus primae noctis? Does not the same last outrage
  exist today in diffused form in the immorality born of monstrous wealth on
  the one hand and ghastly poverty on the other?</p>
<p>In what did the slavery of Russia consist but in giving to the master land
  on which the serf was forced to live? When an Ivan or a Catherine enriched
  their favorites with the labor of others they did not give men, they gave land.
  And when the appropriation of land has gone so far that no free land remains
  to which the landless man may turn, then without further violence the more
  insidious form of labor robbery involved in private property in land takes
  the place of chattel slavery, because more economical and convenient. For under
  it the slave does not have to be caught or held, or to be fed when not needed.
  He comes of himself, begging the privilege of serving, and when no longer wanted
  can be discharged. The lash is unnecessary; hunger is as efficacious. This
  is why the Norman conquerors of England and the English conquerors of Ireland
  did not divide up the people, but divided the land. This is why European slave-ships
  took their cargoes to the New World, not to Europe.</p>
<p>    Slavery is not yet abolished. Though in all Christian countries its ruder
      form has now gone, it still exists in the heart of our civilization in
      more insidious
    form, and is increasing. There is work to be done for the glory of God and
    the liberty of man by other soldiers of the cross than those warrior monks
  whom, with the blessing of your Holiness, Cardinal Lavigerie is sending into
  the Sahara. Yet, your Encyclical
  employs in defense of one form of slavery the same fallacies that the apologists
  for chattel slavery used in defense of the other!</p>
<p>    The Arabs are not wanting in acumen. Your Encyclical reaches far. What shall
    your warrior monks say, if when at the muzzle of their rifles they demand
      of some Arab slave-merchant his miserable caravan, he shall declare that
      he bought
    them with his savings, and producing a copy of your Encyclical, shall prove
    by your reasoning that his slaves are consequently &#8220;only his wages in
    another form,&#8221; and ask if they who bear your blessing and own your authority
    propose to &#8220;deprive him of the liberty of disposing of his wages and
    thus of all hope and possibility of increasing his stock and bettering his
    condition in life&#8221;?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift
      of reason. (6-7.)</em></strong></p>
<p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason and forethought
  may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the earth, but also of the
  earth itself, so that out of its products he may make provision for the future.</p>
<p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing attribute
  of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows, as the Scriptures
  declare, that he is created in the likeness of God. And this gift of reason
  does, as your Holiness points out, involve the need and right of private property
  in whatever is produced by the exertion of reason and its attendant forethought,
  as well as in what is produced by physical labor. In truth, these elements
  of man&#8217;s production are inseparable, and labor involves the use of reason.
  It is by his reason that man differs from the animals in being a producer,
  and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical powers are slight, forming
  as it were but the connection by which the mind takes hold of material things,
  so as to utilize to its will the matter and forces of nature. It is mind, the
  intelligent reason, that is the prime mover in labor, the essential agent in
  production.</p>
<p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach to things
  provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot attach to things
  provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
<p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert as the
  Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought to provide
  themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right of property in
  the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless desert those who had
  neglected to provide themselves, though they might ask water from the provident
  in charity, could not demand it in right. For while water itself is of the
  providence of God, the presence of this water in such vessels, at such place,
  results from the providence of the men who carried it. Thus they have to it
  an exclusive right.</p>
<p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
  the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink of the water
  save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give any right?</p>
<p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it is needed,
  but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to defend in defending
  the private ownership of land!</p>
<p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those who
  say that if private property in land be not just, then private property in
  the products of labor is not just, as the material of these products is taken
  from land. It will be seen on consideration that all of man&#8217;s production
  is analogous to such transportation of water as we have supposed. In growing
  grain, or smelting metals, or building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing any
  of the things that constitute producing, all that man does is to change in
  place or form preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer, not
  a creator; God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s production
  consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of private ownership
  attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right of ownership in that
  natural material in which the labor of production is embodied. Thus water,
  which in its original form and place is the common gift of God to all men,
  when drawn from its natural reservoir and brought into the desert, passes rightfully
  into the ownership of the individual who by changing its place has produced
  it there.</p>
<p>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary possession.
  For though man may take material from the storehouse of nature and change it
  in place or form to suit his desires, yet from the moment he takes it, it tends
  back to that storehouse again. Wood decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates
  and is displaced, while of more perishable products, some will last for only
  a few months, others for only a few days, and some disappear immediately on
  use. Though, so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever persists;
  though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that floats in
  a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the ceaseless flux
  of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining constantly passes away.
  Thus the recognition of the ownership of what natural material is embodied
  in the products of man never constitutes more than temporary possession &#8212; never
  interferes with the reservoir provided for all. As taking water from one place
  and carrying it to another place by no means lessens the store of water, since
  whether it is drunk or spilled or left to evaporate, it must return again to
  the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is it with all things on which man in production
  can lay the impress of his labor.</p>
<p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right to have
  in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish in the using,
  but also those that remain for use in the future, you are right in so far as
  you may include such things as buildings, which with repair will last for generations,
  with such things as food or fire-wood, which are destroyed in the use. But
  when you infer that man can have private ownership in those permanent things
  of nature that are the reservoirs from which all must draw, you are clearly
  wrong. Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits of the earth produced
  by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of that labor, and pass again
  into the natural reservoirs from which they were taken, and thus the ownership
  of them by one works no injury to others. But he cannot so own the earth itself,
  for that is the reservoir from which must constantly be drawn not only the
  material with which alone men can produce, but even their very bodies.<br />
  The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth itself as
  he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it, is in the facts
  stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when you truly say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they demand
      new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in
      the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the private
  property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
<p>    Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore, owes
    to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you mean God. Thus
    your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred an obligation to
    provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail, is the same as is thus
    expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion by the Bishop of Meath:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having created
      us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means necessary
    for our subsistence. The land is the only source of this kind now known to
    us.
      The land, therefore, of every country is the common property of the people
      of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made it, has transferred
      it as a voluntary gift to them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now,
      as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God, and
      as all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
      of a country
      that would exclude the humblest man in that country from his share of the
      common inheritance would be not only an injustice and a wrong to that man,
      but, moreover,
      be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS OF HIS CREATOR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (8.)</em></strong></p>
<p>Your own statement that land is the inexhaustible storehouse that God owes
  to man must have aroused in your Holiness&#8217;s mind an uneasy questioning
  of its appropriation as private property, for, as though to reassure yourself,
  you proceed to argue that its ownership by some will not injure others. You
  say in substance, that even though divided among private owners the earth does
  not cease to minister to the needs of all, since those who do not possess the
  soil can by selling their labor obtain in payment the produce of the land.</p>
<p>Suppose that to your Holiness as a judge of morals one should put this case
  of conscience:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I am one of several children to whom our father left a field abundant for
      our support. As he assigned no part of it to any one of us in particular, leaving
      the limits of our separate possession to be fixed by ourselves, I being the
      eldest took the whole field in exclusive ownership. But in doing so I have
      not deprived my brothers of their support from it, for I have let them work
      for me on it, paying them from the produce as much wages as I would have had
      to pay strangers. Is there any reason why my conscience should not be clear?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would be your answer? Would you not tell him that he was in mortal sin,
  and that his excuse added to his guilt? Would you not call on him to make restitution
  and to do penance?</p>
<p>Or, suppose that as a temporal prince your Holiness were ruler of a rainless
  land, such as Egypt, where there were no springs or brooks, their want being
  supplied by a bountiful river like the Nile. Supposing that having sent a number
  of your subjects to make fruitful this land, bidding them do justly and prosper,
  you were told that some of them had set up a claim of ownership in the river,
  refusing the others a drop of water, except as they bought it of them; and
  that thus they had become rich without work, while the others, though working
  hard, were so impoverished by paying for water as to be hardly able to exist?</p>
<p>Would not your indignation wax hot when this was told?</p>
<p>Suppose that then the river-owners should send to you and thus excuse their
  action:</p>
<p>The river, though divided among private owners, ceases not thereby to minister
    to the needs of all, for there is no one who drinks who does not drink of
  the water of the river. Those who do not possess the water of the river contribute
    their labor to get it; so that it may be truly said that all water is supplied
    either from one&#8217;s own river, or from some laborious industry which
    is paid for either in the water, or in that which is exchanged for the water.</p>
<p>Would the indignation of your Holiness be abated? Would it not wax fiercer
  yet for the insult to your intelligence of this excuse?</p>
<p>I do not need more formally to show your Holiness that between utterly depriving
  a man of God&#8217;s gifts and depriving him of God&#8217;s gifts unless he
  will buy them, is merely the difference between the robber who leaves his victim
  to die and the robber who puts him to ransom. But I would like to point out
  how your statement that &#8220;the earth, though divided among private owners,
  ceases not thereby to minister to the needs of all&#8221; overlooks the largest
  facts.</p>
<p>From your palace of the Vatican the eye may rest on the expanse of the Campagna,
  where the pious toil of religious congregations and the efforts of the state
  are only now beginning to make it possible for men to live. Once that expanse
  was tilled by thriving husbandmen and dotted with smiling hamlets. What for
  centuries has condemned it to desertion? History tells us. It was private property
  in land; the growth of the great estates of which Pliny saw that ancient Italy
  was perishing; the cause that, by bringing failure to the crop of men, let
  in the Goths and Vandals, gave Roman Britain to the worship of Odin and Thor,
  and in what were once the rich and populous provinces of the East shivered
  the thinned ranks and palsied arms of the legions on the simitars of Mohammedan
  hordes, and in the sepulcher of our Lord and in the Church of St. Sophia trampled
  the cross to rear the crescent!</p>
<p>If you will go to Scotland, you may see great tracts that under the Gaelic
  tenure, which recognized the right of each to a foothold in the soil, bred
  sturdy men, but that now, under the recognition of private property in land,
  are given up to wild animals. If you go to Ireland, your Bishops will show
  you, on lands where now only beasts graze, the traces of hamlets that, when
  they were young priests, were filled with honest, kindly, religious people.*</p>

<p>If you will come to the United States, you will find in a land wide enough
  and rich enough to support in comfort the whole population of Europe, the growth
  of a sentiment that looks with evil eye on immigration, because the artificial
  scarcity that results from private property in land makes it seem as if there
  is not room enough and work enough for those already here.</p>
<p>Or go to the Antipodes, and in Australia, as in England, you may see that
  private property in land is operating to leave the land barren and to crowd
  the bulk of the population into great cities. Go wherever you please where
  the forces loosed by modern invention are beginning to be felt and you may
  see that private property in land is the curse, denounced by the prophet, that
  prompts men to lay field to field till they &#8220;alone dwell in the midst
  of the earth.</p>
<p>To the mere materialist this is sin and shame. Shall we to whom this world
  is God&#8217;s world &#8212; we who hold that man is called to this life only as
  a prelude to a higher life &#8212; shall we defend it?</p>
<p><strong><em>4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (9-10.)</em></strong></p>
<p>Your Holiness next contends that industry expended on land gives a right to
  ownership of the land, and that the improvement of land creates benefits indistinguishable
  and inseparable from the land itself.</p>
<p>This contention, if valid, could only justify the ownership of land by those
  who expend industry on it. It would not justify private property in land as
  it exists. On the contrary, it would justify a gigantic no-rent declaration
  that would take land from those who now legally own it, the landlords, and
  turn it over to the tenants and laborers. And if it also be that improvements
  cannot be distinguished and separated from the land itself, how could the landlords
  claim consideration even for improvements they had made?</p>
<p>But your Holiness cannot mean what your words imply. What you really mean,
  I take it, is that the original justification and title of landownership is
  in the expenditure of labor on it. But neither can this justify private property
  in land as it exists. For is it not all but universally true that existing
  land titles do not come from use, but from force or fraud?</p>
<p>Take Italy! Is it not true that the greater part of the land of Italy is held
  by those who so far from ever having expended industry on it have been mere
  appropriators of the industry of those who have? Is this not also true of Great
  Britain and of other countries? Even in the United States, where the forces
  of concentration have not yet had time fully to operate and there has been
  some attempt to give land to users, it is probably true today that the greater
  part of the land is held by those who neither use it nor propose to use it
  themselves, but merely hold it to compel others to pay them for permission
  to use it.</p>
<p>And if industry give ownership to land what are the limits of this ownership?
  If a man may acquire the ownership of several square miles of land by grazing
  sheep on it, does this give to him and his heirs the ownership of the same
  land when it is found to contain rich mines, or when by the growth of population
  and the progress of society it is needed for farming, for gardening, for the
  close occupation of a great city? Is it on the rights given by the industry
  of those who first used it for grazing cows or growing potatoes that you would
  found the title to the land now covered by the city of New York and having
  a value of thousands of millions of dollars?</p>
<p>But your contention is not valid. Industry expended on land gives ownership
  in the fruits of that industry, but not in the land itself, just as industry
  expended on the ocean would give a right of ownership to the fish taken by
  it, but not a right of ownership in the ocean. Nor yet is it true that private
  ownership of land is necessary to secure the fruits of labor on land; nor does
  the improvement of land create benefits indistinguishable and inseparable from
  the land itself. That secure possession is necessary to the use and improvement
  of land I have already explained, but that ownership is not necessary is shown
  by the fact that in all civilized countries land owned by one person is cultivated
  and improved by other persons. Most of the cultivated land in the British Islands,
  as in Italy and other countries, is cultivated not by owners but by tenants.
  And so the costliest buildings are erected by those who are not owners of the
  land, but who have from the owner a mere right of possession for a time on
  condition of certain payments. Nearly the whole of London has been built in
  this way, and in New York, Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, Sydney and Melbourne,
  as well as in continental cities, the owners of many of the largest edifices
  will be found to be different persons from the owners of the ground. So far
  from the value of improvements being inseparable from the value of land, it
  is in individual transactions constantly separated. For instance, one-half
  of the land on which the immense Grand Pacific Hotel in Chicago stands was
  recently separately sold, and in Ceylon it is a not infrequent occurrence for
  one person to own a fruit-tree and another to own the ground in which it is
  implanted.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, no improvement of land, whether it be clearing, plowing,
  manuring, cultivating, the digging of cellars, the opening of wells or the
  building of houses, that so long as its usefulness continues does not have
  a value clearly distinguishable from the value of the land. For land having
  such improvements will always sell or rent for more than similar land without
  them.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the state levy a tax equal to what the land irrespective of
  improvement would bring, it will take the benefits of mere ownership, but will
  leave the full benefits of use and improvement, which the prevailing system
  does not do. And since the holder, who would still in form continue to be the
  owner, could at any time give or sell both possession and improvements, subject
  to future assessment by the state on the value of the land alone, he will be
  perfectly free to retain or dispose of the full amount of property that the
  exertion of his labor or the investment of his capital has attached to or stored
  up in the land.</p>
<p>Thus, what we propose would secure, as it is impossible in any other way to
  secure, what you properly say is just and right &#8212; &#8221;that the results of
  labor should belong to him who has labored.&#8221; But private property in
  land &#8212; to allow the holder without adequate payment to the state to take for
  himself the benefit of the value that attaches to land with social growth and
  improvement &#8212; does take the results of labor from him who has labored, does turn
  over the fruits of one man&#8217;s labor to be enjoyed by another. For labor,
  as the active factor, is the producer of all wealth. Mere ownership produces
  nothing. A man might own a world, but so sure is the decree that &#8220;by
  the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,&#8221; that without labor he could
  not get a meal or provide himself a garment. Hence, when the owners of land,
  by virtue of their ownership and without laboring themselves, get the products
  of labor in abundance, these things must come from the labor of others, must
  be the fruits of others&#8217; sweat, taken from those who have a right to
  them and enjoyed by those who have no right to them.</p>
<p>The only utility of private ownership of land as distinguished from possession
  is the evil utility of giving to the owner products of labor he does not earn.
  For until land will yield to its owner some return beyond that of the labor
  and capital he expends on it &#8212; that is to say, until by sale or rental he can
  without expenditure of labor obtain from it products of labor, ownership amounts
  to no more than security of possession, and has no value. Its importance and
  value begin only when, either in the present or prospectively, it will yield
  a revenue &#8212; that is to say, will enable the owner as owner to obtain products
  of labor without exertion on his part, and thus to enjoy the results of others&#8217; labor.</p>
<p>What largely keeps men from realizing the robbery involved in private property
  in land is that in the most striking cases the robbery is not of individuals,
  but of the community. For, as I have before explained, it is impossible for
  rent in the economic sense &#8212; that value which attaches to land by reason of social
  growth and improvement &#8212; to go to the user. It can go only to the owner or to
  the community. Thus those who pay enormous rents for the use of land in such
  centers as London or New York are not individually injured. Individually they
  get a return for what they pay, and must feel that they have no better right
  to the use of such peculiarly advantageous localities without paying for it
  than have thousands of others. And so, not thinking or not caring for the interests
  of the community, they make no objection to the system.</p>
<p>It recently came to light in New York that a man having no title whatever
  had been for years collecting rents on a piece of land that the growth of the
  city had made very valuable. Those who paid these rents had never stopped to
  ask whether he had any right to them. They felt that they had no right to land
  that so many others would like to have, without paying for it, and did not
  think of, or did not care for, the rights of all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
  mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
  by Divine Law. (11.)</em></strong></p>
<p>Even were it true that the common opinion of mankind has sanctioned private
  property in land, this would no more prove its justice than the once universal
  practice of the known world would have proved the justice of slavery.</p>
<p>But it is not true. Examination will show that wherever we can trace them
  the first perceptions of mankind have always recognized the equality of right
  to land, and that when individual possession became necessary to secure the
  right of ownership in things produced by labor some method of securing equality,
  sufficient in the existing state of social development, was adopted. Thus,
  among some peoples, land used for cultivation was periodically divided, land
  used for pasturage and wood being held in common. Among others, every family
  was permitted to hold what land it needed for a dwelling and for cultivation,
  but the moment that such use and cultivation stopped any one else could step
  in and take it on like tenure. Of the same nature were the land laws of the
  Mosaic code. The land, first fairly divided among the people, was made inalienable
  by the provision of the jubilee, under which, if sold, it reverted every fiftieth
  year to the children of its original possessors.</p>
<p>Private property in land as we know it, the attaching to land of the same
  right of ownership that justly attaches to the products of labor, has never
  grown up anywhere save by usurpation or force. Like slavery, it is the result
  of war. It comes to us of the modern world from your ancestors, the Romans,
  whose civilization it corrupted and whose empire it destroyed.</p>
<p>It made with the freer spirit of the northern peoples the combination of the
  feudal system, in which, though subordination was substituted for equality,
  there was still a rough recognition of the principle of common rights in land.
  A fief was a trust, and to enjoyment was annexed some obligation. The sovereign,
  the representative of the whole people, was the only owner of land. Of him,
  immediately or mediately, held tenants, whose possession involved duties or
  payments, which, though rudely and imperfectly, embodied the idea that we would
  carry out in the single tax, of taking land values for public uses. The crown
  lands maintained the sovereign and the civil list; the church lands defrayed
  the cost of public worship and instruction, of the relief of the sick, the
  destitute and the wayworn; while the military tenures provided for public defense
  and bore the costs of war. A fourth and very large portion of the land remained
  in common, the people of the neighborhood being free to pasture it, cut wood
  on it, or put it to other common uses.</p>
<p>In this partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land is to
  be found the reason why, in a time when the industrial arts were rude, wars
  frequent, and the great discoveries and inventions of our time unthought of,
  the condition of the laborer was devoid of that grinding poverty which despite
  our marvelous advances now exists. Speaking of England, the highest authority
  on such subjects, the late Professor Therold Rogers, declares that in the thirteenth
  century there was no class so poor, so helpless, so pressed and degraded as
  are millions of Englishmen in our boasted nineteenth century; and that, save
  in times of actual famine, there was no laborer so poor as to fear that his
  wife and children might come to want even were he taken from them. Dark and
  rude in many respects as they were, these were the times when the cathedrals
  and churches and religious houses whose ruins yet excite our admiration were
  built; the times when England had no national debt, no poor law, no standing
  army, no hereditary paupers, no thousands and thousands of human beings rising
  in the morning without knowing where they might lay their heads at night.</p>
<p>With the decay of the feudal system, the system of private property in land
  that had destroyed Rome was extended. As to England, it may briefly be said
  that the crown lands were for the most part given away to favorites; that the
  church lands were parceled among his courtiers by Henry VIII., and in Scotland
  grasped by the nobles; that the military dues were finally remitted in the
  seventeenth century, and taxation on consumption substituted; and that by a
  process beginning with the Tudors and extending to our own time all but a mere
  fraction of the commons were inclosed by the greater landowners; while the
  same private ownership of land was extended over Ireland and the Scottish Highlands,
  partly by the sword and partly by bribery of the chiefs. Even the military
  dues, had they been commuted, not remitted, would today have more than sufficed
  to pay all public expenses without one penny of other taxation.</p>
<p>Of the New World, whose institutions but continue those of Europe, it is only
  necessary to say that to the parceling out of land in great tracts is due the
  backwardness and turbulence of Spanish America; that to the large plantations
  of the Southern States of the Union was due the persistence of slavery there,
  and that the more northern settlements showed the earlier English feeling,
  land being fairly well divided and the attempts to establish manorial estates
  coming to little or nothing. In this lies the secret of the more vigorous growth
  of the Northern States. But the idea that land was to be treated as private
  property had been thoroughly established in English thought before the colonial
  period ended, and it has been so treated by the United States and by the several
  States. And though land was at first sold cheaply, and then given to actual
  settlers, it was also sold in large quantities to speculators, given away in
  great tracts for railroads and other purposes, until now the public domain
  of the United States, which a generation ago seemed illimitable, has practically
  gone. And this, as the experience of other countries shows, is the natural
  result in a growing community of making land private property. When the possession
  of land means the gain of unearned wealth, the strong and unscrupulous will
  secure it. But when, as we propose, economic rent, the &#8220;unearned increment
  of wealth,&#8221; is taken by the state for the use of the community, then
  land will pass into the hands of users and remain there, since no matter how
  great its value, its possession will be profitable only to users.</p>
<p>As to private property in land having conduced to the peace and tranquillity
  of human life, it is not necessary more than to allude to the notorious fact
  that the struggle for land has been the prolific source of wars and of lawsuits,
  while it is the poverty engendered by private property in land that makes the
  prison and the workhouse the unfailing attributes of what we call Christian
  civilization.</p>
<p>Your Holiness intimates that the Divine Law gives its sanction to the private
  ownership of land, quoting from Deuteronomy, &#8220;Thou shalt not covet thy
  neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his house, nor his field, nor his man-servant, nor
  his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything which is his.&#8221;</p>
<p>If, as your Holiness conveys, this inclusion of the words, &#8220;nor his
  field,&#8221; is to be taken as sanctioning private property in land as it
  exists today, then, but with far greater force, must the words, &#8220;his
  man-servant, nor his maid-servant,&#8221; be taken to sanction chattel slavery;
  for it is evident from other provisions of the same code that these terms referred
  both to bondsmen for a term of years and to perpetual slaves. But the word &#8220;field&#8221; involves
  the idea of use and improvement, to which the right of possession and ownership
  does attach without recognition of property in the land itself. And that this
  reference to the &#8220;field&#8221; is not a sanction of private property
  in land as it exists today is proved by the fact that the Mosaic code expressly
  denied such unqualified ownership in land, and with the declaration, &#8220;the
  land also shall not be sold forever, because it is mine, and you are strangers
  and sojourners with me,&#8221; provided for its reversion every fiftieth year;
  thus, in a way adapted to the primitive industrial conditions of the time,
  securing to all of the chosen people a foothold in the soil.</p>
<p>Nowhere in fact throughout the Scriptures can the slightest justification
  be found for the attaching to land of the same right of property that justly
  attaches to the things produced by labor. Everywhere is it treated as the free
  bounty of God, &#8220;the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
  in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (14-17.)</em></strong></p>
<p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
  we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father to the child can
  justify private property in land we cannot see. You reason that private property
  in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father, and is therefore
  requisite and just, because  &#8212; </p>
<p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and all
  necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature dictates
  that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his own
  personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to enable them
  honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties of this
  mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father effect this except by the ownership
  of profitable property, which he can transmit to his children by inheritance.
  (14.)</p>
<p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
  that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
  our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father to
  care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural order
  it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the parent.
  This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork of
  the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
  has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
<p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
  But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
  constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
  being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver of every
  good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh, that
  Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; And
  how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist! Let
  the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount as
  nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
  would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the leaves
  fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth refuse
  her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
<p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property that
  will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
  of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. And how is it possible
  for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not considered how mankind really
  lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little one
  generation does or can leave another. It is doubtful if the wealth of the civilized
  world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s labor,
  while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely on existing
  accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest countries pestilence
  and famine would stalk.<br />
  The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private property in land.
  Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is land superior to the
  land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income to
  the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
  the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the individual
  involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore possible only for
  some fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore your Holiness
  practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers to struggle to
  leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong, lucky or unscrupulous
  can leave; and that, a something that involves the robbery of others &#8212; their
  deprivation of the material gifts of God.</p>
<p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
  world. What are its results?</p>
<p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not, so
  far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
  of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
  that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and misery
  deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? Under the r&eacute;gime
  of private property in land and in the richest countries not five per cent
  of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial to their children,
  and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury them! Some few children
  are left by their fathers richer than it is good for them to be, but the vast
  majority not only are left nothing by their fathers, but by the system that
  makes land private property are deprived of the bounty of their Heavenly Father;
  are compelled to sue others for permission to live and to work, and to toil
  all their lives for a pittance that often does not enable them to escape starvation
  and pauperism.</p>
<p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging, is
  that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father. It
  is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
  all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want and
  misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
  than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
  generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. And, to recall your own
  words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that shall
  never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds only in
  the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now assuming
  is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their children by
  appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s children of the
  unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</p>
<p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers! Is it
  not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall come to
  manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue, piety and
  industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all others free
  access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
<p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from want
  and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as much more as the
  providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice of God laughs at the
  efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law that binds humanity together
  poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor. Even the few who are able in
  the general struggle to leave their children wealth that they fondly think
  will keep them from want and misery in the uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do
  they succeed? Does experience show that it is a benefit to a child to place
  him above his fellows and enable him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not
  for him? Is not such wealth oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its
  expectation often destroy filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings
  into families? And how far and how long are even the richest and strongest
  able to exempt their children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain
  than that the blood of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and
  that the descendants of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
<p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste of
  God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would go
  to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than a comfortable
  living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled or incapacitated,
  or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners, the most ample provision
  could be made out of that great and increasing fund with which God in his law
  of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter of niggardly and degrading alms,
  but as a matter of right, as the assurance which in a Christian state society
  owes to all its members.</p>
<p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
  of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
  us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
  way of the single tax.</p>
<p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to those
  who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who have come
  to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
<p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
  to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his Father;
  saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone about his
  neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure such a
  little one?</p>
<p>And what today is the result of private property in land in the richest of
  so-called Christian countries? Is it not that young people fear to marry; that
  married people fear to have children; that children are driven out of life
  from sheer want of proper nourishment and care, or compelled to toil when they
  ought to be at school or at play; that great numbers of those who attain maturity
  enter it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves, undeveloped minds &#8212; under
  conditions that foredoom them, not merely to suffering, but to crime; that
  fit them in advance for the prison and the brothel?</p>
<p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
  of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!</p>
<p><strong><em>7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
  and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (51.)</em></strong></p>
<p>The idea, as expressed by Arthur Young, that &#8220;the magic of property
  turns barren sands to gold&#8221; springs from the confusion of ownership with
  possession, of which I have before spoken, that attributes to private property
  in land what is due to security of the products of labor. It is needless for
  me again to point out that the change we propose, the taxation for public uses
  of land values, or economic rent, and the abolition of other taxes, would give
  to the user of land far greater security for the fruits of his labor than the
  present system and far greater permanence of possession. Nor is it necessary
  further to show how it would give homes to those who are now homeless and bind
  men to their country. For under it every one who wanted a piece of land for
  a home or for productive use could get it without purchase price and hold it
  even without tax, since the tax we propose would not fall on all land, nor
  even on all land in use, but only on land better than the poorest land in use,
  and is in reality not a tax at all, but merely a return to the state for the
  use of a valuable privilege. And even those who from circumstances or occupation
  did not wish to make permanent use of land would still have an equal interest
  with all others in the land of their country and in the general prosperity.</p>
<p>But I should like your Holiness to consider how utterly unnatural is the condition
  of the masses in the richest and most progressive of Christian countries; how
  large bodies of them live in habitations in which a rich man would not ask
  his dog to dwell; how the great majority have no homes from which they are
  not liable on the slightest misfortune to be evicted; how numbers have no homes
  at all, but must seek what shelter chance or charity offers. I should like
  to ask your Holiness to consider how the great majority of men in such countries
  have no interest whatever in what they are taught to call their native land,
  for which they are told that on occasions it is their duty to fight or to die.
  What right, for instance, have the majority of your countrymen in the land
  of their birth? Can they live in Italy outside of a prison or a poorhouse except
  as they buy the privilege from some of the exclusive owners of Italy? Cannot
  an Englishman, an American, an Arab or a Japanese do as much? May not what
  was said centuries ago by Tiberius Gracchus be said today: &#8220;Men of Rome!
  you are called the lords of the world, yet have no right to a square foot of
  its soil! The wild beasts have their dens, but the soldiers of Italy have only
  water and air!&#8221;</p>
<p>What is true of Italy is true of the civilized world &#8212; is becoming increasingly
  true. It is the inevitable effect as civilization progresses of private property
  in land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>8. That the right to possess private property in land is from
      nature, not from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that
      to take the value
  of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private owner.
  (51.)</em></strong></p>
<p>This, like much else that your Holiness says, is masked in the use of the
  indefinite terms &#8220;private property&#8221; and &#8220;private owner&#8221; &#8212; a
  want of precision in the use of words that has doubtless aided in the confusion
  of your own thought. But the context leaves no doubt that by private property
  you mean private property in land, and by private owner, the private owner
  of land.</p>
<p>The contention, thus made, that private property in land is from nature, not
  from man, has no other basis than the confounding of ownership with possession
  and the ascription to property in land of what belongs to its contradictory,
  property in the proceeds of labor. You do not attempt to show for it any other
  basis, nor has any one else ever attempted to do so. That private property
  in the products of labor is from nature is clear, for nature gives such things
  to labor and to labor alone. Of every article of this kind, we know that it
  came into being as nature&#8217;s response to the exertion of an individual
  man or of individual men &#8212; given by nature directly and exclusively to him or
  to them. Thus there inheres in such things a right of private property, which
  originates from and goes back to the source of ownership, the maker of the
  thing. This right is anterior to the state and superior to its enactments,
  so that, as we hold, it is a violation of natural right and an injustice to
  the private owner for the state to tax the processes and products of labor.
  They do not belong to Caesar. They are things that God, of whom nature is but
  an expression, gives to those who apply for them in the way he has appointed &#8212; by
  labor.</p>
<p>But who will dare trace the individual ownership of land to any grant from
  the Maker of land? What does nature give to such ownership? how does she in
  any way recognize it? Will any one show from difference of form or feature,
  of stature or complexion, from dissection of their bodies or analysis of their
  powers and needs, that one man was intended by nature to own land and another
  to live on it as his tenant? That which derives its existence from man and
  passes away like him, which is indeed but the evanescent expression of his
  labor, man may hold and transfer as the exclusive property of the individual;
  but how can such individual ownership attach to land, which existed before
  man was, and which continues to exist while the generations of men come and
  go &#8212; the unfailing storehouse that the Creator gives to man for &#8220;the daily
  supply of his daily wants&#8221;?<br />
  Clearly, the private ownership of land is from the state, not from nature.
  Thus, not merely can no objection be made on the score of morals when it is
  proposed that the state shall abolish it altogether, but insomuch as it is
  a violation of natural right, its existence involving a gross injustice on
  the part of the state, an &#8220;impious violation of the benevolent intention
  of the Creator,&#8221; it is a moral duty that the state so abolish it.</p>
<p>So far from there being anything unjust in taking the full value of landownership
  for the use of the community, the real injustice is in leaving it in private
  hands &#8212; an injustice that amounts to robbery and murder.</p>
<p>And when your Holiness shall see this I have no fear that you will listen
  for one moment to the impudent plea that before the community can take what
  God intended it to take &#8212; before men who have been disinherited of their natural
  rights can be restored to them, the present owners of land shall first be compensated.</p>
<p>For not only will you see that the single tax will directly and largely benefit
  small landowners, whose interests as laborers and capitalists are much greater
  than their interests as landowners, and that though the great landowners &#8212; or
  rather the propertied class in general among whom the profits of landownership
  are really divided through mortgages, rent-charges, etc. &#8212; would relatively lose,
  they too would be absolute gainers in the increased prosperity and improved
  morals; but more quickly, more strongly, more peremptorily than from any calculation
  of gains or losses would your duty as a man, your faith as a Christian, forbid
  you to listen for one moment to any such paltering with right and wrong.</p>
<p>Where the state takes some land for public uses it is only just that those
  whose land is taken should be compensated, otherwise some landowners would
  be treated more harshly than others. But where, by a measure affecting all
  alike, rent is appropriated for the benefit of all, there can be no claim to
  compensation. Compensation in such case would be a continuance of the same
  in another form &#8212; the giving to landowners in the shape of interest of what they
  before got as rent. Your Holiness knows that justice and injustice are not
  thus to be juggled with, and when you fully realize that land is really the
  storehouse that God owes to all his children, you will no more listen to any
  demand for compensation for restoring it to them than Moses would have listened
  to a demand that Pharaoh should be compensated before letting the children
  of Israel go.</p>
<p>Compensated for what? For giving up what has been unjustly taken? The demand
  of landowners for compensation is not that. We do not seek to spoil the Egyptians.
  We do not ask that what has been unjustly taken from laborers shall be restored.
  We are willing that bygones should be bygones and to leave dead wrongs to bury
  their dead. We propose to let those who by the past appropriation of land values
  have taken the fruits of labor to retain what they have thus got. We merely
  propose that for the future such robbery of labor shall cease &#8212; that for the
  future, not for the past, landholders shall pay to the community the rent that
  to the community is justly due.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>III.</strong></p>
<p>I have said enough to show your Holiness the injustice into which you fall
  in classing us, who in seeking virtually to abolish private property in land
  seek more fully to secure the true rights of property, with those whom you
  speak of as socialists, who wish to make all property common. But you also
  do injustice to the socialists.</p>
<p>There are many, it is true, who feeling bitterly the monstrous wrongs of the
  present distribution of wealth are animated only by a blind hatred of the rich
  and a fierce desire to destroy existing social adjustments. This class is indeed
  only less dangerous than those who proclaim that no social improvement is needed
  or is possible. But it is not fair to confound with them those who, however
  mistakenly, propose definite schemes of remedy.</p>
<p>The socialists, as I understand them, and as the term has come to apply to
  anything like a definite theory and not to be vaguely and improperly used to
  include all who desire social improvement, do not, as you imply, seek the abolition
  of all private property. Those who do this are properly called communists.
  What the socialists seek is the state assumption of capital (in which they
  vaguely and erroneously include land), or more properly speaking, of large
  capitals, and state management and direction of at least the larger operations
  of industry. In this way they hope to abolish interest, which they regard as
  a wrong and an evil; to do away with the gains of exchangers, speculators,
  contractors and middlemen, which they regard as waste; to do away with the
  wage system and secure general cooperation; and to prevent competition, which
  they deem the fundamental cause of the impoverishment of labor. The more moderate
  of them, without going so far, go in the same direction, and seek some remedy
  or palliation of the worst forms of poverty by government regulation. The essential
  character of socialism is that it looks to the extension of the functions of
  the state for the remedy of social evils; that it would substitute regulation
  and direction for competition; and intelligent control by organized society
  for the free play of individual desire and effort.</p>
<p>Though not usually classed as socialists, both the trades-unionists and the
  protectionists have the same essential character. The trades-unionists seek
  the increase of wages, the reduction of working-hours and the general improvement
  in the condition of wage-workers, by organizing them into guilds or associations
  which shall fix the rates at which they will sell their labor; shall deal as
  one body with employers in case of dispute; shall use on occasion their necessary
  weapon, the strike; and shall accumulate funds for such purposes and for the
  purpose of assisting members when on a strike, or (sometimes) when out of employment.
  The protectionists seek by governmental prohibitions or taxes on imports to
  regulate the industry and control the exchanges of each country, so as, they
  imagine, to diversify home industries and prevent the competition of people
  of other countries.</p>
<p>At the opposite extreme are the anarchists, a term which, though frequently
  applied to mere violent destructionists, refers also to those who, seeing the
  many evils of too much government, regard government in itself as evil, and
  believe that in the absence of coercive power the mutual interests of men would
  secure voluntarily what cooperation is needed.</p>
<p>Differing from all these are those for whom I would speak. Believing that
  the rights of true property are sacred, we would regard forcible communism
  as robbery that would bring destruction. But we would not be disposed to deny
  that voluntary communism might be the highest possible state of which men can
  conceive. Nor do we say that it cannot be possible for mankind to attain it,
  since among the early Christians and among the religious orders of the Catholic
  Church we have examples of communistic societies on a small scale. St. Peter
  and St. Paul, St. Thomas of Aquin and Fra Angelico, the illustrious orders
  of the Carmelites and Franciscans, the Jesuits, whose heroism carried the cross
  among the most savage tribes of American forests, the societies that wherever
  your communion is known have deemed no work of mercy too dangerous or too repellent
  &#8212; were or are communists. Knowing these things we cannot take it on ourselves
  to say
  that a social condition may not be possible in which an all-embracing love
  shall have taken the place of all other motives. But we see that communism
  is only possible where there exists a general and intense religious faith,
  and we see that such a state can be reached only through a state of justice.
  For before a man can be a saint he must first be an honest man.</p>
<p>With both anarchists and socialists, we, who for want of a better term have
  come to call ourselves single-tax men, fundamentally differ. We regard them
  as erring in opposite directions &#8212; the one in ignoring the social nature of man,
  the other in ignoring his individual nature. While we see that man is primarily
  an individual, and that nothing but evil has come or can come from the interference
  by the state with things that belong to individual action, we also see that
  he is a social being, or, as Aristotle called him, a political animal, and
  that the state is requisite to social advance, having an indispensable place
  in the natural order. Looking on the bodily organism as the analogue of the
  social organism, and on the proper functions of the state as akin to those
  that in the human organism are discharged by the conscious intelligence, while
  the play of individual impulse and interest performs functions akin to those
  discharged in the bodily organism by the unconscious instincts and involuntary
  motions, the anarchists seem to us like men who would try to get along without
  heads and the socialists like men who would try to rule the wonderfully complex
  and delicate internal relations of their frames by conscious will.</p>
<p>The philosophical anarchists of whom I speak are few in number, and of little
  practical importance. It is with socialism in its various phases that we have
  to do battle.</p>
<p>With the socialists we have some points of agreement, for we recognize fully
  the social nature of man and believe that all monopolies should be held and
  governed by the state. In these, and in directions where the general health,
  knowledge, comfort and convenience might be improved, we, too, would extend
  the functions of the state.</p>
<p>But it seems to us the vice of socialism in all its degrees is its want of
  radicalism, of going to the root. It takes its theories from those who have
  sought to justify the impoverishment of the masses, and its advocates generally
  teach the preposterous and degrading doctrine that slavery was the first condition
  of labor. It assumes that the tendency of wages to a minimum is the natural
  law, and seeks to abolish wages; it assumes that the natural result of competition
  is to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish competition by restrictions,
  prohibitions and extensions of governing power. Thus mistaking effects for
  causes, and childishly blaming the stone for hitting it, it wastes strength
  in striving for remedies that when not worse are futile. Associated though
  it is in many places with democratic aspiration, yet its essence is the same
  delusion to which the children of Israel yielded when against the protest of
  their prophet they insisted on a king; the delusion that has everywhere corrupted
  democracies and enthroned tyrants &#8212; that power over the people can be used for
  the benefit of the people; that there may be devised machinery that through
  human agencies will secure for the management of individual affairs more wisdom
  and more virtue than the people themselves possess.<br />
  This superficiality and this tendency may be seen in all the phases of socialism.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, protectionism. What support it has, beyond the mere selfish
  desire of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their goods are worth,
  springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not consumption, is
  the end of effort; that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s-worth, and
  to sell more profitable than to buy; and above all from a desire to limit competition,
  springing from an unanalyzing recognition of the phenomena that necessarily
  follow when men who have the need to labor are deprived by monopoly of access
  to the natural and indispensable element of all labor. Its methods involve
  the idea that governments can more wisely direct the expenditure of labor and
  the investment of capital than can laborers and capitalists, and that the men
  who control governments will use this power for the general good and not in
  their own interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict liberty, invent
  crimes. They promote perjury, fraud and corruption. And they would, were the
  theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilization and reduce mankind
  to savagery.</p>
<p>Take trades-unionism. While within narrow lines trades-unionism promotes the
  idea of the mutuality of interests, and often helps to raise courage and further
  political education, and while it has enabled limited bodies of working-men
  to improve somewhat their condition, and gain, as it were, breathing-space,
  yet it takes no note of the general causes that determine the conditions of
  labor, and strives for the elevation of only a small part of the great body
  by means that cannot help the rest. Aiming at the restriction of competition &#8212; the
  limitation of the right to labor, its methods are like those of an army, which
  even in a righteous cause are subversive of liberty and liable to abuse, while
  its weapon, the strike, is destructive in its nature, both to combatants and
  non-combatants, being a form of passive war. To apply the principle of trades-unions
  to all industry, as some dream of doing, would be to enthrall men in a caste
  system.</p>
<p>Or take even such moderate measures as the limitation of working-hours and
  of the labor of women and children. They are superficial in looking no further
  than to the eagerness of men and women and little children to work unduly,
  and in proposing forcibly to restrain overwork while utterly ignoring its cause &#8212; the
  sting of poverty that forces human beings to it. And the methods by which these
  restraints must be enforced, multiply officials, interfere with personal liberty,
  tend to corruption, and are liable to abuse.</p>
<p>As for thoroughgoing socialism, which is the more to be honored as having
  the courage of its convictions, it would carry these vices to full expression.
  Jumping to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it fails to see that
  oppression does not come from the nature of capital, but from the wrong that
  robs labor of capital by divorcing it from land, and that creates a fictitious
  capital that is really capitalized monopoly. It fails to see that it would
  be impossible for capital to oppress labor were labor free to the natural material
  of production; that the wage system in itself springs from mutual convenience,
  being a form of cooperation in which one of the parties prefers a certain to
  a contingent result; and that what it calls the &#8220;iron law of wages&#8221; is
  not the natural law of wages, but only the law of wages in that unnatural condition
  in which men are made helpless by being deprived of the materials for life
  and work. It fails to see that what it mistakes for the evils of competition
  are really the evils of restricted competition &#8212; are due to a one-sided competition
  to which men are forced when deprived of land. While its methods, the organization
  of men into industrial armies, the direction and control of all production
  and exchange by governmental or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried
  to full expression, mean Egyptian despotism.</p>
<p>We differ from the socialists in our diagnosis of the evil and we differ from
  them as to remedies. We have no fear of capital, regarding it as the natural
  handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself as natural and just; we
  would set no limit to accumulation, nor impose on the rich any burden that
  is not equally placed on the poor; we see no evil in competition, but deem
  unrestricted competition to be as necessary to the health of the industrial
  and social organism as the free circulation of the blood is to the health of
  the bodily organism &#8212; to be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation is to
  be secured. We would simply take for the community what belongs to the community,
  the value that attaches to land by the growth of the community; leave sacredly
  to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and, treating necessary
  monopolies as functions of the state, abolish all restrictions and prohibitions
  save those required for public health, safety, morals and convenience.</p>
<p>But the fundamental difference &#8212; the difference I ask your Holiness specially
  to note, is in this: socialism in all its phases looks on the evils of our
  civilization as springing from the inadequacy or inharmony of natural relations,
  which must be artificially organized or improved. In its idea there devolves
  on the state the necessity of intelligently organizing the industrial relations
  of men; the construction, as it were, of a great machine whose complicated
  parts shall properly work together under the direction of human intelligence.
  This is the reason why socialism tends toward atheism. Failing to see the order
  and symmetry of natural law, it fails to recognize God.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we who call ourselves single-tax men (a name which expresses
  merely our practical propositions) see in the social and industrial relations
  of men not a machine which requires construction, but an organism which needs
  only to be suffered to grow. We see in the natural social and industrial laws
  such harmony as we see in the adjustments of the human body, and that as far
  transcends the power of man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct as it
  is beyond man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct the vital movements
  of his frame. We see in these social and industrial laws so close a relation
  to the moral law as must spring from the same Authorship, and that proves the
  moral law to be the sure guide of man where his intelligence would wander and
  go astray. Thus, to us, all that is needed to remedy the evils of our time
  is to do justice and give freedom. This is the reason why our beliefs tend
  toward, nay are indeed the only beliefs consistent with a firm and reverent
  faith in God, and with the recognition of his law as the supreme law which
  men must follow if they would secure prosperity and avoid destruction. This
  is the reason why to us political economy only serves to show the depth of
  wisdom in the simple truths which common people heard gladly from the lips
  of Him of whom it was said with wonder, &#8220;Is not this the Carpenter of
  Nazareth?&#8221;</p>
<p>And it is because that in what we propose &#8212; the securing to all men of equal
  natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers and the removal of all
  legal restriction on the legitimate exercise of those powers &#8212; we see the conformation
  of human law to the moral law, that we hold with confidence that this is not
  merely the sufficient remedy for all the evils you so strikingly portray, but
  that it is the only possible remedy.</p>
<p>Nor is there any other. The organization of man is such, his relations to
  the world in which he is placed are such &#8212; that is to say, the immutable laws
  of God are such, that it is beyond the power of human ingenuity to devise any
  way by which the evils born of the injustice that robs men of their birthright
  can be removed otherwise than by doing justice, by opening to all the bounty
  that God has provided for all.</p>
<p>Since man can live only on land and from land, since land is the reservoir
  of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is taken, and on which
  he must draw for all that he can produce, does it not irresistibly follow that
  to give the land in ownership to some men and to deny to others all right to
  it is to divide mankind into the rich and the poor, the privileged and the
  helpless? Does it not follow that those who have no rights to the use of land
  can live only by selling their power to labor to those who own the land? Does
  it not follow that what the socialists call &#8220;the iron law of wages,&#8221; what
  the political economists term &#8220;the tendency of wages to a minimum,&#8221; must
  take from the landless masses &#8212; the mere laborers, who of themselves have no
  power to use their labor &#8212; all the benefits of any possible advance or improvement
  that does not alter this unjust division of land? For having no power to employ
  themselves, they must, either as labor-sellers or as land-renters, compete
  with one another for permission to labor. This competition with one another
  of men shut out from God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse has no limit but
  starvation, and must ultimately force wages to their lowest point, the point
  at which life can just be maintained and reproduction carried on.</p>
<p>This is not to say that all wages must fall to this point, but that the wages
  of that necessarily largest stratum of laborers who have only ordinary knowledge,
  skill and aptitude must so fall. The wages of special classes, who are fenced
  off from the pressure of competition by peculiar knowledge, skill or other
  causes, may remain above that ordinary level. Thus, where the ability to read
  and write is rare its possession enables a man to obtain higher wages than
  the ordinary laborer. But as the diffusion of education makes the ability to
  read and write general this advantage is lost. So when a vocation requires
  special training or skill, or is made difficult of access by artificial restrictions,
  the checking of competition tends to keep wages in it at a higher level. But
  as the progress of invention dispenses with peculiar skill, or artificial restrictions
  are broken down, these higher wages sink to the ordinary level. And so, it
  is only so long as they are special that such qualities as industry, prudence
  and thrift can enable the ordinary laborer to maintain a condition above that
  which gives a mere living. Where they become general, the law of competition
  must reduce the earnings or savings of such qualities to the general level &#8212; which,
  land being monopolized and labor helpless, can be only that at which the next
  lowest point is the cessation of life.</p>
<p>Or, to state the same thing in another way: Land being necessary to life and
  labor, its owners will be able, in return for permission to use it, to obtain
  from mere laborers all that labor can produce, save enough to enable such of
  them to maintain life as are wanted by the landowners and their dependents.</p>
<p>Thus, where private property in land has divided society into a landowning
  class and a landless class, there is no possible invention or improvement,
  whether it be industrial, social or moral, which, so long as it does not affect
  the ownership of land, can prevent poverty or relieve the general conditions
  of mere laborers. For whether the effect of any invention or improvement be
  to increase what labor can produce or to decrease what is required to support
  the laborer, it can, so soon as it becomes general, result only in increasing
  the income of the owners of land, without at all benefiting the mere laborers.
  In no event can those possessed of the mere ordinary power to labor, a power
  utterly useless without the means necessary to labor, keep more of their earnings
  than enough to enable them to live.</p>
<p>How true this is we may see in the facts of today. In our own time invention
  and discovery have enormously increased the productive power of labor, and
  at the same time greatly reduced the cost of many things necessary to the support
  of the laborer. Have these improvements anywhere raised the earnings of the
  mere laborer? Have not their benefits mainly gone to the owners of land &#8212; enormously
  increased land values?</p>
<p>I say mainly, for some part of the benefit has gone to the cost of monstrous
  standing armies and warlike preparations; to the payment of interest on great
  public debts; and, largely disguised as interest on fictitious capital, to
  the owners of monopolies other than that of land. But improvements that would
  do away with these wastes would not benefit labor; they would simply increase
  the profits of landowners. Were standing armies and all their incidents abolished,
  were all monopolies other than that of land done away with, were governments
  to become models of economy, were the profits of speculators, of middlemen,
  of all sorts of exchangers saved, were every one to become so strictly honest
  that no policemen, no courts, no prisons, no precautions against dishonesty
  would be needed &#8212; the result would not differ from that which has followed the
  increase of productive power.</p>
<p>Nay, would not these very blessings bring starvation to many of those who
  now manage to live? Is it not true that if there were proposed today, what
  all Christian men ought to pray for, the complete disbandment of all the armies
  of Europe, the greatest fears would be aroused for the consequences of throwing
  on the labor-market so many unemployed laborers?</p>
<p>The explanation of this and of similar paradoxes that in our time perplex
  on every side may be easily seen. The effect of all inventions and improvements
  that increase productive power, that save waste and economize effort, is to
  lessen the labor required for a given result, and thus to save labor, so that
  we speak of them as labor-saving inventions or improvements. Now, in a natural
  state of society where the rights of all to the use of the earth are acknowledged,
  labor-saving improvements might go to the very utmost that can be imagined
  without lessening the demand for men, since in such natural conditions the
  demand for men lies in their own enjoyment of life and the strong instincts
  that the Creator has implanted in the human breast. But in that unnatural state
  of society where the masses of men are disinherited of all but the power to
  labor when opportunity to labor is given them by others, there the demand for
  them becomes simply the demand for their services by those who hold this opportunity,
  and man himself becomes a commodity. Hence, although the natural effect of
  labor-saving improvement is to increase wages, yet in the unnatural condition
  which private ownership of the land begets, the effect, even of such moral
  improvements as the disbandment of armies and the saving of the labor that
  vice entails, is, by lessening the commercial demand, to lower wages and reduce
  mere laborers to starvation or pauperism. If labor-saving inventions and improvements
  could be carried to the very abolition of the necessity for labor, what would
  be the result? Would it not be that landowners could then get all the wealth
  that the land was capable of producing, and would have no need at all for laborers,
  who must then either starve or live as pensioners on the bounty of the landowners?</p>
<p>Thus, so long as private property in land continues &#8212; so long as some men are
  treated as owners of the earth and other men can live on it only by their sufferance &#8212; human
  wisdom can devise no means by which the evils of our present condition may
  be avoided.</p>
<p>Nor yet could the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>By the light of that right reason of which St. Thomas speaks we may see that
  even he, the Almighty, so long as his laws remain what they are, could do nothing
  to prevent poverty and starvation while property in land continues.</p>
<p>How could he? Should he infuse new vigor into the sunlight, new virtue into
  the air, new fertility into the soil, would not all this new bounty go to the
  owners of the land, and work not benefit, but rather injury, to mere laborers?
  Should he open the minds of men to the possibilities of new substances, new
  adjustments, new powers, could this do any more to relieve poverty than steam,
  electricity and all the numberless discoveries and inventions of our time have
  done? Or, if he were to send down from the heavens above or cause to gush up
  from the subterranean depths, food, clothing, all the things that satisfy man&#8217;s
  material desires, to whom under our laws would all these belong? So far from
  benefiting man, would not this increase and extension of his bounty prove but
  a curse, enabling the privileged class more riotously to roll in wealth, and
  bringing the disinherited class to more wide-spread starvation or pauperism?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>IV.</strong></p>
<p>Believing that the social question is at bottom a religious question, we deem
  it of happy augury to the world that in your Encyclical the most influential
  of all religious teachers has directed attention to the condition of labor.</p>
<p>But while we appreciate the many wholesome truths you utter, while we feel,
  as all must feel, that you are animated by a desire to help the suffering and
  oppressed, and to put an end to any idea that the church is divorced from the
  aspiration for liberty and progress, yet it is painfully obvious to us that
  one fatal assumption hides from you the cause of the evils you see, and makes
  it impossible for you to propose any adequate remedy. This assumption is, that
  private property in land is of the same nature and has the same sanctions as
  private property in things produced by labor. In spite of its undeniable truths
  and its benevolent spirit, your Encyclical shows you to be involved in such
  difficulties as a physician called to examine one suffering from disease of
  the stomach would meet should he begin with a refusal to consider the stomach.</p>
<p>Prevented by this assumption from seeing the true cause, the only causes you
  find it possible to assign for the growth of misery and wretchedness are the
  destruction of working-men&#8217;s guilds in the last century, the repudiation
  in public institutions and laws of the ancient religion, rapacious usury, the
  custom of working by contract, and the concentration of trade.</p>
<p>Such diagnosis is manifestly inadequate to account for evils that are alike
  felt in Catholic countries, in Protestant countries, in countries that adhere
  to the Greek communion and in countries where no religion is professed by the
  state; that are alike felt in old countries and in new countries; where industry
  is simple and where it is most elaborate; and amid all varieties of industrial
  customs and relations.</p>
<p>But the real cause will be clear if you will consider that since labor must
  find its workshop and reservoir in land, the labor question is but another
  name for the land question, and will reexamine your assumption that private
  property in land is necessary and right.</p>
<p>See how fully adequate is the cause I have pointed out. The most important
  of all the material relations of man is his relation to the planet he inhabits,
  and hence, the &#8220;impious resistance to the benevolent intentions of his
  Creator,&#8221; which, as Bishop Nulty says, is involved in private property
  in land, must produce evils wherever it exists. But by virtue of the law, &#8220;unto
  whom much is given, from him much is required,&#8221; the very progress of
  civilization makes the evils produced by private property in land more wide-spread
  and intense.</p>
<p>What is producing throughout the civilized world that condition of things
  you rightly describe as intolerable is not this and that local error or minor
  mistake. It is nothing less than the progress of civilization itself; nothing
  less than the intellectual advance and the material growth in which our century
  has been so preeminent, acting in a state of society based on private property
  in land; nothing less than the new gifts that in our time God has been showering
  on man, but which are being turned into scourges by man&#8217;s &#8220;impious
  resistance to the benevolent intentions of his Creator.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discoveries of science, the gains of invention, have given to us in this
  wonderful century more than has been given to men in any time before; and,
  in a degree so rapidly accelerating as to suggest geometrical progression,
  are placing in our hands new material powers. But with the benefit comes the
  obligation. In a civilization beginning to pulse with steam and electricity,
  where the sun paints pictures and the phonograph stores speech, it will not
  do to be merely as just as were our fathers. Intellectual advance and material
  advance require corresponding moral advance. Knowledge and power are neither
  good nor evil. They are not ends but means &#8212; evolving forces that if not controlled
  in orderly relations must take disorderly and destructive forms. The deepening
  pain, the increasing perplexity, the growing discontent for which, as you truly
  say, some remedy must be found and quickly found, mean nothing less than that
  forces of destruction swifter and more terrible than those that have shattered
  every preceding civilization are already menacing ours &#8212; that if it does not
  quickly rise to a higher moral level; if it does not become in deed as in word
  a Christian civilization, on the wall of its splendor must flame the doom of
  Babylon: &#8220;Thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One false assumption prevents you from seeing the real cause and true significance
    of the facts that have prompted your Encyclical. And it fatally fetters you
    when you seek a remedy.</p>
<p>You state that you approach the subject with confidence, yet in all that greater
  part of the Encyclical (19-67) devoted to the remedy, while there is an abundance
  of moral reflections and injunctions, excellent in themselves but dead and
  meaningless as you apply them, the only definite practical proposals for the
  improvement of the condition of labor are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1. That the state should step in to prevent overwork, to restrict the employment
      of women and children, to secure in workshops conditions not unfavorable to
      health and morals, and, at least where there is danger of insufficient wages
      provoking strikes, to regulate wages (39-40).</p>
  <p>2. That it should encourage the acquisition of property (in land) by working-men
      (50-51).</p>
  <p>3. That working-men&#8217;s associations should be formed (52-67). These remedies
      so far as they go are socialistic, and though the Encyclical is not without
      recognition of the individual character of man and of the priority of the individual
      and the family to the state, yet the whole tendency and spirit of its remedial
      suggestions lean unmistakably to socialism &#8212; extremely moderate socialism it
      is true; socialism hampered and emasculated by a supreme respect for private
      possessions; yet socialism still. But, although you frequently use the ambiguous
      term &#8220;private property&#8221; when the context shows that you have
      in mind private property in land, the one thing clear on the surface and
      becoming
      clearer still with examination is that you insist that whatever else may
      be done, the private ownership of land shall be left untouched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
  remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for your Holiness dictates
  that I should speak specifically, even though briefly, of the remedies proposed
  or suggested by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict the
    hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary conditions
    of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
<p>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate the conditions
  of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward democracy, and democratic
  states are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while in the industrial slavery,
  growing out of private ownership of land, that prevails in Christendom today,
  it is not the master who forces the slave to labor, but the slave who urges
  the master to let him labor. Thus the greatest difficulty in enforcing such
  regulations comes from those whom they are intended to benefit. It is not,
  for instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce restrictions on
  child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted by poverty, misrepresent
  the ages of their children even to the masters, and teach the children to misrepresent.</p>
<p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages, etc.,
  though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
  may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far wider
  branches of industry where the laborer works for himself or for small employers?</p>
<p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding that is
  generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under penalty of the number
  who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary buildings. Since these
  measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation or to augment ability
  to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in some places goes on
  in other places and to a worse degree. All such remedies begin at the wrong
  end. They are like putting on brake and bit to hold in quietness horses that
  are being lashed into frenzy; they are like trying to stop a locomotive by
  holding its wheels instead of shutting off steam; like attempting to cure smallpox
  by driving back its pustules. Men do not overwork themselves because they like
  it; it is not in the nature of the mother&#8217;s heart to send children to
  work when they ought to be at play; it is not of choice that laborers will
  work under dangerous and unsanitary conditions. These things, like overcrowding,
  come from the sting of poverty. And so long as the poverty of which they are
  the expression is left untouched, restrictions such as you indorse can have
  only partial and evanescent results. The cause remaining, repression in one
  place can only bring out its effects in other places, and the task you assign
  to the state is as hopeless as to ask it to lower the level of the ocean by
  bailing out the sea.</p>
<p>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond the
  power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of interest.
  Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect they have ever
  had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay, and for the same
  reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price of goods have always
  resulted merely in increasing them. The general rate of wages is fixed by the
  ease or difficulty with which labor can obtain access to land, ranging from
  the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to the least on which laborers
  can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized. Thus, where it has
  been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in the United States and
  in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe and it has been impossible
  to get European laborers to work there for wages that they would gladly accept
  at home; while as monopolization goes on under the influence of private property
  in land, wages tend to fall, and the social conditions of Europe to appear.
  Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition of common rights to land,
  of which I have spoken, the many attempts of the British Parliament to reduce
  wages by regulation failed utterly. And so, when the institution of private
  property in land had done its work in England, all attempts of Parliament to
  raise wages proved unavailing. In the beginning of this century it was even
  attempted to increase the earnings of laborers by grants in aid of wages. But
  the only result was to lower commensurately what wages employers paid.</p>
<p>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for as I
  have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity), only by offering employment
  to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and supporting them
  with its funds. Thus it is, that the thoroughgoing socialists who want the
  state to take all industry into its hands are much more logical than those
  timid socialists who propose that the state should regulate private industry &#8212; but
  only a little.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people should be
    encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land. It is evident that
    by this you mean that, as is now being attempted in Ireland, the state shall
    buy out large landowners in favor of small ones, establishing what are known
    as peasant proprietors. Supposing that this can be done even to a considerable
    extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger privileged
  class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for the still larger
  class
    that must remain, the laborers of the agricultural districts, the workmen
  of the towns, the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true, as Professor
  De
    Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant proprietary
    exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented with
  a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries as
    Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse than it is in Great
    Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the state attempts to buy
  up
    land for peasant proprietors will not the effect be, what is seen today in
    Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more difficult
    for those not so favored, and for those who will come after, to get land?
  How, moreover, on the principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to the state
    the interests of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will you justify
    state aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting on state
    aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to another
    to buy
    the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short to everybody who
    may be able to make good use of it or thinks that he could? And are you not
    thus
    landed in communism &#8212; not the communism of the early Christians and of the
    religious orders, but communism that uses the coercive power of the state
    to take rightful
    property by force from those who have, to give to those who have not? For
    the state has no purse of Fortunatus; the state cannot repeat the miracle
    of the
    loaves and fishes; all that the state can give, it must get by some form
    or other of the taxing power. And whether it gives or lends money, or gives
    or
    lends credit, it cannot give to those who have not, without taking from those
    who have.</p>
<p>But aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining
  private property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot coexist with the
  treatment of land as private property where civilization is materially advancing
  and wealth augments. We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient
  times were the main cause that transformed world-conquering Italy from a land
  of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact that while
  two centuries ago the majority of English farmers were owners of the land they
  tilled, tenancy has been for a long time the all but universal condition of
  the English farmer. And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity have
  come to urge concentration. It is in the United States that we may see on the
  largest scale how their power is operating to turn a nation of landowners into
  a nation of tenants. The principle is clear and irresistible. Material progress
  makes land more valuable, and when this increasing value is left to private
  owners land must pass from the ownership of the poor into the ownership of
  the rich, just as diamonds so pass when poor men find them. What the British
  government is attempting in Ireland is to build snow-houses in the Arabian
  desert! to plant bananas in Labrador!</p>
<p>There is one way, and only one way, in which working-people in our civilization
  may be secured a share in the land of their country, and that is the way that
  we propose &#8212; the taking of the profits of landownership for the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to working-men&#8217;s associations, what your Holiness seems to contemplate
    is the formation and encouragement of societies akin to the Catholic sodalities,
    and to the friendly and beneficial societies, like the Odd Fellows, which have
    had a large extension in English-speaking countries. Such associations may
    promote fraternity, extend social intercourse and provide assurance in case
    of sickness or death, but if they go no further they are powerless to affect
    wages even among their members. As to trades-unions proper, it is hard to define
    your position, which is, perhaps, best stated as one of warm approbation provided
    that they do not go too far. For while you object to strikes; while you reprehend
    societies that &#8220;do their best to get into their hands the whole field
    of labor and to force working-men either to join them or to starve;&#8221; while
    you discountenance the coercing of employers and seem to think that arbitration
    might take the place of strikes; yet you use expressions and assert principles
    that are all that the trades-unionist would ask, not merely to justify the
    strike and the boycott, but even the use of violence where only violence would
    suffice. For you speak of the insufficient wages of workmen as due to the greed
    of rich employers; you assume the moral right of the workman to obtain employment
    from others at wages greater than those others are willing freely to give;
    and you deny the right of any one to work for such wages as he pleases, in
    such a way as to lead Mr. Stead, in so widely read a journal as the Review
    of Reviews, approvingly to declare that you regard &#8220;blacklegging,&#8221; i.e.,
    the working for less than union wages, as a crime.</p>
<p>To men conscious of bitter injustice, to men steeped in poverty yet mocked
  by flaunting wealth, such words mean more than I can think you realize.</p>
<p>When fire shall be cool and ice be warm, when armies shall throw away lead
  and iron, to try conclusions by the pelting of rose-leaves, such labor associations
  as you are thinking of may be possible. But not till then. For labor associations
  can do nothing to raise wages but by force. It may be force applied passively,
  or force applied actively, or force held in reserve, but it must be force.
  They must coerce or hold the power to coerce employers; they must coerce those
  among their own members disposed to straggle; they must do their best to get
  into their hands the whole field of labor they seek to occupy and to force
  other working-men either to join them or to starve. Those who tell you of trades-unions
  bent on raising wages by moral suasion alone are like those who would tell
  you of tigers that live on oranges.</p>
<p>The condition of the masses today is that of men pressed together in a hall
  where ingress is open and more are constantly coming, but where the doors for
  egress are closed. If forbidden to relieve the general pressure by throwing
  open those doors, whose bars and bolts are private property in land, they can
  only mitigate the pressure on themselves by forcing back others, and the weakest
  must be driven to the wall. This is the way of labor-unions and trade-guilds.
  Even those amiable societies that you recommend would in their efforts to find
  employment for their own members necessarily displace others.</p>
<p>For even the philanthropy which, recognizing the evil of trying to help labor
  by alms, seeks to help men to help themselves by finding them work, becomes
  aggressive in the blind and bitter struggle that private property in land entails,
  and in helping one set of men injures others. Thus, to minimize the bitter
  complaints of taking work from others and lessening the wages of others in
  providing their own beneficiaries with work and wages, benevolent societies
  are forced to devices akin to the digging of holes and filling them up again.
  Our American societies feel this difficulty, General Booth encounters it in
  England, and the Catholic societies which your Holiness recommends must find
  it, when they are formed.<br />
  Your Holiness knows of, and I am sure honors, the princely generosity of Baron
  Hirsch toward his suffering coreligionists. But, as I write, the New York newspapers
  contain accounts of an immense meeting held in Cooper Union, in this city,
  on the evening of Friday, September 4, in which a number of Hebrew trades-unions
  protested in the strongest manner against the loss of work and reduction of
  wages that are being effected by Baron Hirsch&#8217;s generosity in bringing
  their own countrymen here and teaching them to work. The resolution unanimously
  adopted at this great meeting thus concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We now demand of Baron Hirsch himself that he release us from his &#8220;charity&#8221; and
      take back the millions, which, instead of a blessing, have proved a curse
    and a source of misery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor does this show that the members of these Hebrew labor-unions &#8212; who are themselves
  immigrants of the same class as those Baron Hirsch is striving to help, for
  in the next generation they lose with us their distinctiveness &#8212; are a whit less
  generous than other men.</p>
<p>Labor associations of the nature of trade-guilds or unions are necessarily
  selfish; by the law of their being they must fight for their own hand, regardless
  of who is hurt; they ignore and must ignore the teaching of Christ that we
  should do to others as we would have them do to us, which a true political
  economy shows is the only way to the full emancipation of the masses. They
  must do their best to starve workmen who do not join them, they must by all
  means in their power force back the &#8220;blackleg&#8221; &#8212; as the soldier
  in battle must shoot down his mother&#8217;s son if in the opposing ranks.
  And who is the blackleg? A fellow-creature seeking work &#8212; a fellow-creature in
  all probability more pressed and starved than those who so bitterly denounce
  him, and often with the hungry pleading faces of wife and child behind him.</p>
<p>And, in so far as they succeed, what is it that trade-guilds and unions do
  but to impose more restrictions on natural rights; to create &#8220;trusts&#8221; in
  labor; to add to privileged classes other somewhat privileged classes; and
  to press the weaker closer to the wall?</p>
<p>I speak without prejudice against trades-unions, of which for years I was
  an active member. And in pointing out to your Holiness that their principle
  is selfish and incapable of large and permanent benefits, and that their methods
  violate natural rights and work hardship and injustice, I am only saying to
  you what, both in my books and by word of mouth, I have said over and over
  again to them. Nor is what I say capable of dispute. Intelligent trades-unionists
  know it, and the less intelligent vaguely feel it. And even those of the classes
  of wealth and leisure who, as if to head off the demand for natural rights,
  are preaching trades-unionism to working-men, must needs admit it.</p>
<p>Your Holiness will remember the great London dock strike of two years ago,
  which, with that of other influential men, received the moral support of that
  Prince of the Church whom we of the English speech hold higher and dearer than
  any prelate has been held by us since the blood of Thomas &agrave; Becket stained
  the Canterbury altar.</p>
<p>In a volume called &#8220;<em>The Story of the Dockers&#8217; Strike</em>,&#8221; written
  by Messrs. H. Llewellyn Smith and Vaughan Nash, with an introduction by Sydney
  Buxton, M.P., which advocates trades-unionism as the solution of the labor
  question, and of which a large number were sent to Australia as a sort of official
  recognition of the generous aid received from there by the strikers, I find
  in the summing up, on pages 164-165, the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If the settlement lasts, work at the docks will be more regular, better
    paid, and carried on under better conditions than ever before. All this will
    be an
      unqualified gain to those who get the benefit from it. But another result
    will undoubtedly be to contract the field of employment and lessen the number
    of
      those for whom work can be found. The lower-class casual will, in the end,
      find his position more precarious than ever before, in proportion to the
    increased regularity of work which the &#8220;fitter&#8221; of the laborers will secure.
      The effect of the organization of dock labor, as of all classes of labor, will
      be to squeeze out the residuum. The loafer, the cadger, the failure in the
      industrial race &#8212; the members of &#8220;Class B&#8221; of Mr. Charles Booth&#8217;s
      hierarchy of social classes &#8212; will be no gainers by the change, but will
      rather find another door closed against them, and this in many cases the
      last door
      to employment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am far from wishing that your Holiness should join in that pharisaical denunciation
  of trades-unions common among those who, while quick to point out the injustice
  of trades-unions in denying to others the equal right to work, are themselves
  supporters of that more primary injustice that denies the equal right to the
  standing-place and natural material necessary to work. What I wish to point
  out is that trades-unionism, while it may be a partial palliative, is not a
  remedy; that it has not that moral character which could alone justify one
  in the position of your Holiness in urging it as good in itself. Yet, so long
  as you insist on private property in land what better can you do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>V.</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of the Encyclical you declare that the responsibility of
  the apostolical office urges your Holiness to treat the question of the condition
  of labor &#8220;expressly and at length in order that there may be no mistake
  as to the principles which truth and justice dictate for its settlement.&#8221; But,
  blinded by one false assumption, you do not see even fundamentals.</p>
<p>You assume that the labor question is a question between wage-workers and
  their employers. But working for wages is not the primary or exclusive occupation
  of labor. Primarily men work for themselves without the intervention of an
  employer. And the primary source of wages is in the earnings of labor, the
  man who works for himself and consumes his own products receiving his wages
  in the fruits of his labor. Are not fishermen, boatmen, cab-drivers, peddlers,
  working farmers &#8212; all, in short, of the many workers who get their wages directly
  by the sale of their services or products without the medium of an employer,
  as much laborers as those who work for the specific wages of an employer? In
  your consideration of remedies you do not seem even to have thought of them.
  Yet in reality the laborers who work for themselves are the first to be considered,
  since what men will be willing to accept from employers depends manifestly
  on what they can get by working for themselves.<br />
  You assume that all employers are rich men, who might raise wages much higher
  were they not so grasping. But is it not the fact that the great majority of
  employers are in reality as much pressed by competition as their workmen, many
  of them constantly on the verge of failure? Such employers could not possibly
  raise the wages they pay, however they might wish to, unless all others were
  compelled to do so.</p>
<p>You assume that there are in the natural order two classes, the rich and the
  poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.</p>
<p>It is true as you say that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
  in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
  however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor. The natural
  differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not greater than are natural
  differences in stature. But while it is only by selecting giants and dwarfs
  that we can find men twice as tall as others, yet in the difference between
  rich and poor that exists today we find some men richer than other men by
  the thousandfold and the millionfold.</p>
<p>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
  in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and poor
  is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who pay toll;
  between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders.</p>
<p>In what way does nature justify such a difference? In the numberless varieties
  of animated nature we find some species that are evidently intended to live
  on other species. But their relations are always marked by unmistakable differences
  in size, shape or organs. To man has been given dominion over all the other
  living things that tenant the earth. But is not this mastery indicated even
  in externals, so that no one can fail on sight to distinguish between a man
  and one of the inferior animals? Our American apologists for slavery used to
  contend that the black skin and woolly hair of the negro indicated the intent
  of nature that the black should serve the white; but the difference that you
  assume to be natural is between men of the same race. What difference does
  nature show between such men as would indicate her intent that one should live
  idly yet be rich, and the other should work hard yet be poor? If I could bring
  you from the United States a man who has $200,000,000, and one who is glad
  to work for a few dollars a week, and place them side by side in your antechamber,
  would you be able to tell which was which, even were you to call in the most
  skilled anatomist? Is it not clear that God in no way countenances or condones
  the division of rich and poor that exists today, or in any way permits it,
  except as having given them free will he permits men to choose either good
  or evil, and to avoid heaven if they prefer hell. For is it not clear that
  the division of men into the classes rich and poor has invariably its origin
  in force and fraud; invariably involves violation of the moral law; and is
  really a division into those who get the profits of robbery and those who are
  robbed; those who hold in exclusive possession what God made for all, and those
  who are deprived of his bounty? Did not Christ in all his utterances and parables
  show that the gross difference between rich and poor is opposed to God&#8217;s
  law? Would he have condemned the rich so strongly as he did, if the class distinction
  between rich and poor did not involve injustice &#8212; was not opposed to God&#8217;s
  intent?</p>
<p>It seems to us that your Holiness misses its real significance in intimating
  that Christ, in becoming the son of a carpenter and himself working as a carpenter,
  showed merely that &#8220;there is nothing to be ashamed of in seeking one&#8217;s
  bread by labor.&#8221; To say that is almost like saying that by not robbing
  people he showed that there is nothing to be ashamed of in honesty. If you
  will consider how true in any large view is the classification of all men into
  working-men, beggar-men and thieves, you will see that it was morally impossible
  that Christ during his stay on earth should have been anything else than a
  working-man, since he who came to fulfil the law must by deed as well as word
  obey God&#8217;s law of labor.</p>
<p>See how fully and how beautifully Christ&#8217;s life on earth illustrated
  this law. Entering our earthly life in the weakness of infancy, as it is appointed
  that all should enter it, he lovingly took what in the natural order is lovingly
  rendered, the sustenance, secured by labor, that one generation owes to its
  immediate successors. Arrived at maturity, he earned his own subsistence by
  that common labor in which the majority of men must and do earn it. Then passing
  to a higher &#8212; to the very highest &#8212; sphere of labor, he earned his subsistence
  by the teaching of moral and spiritual truths, receiving its material wages
  in the love-offerings of grateful hearers, and not refusing the costly spikenard
  with which Mary anointed his feet. So, when he chose his disciples, he did
  not go to landowners or other monopolists who live on the labor of others,
  but to common laboring-men. And when he called them to a higher sphere of labor
  and sent them out to teach moral and spiritual truths, he told them to take,
  without condescension on the one hand or sense of degradation on the other,
  the loving return for such labor, saying to them that &#8220;the laborer is
  worthy of his hire,&#8221; thus showing, what we hold, that all labor does
  not consist in what is called manual labor, but that whoever helps to add to
  the material, intellectual, moral or spiritual fullness of life is also a laborer.*</p>
<p>* Nor should it be forgotten that the investigator, the philosopher, the teacher,
  the artist, the poet, the priest, though not engaged in the production of wealth,
  are not only engaged in the production of utilities and satisfactions to which
  the production of wealth is only a means, but by acquiring and diffusing knowledge,
  stimulating mental powers and elevating the moral sense, may greatly increase
  the ability to produce wealth. For man does not live by bread alone. . . .
  He who by any exertion of mind or body adds to the aggregate of enjoyable wealth,
  increases the sum of human knowledge, or gives to human life higher elevation
  or greater fullness &#8212; he is, in the large meaning of the words, a &#8220;producer,&#8221; a &#8220;working-man,&#8221; a &#8220;laborer,&#8221; and
  is honestly earning honest wages. But he who without doing aught to make mankind
  richer, wiser, better, happier, lives on the toil of others &#8212; he, no matter by
  what name of honor he may be called, or how lustily the priests of Mammon may
  swing their censers before him, is in the last analysis but a beggar-man or
  a thief.  &#8212; Protection or Free Trade, pp. 74-75.</p>
<p>In assuming that laborers, even ordinary manual laborers, are naturally poor,
  you ignore the fact that labor is the producer of wealth, and attribute to
  the natural law of the Creator an injustice that comes from man&#8217;s impious
  violation of his benevolent intention. In the rudest stage of the arts it is
  possible, where justice prevails, for all well men to earn a living. With the
  labor-saving appliances of our time, it should be possible for all to earn
  much more. And so, in saying that poverty is no disgrace, you convey an unreasonable
  implication. For poverty ought to be a disgrace, since in a condition of social
  justice, it would, where unsought from religious motives or unimposed by unavoidable
  misfortune, imply recklessness or laziness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sympathy of your Holiness seems exclusively directed to the poor, the
    workers. Ought this to be so? Are not the rich, the idlers, to be pitied also?
    By the word of the gospel it is the rich rather than the poor who call for
    pity, for the presumption is that they will share the fate of Dives. And to
    any one who believes in a future life the condition of him who wakes to find
    his cherished millions left behind must seem pitiful. But even in this life,
    how really pitiable are the rich. The evil is not in wealth in itself &#8212; in its
    command over material things; it is in the possession of wealth while others
    are steeped in poverty; in being raised above touch with the life of humanity,
    from its work and its struggles, its hopes and its fears, and above all, from
    the love that sweetens life, and the kindly sympathies and generous acts that
    strengthen faith in man and trust in God.</p>
<p>Consider how the rich see the meaner side of human nature; how they are surrounded
  by flatterers and sycophants; how they find ready instruments not only to gratify
  vicious impulses, but to prompt and stimulate them; how they must constantly
  be on guard lest they be swindled; how often they must suspect an ulterior
  motive behind kindly deed or friendly word; how if they try to be generous
  they are beset by shameless beggars and scheming impostors; how often the family
  affections are chilled for them, and their deaths anticipated with the ill-concealed
  joy of expectant possession. The worst evil of poverty is not in the want of
  material things, but in the stunting and distortion of the higher qualities.
  So, though in another way, the possession of unearned wealth likewise stunts
  and distorts what is noblest in man.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s commands cannot be evaded with impunity. If it be God&#8217;s
  command that men shall earn their bread by labor, the idle rich must suffer.
  And they do. See the utter vacancy of the lives of those who live for pleasure;
  see the loathsome vices bred in a class who surrounded by poverty are sated
  with wealth. See that terrible punishment of ennui, of which the poor know
  so little that they cannot understand it; see the pessimism that grows among
  the wealthy classes &#8212; that shuts out God, that despises men, that deems existence
  in itself an evil, and fearing death yet longs for annihilation.</p>
<p>When Christ told the rich young man who sought him to sell all he had and
  to give it to the poor, he was not thinking of the poor, but of the young man.
  And I doubt not that among the rich, and especially among the self-made rich,
  there are many who at times at least feel keenly the folly of their riches
  and fear for the dangers and temptations to which these expose their children.
  But the strength of long habit, the prompting of pride, the excitement of making
  and holding what have become for them the counters in a game of cards, the
  family expectations that have assumed the character of rights, and the real
  difficulty they find in making any good use of their wealth, bind them to their
  burden, like a weary donkey to his pack, till they stumble on the precipice
  that bounds this life.</p>
<p>Men who are sure of getting food when they shall need it eat only what appetite
  dictates. But with the sparse tribes who exist on the verge of the habitable
  globe life is either a famine or a feast. Enduring hunger for days, the fear
  of it prompts them to gorge like anacondas when successful in their quest of
  game. And so, what gives wealth its curse is what drives men to seek it, what
  makes it so envied and admired &#8212; the fear of want. As the unduly rich are the
  corollary of the unduly poor, so is the soul-destroying quality of riches but
  the reflex of the want that embrutes and degrades. The real evil lies in the
  injustice from which unnatural possession and unnatural deprivation both spring.</p>
<p>But this injustice can hardly be charged on individuals or classes. The existence
  of private property in land is a great social wrong from which society at large
  suffers, and of which the very rich and the very poor are alike victims, though
  at the opposite extremes. Seeing this, it seems to us like a violation of Christian
  charity to speak of the rich as though they individually were responsible for
  the sufferings of the poor. Yet, while you do this, you insist that the cause
  of monstrous wealth and degrading poverty shall not be touched. Here is a man
  with a disfiguring and dangerous excrescence. One physician would kindly, gently,
  but firmly remove it. Another insists that it shall not be removed, but at
  the same time holds up the poor victim to hatred and ridicule. Which is right?</p>
<p>In seeking to restore all men to their equal and natural rights we do not
  seek the benefit of any class, but of all. For we both know by faith and see
  by fact that injustice can profit no one and that justice must benefit all.</p>
<p>Nor do we seek any &#8220;futile and ridiculous equality.&#8221; We recognize,
  with you, that there must always be differences and inequalities. In so far
  as these are in conformity with the moral law, in so far as they do not violate
  the command, &#8220;Thou shalt not steal,&#8221; we are content. We do not
  seek to better God&#8217;s work; we seek only to do his will. The equality
  we would bring about is not the equality of fortune, but the equality of natural
  opportunity; the equality that reason and religion alike proclaim &#8212; the equality
  in usufruct of all his children to the bounty of Our Father who art in Heaven.</p>
<p>And in taking for the uses of society what we clearly see is the great fund
  intended for society in the divine order, we would not levy the slightest tax
  on the possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they might be. Not only do
  we deem such taxes a violation of the right of property, but we see that by
  virtue of beautiful adaptations in the economic laws of the Creator, it is
  impossible for any one honestly to acquire wealth, without at the same time
  adding to the wealth of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To persist in a wrong, to refuse to undo it, is always to become involved
    in other wrongs. Those who defend private property in land, and thereby deny
    the first and most important of all human rights, the equal right to the
  material substratum of life, are compelled to one of two courses. Either they
  must,
    as do those whose gospel is &#8220;Devil take the hindermost,&#8221; deny
    the equal right to life, and by some theory like that to which the English
    clergyman
    Malthus has given his name, assert that nature (they do not venture to say
    God) brings into the world more men than there is provision for; or, they
    must, as do the socialists, assert as rights what in themselves are wrongs.</p>
<p>Your Holiness in the Encyclical gives an example of this. Denying the equality
  of right to the material basis of life, and yet conscious that there is a right
  to live, you assert the right of laborers to employment and their right to
  receive from their employers a certain indefinite wage. No such rights exist.
  No one has a right to demand employment of another, or to demand higher wages
  than the other is willing to give, or in any way to put pressure on another
  to make him raise such wages against his will. There can be no better moral
  justification for such demands on employers by working-men than there would
  be for employers demanding that working-men shall be compelled to work for
  them when they do not want to and to accept wages lower than they are willing
  to take. Any seeming justification springs from a prior wrong, the denial to
  working-men of their natural rights, and can in the last analysis rest only
  on that supreme dictate of self-preservation that under extraordinary circumstances
  makes pardonable what in itself is theft, or sacrilege or even murder.</p>
<p>A fugitive slave with the bloodhounds of his pursuers baying at his heels
  would in true Christian morals be held blameless if he seized the first horse
  he came across, even though to take it he had to knock down the rider. But
  this is not to justify horse-stealing as an ordinary means of traveling.</p>
<p>When his disciples were hungry Christ permitted them to pluck corn on the
  Sabbath day. But he never denied the sanctity of the Sabbath by asserting that
  it was under ordinary circumstances a proper time to gather corn.</p>
<p>He justified David, who when pressed by hunger committed what ordinarily would
  be sacrilege, by taking from the temple the loaves of proposition. But in this
  he was far from saying that the robbing of temples was a proper way of getting
  a living.</p>
<p>In the Encyclical however you commend the application to the ordinary relations
  of life, under normal conditions, of principles that in ethics are only to
  be tolerated under extraordinary conditions. You are driven to this assertion
  of false rights by your denial of true rights. The natural right which each
  man has is not that of demanding employment or wages from another man; but
  that of employing himself &#8212; that of applying by his own labor to the inexhaustible
  storehouse which the Creator has in the land provided for all men. Were that
  storehouse open, as by the single tax we would open it, the natural demand
  for labor would keep pace with the supply, the man who sold labor and the man
  who bought it would become free exchangers for mutual advantage, and all cause
  for dispute between workman and employer would be gone. For then, all being
  free to employ themselves, the mere opportunity to labor would cease to seem
  a boon; and since no one would work for another for less, all things considered,
  than he could earn by working for himself, wages would necessarily rise to
  their full value, and the relations of workman and employer be regulated by
  mutual interest and convenience.</p>
<p>This is the only way in which they can be satisfactorily regulated.</p>
<p>Your Holiness seems to assume that there is some just rate of wages that employers
  ought to be willing to pay and that laborers should be content to receive,
  and to imagine that if this were secured there would be an end of strife. This
  rate you evidently think of as that which will give working-men a frugal living,
  and perhaps enable them by hard work and strict economy to lay by a little
  something.</p>
<p>But how can a just rate of wages be fixed without the &#8220;higgling of the
  market&#8221; any more than the just price of corn or pigs or ships or paintings
  can be so fixed? And would not arbitrary regulation in the one case as in the
  other check that interplay that most effectively promotes the economical adjustment
  of productive forces? Why should buyers of labor, any more than buyers of commodities,
  be called on to pay higher prices than in a free market they are compelled
  to pay? Why should the sellers of labor be content with anything less than
  in a free market they can obtain? Why should working-men be content with frugal
  fare when the world is so rich? Why should they be satisfied with a lifetime
  of toil and stinting, when the world is so beautiful? Why should not they also
  desire to gratify the higher instincts, the finer tastes? Why should they be
  forever content to travel in the steerage when others find the cabin more enjoyable?</p>
<p>Nor will they. The ferment of our time does not arise merely from the fact
  that working-men find it harder to live on the same scale of comfort. It is
  also and perhaps still more largely due to the increase of their desires with
  an improved scale of comfort. This increase of desire must continue. For working-men
  are men. And man is the unsatisfied animal.</p>
<p>He is not an ox, of whom it may be said, so much grass, so much grain, so
  much water, and a little salt, and he will be content. On the contrary, the
  more he gets the more he craves. When he has enough food then he wants better
  food. When he gets a shelter then he wants a more commodious and tasty one.
  When his animal needs are satisfied then mental and spiritual desires arise.</p>
<p>This restless discontent is of the nature of man &#8212; of that nobler nature that
  raises him above the animals by so immeasurable a gulf, and shows him to be
  indeed created in the likeness of God. It is not to be quarreled with, for
  it is the motor of all progress. It is this that has raised St. Peter&#8217;s
  dome and on dull, dead canvas made the angelic face of the Madonna to glow;
  it is this that has weighed suns and analyzed stars, and opened page after
  page of the wonderful works of creative intelligence; it is this that has narrowed
  the Atlantic to an ocean ferry and trained the lightning to carry our messages
  to the remotest lands; it is this that is opening to us possibilities beside
  which all that our modern civilization has as yet accomplished seem small.
  Nor can it be repressed save by degrading and embruting men; by reducing Europe
  to Asia.</p>
<p>Hence, short of what wages may be earned when all restrictions on labor are
  removed and access to natural opportunities on equal terms secured to all,
  it is impossible to fix any rate of wages that will be deemed just, or any
  rate of wages that can prevent working-men striving to get more. So far from
  it making working-men more contented to improve their condition a little, it
  is certain to make them more discontented.</p>
<p>Nor are you asking justice when you ask employers to pay their working-men
  more than they are compelled to pay &#8212; more than they could get others to do the
  work for. You are asking charity. For the surplus that the rich employer thus
  gives is not in reality wages, it is essentially alms.</p>
<p><br />
    In speaking of the practical measures for the improvement of the condition
    of labor which your Holiness suggests, I have not mentioned what you place
    much stress upon &#8212; charity. But there is nothing practical in such recommendations
    as a cure for poverty, nor will any one so consider them. If it were possible
    for the giving of alms to abolish poverty there would be no poverty in Christendom.</p>
<p>Charity is indeed a noble and beautiful virtue, grateful to man and approved
  by God. But charity must be built on justice. It cannot supersede justice.</p>
<p>What is wrong with the condition of labor through the Christian world is that
  labor is robbed. And while you justify the continuance of that robbery it is
  idle to urge charity. To do so &#8212; to commend charity as a substitute for justice,
  is indeed something akin in essence to those heresies, condemned by your predecessors,
  that taught that the gospel had superseded the law, and that the love of God
  exempted men from moral obligations.</p>
<p>All that charity can do where injustice exists is here and there to mollify
  somewhat the effects of injustice. It cannot cure them. Nor is even what little
  it can do to mollify the effects of injustice without evil. For what may be
  called the superimposed, and in this sense, secondary virtues, work evil where
  the fundamental or primary virtues are absent. Thus sobriety is a virtue and
  diligence is a virtue. But a sober and diligent thief is all the more dangerous.
  Thus patience is a virtue. But patience under wrong is the condoning of wrong.
  Thus it is a virtue to seek knowledge and to endeavor to cultivate the mental
  powers. But the wicked man becomes more capable of evil by reason of his intelligence.
  Devils we always think of as intelligent.</p>
<p>And thus that pseudo-charity that discards and denies justice works evil.
  On the one side, it demoralizes its recipients, outraging that human dignity
  which as you say &#8220;God himself treats with reverence,&#8221; and turning
  into beggars and paupers men who to become self-supporting, self-respecting
  citizens need only the restitution of what God has given them. On the other
  side, it acts as an anodyne to the consciences of those who are living on the
  robbery of their fellows, and fosters that moral delusion and spiritual pride
  that Christ doubtless had in mind when he said it was easier for a camel to
  pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of
  Heaven. For it leads men steeped in injustice, and using their money and their
  influence to bolster up injustice, to think that in giving alms they are doing
  something more than their duty toward man and deserve to be very well thought
  of by God, and in a vague way to attribute to their own goodness what really
  belongs to God&#8217;s goodness. For consider: Who is the All-Provider? Who
  is it that as you say, &#8220;owes to man a storehouse that shall never fail,&#8221; and
  which &#8220;he finds only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; Is
  it not God? And when, therefore, men, deprived of the bounty of their God,
  are made dependent on the bounty of their fellow-creatures, are not these creatures,
  as it were, put in the place of God, to take credit to themselves for paying
  obligations that you yourself say God owes?</p>
<p>But worse perhaps than all else is the way in which this substituting of vague
  injunctions to charity for the clear-cut demands of justice opens an easy means
  for the professed teachers of the Christian religion of all branches and communions
  to placate Mammon while persuading themselves that they are serving God. Had
  the English clergy not subordinated the teaching of justice to the teaching
  of charity &#8212; to go no further in illustrating a principle of which the whole
  history of Christendom from Constantine&#8217;s time to our own is witness &#8212; the
  Tudor tyranny would never have arisen, and the separation of the church been
  averted; had the clergy of France never substituted charity for justice, the
  monstrous iniquities of the ancient r&eacute;gime would never have brought
  the horrors of the Great Revolution; and in my own country had those who should
  have preached justice not satisfied themselves with preaching kindness, chattel
  slavery could never have demanded the holocaust of our civil war.</p>
<p>No, your Holiness; as faith without works is dead, as men cannot give to God
  his due while denying to their fellows the rights be gave them, so charity
  unsupported by justice can do nothing to solve the problem of the existing
  condition of labor. Though the rich were to &#8220;bestow all their goods to
  feed the poor and give their bodies to be burned,&#8221; poverty would continue
  while property in land continues.</p>
<p>Take the case of the rich man today who is honestly desirous of devoting
  his wealth to the improvement of the condition of labor. What can he do?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bestow his wealth on those who need it? He may help some who deserve it,
    but will not improve general conditions. And against the good he may do will
    be
      the danger of doing harm.</li>
  <li>Build churches? Under the shadow of churches poverty festers and the vice
      that is born of it breeds.</li>
  <li>Build schools and colleges? Save as it may lead men to see the iniquity
    of private property in land, increased education can effect nothing for mere
    laborers,
      for as education is diffused the wages of education sink.</li>
  <li>Establish hospitals? Why, already it seems to laborers that there are too
      many seeking work, and to save and prolong life is to add to the pressure.</li>
  <li>Build model tenements? Unless he cheapens house accommodations he but drives
      further the class he would benefit, and as he cheapens house accommodations
      he brings more to seek employment and cheapens wages.</li>
  <li>Institute laboratories, scientific schools, workshops for physical experiments?
      He but stimulates invention and discovery, the very forces that, acting
    on a society based on private property in land, are crushing labor as between
      the upper and the nether millstone.</li>
  <li>Promote emigration from places where wages are low to places where they
    are somewhat higher? If he does, even those whom he at first helps to emigrate
      will soon turn on him to demand that such emigration shall be stopped as
    reducing
      their wages.</li>
  <li>Give away what land he may have, or refuse to take rent for it, or let
    it at lower rents than the market price? He will simply make new landowners
    or
      partial landowners; he may make some individuals the richer, but he will
    do nothing to improve the general condition of labor.</li>
  <li>Or, bethinking himself of those public-spirited citizens of classic times
      who spent great sums in improving their native cities, shall he try to
    beautify the city of his birth or adoption? Let him widen and straighten
    narrow and
      crooked streets, let him build parks and erect fountains, let him open
    tramways and bring in railroads, or in any way make beautiful and attractive
    his chosen
      city, and what will be the result? Must it not be that those who appropriate
      God&#8217;s bounty will take his also? Will it not be that the value of
      land will go up, and that the net result of his benefactions will be an
      increase
      of rents and a bounty to landowners? Why, even the mere announcement that
      he is going to do such things will start speculation and send up the value
      of
      land by leaps and bounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>What, then, can the rich man do to improve the condition of labor?</p>
<p>He can do nothing at all except to use his strength for the abolition of the
  great primary wrong that robs men of their birthright. The justice of God laughs
  at the attempts of men to substitute anything else for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If when in speaking of the practical measures your Holiness proposes, I did
    not note the moral injunctions that the Encyclical contains, it is not because
    we do not think morality practical. On the contrary it seems to us that in
    the teachings of morality is to be found the highest practicality, and that
    the question, What is wise? may always safely be subordinated to the question,
    What is right? But your Holiness in the Encyclical expressly deprives the
  moral truths you state of all real bearing on the condition of labor, just
  as the
    American people, by their legalization of chattel slavery, used to deprive
    of all practical meaning the declaration they deem their fundamental charter,
    and were accustomed to read solemnly on every national anniversary. That
  declaration asserts that &#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident &#8212; that all men are
    created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
    rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; But
    what did this truth mean on the lips of men who asserted that one man was the
    rightful property of another man who had bought him; who asserted that the
    slave was robbing the master in running away, and that the man or the woman
    who helped the fugitive to escape, or even gave him a cup of cold water in
    Christ&#8217;s name, was an accessory to theft, on whose head the penalties
    of the state should be visited?</p>
<p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which he finds
      only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the great majority
      of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</li>
  <li>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original sin.
      Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the necessity
      for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more than their
    share of labor on others.</li>
  <li>You tell us that God has not created us for the perishable and transitory
      things of earth, but has given us this world as a place of exile and not
    as our true country. Yet you tell us that some of the exiles have the exclusive
      right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that they may compel
    their
      fellow-exiles to pay them for sojourning here, and that this exclusive
    ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet to come, with the same right
    of excluding
      their fellows.</li>
  <li>You tell us that virtue is the common inheritance of all; that all men
    are children of God the common Father; that all have the same last end; that
    all
      are redeemed by Jesus Christ; that the blessings of nature and the gifts
    of grace belong in common to all, and that to all except the unworthy is
    promised
      the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven! Yet in all this and through all
    this you insist as a moral duty on the maintenance of a system that makes
    the reservoir
      of all God&#8217;s material bounties and blessings to man the exclusive
      property of a few of their number &#8212; you give us equal rights in heaven,
      but deny us equal
      rights on earth!</li>
</ul>
<p>It was said of a famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
  made just before the civil war, in a fugitive-slave case, that &#8220;it gave
  the law to the North and the nigger to the South.&#8221; It is thus that your
  Encyclical gives the gospel to laborers and the earth to the landlords. Is
  it really to be wondered at that there are those who sneeringly say, &#8220;The
  priests are ready enough to give the poor an equal share in all that is out
  of sight, but they take precious good care that the rich shall keep a tight
  grip on all that is within sight&#8221;?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Herein is the reason why the working masses all over the world are turning
    away from organized religion.</p>
<p>And why should they not? What is the office of religion if not to point out
  the principles that ought to govern the conduct of men toward each other; to
  furnish a clear, decisive rule of right which shall guide men in all the relations
  of life &#8212; in the workshop, in the mart, in the forum and in the senate, as well
  as in the church; to supply, as it were, a compass by which amid the blasts
  of passion, the aberrations of greed and the delusions of a short-sighted expediency
  men may safely steer? What is the use of a religion that stands palsied and
  paltering in the face of the most momentous problems? What is the use of a
  religion that whatever it may promise for the next world can do nothing to
  prevent injustice in this? Early Christianity was not such a religion, else
  it would never have encountered the Roman persecutions; else it would never
  have swept the Roman world. The skeptical masters of Rome, tolerant of all
  gods, careless of what they deemed vulgar superstitions, were keenly sensitive
  to a doctrine based on equal rights; they feared instinctively a religion that
  inspired slave and proletarian with a new hope; that took for its central figure
  a crucified carpenter; that taught the equal Fatherhood of God and the equal
  brotherhood of men; that looked for the speedy reign of justice, and that prayed, &#8220;<em>Thy
  Kingdom come on Earth!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, the same perceptions, the same aspirations, exist among the masses.
  Man is, as he has been called, a religious animal, and can never quite rid
  himself of the feeling that there is some moral government of the world, some
  eternal distinction between wrong and right; can never quite abandon the yearning
  for a reign of righteousness. And today, men who, as they think, have cast
  off all belief in religion, will tell you, even though they know not what it
  is, that with regard to the condition of labor something is wrong! If theology
  be, as St. Thomas of Aquin held it, the sum and focus of the sciences, is it
  not the business of religion to say clearly and fearlessly what that wrong
  is? It was by a deep impulse that of old when threatened and perplexed by general
  disaster men came to the oracles to ask, In what have we offended the gods?
  today, menaced by growing evils that threaten the very existence of society,
  men, conscious that something is wrong, are putting the same question to the
  ministers of religion. What is the answer they get? Alas, with few exceptions,
  it is as vague, as inadequate, as the answers that used to come from heathen
  oracles.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that the masses of men are losing faith?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me again state the case that your Encyclical presents:</p>
<p>What is that condition of labor which as you truly say is &#8220;the question
  of the hour,&#8221; and &#8220;fills every mind with painful apprehension&#8221;?
  Reduced to its lowest expression it is the poverty of men willing to work.
  And what is the lowest expression of this phrase? It is that they lack bread &#8212; for
  in that one word we most concisely and strongly express all the manifold material
  satisfactions needed by humanity, the absence of which constitutes poverty.</p>
<p>Now what is the prayer of Christendom &#8212; the universal prayer; the prayer that
  goes up daily and hourly wherever the name of Christ is honored; that ascends
  from your Holiness at the high altar of St. Peter&#8217;s, and that is repeated
  by the youngest child that the poorest Christian mother has taught to lisp
  a request to her Father in Heaven? It is, &#8220;Give us this day our daily
  bread!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet where this prayer goes up, daily and hourly, men lack bread. Is it not
  the business of religion to say why? If it cannot do so, shall not scoffers
  mock its ministers as Elias mocked the prophets of Baal, saying, &#8220;Cry
  with a louder voice, for he is a god; and perhaps he is talking, or is in an
  inn, or on a journey, or perhaps be is asleep, and must be awaked!&#8221; What
  answer can those ministers give? Either there is no God, or he is asleep, or
  else he does give men their daily bread, and it is in some way intercepted.</p>
<p>Here is the answer, the only true answer: If men lack bread it is not that
  God has not done his part in providing it. If men willing to labor are cursed
  with poverty, it is not that the storehouse that God owes men has failed; that
  the daily supply he has promised for the daily wants of his children is not
  here in abundance. It is, that impiously violating the benevolent intentions
  of their Creator, men have made land private property, and thus given into
  the exclusive ownership of the few the provision that a bountiful Father has
  made for all.</p>
<p align="left">Any other answer than that, no matter how it may be shrouded in the mere forms
  of religion, is practically an atheistical answer.</p>
<p align="center">    ___________________</p>
<p>    I have written this letter not alone for your Holiness, but for all whom
      I may hope it to reach. But in sending it to you personally, and in advance
      of
    publication, I trust that it may be by you personally read and weighed. In
    setting forth the grounds of our belief and in pointing out considerations
    which it seems to us you have unfortunately overlooked, I have written frankly,
    as was my duty on a matter of such momentous importance, and as I am sure
      you would have me write. But I trust I have done so without offense. For
      your office
    I have profound respect, for yourself personally the highest esteem. And
      while the views I have opposed seem to us erroneous and dangerous, we do
      not wish
    to be understood as in the slightest degree questioning either your sincerity
    or intelligence in adopting them. For they are views all but universally
      held by the professed religious teachers of Christendom, in all communions
      and creeds,
    and that have received the sanction of those looked to as the wise and learned.
    Under the conditions that have surrounded you, and under the pressure of
      so many high duties and responsibilities, culminating in those of your
      present
    exalted position, it is not to be expected that you should have hitherto
      thought to question them. But I trust that the considerations herein set
      forth may
    induce you to do so, and even if the burdens and cares that beset you shall
    now make impossible the careful consideration that should precede expression
    by one in your responsible position I trust that what I have written may
      not be without use to others.</p>
<p>And, as I have said, we are deeply grateful for your Encyclical. It is much
  that by so conspicuously calling attention to the condition of labor, you have
  recalled the fact forgotten by so many that the social evils and problems of
  our time directly and pressingly concern the church. It is much that you should
  thus have placed the stamp of your disapproval on that impious doctrine which
  directly and by implication has been so long and so widely preached in the
  name of Christianity, that the sufferings of the poor are due to mysterious
  decrees of Providence which men may lament but cannot alter. Your Encyclical
  will be seen by those who carefully analyze it to be directed not against socialism,
  which in moderate form you favor, but against what we in the United States
  call the single tax. Yet we have no solicitude for the truth save that it shall
  be brought into discussion, and we recognize in your Holiness&#8217;s Encyclical
  a most efficient means of promoting discussion, and of promoting discussion
  along the lines that we deem of the greatest importance &#8212; the lines of morality
  and religion. In this you deserve the gratitude of all who would follow truth,
  for it is of the nature of truth always to prevail over error where discussion
  goes on.</p>
<p>And the truth for which we stand has now made such progress in the minds of
  men that it must be heard; that it can never be stifled; that it must go on
  conquering and to conquer. Far-off Australia leads the van, and has already
  taken the first steps toward the single tax. In Great Britain, in the United
  States, and in Canada, the question is on the verge of practical politics and
  soon will be the burning issue of the time. Continental Europe cannot long
  linger behind. Faster than ever the world is moving.</p>
<p>Forty years ago slavery seemed stronger in the United States than ever before,
  and the market price of slaves &#8212; both working slaves and breeding slaves &#8212; was
  higher than it had ever been before, for the title of the owner seemed growing
  more secure. In the shadow of the Hall where the equal rights of man had been
  solemnly proclaimed, the manacled fugitive was dragged back to bondage, and
  on what to American tradition was our Marathon of freedom, the slave-master
  boasted that he would yet call the roll of his chattels.</p>
<p>Yet forty years ago, though the party that was to place Abraham Lincoln in
  the Presidential chair had not been formed, and nearly a decade was yet to
  pass ere the signal-gun was to ring out, slavery, as we may now see, was doomed.</p>
<p>today a wider, deeper, more beneficent revolution is brooding, not over one
  country, but over the world. God&#8217;s truth impels it, and forces mightier
  than he has ever before given to man urge it on. It is no more in the power
  of vested wrongs to stay it than it is in man&#8217;s power to stay the sun.
  The stars in their courses fight against Sisera, and in the ferment of today,
  to him who hath ears to hear, the doom of industrial slavery is sealed.</p>
<p>Where shall the dignitaries of the church be in the struggle that is coming,
  nay that is already here? On the side of justice and liberty, or on the side
  of wrong and slavery? with the delivered when the timbrels shall sound again,
  or with the chariots and the horsemen that again shall be engulfed in the sea?</p>
<p>As to the masses, there is little fear where they will be. Already, among
  those who hold it with religious fervor, the single tax counts great numbers
  of Catholics, many priests, secular and regular, and at least some bishops,
  while there is no communion or denomination of the many into which English-speaking
  Christians are divided where its advocates are not to be found.</p>
<p>Last Sunday evening in the New York church that of all churches in the world
  is most richly endowed, I saw the cross carried through its aisles by a hundred
  choristers, and heard a priest of that English branch of the church that three
  hundred years since was separated from your obedience, declare to a great congregation
  that the labor question was at bottom a religious question; that it could only
  be settled on the basis of moral right; that the first and clearest of rights
  is the equal right to the use of the physical basis of all life; and that no
  human titles could set aside God&#8217;s gift of the land to all men.</p>
<p>And as the cross moved by, and the choristers sang,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Raise ye the Christian&#8217;s war-cry &#8212; <br />
        The Cross of Christ the Lord!</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>men to whom it was a new thing bowed their heads, and in hearts long
            steeled against the church, as the willing handmaid of oppression,
            rose the &#8220;God
          wills it!&#8221; of the grandest and mightiest of crusades.</p>
<p>Servant of the Servants of God! I call you by the strongest and sweetest of
  your titles. In your hands more than in those of any living man lies the power
  to say the word and make the sign that shall end an unnatural divorce, and
  marry again to religion all that is pure and high in social aspiration.</p>
<p>Wishing for your Holiness the chiefest of all blessings, that you may know
  the truth and be freed by the truth; wishing for you the days and the strength
  that may enable you by the great service you may render to humanity to make
  your pontificate through all coming time most glorious; and with the profound
  respect due to your personal character and to your exalted office, I am,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br />
  HENRY GEORGE<br />
  NEW YORK, September 11, 1891.</p>
