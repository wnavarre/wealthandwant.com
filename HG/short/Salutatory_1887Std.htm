    <p>Henry George began a weekly newspaper, called <em><strong>The Standard</strong></em>,
    on January 8, 1887. This appeared in the first issue:</p>
  </blockquote>
<p align="center"><strong>Salutatory </strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">from Kenneth C. Wenzer, <em>An Anthology of Henry George's Thought, Volume
      I of the Henry George Centennial Trilogy</em>, University of Rochester Press,
      1997, page 26, available from <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/">http://www.schalkenbach.org/</a></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I begin the publication of this paper in response to many urgent requests,
  and because I believe that there is a field for a journal that shall serve
  as a focus for news and opinions relating to the great movement, now beginning,
  for the emancipation of labor by the restoration of natural rights.</p>
<p>The generation that abolished chattel slavery is passing away, and the political
  distinctions that grew out of that contest are becoming meaningless. The work
  now before us is the abolition of industrial slavery.</p>
<p>What God created for the use of all should be utilized for the benefit of
  all; what is produced by the individual belongs rightfully to the individual.
  The neglect of these simple principles has brought upon us the curse of widespread
  poverty and all the evils that flow from it. Their recognition will abolish
  poverty, will secure to the humblest independence and leisure, and will lay
  abroad and strong foundation on which all other reforms may be based. To secure
  the full recognition of these principles is the most important task to which
  any man can address himself today. It is in the hope of aiding in this work
  that I establish this paper.</p>
<p>I believe that the Declaration of Independence is not a mere string of glittering
  generalities. I believe that all men are really created equal, and that the
  securing of those equal natural rights is the true purpose and test of government.
  And against whatever law, custom or device that restrains men in the exercise
  of their natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness I shall
  raise my voice.</p>
<p>Confident in the strength of truth, I shall give no quarter to abuses and
  ask none from their champions. The political corruption that shames our democracy,
  the false theories that assume that a nation's prosperity lies in shutting
  itself in from free intercourse with other nations, the stupid fiscal system
  that piles up hundreds of millions of dollars in our treasury vaults while
  we are paying interest on an enormous debt; the aping of foreign nations that
  insists upon standing armies and navies modeled on aristocratic plans; the
  judicial system that offers a mockery of justice on one side and condones evildoing
  on the other; the false philanthropy that gives a dole while it denies a right;
  the lip worship of a just God and the heart worship of the Golden Calf &#8212;  all
  these are to my mind parts of one connected whole whose foundations are in
  the denial of the equal rights of man to the use of Nature's bounty; and in
  attacking and exposing them as opportunity may offer, I shall render easier
  the exposure and abolition of the great wrong from which they primarily spring.</p>
<p>I shall endeavor to conduct this paper by the same rules on which a just man
  would regulate his conduct. I shall not wittingly give currency to an untruth,
  and, if I inadvertently do so, will endeavor to repair the wrong. I shall endeavor
  to be fair to opponents and true to friends. I do not propose to make everything
  that shall appear here square to my own theories, but will be willing to give
  place to views which may differ from my own when they are so stated as to be
  worthy of consideration. I hope to make this paper the worthy exponent and
  advocate of the great party yet unnamed that is now beginning to form,  but
  at the same time to make its contents so varied and interesting as to insure
  for it a general circulation.</p>
<p>I ask for <em>The Standard</em> the active aid of all who wish to see such a paper
  firmly established . . . .<br>
