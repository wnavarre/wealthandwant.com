<p><b>How to Help the Unemployed </b></p>
</center>
<div style="text-align: center;">by Henry George</div>
<div></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>The North American Review</em>, February,
1894. <br>
pp 175-184</div>
<p>AN EPIDEMIC of what passes for charity is sweeping over the land.
From New York, where the new and massive United Charities Building,
the million-dollar gift of one philanthropist, gives stately evidence
that the battle against actual starvation has permanently transcended
the powers of a municipality that appropriates to it millions
annually and of the unorganized giving of greater millions; and from
Chicago, where the corridors of the City Hall and the doors of
churches have been thrown open for the shelter of those so poor as to
welcome such a bed, to Seattle, on Puget Sound, or Tampa, on the
Mexican Gulf, &#8212; all who have anything to give are being asked to
give. Municipalities, churches, boards of trade, real-estate
associations, labor unions and merchants' organizations are giving
and asking for charity funds. Officials are surrendering a percentage
on their salaries, policemen, railroad operatives, the employees of
large business establishments, factory hands, and even day laborers,
are docking themselves of part of their pay, and trades dinners being
given up to swell charity subscriptions. There are charity balls,
charity parties, charity entertainments, and charity funds of all
sorts. One great paper in New York is raising an old-clothes fund,
and another great paper a bread fund, and in Ashland, Wis., they have
made a charity mincepie twenty-two feet in circumference and a
quarter of a ton in weight. The politicians are always large givers
of alms, politicians of the Tammany type especially; but even Tammany
has special relief committees at work. One of the chiefs of New
York's "400" calls on each pupil of the public schools for a daily
contribution of a cold potato and a slice of bread for the organized
feeding of the hungry; and to complete the parallel with the "bread
and circuses" of the dying Roman republic, he also asks that the
churches be opened and their organs played every afternoon, so that
to free food may be added free music!</p>
<p>Yet there has been no disaster of fire or flood, no convulsion of
nature, no destruction by public enemies. The seasons have kept their
order, we have had the former and the latter rain, and the earth has
not refused her increase. Granaries are filled to overflowing, and
commodities, even these we have tried to make dear by tariff, were
never before so cheap.</p>
<p>The scarcity that is distressing and frightening the whole country
is a scarcity of employment. It is the unemployed for whom charity is
asked: not those who cannot or will not work, but those able to work
and anxious to work, who, through no fault of their own, cannot find
work. So clear, indeed, is it that of the great masses who are
suffering in this country today, by far the greater part are honest,
sober, and industrious, that the pharisees who preach that poverty is
due to laziness and thriftlessness, and the fanatics who attribute it
to drink, are for the moment silent. </p>
<p>Yet why is it that men able to work and willing to work cannot
find work? It is not strange that the failure to work should bring
want, for it is only by work that human wants are satisfied. But to
say that widespread distress comes from widespread inability to find
employment no more explains the distress than to say that the man
died from want of breath explains a sudden death. The pressing
question, the real question, is, What causes the want of
employment?</p>
<p>This, however, is the question that the men of light and leading,
the preachers, teachers, philanthropists, business men and editors of
great newspapers, who all over the country are speaking and writing
about the distress and raising funds for the unemployed, show no
anxiety to discover. Indeed, they seem averse to such inquiry. "The
cause of the want of employment," they say, tacitly or openly, "is
not to be considered now. The present duty is to keep people from
starving and freezing, or being driven to break in and steal. This is
no time for theories. It is a time for alms."</p>
<p>This attitude, if one considers it, seems something more than
strange. If in any village a traveler found the leading men
clustered about the body of one who had clearly come to untimely
death, yet anxious only to get it buried; making no inquiry into the
cause of death, and even discouraging inquiry, would he not suspect
them of knowing more of that cause than they cared to admit? Now,
this army of unemployed is as unnatural as is death in the prime of
life and vigor of every organ and faculty. Nay, it involves
presumption of wrong as clearly as cut throat or shattered skull.</p>
<p>What more unnatural than that alms should be asked, not for the
maimed, the halt and the blind, the helpless widow and the tender
orphan, but for grown men, strong men, skilful men, men able to work
and anxious to work! What more unnatural than that labor &#8212; the
producer of all food, all clothing, all shelter &#8212; should not be
exchangeable for its full equivalent in food, clothing, and shelter;
that while the things it produces have value, labor, the giver of all
value, should seem valueless!</p>
<p>Here are men, having the natural wants of man, having the natural
powers of man -- powers adapted and intended and more than sufficient
to supply those wants. To say that they are willing to use their
powers for the satisfaction of their wants, yet cannot do so, is to
say that there is a wrong. If it is not their fault, whose fault is
it? Wrong somewhere there must be.</p>
<p>Of old it was said, "If any would not work, neither should he
eat." Men able to work, and willing to work, who could not find work,
were not dreamed of. External nature is the same; the constitution of
man has not changed. How, then, is it that we now hear, "He who
cannot find work shall be fed by charity"? Those who say this do not
say, "He who does not work shall be fed by charity." These
pseudo-philanthropists know the penalty of such an attempt to boldly
annul the natural law that by his toil man shall be fed. By skimping
the dole to what will just prevent actual starvation, and by the
tests and inquiries and degrading conditions of organized charity,
they try to draw the line between those who cannot find work and
those who do not want to. But this line it is impossible to draw, for
no such clear line exists. Organize charity as we may, men who cannot
find work go hungry, and men who do not want to find work are fed,
and men willing to work are converted into men unwilling to work.</p>
<p>For willingness to work depends on what can be had by work and
what can be had without work, and the personal and social estimate of
the relation. Work is in itself painful and repellent. No human being
ever worked for the sake of working. I write this article that it may
be published in <em>THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW</em>, and that I may get the pay
for it, and communicate my thought to others. But the work of writing
it is as irksome to me as sawing wood. So with all work. In a ruder
stage men looked upon the necessity of work as the curse of an
offended creator. We who may now see to what marvelous advances it
has led, and recognize in it the motor of all human progress, may
behold in it, not a curse, but a blessing. But its irksomeness
remains. What keeps any of us at work are our desires and hopes &#8212;
our wants and our pride. Kill hope and lessen desire by crucifying
the feeling of personal independence and accustoming your man to a
life maintained by alms, and you will make of the most industrious a
tramp. For the law of our being is that we seek the gratification of
our desires with the least exertion.</p>
<p>Why should charity be offered the unemployed? It is not alms they
ask. They are insulted and embittered and degraded by being forced to
accept as paupers what they would gladly earn as workers. What they
ask is not charity, but the opportunity to use their own labor in
satisfying their own wants. Why can they not have that? It is their
natural right. He who made food and clothing and shelter necessary to
man's life has also given to man, in the power of labor, the means of
maintaining that life; and when, without fault of their own, men
cannot exert that power, there is somewhere a wrong of the same kind
as denial of the right of property and denial of the right of life &#8212;
a wrong equivalent to robbery and murder on the grandest scale.</p>
<p>Charity can only palliate present suffering a little at the risk
of fatal disease. For charity cannot right a wrong; only justice can
do that. Charity is false, futile, and poisonous when offered as a
substitute for justice. This is the fatal taint that runs through all
the efforts of the rich and influential to aid the unemployed, with
which our newspapers now are full. Like the gatherings of clergymen
called in Chicago by Editor Stead &#8212; blinded leader of the wilfully
blind &#8212; their spirit is that of men pretending to look for what they
are determined not to find; of men, like those of Moscow of whom
Tolstoi tells, willing to do anything whatever to help the poor &#8212;
except to get off their backs.</p>
<p>Yet this is to be expected. For the question of the unemployed is
but a more than usually acute phase of the great labor question &#8212; a
question of the distribution of wealth. Now, given any wrong, no
matter what, that affects the distribution of wealth, and it follows
that the leading class must be averse to any examination or question
of it. For, since wealth is power, the leading class is necessarily
dominated by those who profit or imagine they profit by injustice in
the distribution of wealth. Hence, the very indisposition to ask the
cause of evils so great as to arouse and startle the whole community
is but proof that they spring from some wide and deep injustice.</p>
<p>What that injustice is may be seen by whoever will really look. We
have only to ask to find.</p>
<p>What do we mean when we say that it is scarcity of employment from
which the masses are suffering? Not what we mean when we say of the
idle rich that they suffer from want of employment. There is no
scarcity of the need for work when so many are suffering for the want
of things that work produces, when all of us would like more, and all
but a very few of us could advantageously use more, of those things.
Nor do we mean that there is scarcity of ability to work or
willingness to work. Nor yet do we mean that there is scarcity of the
natural materials and forces necessary for work. 'They are as
abundant as they ever were or ever will be until the energy radiated
by the sun upon our globe loses its intensity. What we really mean by
"scarcity of employment " is such scarcity as would be brought about
were an ice sheet continued into the summer to shut out the farmer
from the fertile field he was anxious to cultivate; such a scarcity
as was brought about in Lancashire when our blockade of the Southern
ports raised suddenly and enormously the price of the staple that
English operatives were anxious to turn into cloth.</p>
<p>What answers to the ice sheet or the blockade? Need we ask? May it
not be seen, from our greatest cities to our newest territories, in
the speculation which has everywhere been driving up the price of
land &#8212; that is to say, the toll that the active factor in all
production must pay for permission to use the indispensable passive
factor. Across the street from the City Hall of Chicago, where 1,400
men, "the great majority Americans by birth and almost all of them
voters," have been this winter sleeping in the stone corridors,
stands the Chamber of Commerce Building, thirteen stories high. This
great building cost $800,000. The lot which it covers is worth over
$1,000,000! A few blocks from where the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">New York World</span> is today
distributing free bread, land has been sold since the bread
distribution began at the rate of over $12,000,000 an acre! As for
the remotest outskirts, who has not heard of the mad rush for the
Cherokee Strip? </p>
<p>If there are any who do not see the relation of these facts, it is
because they have become accustomed to think of labor as deriving
employment from capital, instead of, which is the true and natural
relation, capital being the product and tool of labor. The very term
"scarcity of employment," and its opposite, "scarcity of labor," come
to us from a state of society in which the idea of labor employing
itself directly on land had been forgotten. The primary suggestion of
"scarcity of employment " is that the supply of labor for hire is in
excess of the demand for its purchase. But the intervention of an
employer by no means alters the relation between labor and land. As
the price that labor must pay for land increases, the more difficult
it becomes for laborers to employ themselves, and the less of the
products of their labor can they retain; hence the larger the
proportion of laborers forced to seek the wages of an employer, and
the lower the wages to which their competition with each other drives
them. While, on the other hand, the demand for labor by employers &#8212;
those at least who hire labor in order to sell its products, &#8212; is
determined in largest part by the demands of those who draw their
purchasing power from what they get by their labor, since they are
and always must be the great majority of any people. Thus the same
increase in the price that labor must pay for laud, which increases
the supply of labor offered for hire, and decreases the wages it can
ask, lessens also the demand of employers for such labor and the
wages they can pay. So that, whether we begin at the right or the
wrong end, any analysis brings us at last to the conclusion that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">the
opportunities of finding employment and the rate of all wages depend
ultimately upon the freedom of access to land; the price that labor
must pay for its use.</span></p>
<p>"Scarcity of employment" is a comparatively new complaint in the
United States. In our earlier times it was never heard of or thought
of. There was "scarcity of employment " in Europe, but on this side
of the Atlantic the trouble &#8212; so it was deemed by a certain class &#8212;
was "scarcity of labor." It was because of this "scarcity of labor "
that negroes were imported from Africa and indentured apprentices
from the Old Country, that men who could not pay their passage sold
their labor for a term of years to get here, and that that great
stream of immigration from the Old World that has done so much to
settle this continent set in. Now, why was there "scarcity of
employment" on one side of the Atlantic and "scarcity of labor" on
the other? What was the cause of this difference, of which all other
social and political differences were but consequences? Adam Smith
saw it, and in his "Wealth of Nations" states it, but it did not need
an Adam Smith for that, as everyone who knew anything of the two
countries knew it. It was, that in this country land was cheap and
easy to get, while in Europe land was dear and hard to get. Land has
been steadily growing dear in the United States, and as a consequence
we hear no longer of "scarcity of labor." We hear now of "scarcity of
employment."</p>
<p>In the first quarter of this century an educated and thoughtful
Englishman, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, visited this country. He saw its
great resources, and noted the differences between the
English-speaking society growing up here and that to which he had
been used. Viewing everything from the standpoint of a class
accustomed to look on the rest of mankind as created for their
benefit, 'what he deemed the great social and economic disadvantage
of the United States was "the scarcity of labor." It was to this he
traced the rudeness of even what he styled the upper class, its want
of those refinements, enjoyments, and delicacies of life common to
the aristocracy of England. How could an English gentleman emigrate
to a country where labor was so dear that he might actually have to
black his own boots; so dear that even the capitalist might have to
work, and no one could count on a constant supply ready to accept as
a boon any opportunity to perform the most menial, degrading, and
repulsive services? Mr. Wakefield was not a man to note facts without
seeking their connection. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He
saw that this "scarcity of labor" came
from the cheapness of land where the vast area of the public domain
was open for settlement at nominal prices.</span> A man of his class
and
time, without the slightest question that land was made to be owned
by landlords, and laborers were made to furnish a supply of labor for
the upper classes, he was yet a man of imagination. He saw the future
before the English-speaking race in building up new nations in what
were yet the waste spaces of the earth. But he wished those new
nations to be socially, politically, and economically newer Englands;
not to be settled as the United States had been, from the "lower
classes" alone, but to contain from the first a proper proportion of
the "upper classes" as well. He saw that "scarcity of employment"
would in time succeed "scarcity of labor" even in countries like the
United States by the growth of speculation in land; but he did not
want to wait for that in the newer Britains which his imagination
pictured. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He proposed at
once to produce such salutary "scarcity of
employment " in new colonies as would give cheap and abundant labor,
by a governmental refusal to sell public land, save at a price so
high as to prevent the poorer from getting land, thus compelling them
to offer their labor for hire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This
was the essential part of what was once well known as the
Wakefield plan of colonization.</span> It is founded on a correct
theory. In
any country, however new and vast, it would be possible to change
"scarcity of labor" into "scarcity of employment" by increasing the
price put on the use of land. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If
three families settled a virgin
continent, one family could command the services of the others as
laborers for hire just as fully as though they were its chattel
slaves, if it was accorded the ownership of the land and could put
its own price on its use.</span> Wakefield proposed only that land
should be
held at what he called "a sufficient price" &#8212; that is, a price high
enough to keep wages in new colonies only a little higher than wages
in the mother-country, and to produce not actual inability to get
employment on the part of laborers, but only such difficulty as would
keep them tractable, and ready to accept what from his standpoint
were reasonable wages. Yet it is evident that it would only require a
somewhat greater increase in the price of land to go beyond this
point and to bring about in the midst of abundant natural
opportunities for the employment of labor, the phenomena of laborers
vainly seeking employment. Now, in the United States we have not
attempted to create "scarcity of employment" by Wakefield's plan. But
we have made haste by sale and gift to put the public domain in the
hands of private owners, and thus allowed speculation to bring about
more quickly and effectually than he could have anticipated, more
than Wakefield aimed at. The public domain is now practically gone;
land is rising to European prices, and we are at last face to face
with social difficulties which in the youth of men of my time we were
wont to associate with "the effete monarchies of the Old World."<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Today, as the last census reports show, the majority of American
farmers are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the first
form of tenancy; and the great majority of our people are landless
men, without right to employ their own labor and without stake in the
land they still foolishly speak of as their country. This is the
reason why the army of the unemployed has appeared among us, why by
pauperism has already become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in
more dangerous type the proletarian of ancient Rome.</span></p>
<p>These recurring spasms of business stagnation; these long-drawn
periods of industrial depression, common to the civilized world, do
not come from our treatment of money; are not caused and are not to
be cured by changes of tariffs. Protection is a robbery of labor, and
what is called free trade would give some temporary relief, but
speculation in land would only set in the stronger, and at last labor
and capital would again resist, by partial cessation, the blackmail
demanded for their employment in production, and the same round would
be run again. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">There is but
one remedy, and that is what is now known
as the single-tax &#8212; the abolition of all taxes upon labor and
capital, and of all taxes upon their processes and products, and the
taking of economic rent, the unearned increment which now goes to the
mere appropriator, for the payment of public expenses. Charity can
merely demoralize and pauperize,</span> while that indirect form of
charity,
the attempt to artificially "make work" by increasing public expenses
and by charity woodyards and sewing-rooms, is still more dangerous.
If, in this sense, work is to be made, it can be made more quickly by
dynamite and kerosene.</p>
<p>But there is no need for charity; no need for "making work." All
that is needed is to remove the restrictions that prevent the natural
demand for the products of work from availing itself of the natural
supply. Remove them today, and every unemployed man in the country
could find for himself employment tomorrow, and his "effective
demand" for the things he desires would infuse new life into every
subdivision of business and industry, even that of the dentist, the
preacher, the magazine writer, or the actor.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The country is suffering from
"scarcity of employment." But let
anyone today attempt to employ his own labor or that of others,
whether in making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, or
in erecting a factory, and he will at once meet the speculator to
demand of him an unnatural price for the land he must use, and the
tax-gatherer to fine him for his act in employing labor as if he had
committed a crime. </span>The common-sense way to cure "scarcity of
employment" is to take taxes off the products and processes of
employment and to impose in their stead the tax that would end
speculation in land.</p>
<p>But, it will be said, this is not quick enough. On the contrary,
it is quicker than anything else. Even the public recognition of its
need, by but a part of the intelligence and influence that is now
devoted to charity appeals and schemes, would have such an effect
upon the speculative price of land as to at once set labor and
capital to work.</p>
<p>This is not "mere theory." It is theory to which all experience
testifies. New Zealand is today the one country which enjoys
anything like prosperity in the midst of a universal depression.
While population is leaving New South Wales and Victoria, and, in the
search for cheap land, people are even emigrating to Paraguay, more
than six thousand families have settled in New Zealand since the
passage of the Ballance Act, a partial application of the single-tax
principle.</p>
