<b>Causes of Business Depression<br>
</b>&nbsp;<br>
By Henry George
<br>
A Contribution to <b><i>Once a Week</i></b>, New York, March
1894</center>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">The cause is clear. Idle acres mean idle
hands, and idle hands mean a lessening of purchasing power on the part
of the great body of consumers that must bring depression to all
business.</p>
<p> I am asked by <span style="font-style: italic;">Once a Week</span>
to state what, in my opinion, are the
causes of the existing business depression [1894]. It should
be possible to do more. For the method that has fixed with certainty
the causes of natural phenomena once left to varying opinion or wild
fancy ought to enable us to bring into the region of ascertained fact
the causes of social phenomena so clearly marked and so entirely
within observation. </p>
<p> To ascertain the cause of failure or abnormal action in that
complex machine, the human body, the first effort of the surgeon is
to locate the difficulty. So the first step toward determining the
causes of business depression is to see what business depression
really is. By business depression we mean a lessening in rapidity
and volume of the exchanges by which, in our highly specialized
industrial system, commodities pass into the hands of consumers. This
lessening of exchanges, which from the side of the merchant or
manufacturer we call business depression, is evidently not due to any
scarcity of the things that merchants or manufacturers have to
exchange. From that point of view there seems, indeed, a plethora of
such things. Nor is it due to any lessening in the desire of
consumers for them. On the contrary, seasons of business depression
are seasons of bitter want on the part of large num<big><big><small><small>bers,
of want so
intense</small></small> </big></big>and general that charity is called
on to prevent actual
starvation from need of things that manufacturers and merchants have
to sell. </p>
<p> It may seem, on first view, as if this lessening of exchanges
came from some impediment in the machinery of exchange. Since tariffs
have for their object the checking of certain exchanges, there is a
superficial plausibility in looking to them for the cause. While, as
money is the common measure of value and a common medium of exchange,
in terms of which most exchanges are made, it is, perhaps, even more
plausible to look to monetary regulations. But however important any
tariff question or any money question may be, neither has sufficient
importance to account for the phenomena. Protection carried to its
furthest could only shut us off from the advantage of exchanging what
we produce for what other countries produce. Free trade carried to
its furthest could only give us with the rest of the world that
freedom of exchange that we already enjoy between our several States;
while money, important as may be its office as a measure and flux of
exchanges, is still but a mere counter. Seasons of business
depression come and go without change in tariffs and monetary
regulations, and exist in different countries under widely varying
tariffs and monetary systems. The real cause must lie deeper. </p>
<p> That it does lie deeper is directly evident. The lessening of the
exchanges by which commodities pass into the hands of consumers is
clearly due not so much to increased difficulty in transferring these
commodities as to decreased ability to pay for them. Every business
man sees that business depression comes from lack of purchasing power
on the part of would-be consumers, or, as our colloquial phrase is,
from their lack of money. But money is only an intermediary
performing in exchanges the same office that poker chips do in a
game. In the last analysis it is a labor certificate. The great mass
of consumers obtain money by exchanging their labor or the proceeds
of their labor for money, and with it purchasing commodities. Thus
what they really pay for commodities with is labor. It is not merely
true in the sense he meant it, that, as Adam Smith says, "Labor
was the first price, the original purchase money that was paid for
all things." It is the final price that is paid for all things.</p>
<p> The lessening of "effective demand," which is the
proximate cause of business depression, means, therefore, a lessening
of the ability to convert labor into exchangeable forms means what
we call scarcity of employment. These two phrases are, in fact, but
different names for different aspects of one thing. What from the
side of the business man is "business depression," is, from
the side of the workman, "scarcity of employment." The one
always comes with the other and passes away with the other. They act
on each other and again react, as when the merchant or manufacturer
discharges his employees on account of business depression, and thus
adds to scarcity of employment. But in the primary causal relation
scarcity of employment comes first. That is to say, scarcity of
employment do not come from business depression, as is sometimes
assumes but business depression comes from the scarcity of
employment. For it is the effective demand for consumption that
determines the extent and direction in which labor will be expended
in producing commodities not the supply of commodities that
determines the demand. </p>
<p> What is employment? It is the expenditure of exertion in the
production of commodities or satisfactions. It is what, in a phrase
having clearer connotations, we term work. For the term employment
is, for economic use, somewhat confused by our habitual distraction
between employers and employees. This distinction only arises from
the division of labor, and disappears when we consider first
principles. I employ a man to black my boots. He expends his labor
to give me the satisfaction of polished boots. What is the five cents
I give him in return? It is a counter or chip through which he may
obtain at will the expenditure of labor to that equivalent in any of
various forms &#8212; food, shelter, newspaper, a street-car ride, and
so on. In final analysis the transaction is the same as if I had
employed him to black my boots and he had employed me to render to
him some of these other services; or as if I had blacked my own boots
and he had performed these other services for himself. Even in a
narrow view there are only three ways by which men may live &#8212; by
work, by beggary, and by theft; for the man who obtains work without
giving work is, economically, only a beggar or a thief. But on a
larger view these three come down to one, for beggars and thieves can
only live on workers. It is human labor that supplies all the wants
of human life as truly now, in all the complexities of modern
civilization, as in the beginning: when the first man and first woman
were the only human beings on the globe. </p>
<p> Now employment or work is the expenditure of labor in the
production of commodities or satisfactions. But on what? Manifestly
on land, for land is to man the whole physical universe. Take any
country as a whole, or the world as a whole. On what and from what
does its whole population live? Despite our millions and our complex
civilization, our extensions of exchanges and our inventions of
machines, are we not all living as the first man did and the last man
must, by the application of labor to land? Try a mental experiment:
Picture, in imagination, the farmer at the plow, the miner in the ore
vein, the railroad train on its rushing way, the steamer crossing the
ocean, the great factory with its whirring wheels and thousand
operatives, builders erecting a house, linemen stringing a telegraph
wire, a salesman selling goods, a bookkeeper casting up accounts, a
bootblack polishing the boots of a customer. Make any such picture in
imagination and then by mental exclusion withdraw from it, item by
item, all that belongs to land. What will be left? </p>
<p> Land is the source of all employment, the natural element
indispensable to all work. Land and labor &#8212; these are the two
primary factors that, by their union, produce all wealth and bring
about all material satisfactions. Given labor &#8212; that is to say,
the ability to work and the willingness to work and there never has
and never can be any scarcity of employment so long as labor can
obtain access to land. Were Adam and Eve bothered by "scarcity
of employment?" Did the first settlers in this country or the
men who afterwards settled those parts of the country where land was
still easily had know anything of it? That the monopoly of
land &#8212; the exclusion of labor from land by the high price
demanded for it &#8212; is the cause of scarcity of employment and
business depressions is as clear as the sun at noonday. Wherever you
may be that scarcity of employment is felt &#8212; whether in city or
village, or mining district or agricultural section &#8212; how far will
you have to go to find land that labor is anxious to use (for land
has no value until labor will pay a price for the privilege of using
it), but from which labor is debarred by the high prices demanded by
some non-user? In the very heart of New York City, two minutes' walk
from Union Square will bring you to three vacant lots. For permission
to use the smallest and least valuable of these a rental of $40,000 a
year has been offered and refused. This is but an example of what may
everywhere be seen, from the heart of the metropolis to the Cherokee
Strip. Where labor is shut out from land it wastes. Desire may
remain, but "effective demand" is gone. Is there any
mystery in the cause of business depression? Let the whole earth be
treated as these lots are treated and who of its teeming millions
could find employment? </p>
<p> At the close of the last great depression [1879], I made
"An Examination of the Cause of Industrial Depression" in a
book better known by its main title, "<a
 href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>"
to which I would refer the reader who would see the genesis and
course of business depressions fully explained. But their cause is
clear. Idle acres mean idle hands, and idle hands mean a lessening of
purchasing power on the part of the great body of consumers that must
bring depression to all business. Every great period of land
speculation that has taken place in our history has been followed by
a period of business depression, and it always must be so.
Socialists, Populists and charity mongers &#8212; the people who would
apply little remedies for a great evil are all "barking up
the wrong tree." The <a href="../glossary.html">upas</a> of our
civilization is our treatment
of land. It is that which is converting even the march of invention
into a blight. </p>
<p> Charity and the giving of "charity work" may do a
little to alleviate suffering, but they cannot cure business
depression. For they merely transfer existing purchasing power. They
do not increase the sum of "effective demand." There is but
one cure for recurring business depression. There is no other. That
is the Single Tax &#8212; the abolition of all taxes on the employment
and products of labor and the taking of economic or ground rent for
the use of the community by taxes levied on the value of land,
irrespective of improvement. For that would make land speculation
unprofitable, land monopoly impossible, and so open to the possessors
of the power to labor the ability of converting it by exertion into
wealth or purchasing power that the very idea of a man able to work
and yet suffering from want of the things that work produces
would seem as preposterous on earth as it must seem in heaven.</p>
