<center><b>The Single Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</b>
<p>by Henry George</p>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><big><font size="-2"><big>&nbsp;[The
article below by Henry George was
originally published in "The Christian Advocate" in 1890 and
thereafter reprinted in various magazines in the United States and
England.]</big></font></big></p>
<p>I shall briefly state the fundamental principles of what we
who advocate it call the Single Tax.</p>
<p>We propose to abolish all taxes save one single tax levied on the
value of land, irrespective of the value of the improvements in or on
it.</p>
<p>What we propose is not a tax on real estate, for real estate
includes improvements. Nor is it a tax on land, for we would not tax
all land, but only land having a value irrespective of its
improvements, and would tax that in proportion to that value.</p>
<p>Our plan involves the imposition of no new tax, since we already
tax land values in taxing real estate. To carry it out we have only
to abolish all taxes save the tax on real estate, and abolish all of
that which now falls on buildings or improvements, leaving only that
part of it which now falls on the value of the bare land, increasing
that so as to take as nearly as may be the whole of
<font color="#ff3300"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">economic rent</span>,</font>
or what is sometimes
styled the "unearned increment of land values."</p>
<p>That the value of the land alone would suffice to provide all
needed public revenues--municipal, county, State, and national--there
is no doubt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To show briefly why we urge this change, let me treat (1) of
<b><i>its expediency, </i></b>and (2) of <b><i>its
justice.</i></b></p>
<p>From the Single Tax we may expect these
<small><font size="+1"><small><b>advantages</b></small></font>:</small></p>
<blockquote>1. It would dispense with a whole army of tax gatherers and
other officials which present taxes require, and place in the treasury
a much larger portion of what is taken from people, while by making
government simpler and cheaper, it would tend to make it purer. It
would get rid of taxes which necessarily promote fraud, perjury,
bribery, and corruption, which lead men into temptation, and which tax
what the nation can least afford to spare -- honesty and conscience.
Since land lies out-of-doors and cannot be removed, and its value is
the most readily ascertained of all values, the tax to which we would
resort can be collected with the minimum of cost and the least strain
on public morals.
  <p>2. It would enormously increase the production of wealth--</p>
  <blockquote>(a) By the removal of the burdens that now weigh upon
industry and thrift. If we tax houses, there will be fewer and poorer
houses; if we tax machinery, there will be less machinery; if we tax
trade, there will be less trade; if we tax capital, there will be less
capital; if we tax savings, there will be less savings. All the taxes
therefore that we would abolish are those that repress industry and
lessen wealth. But <b>if we tax land values, there will be no less
land.</b>
    <p>(b) On the contrary, <b>the taxation of land values has the
effect of making land more easily available by industry,</b> since it
makes it more difficult for owners of valuable land which they
themselves do not care to use to hold it idle for a large future price.
While the abolition of taxes on labor and the products of labor would
free the active element of production, the taking of land values by
taxation would free the passive element by destroying speculative land
values and preventing the holding out of use of land needed for use. If
any one will but look around today and see the unused or but half-used
land, the idle labor, the unemployed or poorly employed capital, he
will get some idea of how enormous would be the production of wealth
were all the forces of production free to engage.</p>
    <p>(c) <b>The taxation of the processes and products of labor on
one hand, and the insufficient taxation of land values on the other,
produce an unjust distribution of wealth</b> which is building up in
the hands of a few, fortunes more monstrous than the world has ever
before seen, while the masses of our people are steadily becoming
relatively poorer. These taxes necessarily fall on the poor more
heavily than on the rich; by increasing prices, they necessitate a
larger capital in all businesses, and consequently give an advantage to
large capitals; and they give, and in some cases are designed to give,
special advantage and monopolies to combinations and trusts. On the
other hand, the insufficient taxation of land values enables men to
make large fortunes by land speculation and the increase of ground
values --fortunes which do not represent any addition by them to the
general wealth of the community, but merely the appropriation by some
of what the labor of others creates.</p>
    <p><b>This unjust distribution of wealth develops on the one hand a
class idle and wasteful because they are too rich, and on the other
hand a class idle and wasteful because they are too poor</b>. It
deprives men of capital and opportunities which would make them more
efficient producers. It thus greatly diminishes production.</p>
    <p>(d) <b>The unjust distribution which is giving us the
hundred-fold millionaire on the one side and the tramp and pauper on
the other, generates thieves, gamblers, and social parasites of all
kinds,</b> and requires large expenditure of money and energy in
watchmen, policemen, courts, prisons, and other means of defense and
repression. It kindles a greed of gain and a worship of wealth, and
produces a bitter struggle for existence which fosters drunkenness,
increases insanity, and causes men whose energies ought to be devoted
to honest production to spend their time and strength in cheating and
grabbing from each other. Besides the moral loss, all this involves an
enormous economic loss which the Single Tax would save.</p>
    <p>(e)<b> The taxes we would abolish fall most heavily on the
poorer agricultural districts, and tend to drive population and wealth
from them to the great cities</b>. The tax we would increase would
destroy that monopoly of land which is the great cause of that
distribution of population which is crowding the people too closely
together in some places and scattering them too far apart in other
places. Families live on top of one another in cities because of the
enormous speculative prices at which vacant lots are held. In the
country they are scattered too far apart for social intercourse and
convenience, because, instead of each taking what land he can use,
every one who can grabs all he can get, in the hope of profiting by its
increase in value, and the next man must pass farther on. Thus we have
scores of families living under a single roof, and other families
living in dugouts on the prairies afar from neighbors--some living too
close to each other for moral, mental, or physical health, and others
too far separated for the stimulating and refining influences of
society. The wastes in health, in mental vigor, and in unnecessary
transportation result in great economic losses which the Single Tax
would save.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us turn to the moral side and consider the question of
<small><small><b>justice</b></small>.</small></p>
<p>The right of property does not rest upon human laws; they have
often ignored and violated it. It rests on natural laws -- that is to
say, the law of God. It is clear and absolute, and every violation of
it, whether committed by a man or a nation, is a violation of the
command, "<font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#ff6600">Thou shalt
not steal.</font>"</p>
<p><b>The man who catches a fish, grows an apple, raises a calf,
builds a house, makes a coat, paints a picture, constructs a machine,
has, as to any such thing, an exclusive right of ownership which
carries with it the right to give, to sell or bequeath that
thing</b>.</p>
<p><b>But who made the earth that any man can claim such ownership of
it, or any part of it, or the right to give, sell or bequeath it?</b>
Since the earth was not made by us, but is only a temporary dwelling
place on which one generation of men follow another; since we find
ourselves here, are manifestly here with equal permission of the
Creator, it is manifest that no one can have any exclusive right of
ownership in land, and that the rights of all men to land must be
equal and inalienable. There must be exclusive right of possession of
land, for the man who uses it must have secure possession of land in
order to reap the products of his labor. But his right of possession
must be limited by the equal right of all, and should therefore be
conditioned upon the payment to the community by the possessor of an
equivalent for any special valuable privilege thus accorded him.</p>
<p><b>When we tax houses, crops, money, furniture, capital or wealth
in any of its forms, we take from individuals what rightfully belongs
to them</b>. We violate the right of property, and in the name of the
State commit robbery. <b>But when we tax ground values, we take from
individuals what does not belong to them, but belongs to the
community,</b> and which cannot be left to individuals without
robbery of other individuals.</p>
<p>Think about what the value of land is. It has no reference to the
cost of production, as has the value of houses, horses, ships,
clothes, or other things produced by labor, for land is not produced
by man, it was created by God. The value of land does not come from
the exertion of labor on land, for the value thus produced is a value
of improvement. That value attaches to any piece of land means that
that piece of land is more desirable than the land which other
citizens may obtain, and that they are willing to pay a premium for
permission to use it. Justice therefore requires that this premium of
value shall be taken for the benefit of all in order to secure to all
their equal rights.</p>
<p><b>Consider the difference between the value of a building and the
value of land</b>. The value of a building, like the value of goods,
or of anything properly styled wealth, is produced by individual
exertion, and therefore properly belongs to the individual; but the
value of land only arises with the growth and improvement of the
community, and therefore properly belongs to the community. It is not
because of what its owners have done, but because of the presence of
the whole great population, that land in New York is worth millions
an acre. This value therefore is the proper fund for defraying the
common expenses of the whole population; and it must be taken for
public use, under penalty of generating land speculation and monopoly
which will bring about artificial scarcity where the Creator has
provided in abundance for all whom His providence has called into
existence.</p>
<p>It is thus a violation of justice to tax labor, or the things
produced by labor, and it is also a violation of justice not to tax
land values.</p>
<p>These are the fundamental reasons for which we urge the Single
Tax, believing it to be the greatest and most fundamental of all
reforms. We do not think it will change human nature. That, man can
never do; but it will bring about conditions in which human nature
can develop what is best, instead of, as now in so many cases, what
is worst. It will permit such an enormous production as we can now
hardly conceive. It will secure an equitable distribution. It will
solve the labor problem and dispel the darkening clouds which are now
gathering over the horizon of our civilization. It will make
undeserved poverty an unknown thing. It will check the
soul-destroying greed of gain. It will enable men to be at least as
honest, as true, as considerate, and as high-minded as they would
like to be. It will remove temptation to lying, false, swearing,
bribery, and law breaking. It will open to all, even the poorest, the
comforts and refinements and opportunities of an advancing
civilization. It will thus, so we reverently believe, clear the way
for the coming of that kingdom of right and justice, and consequently
of abundance and peace and happiness, for which the Master told His
disciples to pray and work. It is not that it is a promising
invention or cunning device that we look for the Single Tax to do all
this; but it is because it involves a conforming of the most
important and fundamental adjustments of society to the supreme law
of justice, because it involves the basing of the most important of
our laws on the principle that we should do to others as we would be
done by.</p>
<p>The readers of this article, I may fairly presume, believe, as I
believe, that there is a world for us beyond this. The limit of space
has prevented me from putting before them more than some hints for
thought. Let me in conclusion present two more:</p>
<blockquote>1. What would be the result in heaven itself if those who
get there first instituted private property in the surface of heaven,
and parceled it out in absolute ownership among themselves, as we
parcel out the surface of the earth?
  <p>2. Since we cannot conceive of a heaven in which the equal rights
of God's children to their Father's bounty is denied, as we now deny
them on this earth, what is the duty enjoined on Christians by the
daily prayer: "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth, as it is
in heaven?"</p>
