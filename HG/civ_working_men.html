is the eternal law &#8212; wealth comes only by work.</span><br>
</div>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is our civilization just to working men? It is
not. Try it by whatever test you will, it is glaringly, bitterly and
increasingly unjust.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does not seem so, it is because our
moral perceptions are obscured by habit.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tolerance of wrong dulls our sense of its
injustice. Men may become accustomed to theft, murder, even to slavery
&#8212; that sum of all villainies &#8212; so they see no injustice in it, yet that
which is unjust is unjust still, and whoever will go back to first
principles will see that it is unjust. Work is the producer, the
fashioner, the bringer forth; the means whereby intelligence moulds
matter to its purpose. The earth and the heavens are they not, as the
Scripture tells us, the work of God?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what kind of a world is that on which we
find ourselves? It is a world in which only the raw materials are
furnished us&#8212;a world in which human life can only be maintained and
human wants met and desires gratified by work. Beast, bird and fish
take the food they find, and are clothed they know not how. But man
must work. Created in the image of the Creator, he, in a lower way,
must create in his turn. Food, clothing, shelter &#8212; all the things that
we call wealth &#8212; are brought into being by work. Nature yields to
labor, and to labor alone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are truisms which everybody knows. The
first man knew them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the first man knew them; and if we would
see how they are ignored in the facts of today, imagine that, in the
slumber of night, that first man stood by your bedside in one of those
great cities that are the flower, crown, and type of our civilization,
and asked you to take him through it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here you would take him through wide and well
kept streets, lined with spacious mansions, replete with everything
that can enhance comfort and gratify taste, adorned with magnificent
churches. Again, you would pass into another quarter, where everything
is pinched and niggard &#8212; where families are packed together tier on
tier, sometimes a whole family in a single room, where even such
churches as you see are poor and mean, and only the grogshops are
gorgeous. Which quarter do you think Adam would understand you to mean
if you spoke of the working man's quarter?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing that wealth comes only by work, would
he not necessarily infer that the fine houses were the homes of the
working men, and the poor, squalid houses the homes of the people who
do no work? You might by ocular demonstration convince the simple old
man that the very reverse of this is true, but how would you convince
him that it is just?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the eternal law &#8212; wealth comes only by
work. Here, wherever our civilization extends, is the social fact,
those who work hardest and longest, those whom we style the working
classes, are the poorest classes. The very word working man is
synonymous with poverty. A working man's hotel is everywhere a poor
hotel; a working man's restaurant is a mean restaurant. In a working
man's store you will find only the cheaper and coarser goods. What
physician wants a working man's practice if he can get any other? What
minister a working man's church? Who wishes his son to become, or his
daughter to wed, a working man? We prate vainly of the dignity of our
labor; facts give our words the lie. Labor is everywhere condemned and
despised. Everywhere it slinks to a back seat; aye, even in the house
of God! Magnificent churches are dedicated to a carpenter, to a
fisherman, and to a tentmaker, but are they working man's carriages
which stand on Sundays before the door? Are their well-dressed
congregations composed of the class of which the carpenter, the
fisherman and the tentmaker of eighteen centuries ago belonged? Why
even in the cathedrals of that Church which most boasts that before her
priesthood, all are equal, the carpenter, the fisherman and the
tentmaker of the present day must go into the five cent place or the
ten cent place. The good places are the soft seats &#8212; they are for the
people who have got above labor.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It were idle to complain of this. The
prettiest theory must bend to the logic of facts. God intended labor to
be honorable among men. That is clear, for He made wealth the reward of
labor. But somehow or other, as we have managed to fix things in the
civilization of which we are so proud, labor has been divorced from its
natural reward, and this being the case, the signet of respectability
is gone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it may be said, in speaking of working
men, we mean, for the most part, mere handworkers. Manual labor is but
a low kind of labor. The great agent of production is mind, not muscle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted that the more intelligent work &#8212; the
work we call brainwork ought to be paid more than mere manual labor,
this does not prove it just that manual labor should get so little.
What can the brain produce without the hand? Suppose Adam, when driven
from Paradise, had set himself under a tree and resolved to make a
living with his brain, what would have become of him? Suppose that the
hand-workers of the world were to stop work today, what would become of
brainworkers? Furthermore, is not all handwork brainwork, and have not
those in the ranks of hand-workers just as much natural intelligence as
those in any other walk of life?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I make no narrow definition of the term
working man. Whoever does productive work of any kind is really a
working man. But all exertion is not work. The gambler I do not call a
working man, whether he gamble with dice, or cards, or in stocks or
produce. The thief I do not call a working man, whether he picks
pockets or wrecks railroads. The confidence operator I do not call a
working man, whether his gains be dollars or millions; and whether he
dwell in an almshouse or in a palace &#8212; whether he ride in a prison van
or in a coach and pair, I do not call the mere appropriator a working
man.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man may toil from early manhood to hoary age
to increase his gains, he may in the struggle for wealth wear out his
body, distort his mind, warp his instincts, and lose his soul, and yet
be not a working man, if his struggle be merely to take &#8212; not to make!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But him I call a working man, who, with hand
or with head, takes the part of a producer in the complex machinery of
which human wants are satisfied. Whether his work be physical, or
whether it be mental, if he would aid in providing for the needs of the
body, of the intellect, for the needs of the soul &#8212; him I call a
working man! And using the term in the widest sense, I still insist
that our civilization is unjust to working men.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not notorious that brainwork is, on the
whole, as much underpaid as handwork? Are there not many brainworkers
who, at times, are tempted to envy the hand-worker? How many authors,
how many inventors, how many newspaper writers, how many teachers, do
you know of who have got rich by work? I do know of some newspaper
writers who have got rich, but it has been by being led into "fat
things." I do know of some teachers who have made fortunes, but it has
been by successful speculation. I do know of one author who by the
sheer earnings of his pen has bought himself what most of us would call
a fine house, though it is not as good as some millionaire's stable,
but he writes detective stories for boys' papers. Even in business, do
not statistics show that something like 95 per cent of all that start
fail?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting rich by hand-work &#8212; that is utterly
out of the question; and if you have a strong vigorous brain, and want
to get rich, use it not to do productive work, but to appropriate the
work of others. That is the way to get rich.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was a boy and went to Sunday school, I
used to want to be rich. Dollars was the sum I used to dream about, for
fortunes were not so large in those days. But since I have seen more of
life, since I have seen how great wealth masters the man, I fear the
responsibilities. But poverty, in such a civilization as ours, this
does not merely mean hard work and poor fare, but weakness and
contempt; the dulling of the intellect; the cramping of the soul. The
injustice of our civilization to working men is not so much that it
deprives them of physical gratifications they ought to have, but that
it deprives them of higher things &#8212; of leisure and opportunity for
mental and moral growth.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The working class is everywhere necessarily
the least cultured class.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go into our prisons and you will find them
tenanted not from the rich, but from the poor. Inquire into the history
of the girls you may find at night prowling the streets of our great
cities, in nine cases out of ten it was poverty that sent them there.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I listened last night with deep interest to
the discussion of education.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree with all that was said as to the
superiority of the moral to the intellectual. To merely develop the
intellectual faculties without commensurate development of the moral
sense seems to me but to make the man a monster.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what is the education of the school as
compared with the education outside the school? How little will it
avail if you teach the child in school that honesty is the best policy,
when from the time he can think, the lesson that he everywhere learns
is if you would escape pain and gain pleasure, if you would win respect
and consideration, get MONEY. Get it honestly if you can, but at any
rate get money. You ministers may preach every Sunday, of hell and of
heaven, but the hell that the mass of your congregation most fear is
the hell of poverty. The heaven which most attracts them is the heaven
of wealth; nor is it strange that it should be so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the necessary result of that fierce
struggle for existence, which rages wherever our civilization extends,
and becomes fiercer and fiercer as it progresses. But the fierce
struggle is not natural; our moral perceptions tells us that. The very
construction of man, with his capacity for thought and capacity for
feeling, show us that he was intended for better things than to spend
nine-tenths of his powers to get an animal existence, as most men have
to do.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And when we look into the social laws, which
are as truly the laws of the Creator as are the physical or moral laws,
we can see that civilization, instead of enriching one class and
impoverishing another, ought to make it easier for all to live. My time
is too short for argument, but let me try, as well as I can, to show
this in a word.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, let us say, is a primitive community &#8212;
one part engaged in fishing, one part in agriculture, one in mechanical
operations. Now, if in one of these occupations, either by the increase
in productiveness of nature or by invention or discovery, which
increases the productiveness of labor, the power of obtaining wealth is
increased, the benefit will not be confined to those engaged in that
particular occupation, but by virtue of what is known to economists as
the law of values, must be shared by all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This principle that increased efficiency in
one department of labor virtually increases the productiveness of all
labor &#8212; the principle that the growth in wealth of one people is a
benefit to all other peoples with whom they exchange &#8212; runs through all
the social laws, and by virtue of the principle, every invention and
every improvement ought to make it easier for those in every department
of industry to get a living. By virtue of this principle, the rudest
manual laborer ought now to live in affluence as compared with his
predecessor in a rude state of society.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the fact? The fact is that in the very
heart of our civilization there are great masses with whose lot the
veriest savage could not afford to exchange &#8212; masses, who not only can
get a bare living by the hardest toil, but who often cannot get a
living at all, and would starve but for charity. In the primitive
condition, of which we have a record in the Bible, we hear nothing of
pauperism; nothing of women compelled to unwomanly toil; nothing of
little children forced to monotonous employment; nothing of hungry want
in the midst of overflowing plenty -- things so common today. Six
centuries ago before any of the great modern inventions had been made,
before even our most prolific vegetables and fruits had been
introduced, when all the arts were rude beyond comparison with the
present state, pauperism was unknown in England; eight hours was the
ordinary day's work, and the rudest manual labor, as such investigators
as Prof. Thorold Rogers tells us, lived in a rude plenty, which is
affluence itself, as compared with what they get now, and even in times
of actual scarcity were unvexed by the fear of want. Is our
civilization just to working men, when that is the fruit of all this
advance?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not civilization unjust to working men when want
so exists in the midst of plenty? Read the papers to day. Everywhere
you will read of reduction of wages, or of strikes against reduction of
wages. What is the reason? Overproduction, they say. That is to say,
there is such a plethora of food &#8212; such a glut of goods &#8212; that the
working man must stint his family.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Esquimaux of the North to the Terra
del Fuegan of the South there is not a savage tribe that can comprehend
the chronic poverty that exists in the heart of our civilization.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it any wonder that that which most
astonished Sitting Bull on his recent visit to the East was the
children that he saw at work &#8212; children, who, as he said, ought to be
at play. Ought it not astonish us? Discovery and invention have
multiplied a hundredfold, yea, a thousandfold, the power of human labor
to supply human needs; yet when machinery is in its latest development
you will find young girls and little children straining brain and
muscle in monotonous work for ten and twelve hours a day. We do not
offer our children up to idols; we do not sacrifice our virgins to
propitiate the dark powers &#8212; we are Christians; but we do give them to
disease and death in mill and mine and factory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the bitter fruits of injustice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is that injustice? Many minor injustices
there may be, but the first, the widespread, the great injustice &#8212; an
injustice sufficient to account for all these effects &#8212; is so glaring
that all who will look may see it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the first chapter of Genesis, consider
the relation between man and the planet which he inhabits, and you can
have no doubt what it is.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the injustice, which robs man of his
birthright. It is that we have made private property of what the
Creator intended for the common heritage of all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me quote the words of a Christian bishop,
<a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Thomas Nulty</a>, Bishop of Meath, "The land in every country is the common
property of the people of that country, because its real owner, the
Creator, who made it, has bestowed it as a voluntary gift upon them.
The earth has He given to the children of men." Now, as every human
being is a child of God, and, as all His children are equal in His
eyes, any settlement of the land of this or any, other country, that
would exclude the humblest of God's children from an equal share in the
common heritage, is not merely a wrong and an injustice to that man,
but is an impious violation of the benevolent intention of the Creator.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not that truth &#8212; is not that truth with
which religion has to do? Think of it.<br>
