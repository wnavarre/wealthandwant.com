<blockquote>
  <blockquote> I said to myself, there must be some <em>reason</em> for this;
there must be some <em>remedy</em> for this, and I will not rest until I have
found the one and discovered the other. At last it came clear as the
stars of a bright midnight. I saw what was the cause; I saw what was
the cure. I saw nothing that was new.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As I rise on this stage the past comes back to me. Twelve years
ago, when I was halt of speech, when to face an audience, it seemed
to me, required as much courage as it would to face a battery, I
stood on this platform to speak my first word in the cause for which
I stand here now. I stood on this platform to see, instead of the
audience that greets me tonight, a beggarly array of empty benches.
Many times since, in this country and in the dear old world, I have
stood before far greater audiences than this; I have been greeted by
thousands who never saw me before, as they would greet a friend long
known and well loved; but I don't think it ever gave me such pleasure
to stand before an audience as it does here tonight. </p>
<p> For years and years I have been promising myself to come back to
San Francisco. I have crossed the Atlantic five times before I could
fulfil that desire. I am here now, to go in a few days to the
Antipodes; perhaps I may never return &#8212; who knows? If I live, I
shall try to. But to San Francisco &#8212; though I never again can be a
citizen of California though my path in life seems away so far that
California seems but a ridge on the horizon &#8212; my heart has always
turned, and always will turn, to the home of my youth, to the city in
which I grew up, to the city in which I have found so many warm
friends &#8212; to the country in which I married, and in which my
children were born. Always it will seem to me home; and it is sweet
to the man long absent to be welcomed home. </p>
<p> Aye, and you men, old friends tried and true &#8212; you men who
rallied in the early times to our movement, when we could count each
other almost upon one's fingers &#8212; I come back to you to say that
at last our triumph is but a matter of time; to say that never in the
history of thought has a movement come forward so fast and so well.
Ten years ago, when I left, I was anything. but hopeful. Ten years
ago I would not have dared to say that in any time to which I might
live, we should see the beginning of this great struggle. Nor have I
cared. My part (and I think I can speak for every man who is enlisted
in this movement) &#8212; my part has never been to predict results. Our
feeling is the feeling of the great stoic emperor, "that is the
business of Jupiter; not ours." Ours to do the work as we may;
ours to plant the seed. But so well forward is this cause, so many
strong advocates has it in every land, so far has it won its way,
that now it makes no difference who lives or who dies, who goes
forward or who hangs back. The currents of the time are setting in
our favour. At last &#8212; at last we can say with certainty that it
will only be a little while before all over the English-speaking
world, and then, not long after, over the rest of the civilised
world, the great truth will be acknowledged that no human child comes
into this world without coming into his equal right with all. </p>
<p> I am talking tonight to my friends; I am talking tonight to those
who are as earnest and well informed in this cause as I am; but I am
also probably talking to many who have but vague ideas concerning it.
Let me, since I am in San Francisco, speak of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The genesis of my own
thought</span>. I came out here at an early age, and knew nothing
whatever
of political economy. I had never thought upon any social problem.
The first time I ever recollect talking on such a subject was one
day, when I was about eighteen, after I had first come to this
country, sitting on the deck of a topsail schooner with a lot of
miners on the way to the Frazer River. We got talking about the
Chinese, and I ventured to say &#8212; ventured to ask what harm the
Chinese were doing here, if, as these miners said, they were only
working the cheap diggings? One old miner turned to me and said:
"No harm now; but it will not be always that wages are as high
as they are today in California. As the country grows, as people come
in, wages will go down, and some day or other white men will be glad
to get these diggings that the Chinamen are now working." I well
remember how it impressed me, the idea that as the country grew in
all that we are hoping that it might grow, the condition of those who
had to work for their living must grow, not better, but worse. </p>
<p> And I remember, after having come down from the country, sitting
on Christmas eve in the gallery of the old American Theatre, among
the gods, when a new drop-curtain fell, and we all sprang to our
feet, for on that curtain was painted what was then a dream of the
far future, the overland train coming into San Francisco; and after
we had shouted ourselves hoarse, I began to think what good is it
going to be to men like me? those who have nothing but their labour?
I saw that thought grow and grow; we were all &#8212; all of us, rich
and poor &#8212; hoping for the development of California, proud of her
future greatness, looking forward to the time when San Francisco was
to be one of the great capitals of the world; looking forward to the
time when this great empire of the West was to count her population
by millions, and underneath it all came to me what that miner said:
What about the masses of the people? </p>
<p> When, after growing up here, I went across the continent, before
the continental railway was completed, and in the streets of New York
for the first time realised the contrasts of wealth and want that are
to be found in a great city; saw those sights that, to the man who
comes from the West, affright and appall, the problem grew upon me. I
said to myself, there must be some reason for this; there must he
some remedy for this, and I will not rest until I have found the one
and discovered the other. At last it came clear as the stars of a
bright midnight. I saw what was the cause; I saw what was the cure. I
saw nothing that was new.</p>
<p> When I lectured for the first time in Oxford, a professor of
political economy in that great university met and opposed me, and he
said: <span style="font-weight: bold;">"I have read Mr. George's book
from one end to the other.
What I have to say is this: there is nothing in it both new and true.
What is true is not new, and what is new is not true."</span> I
answered him: "I accept your statement; it is a correct
criticism. Social truth never is, never can be, new; and the truth
for which we stand is an old truth &#8212; a truth seen by men
everywhere, recognised by the first perceptions of all men, only
overclouded, only obscured in our modern times by force and
fraud." </p>
<p> So it is. I notice that one of our papers gives to me the
character of an apostle and speaks of my comrades as my disciples. It
is not so. <span style="font-weight: bold;">I have done no more to any
man than point out God's stars.
They were there for him to see.</span> Millions and millions of years
have
seen them precisely as I saw them; every man may see them who will
look. When I first went to Ireland I got a note from the most
venerable of the Irish bishops, Dr. Dougan, Bishop of Waterford,
asking me to come and have a private talk with him. I went, and the
old man &#8212; white haired, ruddy cheeked &#8212; the man who under the
mitre of the bishop still keeps the fresh true heart of the Irish
peasant commenced, with the privilege of age, catechising me. He
said: "What is this new doctrine that your name is associated
with? You say that all men have equal rights to land; but all men
can't use land. How do you propose to divide up?" And then he
went on from one question to another, bringing all the arguments, all
the objections that spring up in the minds of men, just as they
probably sprang up in the minds of many who are here just as they
spring up in the mind of any man &#8212; all the objections that are so
current; and I answered them all. Finally rising, without saying
anything, the old man stretched out his hand. "God bless you, my
son; I have asked you to come here and answer my questions, because I
wanted to see if you could defend your faith. Go on; go on. What you
say to me is nothing new; it is the old truth that through
persecution and against force, though trodden down, our people have
always held. What you say is not new to me. When a little boy,
sitting by the peat fire in the west of Ireland, I have heard the
same truths from the lips of men who could not speak a word of
English. Go on; the time has come; I, an old man, tell you that there
is no earthly power that can stop this movement." And the years
have shown that the venerable bishop was right. </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> What is the cause of this dark shadow that
seems to accompany
modern civilisation </span>&#8212; of this existence of bitter want in the
very
centres of life &#8212; of the failure of all our modern advance &#8212; of
all the wonderful discoveries and inventions that have made this
wonderful nineteenth century, now drawing to a close, so prominent
among all the centuries? What is the reason, that as we add to
productive power &#8212; that is, invention after
invention &#8212; multiplying by the hundredfold and the thousandfold
the power of human hands to supply human wants; that all over the
civilised world, and especially in this great country, pauperism is
increasing, and insanity is increasing, and criminality is
increasing; that marriages are decreasing; that the struggle for
existence seems not less, but more and more intense &#8212; what is the
reason? There must be but one of two answers. 
</span></p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: normal;">Either it is in
accordance with the will of God, either it is the result of natural
law, 
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: normal;">or it is because of our
ignorance and selfishness of our faith
that we evade the natural law.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"> We Single Taxers point to The one
sufficient cause.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Wherever
these phenomena are to be seen the natural element on
which and from which all men must live, if they are to live at all,
is the property, not of the whole people, but of the few. </span>We
point to
the adequate cure; the restoration to all men of their natural rights
in the soil &#8212; the assurance to every child, as it comes into the
world, of the enjoyment of its natural heritage &#8212; the right to
live, the right to work, the right to enjoy the fruits of its work;
rights necessarily conditioned upon the equal right to that element
which is the basis of production; that element which is indispensable
to human life; that element which is the standing place, the
storehouse, the reservoir of men; that element from which all that is
physical in man is drawn. For our bodies, themselves, they come from
the land, and to the land they return again; we, ourselves, are as
much children of the soil as are the flowers or the trees. We call
ourselves today Single Tax men. It is only recently, within a few
years, that we have adopted that title. </p>
<p> It is not a new title; over a hundred years ago there arose in
France a school of philosophers and patriots &#8212; Quesnay, Turgot,
Condorcet, Dupont &#8212; most illustrious men of their time, who
advocated, as the cure for all social ills, the imp&ocirc;t unique,
the Single Tax. We here, on this western continent, as the nineteenth
century draws to a close, have revived the same name, and we find
enormous advantages in it. </p>
<p> We used to be confronted constantly by the question: "Well,
after you have divided the land up, how do you propose to keep it
divided?" We don't meet that question now. The Single Tax has,
at least, this great merit: it suggests our method; it shows the way
we would travel &#8212; the simple way of abolishing all taxes, save one
tax upon land values. Now, mark: One tax upon land values. </p>
<p>We do not propose a tax upon land, as people who misapprehend us
constantly say. We do not propose a tax upon land; we propose a tax
upon land values, or what in the terminology of political economy is
termed rent; that is to say, the value which attaches to land
irrespective of any improvements &#8212; in or on it; that value which
attaches to land, not by reason of anything that the user or improver
of land does &#8212; not by reason of any individual exertion of labour,
but by reason of the growth and improvement of the community. A tax
that will take up what John Stuart Mill called the unearned
increment; that is to say, that increment of wealth which comes to
the owner of land, not as a user; that comes whether he be a resident
or an absentee; whether he be engaged in the active business of life;
whether he be an idiot and whether he be a child; that growth of
value that we have seen in our own times so astonishingly great in
this city; that has made sand lots, lying in the same condition that
they were thousands of years ago, worth enormous sums, without anyone
putting any exertion of labour or any expenditure of capital upon
them. </p>
<p> Now, the distinction between a tax on land and a tax on land
values may at first seem an idle one, but it is a most important one.
A tax on land that is to say, a tax upon all land &#8212; would
ultimately become a condition to the use of land; would therefore
fall upon labour, would increase prices, and be borne by the general
community. But a tax on land values cannot fall on all land, because
all land is not of value; it can only fall on valuable land, and on
valuable land in proportion to its value; therefore, it can no more
become a tax on labour than can a tax upon the value of special
privileges of any kind. It can merely take from the individual, not
the earnings of the individual, but that premium which, as society
grows and improves, attaches to the use of land of superior quality.
</p>
<p> Now see, take it in its lowest aspect &#8212; take it as a mere
fiscal change, and see how in accord with every dictate of
expediency, with every principle of justice, is the Single Tax. We
have invented and invented, improved and improved, yet the great fact
is, that today we have not wealth enough. There are in the United
States some few men richer than it is wholesome for men to be. But
the great masses of our people are not so rich as civilised Americans
at the close of the nineteenth century ought to be. The great mass of
our people only manage by hard work to live. The great mass of our
people don't get the comforts, the refinements, the luxuries that in
the present age of the world everyone ought to have. All over this
country there is a fierce struggle for existence. Only as I came to
the door of this building a beggar stopped me on the street &#8212; a
young man; he said he could not find work. I don't know, perhaps he
lied. I do know that when a man once commences upon that course there
is rapid demoralisation. I do know that indiscriminate charity is apt
to injure far more than it can help; yet I gave him something, for I
did not know but that his story might be true. </p>
<p> This is the shore of the Pacific. This is the Golden Gate. The
westward march of our race is terminated by the ocean, which has the
ancient East on its farther shore; no farther can we go. And yet
here, in this new country, in this golden State, there are men ready
to work, anxious to work, and yet who, for longer or shorter periods,
cannot get the opportunity to work. The farther east you go, the
worse it grows. To the man from San Francisco, who has never realised
it before, there are sights in New York that are appalling. Cross the
ocean to the greater city &#8212; the metropolis of the civilised
world &#8212; and there poverty is deeper and darker yet. What is the
reason? If there is more wealth wanted, why don't they get more? </p>
<p> We cannot cure this evil of poverty by dividing up wealth,
monstrous as are some of the fortunes that have arisen &#8212; and
fortunes are concentrating in this country faster than ever before in
the history of the world. But divide them and still there would not
be enough. </p>
<p>But if men want more wealth, why don't they get more wealth? If
we, as a people, want more wealth (and certainly ninety-nine out of
every hundred Americans do want more wealth), why are some suffering
from the want of employment? Others are at work without making a
living. But ninety-nine out of a hundred have some legitimate desire
that they would like to gratify. Well, in the first place, if we want
more wealth &#8212; if we call that country prosperous which is
increasing in wealth &#8212; is it not a piece of stupidity that we
should tax men for producing wealth? Yet that is what we are doing
today. </p>
<p> Bring almost any article of wealth to this country from a foreign
country, and you are confronted at once with a tax. Is it not from a
common sense standpoint a stupid thing, if we want more
wealth &#8212; if the prosperous country is the country that increases
in wealth, why in Heaven's name should we put up a barrier against
the men who want to bring wealth into this country? We want more
dry-goods (if you don't know, your wives surely will tell you). We
want more clothing; more sugar; more of all sorts of the good things
that are called "goods;" and yet by this system of taxation
we virtually put up a high fence around the country to keep out these
very things. We tax that convenient man who brings goods into the
country. </p>
<p> If wealth be a good thing; if the country be a prosperous
country &#8212; that is, increasing in wealth &#8212; well, surely, if we
propose to restrict trade at all, the wise thing would he to put the
taxes on the men who are taking goods out of the country, not upon
those who are bringing goods into the country. </p>
<p> We Single Tax men would sweep away all these barriers. We would
try to keep out small-pox and cholera and vermin and plagues. But we
would welcome all the goods that anybody wanted to send us, that
anybody wanted to bring home. We say it is stupid, if we want more
wealth, to prevent people from bringing wealth to the country. We
say, also, that it is just as stupid to tax the men who produce
wealth within the country. </p>
<p> Here we say we want more manufacturers. The American people
submit to enormous taxes for the purpose of building up factories;
yet when a man builds a factory, what do we do? Why, we come down and
tax him for it. </p>
We certainly want more houses. There are a few people who have
bigger houses than any one reasonable family can occupy; but the
great mass of the American people are underhoused. There, in the city
of New York, the plight to which all American cities are tending, you
will find that 65 % of the population are living two families or more
to the single floor. Yet let a man put a house in any part of the
United States, and down comes the tax-gatherer to demand a fine for
having put up a house. 
<p> We say that industry is a good thing, and that thrift is a good
thing; and there are some people who say that if a man be
industrious, and if a man he thrifty, he can easily accumulate
wealth. Whether that be true or not, industry is certainly a good
thing, and thrift is certainly a good thing. But what do we do if a
man be industrious? If he produces wealth enough, and by thrift
accumulates wealth at all, down comes the tax-gatherer to demand a
part of it. </p>
<p> We say that that is stupid; that we ought not by our taxes to
repress the production of wealth; that when a farmer reclaims a strip
of the desert and turns it into an orchard and a vineyard, or on the
prairie produces crops and feeds fine cattle, that, so far from being
taxed and fined for having done these things, we ought to be glad
that he has done it; that we ought to welcome all energy; that no man
can produce wealth for himself without augmenting the general stock,
without making the whole country richer. We impose some taxes for the
purpose of getting rid of things, for the purpose of having fewer of
the things that we tax. In most of our counties and States when dogs
become too numerous, there is imposed a dog tax to get rid of dogs.
Well, we impose a dog tax to get rid of dogs, and why should we
impose a house tax unless we want to get rid of houses? Why should we
impose a farm tax unless we want fewer farms? Why should we tax any
man for having exerted industry or energy in the production of
wealth? </p>
<p> Tax houses and there will certainly be fewer houses. If you go
east to the city of Brooklyn, you may see that demonstrated to the
eye. What first surprised me in the city of churches was to see long
rows of buildings, of brown-stone houses, two stories in front and
three stories behind; or three stories in front and four stories
behind; and I thought for a moment what foolish idea ever entered the
brains of those men, to have left out half an upper story in that
way? I found out by inquiring that it was all on account of tax. In
the city of Brooklyn, the assessor is only supposed to look in front,
and so by making the house in that way, you can get a three-story
building behind with only a two-story front and a two-story tax. </p>
<p> So in England, in the old houses, there you may see the result of
the window tax. The window tax is in force in France today, and in
France there are two hundred thousand houses, according to the
census, that have no window at all &#8212; in order to escape the tax.
</p>
<p> So if you tax ships there will be fewer ships. What old San
Franciscan cannot remember the day when in this harbour might be seen
the graceful forms and lofty spars of so many American ships, the
fleetest and best in the world? I well remember the day that no
American who crossed to Europe thought of crossing on any other than
an American ship. Today, if you wish to cross the Atlantic, you must
cross on a British steamer, unless you choose to cross on a German or
French steamer. On the high seas of the world the American ship is
becoming almost as rare as a Chinese junk. Why? Simply because we
have taxed our ships out of existence. There is the proof. </p>
<p> Tax buildings, and you will have fewer or poorer buildings; tax
farms, and you will have fewer farms and more wilderness; tax ships,
there will be fewer and poorer ships; and tax capital, and there will
be less capital; but you may tax land values all you please and there
will not he a square inch the less land. Tax land values all you
please up to the point of taking the full annual value &#8212; up to the
point of making mere ownership in land utterly unprofitable, so that
no one will want merely to own land &#8212; what will be the result?
Simply that land will be the easier had by the user. Simply that the
land will become valueless to the mere speculator &#8212; to the dog in
the manger, who wants merely to hold and not to use; to the
forestaller, who wants merely to reap where others have sown, to
gather to himself the products of labour, without doing labour. Tax
land values, and you leave to production its full rewards, and you
open to producers natural opportunities.</p>
Take it from any aspect you please, take it on its political side
(and surely that is a side that we ought to consider clearly and
plainly), while we boast of our democratic republicanism, democratic
republicanism is passing away. I need not say that to you men of San
Francisco &#8212; San Francisco ruled by a boss; to you men of
California, where you send to the Senate the citizen who dominates
the State as no duke could rule. Look at the corruption that is
tearing the heart out of our institutions; where does it come from?
Whence this demoralisation? Largely from our system of taxation. What
does our present system of taxation do? Why, it is a tax upon
conscience; a tax upon truth; a tax upon respect for law. It offers a
premium for lying and perjury and evasion. It fosters and stimulates
bribery and corruption. 
<p> Go over to Europe; travel around for a while among the effete
monarchies of the old world, and what you see will make you
appreciate democracy. Then come home. At length you take a pilot.
There is the low-lying land upon the horizon &#8212; the land of the
free and the home of the brave &#8212; and if you are entering the port
of New York, as most Americans do, finally you will see that great
statue, presented by a citizen of the French republic &#8212; the statue
of Liberty holding aloft a light that talks to the world. </p>
<p> Just as you get to see that statue clearly, Liberty enlightening
the world, you will be called down by a Customhouse officer to form
in line, men and women, and to call on God Almighty, maker of heaven
and earth, to bear witness that you have nothing dutiable in your
trunks or in your carpet sacks, or rolled up in your shawl straps;
and you take that oath. The United States of America compels you to.
But the United States of America don't leave you there. The very next
thing, another official steps up to demand your keys and to open your
box or package and to look through it for things dutiable, unless, as
may be, his eyes are stopped by a greenback. Well, now, everyone who
has made that visit does know that most passengers have things
dutiable; and I notice that the protectionists have them fully as
often as the free traders. I have never yet seen a consistent
protectionist. There may he protectionists who would not smuggle when
they get a chance, but I think they must be very, very few. </p>
<p> Go right through the daily stream &#8212; from the very institution
of law down to the very lobby that gathers at Washington when it is
proposed to repeal a tax, bullying, bragging, stealing to keep that
particular tax on the American people, so patriotic are they; very
much interested in protecting the poor working man. See the private
interests that are enlisted in the merely petty evasions of law that
go on by passengers; see the gigantic smuggling, the under-valuation
frauds of all kinds; the private interests that are enlisted in
class; that enter the primaries; that surround our national
legislature with lobbyists that in every presidential election put
their millions into the corruption fund. Does not the whole system
reek with fraud and corruption? Is it not a discrimination against
honesty, against conscience, a premium on evasion and fraud? </p>
<p> Come into our States and look at their taxes, or look, if you
please, by the way, on the internal revenue. You remember how, when
it was proposed to abolish that stamp tax on matches that was in
force during the war, how the match combination fought hard and
fought long against the repeal of that tax. You remember how the
whisky ring spent its money to prevent the reduction of the whisky
tax; how today it stands ready to spend money to keep up the present
tax. </p>
<p> Go then into our States; take our system of direct taxation. What
do you find? We pretend to tax all property; many of our taxes are
especially framed to get at rich men; what is the result? Why, all
over the United States the very rich men simply walk from under those
taxes. All over the United States the attempt to tax men upon their
wealth is a farce and a fraud. If there were no other reason, this
would be a sufficient reason why all such taxes should be abolished.
In their very nature they permit evasion, law breaking, perjury,
bribery, and corruption. But the tax on land values, it has at least
this advantage: land cannot be hid; it cannot be carried off; it
always remains, so to speak, out of doors. If you don't see the land
you know that it is there; and of all values the value which attaches
to land is the most definite, the most easily ascertained. Why, I may
go into San Francisco, into Denver, into New York, into Boston, into
any city where I am totally unacquainted, and if one offers to sell
me a lot, I can go to any real-estate dealer and say: "Here is a
lot of such a frontage and such a depth, and on such a street; what
is it worth?" He will tell me closely. How can he tell me the
value of the house that is upon it? Not without a close examination;
still less, how can anyone tell me, without the examination of
experts, what is the value of the things contained in that house, if
it be a large and fine house? And, still less, how can anyone tell me
the value of the various things that the man who lives in that house
may own? But land &#8212; there it is. You can put up a simple little
sign on every lot, or upon every piece of agricultural land, saying
that this tract is of such a frontage and of such a depth, having
such an area, and it belongs to such a person, and is assessed at so
much, and you have published information checking the assessment; you
have the assessment on a value that can be ascertained more
definitely, more certainly than any other value. </p>
<p> Substitute the tax on land values for all the many taxes that we
now impose. See the gain in morals; see the gain in economy! With
what a horde of tax-gathering and tax assessing officials could we
dispense; what swearing and examination and nosing around to find out
what men have or what they are worth! Now take the matter of justice.
We Single Tax men are not deniers of the rights of property; but, on
the contrary, we are the upholders and defenders of the rights of
property. We assert the sacred right of property; that there is a
right of property, which comes from no human law, which antedates all
human enactments. That is a clear genesis. That which a man produces,
that which by his exertion he brings from the reservoir of nature and
adapts to forms suited to gratify the wants of man &#8212; that is his;
his as against all the world. </p>
<p> If I, by my labour, catch a fish, that fish is and ought to be
mine; if I make a machine, that machine belongs to me; that is the
sacred right of property. There is a clear title from the producer,
resting upon the right of the individual to himself, to the use of
his own powers, to the enjoyment of the results of his exertion; the
right that he may give, that he may sell, that he may bequeath. </p>
<p> What do we do when we tax a building? When a man puts up a
building by his own exertion, or it comes to him through the transfer
of the right that others have to their exertion, down comes the
community and says, virtually, you must give us a portion of that
building. For where a man honestly earns and accumulates wealth, down
come the tax-gatherers and demand every year a portion of those
earnings. Now, is it not as much an impairment of the right of
property to take a lamb as to take a sheep? To take 5% or 20%, as to
take 100%? We should leave the whole of the value produced by
individual exertion to the individual. We should respect the rights
of property not to any limited extent, but fully. We should leave to
him who produces wealth, to him to whom the title of the producer
passed, all that wealth. No matter what be its form, it belongs to
the individual. We should take for the uses of the community the
value of land for the same reason. It belongs to the community
because the growth of the community produces it. </p>
<p> What is the reason that land in San Francisco today is worth so
much more than it was in 1860 or 1850? Why is it that barren sand,
then worth nothing, has now become so enormously valuable? On account
of what the owners have done? No. It is because of the growth of the
whole people. It is because San Francisco is a larger city; it is
because you all are here. Every child that is born; every family that
comes and settles; every man that does anything to improve the city,
adds to the value of land. It is a value that springs from the growth
of the community. Therefore, for the very same reason of justice, the
very same respect for the rights of property which induces us to
leave to the individual all that individual effort produces, we
should take for the community that value which arises by the growth
and improvement of the community. </p>
<p> What would be the direct result? Take this city, this State or
the whole country; abolish all taxes on the production of wealth; let
every man be free to plough, to sow, to build, in any way add to the
common stock without being fined one penny. Say to every man who
would improve, who would in any way add to the production of wealth:
Go ahead, go ahead; produce, accumulate all you please; add to the
common stock in any way you choose; you shall have it all; we shall
not fine or tax you one penny. What would be the result of abolishing
all these taxes that now depress industry; that now fall on labour;
that now lessen the profits of those who are adding to the general
wealth? Evidently to stimulate production; to increase wealth; to
bring new life into every vocation of industry. </p>
<p>On the other side what would be the effect when abolishing all
these taxes that now fall on labour or the products of labour, if we
were to resort for public revenue to a tax upon land values; a tax
that would fall on the owner of a vacant lot just as heavily as upon
the man who has improved a lot by putting up a house; that would fall
on the speculator who is holding 160 acres of agricultural land idle,
waiting for a tenant or a purchaser, as heavily as it would fall upon
the farmer who had made the 160 acres bloom? Why, the result would be
everywhere that the dog in the manger would he checked; for the
result everywhere would he that the men who are holding natural
opportunities, not for use but simply for profit, by demanding a
price of those who must use them, would have either to use their land
or give way to somebody who would. </p>
<p> Everywhere from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the lakes to
the gulf, opportunities would be opened to labour; there would come
into the labour market that demand for the products of labour that
never can be satisfied &#8212; the demands of labour itself. We should
cease to hear of the labour question. The notion of a man ready to
work, anxious to work, and yet not able to find work, would be
forgotten, would be a story of the misty past. </p>
<p> Why, look at it here today, in this new country, where there are
as yet only 65 millions of us scattered over a territory that in the
present stage of the arts is sufficient to support in comfort a
thousand millions; yet we are actually thinking and talking as if
there were too many people in the country. We want more wealth. Why
don't we get it? Is any factor of production short? What are the
factors of production? Labour, capital, and land; but to put them in
the order of their importance: land, labour, capital. We want more
wealth; what is the difficulty? Is it in labour; is there not enough
labour? No. From all parts of the United States we hear of what seems
like a surplus of labour. We have actually got to thinking that the
man who gives another employment is giving him a boon. Is there any
scarcity of capital? Why, so abundant is capital today that United
States bonds, bought at the current rate, will only yield a fraction
over 2% per annum. So abundant is capital that there can be no doubt
that a government loan could be floated today at 2% and little doubt
but that it would soon command a premium. So abundant is capital that
all over the country it is pressing for remunerative employment. </p>
<p> If the limitation is not in labour and not in capital, it must be
in land. But there is no scarcity of land from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, for there you will find unused or only half-used land. Aye,
even where population is densest. Have you not land enough in San
Francisco? Go to that great city of New York, where people are
crowded together so closely, the great majority of them, that
physical health and moral health are in many cases alike impossible.
Where, in spite of the fact that the rich men of the whole country
gravitate there, only four per cent of the families live in separate
houses of their own, and sixty-five per cent of the families are
crowded two or more to the single floor &#8212; crowded together layer
on layer, in many places, like sardines in a box. Yet, why are there
not more houses there? Not because there is not enough capital to
build more houses, and yet not because there is not land enough on
which to build more houses. </p>
<p> Today one half of the area of New York City is unbuilt
upon &#8212; is absolutely unused. When there is such a pressure, why
don't people go to these vacant lots and build there? Because though
unused, the land is owned; because, speculating upon the future
growth of the city, the owners of those vacant lots demand thousands
of dollars before they will permit anyone to put a house upon them.
What you see in New York, you may see everywhere. Come into the
coalfields of Pennsylvania; there you will frequently find thousands
and thousands of miners unable to work, either locked out by their
employers, or striking as a last resource against their pitiful wages
being cut down a little more. </p>
<p> Why should there be such a struggle? Why don't these men go to
work and take coal for themselves? Not because there is not coal land
enough in those mining districts. The parts that are worked are small
as compared to the whole coal deposits. The land is not all used, but
it is all owned, and before the men who would like to go to work can
get the opportunity to work the raw material, they must pay to its
owner thousands of dollars per acre for land that is only nominally
taxed. </p>
<p> Go West, find people filing along, crowding around every Indian
reservation that is about to be opened; travelling through unused and
half-used land in order to get an opportunity to settle &#8212; like men
swimming a river in order to get a drink. Come to this State, ride
through your great valleys, see those vast expanses, only dotted here
and there by a house, without a tree; those great ranches, cultivated
as they are cultivated by blanket men, who have a little work in
ploughing time, and some more work in reaping time, and who then,
after being fed almost like animals, and sheltered worse than
valuable animals are sheltered, are forced to tramp through the
State. It is the artificial scarcity of natural opportunities. Is
there any wonder that under this treatment of the land all over the
civilised world there should he want and destitution? Aye, and
suffering &#8212; degradation worse in many cases than anything known
among savages, among the great masses of the people. </p>
<p> How could it be otherwise in a world like this world, tenanted by
land animals, such as men are? How could the Creator, so long as our
laws are what they are &#8212; how could He, himself, relieve it?
Suppose that in answer to the prayers that ascend for the relief of
poverty, the Almighty were to rain down wealth from heaven, or cause
it to spout tip from the bowels of the earth. Who, under our present
system, would own it? The landowner. There would be no benefit to
labour. Consider, conceive any kind of a world your imagination will
permit. Conceive of heaven itself, which, from the very necessities
of our minds, we cannot otherwise think of than as having an
expansion of space &#8212; what would be the result in heaven itself, if
the people who should first get to heaven were to parcel it out in
big tracts among themselves? </p>
<p> Oh, the wickedness of it; oh, the blasphemy of it! Worse than
atheists are those so-called Christians who by implication, if not by
direct statement, attribute to the God they call on us to worship,
the God that they say with their lips is all love and mercy, this
bitter suffering which today exists in the very centres of our
civilisation. </p>
<p> When I was last in London, the first morning that I spent there,
I rose early and walked out, as I always like to walk when I go to
London, through streets whose names I do not know; I came to a
sign &#8212; a great big brass plate, "Office of the Missionary
Society for Central Africa." I walked half a block, and right by
the side of the Horse Guards, where you may see the pomp and glare of
the colour mounting, there went a man and a women and two little
children that seemed the very embodiment of hard and hopeless
despair. </p>
<p> A while ago I was in Edinburgh, the Modern Athens, the glorious
capital (for such it is in some parts) &#8212; the glorious capital of
Scotland; aye, and I went into those tall houses, monstrous they
seemed, those relics of the old time, and there, right in the shadow,
in the centre of such intellectual activity, such wealth, such
patriotism, such public spirit, were sights that would appall the
veriest savage. </p>
<p> I saw there the hardest thing a man can look at. They took me to
an institution where little children are taken in and cared for,
whose mothers are at work, and here I saw the bitterest of all sight
little children shrunken and sickly from want of food; and the
superintendent told me a story. He pointed out a little girl, and
said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"That little thing was brought in here,
almost starving,
and when they set food before her, before she touched it or tasted
it, she folded her hands and raised her eyes, and thanked her
Heavenly Father for his bounty." </p>
<p> Good God! Men and women &#8212; think of the blasphemy of it! To say
that the bounty of that little child's Heavenly Father was conceded
so. No! No! No! He has given enough and to spare for all His
providence brings into this world. It is the injustice that
disinherits God's children; it is the wrong that takes from those
children their heritage, not the Almighty. Aye, years ago, I said on
this platform that the seed had been set. Now the grand truth is
beginning to appear. From one end of Great Britain to the other, all
through this country, into the Antipodes to which I am going wherever
the English tongue is spoken &#8212; aye, and beyond, on the continent
of Europe &#8212; the truths for which we stand are making their way.
The giant Want is doomed. But I tell you, and I call upon my comrades
to bear me witness, that there is a reward in this belief, in this
work, which is utterly independent of results. </p>
<p> In London, on one of my visits, a clergyman of the Established
Church asked a private interview with me. He said:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">"I want to
talk with you frankly. Something I have seen of your sayings has made
me think that you could give me an answer. Let me tell you my story.
I was educated for the Church; graduated at one of the universities;
took orders; was sent to a foreign country as a missionary. After a
while I became a chaplain in the navy; finally, a few years since, I
took a curacy in London, and settled here. I have been, up till
recently, a believing Christian. I have believed the Bible to be the
word of God, and I have rested implicitly on its promises; the one
promise I have often thought of: 'Once I was young, and now I am old,
yet never have I seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging
their bread.' I believed that till I came to my own country. </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> I believed that until I undertook the
ministerial work in London.
I believed it was true. Now I know it is not true; I have seen the
righteous forsaken and his seed begging their bread. My faith is
gone; and I am holding on here, but I feel like a hypocrite. I want
to ask you how it seems to you."</div>
<p>And I told him in my poor way,
as I have been trying to tell you tonight, how it is, simply because
of our violation of natural justice; how it is, simply because we
will not take the appointed way. </p>
<p>Aye, in our own hearts we all know. To the man who appreciates
this truth, to the man who enters this work, it makes little
difference &#8212; this thing of results. This at least he knows, that
it is not because of the Power that created this world and brought
men upon it that these dark shades exist in our civilisation today;
that it is not because of the niggardliness of the Creator. </p>
<p> And there arises in me a feeling of what the world might be. The
prayer that the Master taught His disciples: '<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven</span>,' was no mere form
of words. It is given to men to struggle for the kingdom of justice
and righteousness. It is given to men to work and to hope for and to
bring on that day of which the prophets have told and the seers have
dreamed; that day in which involuntary poverty shall be utterly
abolished; that day in which there shall be work for all, leisure for
all, abundance for all; that day in which even the humblest shall
have his share, not merely of the necessities and comforts, but of
the reasonable luxuries of life; that day in which every child born
among us may hope to develop all that is highest and noblest in its
nature; that day in which in the midst of abundance the fear of want
shall be gone. </p>
<p> This greed for wealth that leads men to turn their backs upon
everything that is just and true, and to trample upon their fellows
lest they be trampled upon; to search and to strive, and to strain
every faculty of their natures to accumulate what they cannot take
away, will be gone, and in that day the higher qualities of man shall
have their opportunity and claim their reward. </p>
<p> We cannot change human nature; we are not so foolish as to dream
that human nature can be changed. What we mean to do is to give the
good in human nature its opportunity to develop. </p>
<p> Try our remedy by any test &#8212; the test of justice; the test of
expediency. Try it by any dictum of political economy; by any maxim
of good morals; by any maxim of good government. It will stand every
test. What I ask you to do is not to take what I or any other man may
say, but to think for yourselves!</p>
