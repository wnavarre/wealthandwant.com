<p>UPON the plains this season railroad building is progressing with
a rapidity never before known. The two companies, in their struggle
for the enormous bounty offered by the Government, are shortening the
distance between the lines of rail at the rate of from seven to nine
miles a day &#8212; almost as fast as the ox teams which furnished the
primitive method of conveyance across the continent could travel.
Possibly by the middle of next spring, and certainly, we are told,
before mid-summer comes again, this "greatest work of the age" will
be completed, and an unbroken track stretch from the Atlantic to the
Pacific.</p>
<p>Though, as a piece of engineering, the building of this road
may not deserve the superlative terms in which, with American
proneness to exaggeration, it is frequently spoken of, yet, when the
full effects of its completion are considered, it seems the "greatest
work of the age," indeed. Even the Suez Canal, which will
almost change the front of Europe and divert the course of the
commerce of half the world, is, in this view, not to be compared with
it. For this railroad will not merely open a new route across the
continent; it will be the means of converting a wilderness into a
populous empire in less time than many of the cathedrals and palaces
of Europe were building, and in unlocking treasure vaults which will
flood the world with the precious metals. The country west of the
longitude of Omaha, all of which will be directly or indirectly
affected by the construction of the railroad, (for other roads must
soon follow the first) is the largest and richest portion of the
United States. Throughout the greater part of this vast domain gold
and silver are scattered in inexhaustible profusion, and it contains
besides, in limitless quantities, every valuable mineral known to
man, and includes every variety of soil and climate.</p>
<p>The natural resources of this country are so great and varied, the
inducements which it offers to capital and labor are so superior to
those offered anywhere else, that when it is opened by railroads
placed, as it soon will be, within a few days' ride of New York, and
two or three weeks' journey from Southampton and Bremen, immigration
will flow into it like pent-up waters seeking their level, and States
will be peopled and cities built with a rapidity never before known,
even in our central West. In the consideration of the effects of this
migratory movement; of the economical, social and political features
of these great commonwealths shortly to be called into vigorous
being, and of the influences which their growth will exert upon the
rest of the Union and the rest of the world; of the changes which
must follow the movement of the centre of population and power
Pacific-wards, a bound less and most tempting field for speculation
is opened up; but into it we cannot enter, as there is more than
enough occupy us in the narrower range suggested by the title of this
article.</p>
<p>What is the railroad to do for <span style="font-style: italic;">us</span>?
&#8212; this railroad that we have
looked for, hoped for, prayed for so long?</p>
<p>Much as the matter has been thought about and talked about; many
as have been the speeches made and the newspaper articles written on
the subject, there are few of us who really comprehend all it will
do. We are so used to the California of the stage-coach, widely
separated from the rest of the world, that we can hardly realize what
the California of the railroad will be &#8212; the California netted with
iron tracks, and, almost as near in point of time to Chicago and St.
Louis, as Virginia City was to San Francisco when the Washoe
excitement first commenced, or as Red Bluff is now. The sharpest
sense of Americans &#8212; the keen sense of gain, which certainly does not
lose its keenness in our bracing air &#8212; is the first to realize what
coming with our railroad. All over the State, land is
appreciating &#8212; fortunes are being made in a day by buying and
parceling
out Spanish ranches; the Government surveyors and registrars are
busy; speculators are grappling the public domain by the hundreds of
thousand of acres; while for miles in every direction around San
Francisco, ground is being laid off into homestead lots. The spirit
of speculation doubles, trebles, quadruples the past growth of the
city in its calculations, and then discounts the result, confident
that there still remains a margin. And it is not far wrong. The new
era will be one of great material prosperity, if material prosperity
means more people, more houses, more farms and mines, more factories
and ships. Calculations based upon the growth of San Francisco can
hardly be wild. There are men now in their prime among us who will
live to see this the second, perhaps the first city on to the
continent. This, which may sound like the sanguine utterance of
California speculation, is simply a logical deduction from the
past.</p>
<p>After the first impulse which settled California had subsided,
there came a time of stagnation, if not of absolute decay. As the
placers one after another were exhausted, the miners moved off; once
populous districts were deserted, there are probably but few of us
who once flourishing mining towns fell into ruin, and it seemed to
superficial observers as though the State had passed the acme of her
prosperity. During this period quartz mining was being slowly
developed, agriculture steadily increasing in importance, and
manufactures gaining a foot-hold; but the progress of these
industries was slow; they could not at once compensate for the
exhaustion of the placer mines; and though San Francisco, drawing her
support from the whole coast, continued to grow steadily if not
rapidly, the aggregate population and wealth of the State diminished
rather than increased. Through this period we have passed. Although
the decay of portions of the mining regions still continues, there
has been going on for some time a steady, rapid development of the
State at large &#8212; felt principally in the agricultural counties and the
metropolis, but which is now beginning to make itself felt from one
end of the State to the other. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To
produce this, several causes have
combined, but prominent among them must be reckoned the new force to
which we principally and primarily look for the development of the
future &#8212; railroads. </span>This year &#8212; during which more has been
done in
railroad building and railroad projecting than in all previous years
combined &#8212; the immediate and prospective influence of this new force,
the great settler of States and builder up of cities, has first been
powerfully felt. This year we have received the first great wave of
the coming tide of immigration, the country has filled up more
rapidly than for many years before, more new farms have been staked
off and more land sold. And this year a spirit of sanguine enterprise
has sprung from present prosperity.</p>
<p>It is not only the metropolis that is hopeful. Sacramento,
Stockton and Marysville feel the general impulse. Oakland is laying
out, or at least surveying, docks which will cast those of Jersey
City, if not of Liverpool, into the shade; Vallejo talks of her
coming foreign commerce, and is preparing to load the grain of the
Sacramento and Napa valleys into ships for all parts of the world;
and San Diego is beginning to look forward to the time when she will
have steam communication with St. Louis and New Orleans on the one
hand, and China and Japan on the other, &#8212; and be the second city on
the coast. Renewed interest is being taken in mining-new branches of
manufacture are being started. <span style="font-weight: bold;">All
over it is felt that the old era
of stage coaches and ox and mule transportation is rapidly passing
away, and that the locomotive, soon to penetrate the State in all
directions, will in future carry the wheat to the wharf, the ore to
the mill, the timber to the mine; supply the deficiency of navigable
streams, open up millions of acres of the best fruit and grain lands
in the world, and make accessible and workable thousands of rich
mines.</span></p>
<p>In San Francisco the change is especially observable, and no one
who walks our streets can fail to be struck with the stirring
atmosphere of rapid growth. In the crowded avenues and squares, the
bustling business air of the centre, the rapidly rising buildings of
the suburbs; in new manufactories, docks and wharves, he will
everywhere find evidence that San Francisco is fast rising to the
rank of a great metropolis.</p>
<p>To the old resident, the growth of this city during the past few
years in which she has taken her second start seems sufficiently
marvelous. It does not seem long ago when Market street was blocked
below Third by a huge sand dune; when the walk to Russ Garden was
esteemed a "Sabbath day's journey;" when the "old road" and the "new
road" led past nursery, garden, swamp and sand-hill to the suburban
village of the Mission; when Mason street bounded civilization on one
side and South Park on the other; when the Rassette and International
were crack hotels, the Queen City and the Antelope ran to Sacramento,
and the gun of the Panama steamer roused the whole town &#8212; and when
(inevitable reflection) land enough to make a millionaire now might
have been had for a song. <br>
</p>
In striking contrast with these memories of
the San Francisco of but a few years back is the wide-spreading, well
built city of the present, whose dwellings, workshops and wharves
already straggle past points which ten years ago only the daring
would have thought they could reach during the present
generation.&nbsp; Yet the growth of San Francisco has hardly commenced
&#8212; growing now
with greater rapidity than ever, her greatest growth will date from
the completion of the railroad next year. The San Francisco of the
new era will be a city compared with which the San Francisco of the
present is only a little village.
<p>Look for a moment at the geographical position of this city, and
all doubt as to her future rank will be dispelled. There is in the
whole world no city &#8212; not even Constantinople, New Orleans, or
Panama &#8212; which possesses equal advantages. From San Diego to the
Columbia river, a stretch of over 1000 miles of coast, the bay of San
Francisco is the only possible site for a great city. For the whole
of the vast and rich country behind, this is the only gate to the
sea. Not a settler in all the Pacific States and Territories but must
pay San Francisco tribute; not an ounce of gold dug, a pound of ore
smelted, a field gleaned, or a tree felled in all their thousands of
square miles, but must, in a greater or less degree, add to her
wealth. She must be the importer, the banker, the market, the centre
of every kind, for all the millions who are shortly to settle this
territory. She will be not merely the metropolis of the Western front
of the United States, as New York is the metropolis of the Eastern
front, but <span style="font-style: italic;">the city</span>, the sole
great city &#8212; relatively such a city as
New York, Boston, Portland, Philadelphia, Richmond and Charleston,
with many a coast and inland city rolled into one, would be. The
Atlantic shore line is indented with bays and navigable rivers, but
from San Diego to the Columbia on the Western coast there is but one
bay &#8212; San Francisco &#8212; and the only navigable rivers are those which
empty
into it. For a thousand miles north and south of San Francisco no
cities are possible to become her rivals as the seaboard cities from
Maine to South Carolina rival New York. On this single bay the whole
business of the coast must be concentrated.</p>
And then, San Francisco has all the advantage of the start. When
New York had the same population that San Francisco has at present,
Philadelphia was of equal size, Boston and Baltimore were
considerable rivals, and the foreign commerce of the East was divided
between half a dozen cities. But while San Francisco has today a
population of 140,000, from Panama to Alaska there is not a town
which, compared with her, is more than an <span
 style="font-style: italic;">embarcadero</span>, and from
Panama to Alaska her influence will be felt in preventing the growth
of other cities, by drawing to herself business which should
naturally belong to them. Great cities draw to themselves population,
business, capital, by the law of attraction &#8212; the law that "unto him
that hath shall be given;" they prevent the growth of rivals just as
the great tree with its wide-spreading branches and deep-striking
roots prevents the growth of the sapling over which it casts its
shadow.&nbsp; The start of San Francisco &#8212; the concentration of
capital and
business which is inevitable here-will enable her to draw support
from the whole Pacific, stunting cities which might otherwise become
her rivals; and when she gets free-trade (as she one day will) she
will become the great financial and commercial centre of all the
Pacific coasts and countries.
<p>Considering these things, is it too much to say that this city of
ours must become the first city of the continent; and is it too much
to say that the first city of the continent must ultimately be the
first city of the world? And when we remember the irresistible
tendency of modern times to concentration &#8212; remember that New York,
Paris and London are still growing faster than ever &#8212; where shall we
set bounds to the future population and wealth of San Francisco;
where find a parallel for the city which a century hence will
<span style="font-style: italic;">surround </span>this bay?</p>
<p>The new era into which our State is about entering &#8212; or, perhaps,
to
speak more correctly, has already entered &#8212; is without doubt an era of
steady, rapid and substantial growth; of great addition to population
and immense increase in the totals of the Assessor's lists. Yet we
cannot hope to escape the great law of compensation which exacts some
loss for every gain. And as there are but few of us who, could we
retrace our lives, retaining the knowledge we have gained, would pass
from childhood into youth, or from youth into manhood, with unmixed
feelings, so we imagine that if the genius of California, whom we
picture on the shield of our State, were really a sentient being, she
would not look forward now entirely without regret. The California of
the new era will be greater, richer, more powerful than the
California of the past; but will she be still the same California
whom her adopted children, gathered from all climes, love better than
their own mother lands; from which all who have lived within her
bounds are proud to hail; to which all who have known her long to
return? She will have more people; but among those people will there
be so large a proportion of full, true men? She will have more
wealth; but will it be so evenly distributed? She will have more
luxury and refinement and culture; but will she have such general
comfort, so little squalor and misery; so little of the grinding,
hopeless poverty that chills and cramps the souls of men, and
converts them into brutes?</p>
<p>Amid all our rejoicing and all our gratulation let us see clearly
whither we are tending. Increase in population and in wealth past a
certain point means simply an approximation to the condition of older
countries the Eastern States and Europe. Would the average
Californian prefer to "take his chances" in New York or
Massachusetts, or in California as it is and has been? Is England,
with her population of twenty millions to an area not more than
one-third that of our State, and a wealth which per inhabitant is six
or seven times that of California, a better country than California
to live in? Probably, if one were born a duke or a factory lord, or
to any place among the upper ten thousand; but if one were born among
the lower millions &#8212; how then?</p>
<p>And so the California of the future the California of the new
era &#8212; will be a better country for some classes than the California of
the present; and so too, it must be a worse country for others. Which
of these classes will be the largest? Are there more mill owners or
factory operatives in Lancastershire; more brown stone mansions, or
tenement rooms in New York?</p>
<p>With the tendency of human nature to set
the highest value on that which it has not, we have clamored for
immigration, for population, as though that was the one sole good.
But if this be so, how is it that the most populous countries in the
world are the most miserable, most corrupt, most stagnant and
hopeless? How is it that in populous and wealthy England there is so
much more misery, vice and social disease than in her poor and
sparsely populated colonies? If a large population is not a curse as
well as a blessing, how was it that the black-death which swept off
one-third of the population of England produced such a rise in the
standard of wages and the standard of comfort among the people?</p>
<p>We want great cities, large factories, and mines worked cheaply,
in this California of ours! Would we esteem ourselves gainers if New
York, ruled and robbed by thieves, loafers and brothelkeepers;
nursing a race of savages fiercer and meaner than any who ever
shrieked a war-whoop on the plains; could be set down on our bay
tomorrow? Would we be gainers, if the cotton-mills of Massachusetts,
with their thousands of little children who, official papers tell us,
are being literally worked to death, could be transported to the
banks of the American; or the file and pin factories of England,
where young girls are treated worse than ever slaves on Southern
plantations, be reared as by magic at Antioch? Or if among our
mountains we could by wishing have the miners, men, women and
children, who work the iron and coal mines of Belgium and France,
where the condition of production is that the laborer shall have meat
but once a week &#8212; would we wish them here?</p>
<p>Can we have one thing without the other? We might, perhaps. But
does human nature differ in different longitudes? Do the laws of
production and distribution, inexorable in their sphere as the law of
gravitation in its lose their power in a country where no rain falls
in the summer time?</p>
<p>For years the high rate of interest and the high rate of wages
prevailing in California have been special subjects for the
lamentation of a certain school of local political economists, who
could not see that high wages and high interest were indications that
the natural wealth of the country was not yet monopolized, that great
opportunities were open to all &#8212; who did not know that these were
evidences of social health, and that it were as wise to lament them
as for the maiden to wish to exchange the natural bloom on her cheek
for the interesting pallor of the invalid?</p>
<p>But however this be, it is
certain that the tendency of the new era &#8212; the more dense population
and more thorough development of the wealth of the State &#8212; will be
to a reduction both of the rate of interest and the rate of wages,
particularly the latter. This tendency may not, probably will not, be
shown immediately; but it will be before long, and that powerfully,
unless balanced and counteracted by other influences which we are not
now considering, which do not yet appear, and which it is probable
will not appear for some time yet.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The truth is, that the completion
of the railroad and the
consequent great increase of business and population, will not be a
benefit to all of us, but only to a portion.</span> As a general rule
(liable of course to exceptions) those who <span
 style="font-style: italic;">have</span> it will make
wealthier; for those who <span style="font-style: italic;">have not</span>,
it will make it more difficult to
get. Those who have lands, mines, established businesses, special
abilities of certain kinds, will become richer for it and find
increased opportunities; those who have only their own labor will be
come poorer, and find it harder to get ahead &#8212; first, because it will
take more capital to buy land or to get into business; and second,
because as competition reduces the wages of labor, this capital will
be harder for them to obtain.</p>
<p>What, for instance, does the rise in land mean? Several things,
but certainly and prominently this: that it will be harder in future
for a poor man to get a farm or a homestead lot. In some sections of
the State, land which twelve months ago could have been had for a
dollar an acre, cannot now be had for less than fifteen dollars. In
other words, the settler who last year might have had at once a farm
of his own, must now either go to work on wages for some one else,
pay rent or buy on time; in either case being compelled to give to
the capitalist a large proportion of the earnings which, had he
arrived a year ago, he might have had all for of himself. And as
proprietorship is thus rendered more difficult and less profitable to
the poor, more are forced into the labor market to compete with each
other, and cut down the rate of wages &#8212; that is, to make the division
of their joint production between labor and capital more in favor of
capital and less in favor of labor.</p>
<p>And so in San Francisco the rise in building lots means, that it
will be harder for a poor man to get a house and lot for himself, and
if he has none that he will have to use more of his earnings for
rent; means a crowding of the poorer classes together; signifies
courts, slums, tenement-houses, squalor and vice.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">San Francisco has one great
advantage &#8212; there is probably a
larger proportion of her population owning homesteads and homestead
lots than in any other city of the United States.</span> The product of
the
rise of real estate will thus be more evenly distributed, and the
great social and political advantages of this diffused proprietorship
cannot be over-estimated. Nor can it be too much regretted that the
princely domain which San Francisco inherited as the successor of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">pueblo </span>was not appropriated
to furnishing free, or almost free,
homesteads to actual settlers, instead of being allowed to pass into
the hands of a few, to make more millionaires. Had the matter been
taken up in time and in a proper spirit, this disposition might
easily have been secured, and the great city of the future would have
had a population bound to her by the strongest ties &#8212; a population
better, freer, more virtuous, independent and public spirited than
any great city the world has ever had.</p>
To say that "Power is constantly stealing from the many to the
few," is only to state in another form the law that wealth tends to
concentration. In the new era into which the world has entered since
the application of steam, this law is more potent than ever; in the
new era into which California is entering, its operations will be
more marked here than ever before. The locomotive is a great
centralizer. It kills towns and builds up great cities, and in the
same way kills little businesses and builds up great ones. We have
had comparatively but few rich men; no very rich ones, in the meaning
"very rich" has in these times. But the process is going on. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
great city that is to be will have its Astors, Vanderbilts, Stewarts
and Spragues, and he who looks a few years ahead may even now read
their names as he passes along Montgomery, California or Front
streets.&nbsp;</span> With the protection which property gets in modern
times &#8212; with stocks, bonds, burglar-proof safes and policemen; with
the
railroad and the telegraph, after a man gets a certain amount of money
it is plain sailing, and he need take no risks. Astor said that to
get his first thousand dollars was his toughest struggle; but when
one gets a million, if he has ordinary prudence, how much he will
have is only a question of life. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nor
can we rely on the absence of
laws of primogeniture and entail to dissipate these large fortunes so
menacing to the general weal. Any large fortune will, of course,
become dissipated in time, even in spite of laws of primogeniture and
entail; but every aggregation of wealth implies and necessitates
others, and so that the aggregations remain, it matters little in
what particular hands. </span>Stewart, in the natural course of
things, will
die before long, and being childless, his wealth will be dissipated,
or at least go out of the dry goods business. But will this avail the
smaller dealers whom he has crushed or is crushing out? Not at all.
Some one else will step in, take his place in the trade, and run the
great money-making machine which he has organized, or some other
similar one. Stewart and other great houses have concentrated the
business, and
it will remain concentrated. <br>
<br>
Nor is it worth while to shut our eyes
to the effects of this concentration of wealth. One millionaire
involves the little existence of just so many proletarians. It is the
great tree and the saplings over again. We need not look far from the
palace to find the hovel. When people can charter special steamboats
to take them to watering places, pay four thousand dollars for the
summer rental of a cottage, build marble stables for their horses,
and give dinner parties which cost by the thousand dollars a head, we
may know that there are poor girls on the streets pondering between
starvation and dishonor.&nbsp; When liveries appear, look out for
bare-footed children. A few
liveries are now to be seen on our streets; we think their appearance
coincides in date with the establishment of the almshouse. They are
few, plain and modest now; they will grow more numerous and gaudy &#8212;
and then we will not wait long for the children &#8212; their
corollaries.
<p>But there is another side: we are to become a great, populous,
wealthy community. And in such a community many good things are
possible that are not possible in a community such as ours has been.
There have been artists, scholars, and men of special knowledge and
ability among us, who could and some of whom have since won
distinction and wealth in older and larger cities, but who here could
only make a living by digging sand, peddling vegetables, or washing
dishes in restaurants. It will not be so in the San Francisco of the
future. We shall keep such men with us, and reward them, instead of
driving them away. We shall have our noble charities, great museums,
libraries and universities; a class of men who have leisure for
thought and culture; magnificent theatres and opera houses; parks and
pleasure gardens.</p>
<p>We shall develop a literature of our own, issue books which will
be read wherever the English language is spoken, and maintain
periodicals which will rank with those of the East and Europe. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The
Bulletin, Times </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">Alta</span>,
good as they are, must become, or must
yield to, journals of the type of the New York<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> Herald</span> or the Chicago
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tribune</span>. The railroads which
will carry the San Francisco newspapers
over a wide extent of country the same day that they are issued, will
place them on a par, or almost on a par in point of time, with
journals printed in the interior, while their metropolitan
circulation and business will enable them to publish more and later
news than interior papers can.</p>
<p>The same law of concentration will work in other businesses in the
same way. The railroads may benefit Sacramento and Stockton by making
of them workshops, but no one will stop there to buy goods when he
can go to San Francisco, make his choice from larger stocks, and
return the same day.</p>
<p>But again comes the question: will this California of the future,
with its facilities for travel and transportation; its huge
metropolis and pleasant watering places; its noble literature and
great newspapers; universities, libraries and museums; parks and
operas; fleets of yachts and miles of villas, possess still the
charm which makes Californians prefer their State, even as it is, to
places where all these things are to be found?</p>
<p>What constitutes the peculiar charm of California, which all who
have lived here long enough feel? Not the climate alone. Heresy
though it be to say so, there <span style="font-style: italic;">are </span>climates
as good; some that on the
whole are better. Not merely that there is less social restraint, for
there are parts of the Union and parts from which tourists
occasionally come to lecture us &#8212; where there is much less social
restraint than in California. Not simply that the opportunities of
making money have been better here; for the opportunities for making
large fortunes have not been so good as in some other places, and
there are many who have not made money here, who prefer this country
to any other; many who after leaving us throw away certainty of
profit to return and "take the, chances" of California. It certainly
is not in the growth of local attachment, for the Californian has
even less local attachment than the average American, and will move
about from one end of the State to the other with perfect
indifference. It is not that we have the culture or the opportunities
to gratify luxurious and cultivated tastes that older countries
afford, and yet those who leave us on this account as a general thing
come back again.</p>
<p>No: the potent charm of California, which all feel but few
analyze, has been more in the character, habits and modes of thought
of her people &#8212; called forth by the peculiar conditions of the young
State &#8212; than in anything else. In California there has been a
certain cosmopolitanism, a certain freedom and breadth of common
thought and feeling, natural to a community made up from so many
different sources, to which every man and woman had been transplanted
&#8212; all travellers to some extent, and with native angularities of
prejudice and habit more or less worn off. Then there has been a
feeling of personal independence and equality, a general hopeful ness
and self-reliance, and a certain large-heartedness and
open-handedness which were born of the comparative evenness with
which property was distributed, the high standard of wages and of
comfort, and the latent feeling of every one that he might "make a
strike," and certainly could not be kept down long.</p>
<p>While we have had no very rich class, we have had no really poor
class. There have been enough "dead brokes," and how many
Californians are there who have not gone through that experience; but
there never was a better country to be " broken" in, and where almost
every man, even the most successful, had been in the same position,
it did not involve the humiliation and loss of hope which attaches to
utter poverty in older and more settled communities.</p>
<p>In a country where all had started from the same level &#8212; where the
banker had been a year or two before a journeyman carpenter, the
merchant a foremast hand; the restaurant waiter had perhaps been
educated for the bar or the church, and the laborer once counted his
"pile," and where the wheel of fortune had been constantly revolving
with a rapidity in other places unknown, social lines could not be
sharply drawn, nor a reverse dispirit. There was something in the
great possibilities of the country; in the feeling that it was one of
immense latent wealth; which furnished a background of which a better
filled and more thoroughly developed country is destitute, and which
contributed not a little to the active, generous, independent social
tone.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the principal business &#8212; mining &#8212; gave a
color
to all California thought and feeling. It fostered a reckless,
generous, independent spirit, with a strong disposition to "take
chances" and "trust to luck." Than the placer mining, no more
independent business could be conceived. The miner working for
himself, owned no master; worked when and only when he pleased; took
out his earnings each day in the shining particles which depended for
their value on no fluctuations of the market, but would pass current
and supply all wants the world over. When his claim gave out, or for
any reason he desired to move, he had but to shoulder his pick and
move on. Mining of this kind developed its virtues as well as its
vices. If it could have been united with ownership of land and the
comforts and restraints of home, it would have given us a class of
citizens of the utmost value to a republican state. But the "honest
miner" of the placers has passed away in California. The Chinaman,
the millioner and his laborers, the mine superintendent and his gang,
are his successors.</p>
<p>This crowding of people into immense cities, this aggregation of
wealth into large lumps, this marshalling of men into big gangs under
the control of the great "captains of industry," does not tend to
foster personal independence &#8212; the basis of all virtues &#8212; nor will it
tend to preserve the characteristics which particularly have made
Californians proud of their State.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, we shall have some real
social gains, with some that are only apparent. We shall have more of
home influences, a deeper religious sentiment, less of the unrest
that is bred of an adventurous and reckless life. We shall have fewer
shooting and stabbing affrays, but we will have probably something
worse, from which, thank God, we have hitherto been exempt &#8212; the low,
brutal, cowardly rowdyism of the great Eastern cities. We shall hear
less of highway robberies in the mountains, but more, perhaps, of
pickpockets, burglars and sneak thieves. <br>
</p>
<p>That we can look forward to
any political improvement is, to say the least, doubtful. There is
nothing in the changes which are coming that of itself promises that.
There will be a more permanent population, more who will look on
California as their home; but we would not aver that there will be a
larger proportion of the population who will take an intelligent
interest in public affairs. In San Francisco the political future is
full of danger. As surely as San Francisco is destined to become as
large as New York, as certain is it that her political condition is
destined to become as bad as that of New York, unless her citizens
are aroused in time to the necessity of preventive or rather
palliative measures. And in the growth of large corporations and
other special interests is an element of great danger. Of these great
corporations and interests we shall have many. Look, for instance, at
the Central Pacific Railroad Company, as it will be, with a line
running to Salt Lake, controlling more capital and employing more men
than any of the great eastern railroads who manage legislatures as
they manage their workshops, and name governors, senators and judges
almost as they name their own engineers clerks! Can we rely upon
sufficient intelligence, independence and virtue among the many to
resist the political effects of the concentration of great wealth in
the hands of a few?</p>
<p>And this in general is the tendency of the time, and of the new
era opening before us: to the great development of wealth; to
concentration; to the differentiation of classes; to less personal
independence among the many and the greater power of the few. We
shall lose much which gave a charm to California life; much that was
valuable in the character of our people, while we will also wear off
defects, and gain some things that we lacked.</p>
<p>With our gains and our losses will come new duties and new
responsibilities. Connected more closely with the rest of the nation,
we will feel more quickly and keenly all that affects it. We will
have to deal, in time, with all the social problems that are forcing
themselves on older communities, (like the riddles of a Sphinx, which
not to answer is death) with one of them, the labor question,
rendered peculiarly complex by our proximity to Asia. Public spirit,
public virtue, the high resolve of men and women who are capable of
feeling the "enthusiasm of humanity," will be need ed in the future
more than ever.</p>
<p>A great change is coming over our State. We should not prevent it
if we could, and could not if we would, but we can view it in all its
bearings &#8212; look at the dark as well as the bright side, and endeavor
to
hasten that which is good and retard or prevent that which is bad. A
great State is forming; let us see to it that its foundations are
laid firm and true.</p>
<p>And as California becomes populous rich, let us not forget that
the character of a people counts for more than their numbers; that
the distribution of wealth is even a more important matter than its
production. Let us not imagine ourselves in a fools' paradise, where
the golden apples will drop into our mouths; let us not think that
after the stormy seas and head gales of all the ages, our ship has at
last struck the trade winds of time. The future of our State, of our
nation, of our race, looks fair and bright; perhaps the future looked
so to the philosophers who once sat in the porches of Athens &#8212; to the
unremembered men who raised the cities whose ruins lie south of us.
Our modern civilization strikes broad and deep and looks high. So did
the tower which men once built almost unto heaven.</p>
