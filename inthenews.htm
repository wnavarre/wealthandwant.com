<p align="center"><strong>Rent, Wealth and Want
  in the News</strong>
</p>
<p>The newsmedia and internet are full of stories that relate to the issues you
  read about on the WealthandWant.com website.</p>
<p>Here are a few recent ones:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thursday, June 15, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>In Poverty Tactics, An Old Debate: Who Is at Fault?  <font size="-1">Today,
        the Pendulum Swings Away From Government To Small-Scale Projects; 
      The Price of 'Dependency'</font></strong> </em>By DAVID WESSEL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article briefly touched on the right answer at the
  end of this paragraph ... </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Either you blame the poor -- 'the poverty is in the people' -- or you
      blame the system,&quot; says James T. Patterson, a Brown University historian. &quot;It
      is a constant divide.&quot; If the poor are primarily responsible for their
      plight, then government ought to prod them to change their ways. If poverty
      is primarily the consequence of economic and social forces largely beyond
      their control, then government ought to give them money and change the
      rules of the
      economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That last phrase -- &quot;and change the rules of the economy&quot; -- is apt, but then
  they only talk about current proposals to increase the minimum wage, increase
  income taxes and spend more on &quot;programs.&quot;</p>
<p>Wessel goes on to say, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Eradicating poverty in the U.S. is an old goal. In the frothy days of 1928,
      Herbert Hoover said, &quot;We shall soon, with the help of God, be in sight
      of the day when poverty will be banished in the nation.&quot; Incomes did
      rise sharply in the 1920s; the working class did better; life expectancy
      grew. But
      he was wrong about poverty.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the history of the effort to eradicate poverty needs to be examined in
  more depth. Fifty years earlier, <a href="themes/About_HG.html">Henry George</a> laid
  out both the causes of poverty and the remedy in <strong><em><a href="George_P&P.html">Progress
  and Poverty</a></em></strong>. The book
  was a bestseller, and some would say that it kicked off the Progressive movement.
  George identifed the economic laws and the related structural problem in our
  economy -- &quot;the rules of the economy&quot; that would need to be changed, in Wessel's
  words.</p>

<p><strong>House passes tax cut bill: Measure extends capital gains cuts, trims
    taxes by $70 billion over 5 years</strong></p>
<p>Updated: 6:26 p.m. ET May 10, 2006</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The House Wednesday passed a bill sought by President Bush to
  deliver tax cuts worth $70 billion to investors and to keep 15 million taxpayers
  from being hit by the alternative minimum tax</p>
<p>The House passed the measure by a 244-185 vote. The Senate is expected to
  clear the bill Thursday.</p>
<p>The bill provides a two-year extension of the reduced 15 percent tax rate
  for capital gains and dividends, currently set to expire at the end of 2008. </p>
<table width="95%" border="2" cellpadding="1">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#FFFF99"><p>Who benefits from this? Take a look at the ownership of &quot;equity&quot; in the
          <a href="issues/wealth/90-9-1_Tables.html">90-9-1 tables</a>, and you'll
        see that nearly 37% of the ownership is in the hands of the top 1% of
        us, and another 42% belongs to the next 9% of us, leaving 21% for the other
        90% of us! (That's based on the distribution of wealth.)</p>
      <p>Based on the distribution of income, the top 1% of income recipients
        received 57.5% of capital income in 2003! The top 10% received 79.4%.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would also extend, for this year, recent changes to the alternative minimum
    tax &#8212; originally aimed at making sure the wealthy pay at least some taxes &#8212; to
    prevent it from hitting more upper middle-income families.</p>
<p>The debate divided starkly along partisan lines, with Republicans crediting
  the tax cuts, first enacted in 2003, with a surging economy, millions of new
  jobs and surging tax revenues. Democrats countered that the deficit-financed
  tax cuts are tilted in favor of wealthy investors and that the economic benefits
  are not as great as advertised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our tax relief sparked this economic growth,&#8221; said House Speaker
  Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. &#8220;And by extending key provisions of that tax relief,
  today&#8217;s legislation adds just another spark to the already booming economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Added Treasury Secretary John Snow: &#8220;It sends a terrific message to
  the markets that we&#8217;re going to continue to have low rates on capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Critics, including most Democrats, attacked the tax rate reductions on dividends
  and capital gains as being skewed in favor of the rich. They noted that is
  was the second half of a GOP budget package that began with $39 billion in
  benefit cuts over five years, many of which came from programs for the poor
  such as Medicaid.</p>

<p><strong>Alaskans See Bright Side to Soaring Pump
      Prices <br>
</strong><font size="-1">By Sam Howe Verhovek, Times Staff Writer, 
  May 7, 2006</font><br>
      <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-oil7may07,0,3768.story">http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-oil7may07,0,3768.story</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">... But while Ginnis and other Alaskans are clearly irked
        by high prices at the pump, some also see an upside &#8212; a very big upside.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Alaska is an oil state,&quot; said John Pearson, a pipe fitter filling
      up his Chevy Tahoe, his face creasing into a very slight smile. &quot;No one
      likes high prices. But maybe high prices for oil are less bad for us than people
      'outside.' &quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;Outside&quot; is the standard term Alaskans use for
        any place, well, outside Alaska.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Inside the Last Frontier, where every man, woman and child
        received a dividend check last year for $854.76 from the state's optimistically
        named &quot;Permanent
      Fund&quot; of oil-generated wealth, there is a sense that record-high oil prices
      might not be the worst thing that ever happened here.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">In fact, legislators in Juneau, the state capital, say they
        are anticipating a windfall in the budget this year, leaving them with as
        much as $2.4 billion
      in unexpected revenue to spend on capital construction &#8212; including the
      state's share of two projects that critics describe as &quot;bridges to nowhere&quot; and
      which have become symbols of congressional pork-barrel spending run amok.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;While the rest of the country is squirming with high gas prices, we're
      laughing all the way through the capital budget,&quot; said Sue Libenson, an
      organizer with the Boreal Songbird Initiative, an environmental group critical
      of the bridge projects. </font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Alaska developers say the bridges are no laughing matter, but instead will
      be vital spurs to economic development, and they have persuaded state lawmakers
      to set aside more than $90 million for each project.</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1"> One bridge would cross over the waters of Knik Arm in Anchorage to a currently
            undeveloped stretch of peninsula nearby.</font></li>
    <li><font size="-1">  The other would connect Ketchikan, a city of about 9,000 at the very
              southeastern tip of Alaska, to an island, population 50, where its airport
              is located. The
              two have been linked for years by a six-minute ferry ride.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font size="-1">After specific federal earmarks for the bridges received the
        Taxpayers for Common Sense &quot;Golden Fleece Award&quot; last year for wasteful spending,
      Alaska's congressional delegation agreed to remove them &#8212; but then quickly
      secured such a large pot of federal highway money for the state that design
      and other planning for the bridges went right on ahead.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Many in Alaska are confident that oil- and gas-fueled prosperity will continue
      indefinitely, sustaining a tax structure in which there aren't a lot of taxes.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Alaskans pay no state income or sales taxes, for instance. Since the oil-fund
      payout plan was launched in 1982, residents have received more than $13.5 billion
      in such dividends.</font></p>

<p><em><strong>How much does the Alaska Permanent Fund pay directly to Alaska's residents
  each year? Here's a recent article:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>This fall&#8217;s PFD forecast at $1,000<br>
</strong><font size="-1">By BILL WHITE, 
  Anchorage Daily News Published: April 18, 2006</font><br>
  <a href="http://www.adn.com/money/story/7639736p-7551381c.html">http://www.adn.com/money/story/7639736p-7551381c.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <font size="-1">This fall&#8217;s Permanent Fund dividend should total around $1,000, based
          on the Alaska Permanent Fund&#8217;s profits for the first nine months
          of its budget year, fund officials said Tuesday.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Through March 31, the $34 billion state oil-wealth savings
        account has posted a $2.1 billion profit, fund officials said. Profits for
        the year that runs
      through June 30 will be averaged with profits from the previous four years
      to calculate the size of this year&#8217;s dividend, which is to be paid in
      October. Last year&#8217;s dividend was $845.76.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">In the January-March quarter, the Permanent Fund showed a 4.5 percent return
      on its portfolio of stock, bond and real estate investments, fund officials
      said. For the first nine months of its budget year, the investments grew by
      11.9 percent, they said.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The state pays the dividend to all residents of at least a calendar year who
      apply by March 31 each year.</font></p>

<p><strong>Sitting on a jackpot</strong><br>
    <font size="-1">Open land in Boulder City, Nevada, is worth enough to make all 15,000 residents
      millionaires. <br>
      Kathleen Hennessey, Associated Press | May 6, 2006 <br>
      <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0506bouldercityA105060.html">http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0506bouldercityA105060.html</a></font><br>
      a few excerpts: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">No neon. No slots. No showgirls. This desert enclave, 25 miles southeast of
      Las Vegas, never has been interested in cashing in on its proximity to Sin
      City.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Until now, that is. Local activists say Boulder City, where gambling has been
      banned since its founding in 1931, is sitting on a jackpot: 167 square miles
      of undeveloped open land in one of the hottest real estate markets in the country.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">They've developed a plan to cash in and make millionaires of every man,
    woman and child in this community of about 15,000. (It's too late to move.
    Only people
      living here as of March 31 qualify.) <strong>... </strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">One proposal would require the land to remain untouched, set aside for the
    preservation of the endangered desert tortoise, public recreation and development
    of solar power.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The other would force the council to sell the property to the highest bidder,
    with 10 percent of the money to pay off city debt, build a bypass highway and
    fund education. A tax-exempt trust of 90 percent would be doled out to residents.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">An average vacant acre sold for $152,000 in the third quarter
      of 2001 and $700,000 in the same period in 2005, so the sale could yield
      $3.2 million
    for every &quot;resident of record.&quot; <strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Rattner compares the arrangement to Alaska, where citizens get an annual check
    for their share of royalties from the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">More fundamental, the city attorney said, the land doesn't belong to the residents
    of Boulder City in the first place.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">&quot;The deed that's on file in the County Recorder's Office says the city
    of Boulder City, not the people of Boulder City. Boulder City is a corporate
    entity that exists at the pleasure of the Nevada state Legislature,&quot; he
    said. <strong>... </strong></font></p>

<p><strong><em>wealthandwant</em></strong> comments: We applaud the impulse that
  all should share in the bounty of something that no individual created, but
  have some issues about how they propose to do that.</p>
<p>What about the <em>next</em> child born in Boulder City, to a Boulder City
  resident who qualifies? Is that child somehow unequal to his or her siblings?
  How about the next child adopted there? How about the next person to move in? </p>
<p>A better way, just to everyone:  Acknowledge
  that the economic value of Boulder City's land &#8212; <strong><em>all</em></strong> its
  land, not just the acres owned by the city itself &#8212; is 
  the
  common property of all who live there, and collect its economic value as the
  common treasure. Don't tax buildings: they represent human effort. Don't
  tax sales (ditto). Don't tax incomes (ditto). At 25 miles from Las Vegas, it
  will become a desirable
  place
  to
  live,
  and will
  attract residents. Use some of that revenue to provide efficient public transportation
  to Las Vegas. Use some to make an attractive downtown, with good schools and
  good services. They might think about these issues before selling any of the
  commons to some other private entity.</p>

<p>April 28, 2006 &#8212; <strong>Atlantic City May Lose in New Monopoly</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/28/nyregion/28monopoly.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/28/nyregion/28monopoly.html</a></p>
<p><strong><em>wealthandwant</em></strong> comments: The game of Monopoly has
  a very different history from what the New York Times reported:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">When Monopoly was devised in the 1930's, Atlantic City was chosen because
      it epitomized the kind of glittering tourist destination that many Depression-era
      Americans could only fantasize about visiting.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">Charles B. Darrow, an unemployed salesman, sketched the prototype board
          game on a tablecloth at his home in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia,
          using 21 street names from Atlantic City. (The final space, Marvin Gardens,
          was a name taken from the neighboring community of Margate City, where
          it is spelled Marvyn.)</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">The Parker Brothers game company rejected Mr. Darrow's
            proposal, so he went to a printer and began selling it himself. It caught
            on so quickly
          that Parker Brothers eventually reversed itself. It began mass-marketing
          Monopoly in 1935, and that year it became the world's best-selling board
          game. Pat Riso, a Hasbro spokeswoman, said it decided last year to poll
          fans to see how they might recast the game if it were to be developed today.
          So the &quot;here and now&quot; version will replace railroads with airlines.
          Utilities will be updated (Ms. Riso would not say with what, but allowed
          that Internet providers is a good guess.) Rents will rise, along with the
          cost of bail and the $200 payment for passing &quot;Go.&quot;</font></p>

    <p>Well, they've got a lot of facts wrong. For starters, </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, Monopoly was not &quot;devised&quot;
          in the 1930s. </li>
      <li>Nor was it created by Charles Darrow. Rather, it was created
            by Elizabeth Magie before 1903, in order to teach the ideas that
        the wealthandwant website seeks to share. Her game was called The Landlord's
          Game. </li>
      <li>Third,
              Marvin Gardens is a misspelling of the conjunction of the first
          syllables
              of Margate and Ventnor. </li>
    </ul>
