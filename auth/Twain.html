<blockquote>
  <p><a href="../themes/About_HG.html">Henry George</a>, Thomas Edison and Mark Twain were probably the most famous three
      people of their day, outside of those who were elected to public office. Their
      contributions were a major influence on our society. Mark Twain can clearly
      be counted among those who saw clearly the validity and significance of Henry
      George's ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
    <a href="../docs/Twain_archimedes.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Archimedes</span></a> (1887)</p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> "Give me whereon to
stand", said Archimedes, "and I will
move the earth." The boast was a pretty safe one, for he knew quite
well that the standing place was wanting, and always would be wanting.
But suppose he had moved the earth, what then? What benefit would it
have been to anybody? </small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...I know of a mechanical
force more powerful than anything the vaunting engineer of Syracuse
ever dreamed of. It is the force of land monopoly; it is a screw and
lever all in one; it will screw the last penny out of a man's pocket,
and bend everything on earth to its own despotic will. Give me the
private ownership of all the land, and will I move the earth? No; but
I will do more. I will undertake to make slaves of all the human
beings on the face of it. Not chattel slaves exactly, but slaves
nevertheless. What an idiot I would be to make chattel slaves of
them. I would have to find them salts and senna when they were sick,
and whip them to work when they were lazy. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No, it is not good enough. Under
the system I propose the fools
would imagine they were all free. I would get a maximum of results,
and have no responsibility whatever. They would cultivate the soil;
they would dive into the bowels of the earth for its hidden
treasures; they would build cities and construct railways and
telegraphs; their ships would navigate the ocean; they would work and
work, and invent and contrive; their warehouses would be full, their
markets glutted, and: </small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The beauty of the whole
concern would be<br>
That everything they made would belong to me.<br>
</b></small></center>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be this way, you see:
As I owned all the land, they would
of course, have to pay me rent. They could not reasonably expect me
to allow them the use of the land for nothing. I am not a hard man,
and in fixing the rent I would be very liberal with them. I would
allow them, in fact, to fix it themselves. What could be fairer? Here
is a piece of land, let us say, it might be a farm, it might be a
building site, or it might be something else - if there was only one
man who wanted it, of course he would not offer me much, but if the
land be really worth anything such a circumstance is not likely to
happen. On the contrary, there would be a number who would want it,
and they would go on bidding and bidding one against the other, in
order to get it. I should accept the highest offer - what could be
fairer? Every increase of population, extension of trade, every
advance in the arts and sciences would, as we all know, increase the
value of land, and the competition that would naturally arise would
continue to force rents upward, so much so, that in many cases the
tenants would have little or nothing left for themselves.</small></div>

  </span>Suppose I am the owner of an estate and 100 slaves, all the land
about being held in the same way by people of the same class as
myself. It is a profitable business, but there are many expenses and
annoyances attached to it. I must keep up my supply of slaves either
by buying or breeding them. ... <br>

<p><br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">from an address to Congress on
copyrights:</span> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">(Twain was arguing the injustice that
land titles are perpetual
but that copyrights are not. He lampoons the oft used claim that
people are entitled to be enriched by land monopoly because of their
foresight in realizing that the land will increase in value.) </p>
<p>I put a supposititious case, a dozen Englishmen who travel through
South Africa and camp out, and eleven of them see nothing at all;
they are mentally blind. But there is one in the party who knows what
this harbor means and what the lay of the land means. To him it means
that some day a railway will go through here, and there on that
harbor a great city will spring up. That is his idea. And he has
another idea, which is to go and trade his last bottle of Scotch
whiskey and his last horse-blanket to the principal chief of that
region and buy a piece of land the size of Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>
</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Lowest Animal</span>"
<p>Man is the only animal that robs his helpless fellow of his
country -- takes possession of it and drives him out of it or destroys
him. Man has done this in all the ages. There is not an acre of
ground on the globe that is in possession of its rightful owner, or
that has not been taken away from owner after owner, cycle after
cycle, by force and bloodshed. </p>
<p>Man is the only Slave. And he is the only animal who enslaves. He
has always been a slave in one form or another, and has always held
other slaves in bondage under him in one way or another. In our day
he is always some man's slave for wages, and does that man's work,
and this slave has other slaves under him for minor wages, and they
do his work. The higher animals are the only ones who do their own
work and provide their own living. </p>
<p>Man is the only Patriot. He sets himself apart in his own country,
under his own flag, and sneers at the other nations, and keeps
multitudinous uniformed assassins on hand at heavy expense to grab
slices of other people's countries, and to keep them from grabbing
slices of his. And in the intervals between campaigns he washes the
blood off his hands and works for "the universal brotherhood of
man" -- with his mouth. </p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Twain on Cecil Rhodes as a land
monopolizing enslaver</p>
<p>What is the secret of his [Cecil Rhodes's] formidable
supremacy? <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>One says it is his prodigious wealth--a wealth whose
drippings in salaries and and in other ways support multitudes and
make them his interested and loyal vassels; <br>
  </li>
  <li>another says it is his
personal magnetism and his persuasive tongue, and that these
hypnotize and make happy slaves of all that drift within the circle
of their influence; <br>
  </li>
  <li>another says it is his majestic ideas, his vast
schemes for the territorial aggrandizement of England, his patriotic
and unselfish ambition to spread her beneficent protection and her
just rule over the pagan wastes of Africa and make luminous the
African darkness with the glory of her name; and <br>
  </li>
  <li>another says he
wants the earth, wants it for his own, and that the secret belief
that he will get it and let his friends in on the ground floor is
*the* secret that rivets so many eyse on him and keeps him in the
zenith... </li>
</ul>
I admire him, I frankly confess it; and when his time comes I
shall buy a piece of the rope as a keepsake... The great bulk of the
savages must go. The white man wants their lands, and all must go
excepting such percentage of them as he will need to do his work for
him on terms determined by himself. Since history has removed the
element of guesswork from this matter and made it certainty, the
humanest way of diminishing the black population should be adopted,
not the old, cruel ways of the past. Mr. Rhodes and his gangs have
been following the old ways. They have been chartered to rob and
slay, and they lawfully do it, but not in a compassionate and
Christian spirit. They rob the Mashonas and the Matabeles of a
portion of their territories in the hallowed old style of "purchase"
for a song, and then they force a quarrel and take the rest by strong
hand. They rob the natives of their cattle under the pretext that all
the cattle in the country belonged to the king whom they have tricked
and assassinated. They issue "regulations" requiring the incensed and
harrassed natives to work for the white settlers, and neglect their
own affairs to do it. This is slavery, and it is several times worse
than was the American slavery which used to pain England so much; for
when the Rhodesian slave is sick, superannuated, or otherwise
disabled, he must support himself or starve--his master is under no
obligation to support him.
<p>The reduction of the population by Rhodesian methods to the
desired limit is a return to the old-time slow-misery and
lingering-death system of a discredited time and a crude
"civilization." We humanely reduce an overplus of dogs by the swift
method of chloroform; the Boer humanely reduced an overplus of blacks
by swift suffocation; the nameless but right-hearted Australian
pioneer humanely reduced his overplus of aboriginal neighbors by a
sweetened swift death concealed in a poisoned pudding. All these are
admirable, and worthy of praise; you and I would rather suffer either
of these deaths thirty times over on thirty successive days than
linger out one of the Rhodesian twenty-year deaths, with its daily
burden of insult, humiliation, and forced labor for a man whose
entire race the victim hates. Rhodesia is a happy name for that land
of piracy and pillage, and puts the right stain upon it. <br>

*Following the Equator* </div>

<br>
<br>
Roughing It,&nbsp; Volume I: Chapter XXII: The Air The Angels
Breathe &nbsp; -- 1871<br>
<p>(Last two paragraphs of chapter)</p>
<p>"I superintended again, and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we
got in the boat and skirted along the lake-shore about three miles
and disembarked. We liked the appearance of the place, and so we
claimed some three hundred acres of it and stuck our "notices" on a
tree. It was yellow-pine timber-land -- a dense forest of trees a
hundred feet high and from one to five feet through at the butt. It
was necessary to fence our property or we could not hold it. That is
to say, it was necessary to cut down trees here and there and make
them fall in such a way as to form a sort of inclosure (with pretty
wide gaps in it). We cut down three trees apiece, and found it such
heartbreaking work that we decided to "rest our case" on those; if
they held the property, well and good; if they didn't, let the
property spill out through the gaps and go; it was no use to work
ourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land. Next day we
came back to build a house -- for a house was also necessary, in
order to hold the property. We decided to build a substantial log
house and excite the envy of the Brigade boys; but by the time we had
cut and trimmed the first log it seemed unnecessary to be so
elaborate, and so we concluded to build it of saplings. However,
two saplings, duly cut and trimmed, compelled recognition of the fact
that a still modester architecture would satisfy the law, and so we
concluded to build a "brush" house. We devoted the next day to this
work, but we did so much "sitting around" and discussing, that by the
middle of the afternoon we had achieved only a half-way sort of
affair which one of us had to watch while the other cut brush, lest
if both turned our backs we might not be able to find it again, it
had such a strong family resemblance to the surrounding vegetation.
But we were satisfied with it.</p>
We were landowners now, duly seized and possessed, and within the
protection of the law. Therefore we decided to take up our residence
on our own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which
only such an experience can bring.
<p>[from Chapter XXIII]:</p>
We never slept in our "house." It never occurred to us, for one
thing; and besides, it was built to hold ground, and that was enough.
We did not wish to strain it. <br>
