      Hanno publishes <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Progress Report</span>,
      at <a href="http://www.progress.org">http://www.progress.org</a>,
      updated daily since 1997.&nbsp; He expresses himself beautifully and
      gently, parrying the comments of many readers with thoughtful and
      well-chosen words which lead us to think more deeply.<br>
      <br>
      Here are some of my favorites of things he has written, beyond his
      editorial work at the Progress Report:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><a href="../docs/Beck_BP.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Bathroom Policy</span></a><br>
      <small><br>
      We were four college sophomores. And we were not going to live in a
      dorm, no sir, we figured that we were smart, mature fellows and so we
      arranged to rent a house. Each person would have his own private
      bedroom and we would share the bathroom. Four guys, one bathroom. That
      sounds reasonable, right?<strong> ...</strong><br>
      <br>
      Now let's talk about you and everyone on Earth. We don't have to share
      a single bathroom. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But we do
      all share one planet.</span><br>
      <br>
      Our planet's natural resources are a common heritage for all humanity,
      just as the bathroom was a common resource for the four of us in
      college.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; ...</strong><strong><br>
      </strong><br>
      Is there a solution? Of course there is. It's a simple solution. To
      respect our common interest in our planet's resources, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">those who <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">take </span>or <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">monopolize </span>or <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">pollute </span>more than their
      fair share of our planet should compensate those of us who they are
      taking from.</span></small>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Beck_PP.html">What The
        Polluter Pays Principle
        Implies</a><br>
        </span><small><br>
        Dinner has ended. Over a cup of tea, Sara is talking with Vernon:<br>
        <br>
"... and so those new policies are justified because of the Polluter
        Pays Principle."<br>
        <br>
        Vernon says, "Tell me one more time, what the Polluter Pays Principle
        is."<br>
        <br>
        Sara replies, "The polluter is responsible for the environmental and
        economic effects of his or her polluting activities. That's all. For
        instance, if you pollute a river and someone downstream gets
        lower-quality water, or must buy more expensive water as a result, you
        owe compensation to them. It's obvious."<br>
        <br>
        But Vernon says, "It is not obvious to me. I do not agree with the
        Polluter Pays Principle. Why does it have to be the polluter's problem
        when he causes damage to the life or property or rights of others?
        Maybe it should be all the taxpayers' problem, or only the problem of
        people whose names start with the letter K."<br>
        <br>
        Now what is Sara supposed to do? What can you do, when somebody says
        they don't agree with something that seems obvious to
        you?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><small

 style="font-weight: bold;">The Three Keys to Containing Sprawl</span></a><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <small>The successful solution to sprawl is not some formula. Rather, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">succeeding
        against sprawl means having a variety of tools at your disposal, so
        that you can shape the best solution for your particular situation.</span><br>
        <br>
        I baked a birthday cake for my wife a few weeks ago. White cake, with
        pink icing. To serve it, I used a knife to cut the cake, then a sort of
        spatula to lift the slice of cake, then a fork to eat the cake. It was
        just a simple piece of cake, for crying out loud, but we used three
        tools to serve it. Three tools, just to control a piece of cake!<br>
        <br>
        Do you think that sprawl is less complex than a piece of cake? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Do
        you think that all sprawl is caused by one simple factor, has one set
        of characteristics, and always has the same solution? Of course not.
        There are lots of causes of sprawl, and lots of types of sprawl. Sprawl
        is more complicated than a piece of cake.</span><br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">So how many anti-sprawl tools do we
        need? We need as many as possible. Right now I am going to put three
        tools in your anti-sprawl toolkit. </span>They are three general
        tools, you can use them in many ways and in many combinations.<a
