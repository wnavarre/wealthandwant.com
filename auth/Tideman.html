Peace, Justice and Economic Reform</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
[one of the essential documents]<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a bumper sticker that
says, "If you want peace, then work
for justice." At a superficial level, this simple slogan contains an
important half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound
half-truth. To understand these half-truths and why they are only
half true, we need to know what peace is, what justice is, and we
need to understand the relationship between the two. So in this talk
I want to explore the meanings of peace and justice, their
relationship, and the role of economic reform in attaining both.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"If you want peace, then work for
justice." The more obvious and
superficial meaning of this slogan is that people who are treated
unjustly will prevent the attainment of peace until the wrongs to
which they are subject are righted. Demonstrators shout: "No justice.
No peace." The apparent meaning of peace in this case is tranquility,
the absence of strife. And if this meaning of peace is accepted, the
slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as long as people
have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only half
true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really
is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is more than armistice, more
than the cessation of violence.
Peace is unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all
pleased to cooperate with one another. When we have attained true
peace, there will be no person who has any purpose that any other
person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world, everyone will feel the
truth of John Donne's meditation,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>No man is an Island
entire of itself; every man is a
piece of the Continent; a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by
the sea, Europe is the less, and well as if a promontory were, as well
as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death
diminishes me because I am involved in Mankind; therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee</i>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[1]</span></small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it imaginable that we might
ever attain a world where everyone
felt so? And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that
world? What is justice? <br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are so many conflicting,
strident claims for different
conceptions of justice that a person might reasonably despair of ever
finding a meaning of justice that people would agree upon. Any
conception of justice may seem to be no more than one person's
opinion. And yet there are things that we all know about justice. If
I tell you that I stand before you as justice, you know that across
my face you will find -- a blindfold. In my left hand I hold aloft -- a
pair of scales. You know that in my right hand I have -- a sword that I
will use if necessary. And my gender is female.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The blindfold, the scales, the
sword, and the feminine gender.
These features of the traditional symbol tell us much about justice.
The blindfold might seem out of place, since it prevents justice from
either seeing what the scales say or wielding the sword effectively.
But we know that the blindfold has a distinct and essential meaning.
The blindfold ensures that justice will not be swayed by any visible
characteristics of those who plead before her. Justice is not
concerned with whether you are black or white, short or tall,
beautiful or ugly. Every person receives the same treatment from
justice. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The scales have at least two
possible interpretations. ... </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And then the sword. The sword
represents the fact that justice is
prepared to use the threat of force, and force itself, to see that
her decrees are carried out. ... </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus if we know that justice is
the blindfolded woman with the
scales and the sword, then we know that justice is the principles of
equality and evenhandedness that command and prohibit the use of
force in resolving conflicts.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider what this tells us. It
tells us first that if we wish to
claim that justice authorizes the force we wish to use, or that
justice forbids the force that others wish to use against us, then we
must be able to show that our claim is consistent with equality and
evenhandedness. ...</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Second, the blindfold tells us
that we are not in the realm of
justice if the principles we offer to explain why our use of force is
justified are of the form, "Because I am better than you," or
Hitler's, "Because Aryans are better than Jews." Justice compels us
to acknowledge the equality of all persons. Claims of individual or
group supremacy cannot be accepted by justice.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Third, not only are all persons
equal in the blindfolded eyes of
justice, but their different goals in life all deserve equal respect.
... <br>
<br>
Even the utilitarian proposal that conflicting claims should be
settled in the way that yields the greatest possible utility must be
rejected as an elitist imposition of a particular goal on people who
may have other plans. If I choose to pursue a life that can be
guaranteed to lead to depression and despair, I have as much claim to
the protection of justice in that pursuit as if I choose the path
that leads to bliss. Justice must be neutral in its evaluation of
people and their goals. ...<br>
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we commit ourselves to
neutrality, does that provide a unique
definition of justice? No, it doesn't. There are a number of
definitions of justice that might claim to satisfy neutrality,
although the claims of some definitions are dubious, and other
definitions can be rejected on other grounds.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider first the conservative
claim that justice is defined by
traditional rules.&nbsp; ...<br>
<br>
Next, consider the claim that justice is defined by what the
majority wants. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarian </span>says,
"If you want to know who
should prevail in a conflict, take a vote." As appealing as
majoritarianism may be on the surface, it cannot provide a coherent
theory of justice. ...<br>
<br>
If voting cannot be used to define justice, one might entertain
the possibility of using a contractarian formulation: What is just is
the rules to which people would have agreed if they did not know
their personal circumstances.&nbsp; ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a reasonable recipe for
implementing the Golden Rule and a
fine idea for seeking agreement about the principles by which
complaints shall be judged. If people were to follow this suggestion
and achieve the agreement that is described, they would achieve
fairness.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, this does not make
Rawls's suggestion a good way to
identify justice.&nbsp; ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, consider <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>. The egalitarian says
that justice
is equality. There is a conceptual difficulty in specifying how
beings as different from each other as humans are could ever be
equal, unless we create a society where all humans are female clones
of one another. (This should be technologically feasible within a few
decades, if it is not already.) But I do not think that egalitarians
want a society of clones. ... </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Rawls has proposed that the
talents that individuals possess
be regarded as a common pool, so that anyone who has more than his
share has an obligation to compensate those who have less then their
shares.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All of these suggestions should be
rejected. Talents are not a
common pool from which some persons have taken more then their
shares. If we are all fishing in the same pond, the quantity of fish
that you take will diminish the quantity that is available to me. But
the quantity of talent that you have in no way diminishes the
quantity that is available to me. Your talent is not acquired at my
expense.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the perspective of peace, no
man is an island; each of us is
a part of mankind. And any of us who has been graced with an extra
measure of talent should recognize that, often, the best use of our
talent is to provide for others. Nevertheless, from the perspective
of justice, each of us must be allowed to act like an island if he
wishes. .</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose that a bone-marrow
transplant from me would save your
life--or at least prolong it. ...<br>
If you do not mind requiring a bone-marrow transplant of me, then
what about a kidney? ... <br>
If you do not mind requiring me to donate a kidney, then what
about my heart?&nbsp; ...<br>
<br>
A good egalitarian should require me to part with the one available
heart after I have had my share of years.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I don't think you would. I
don't think anyone would. We are
not egalitarians. We recognize the sanctity of the boundaries of the
human body. In a peaceful world I will gladly give a spare kidney to
anyone who needs it. But in a just world, no one will forcefully
extract a kidney from me, even to save someone else's life. Justice
is not egalitarianism.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just as I own my kidneys, so do
I own my talents. In a peaceful
world I will use them for the benefit of all mankind. But the sword
of justice should not be used to force me to compensate those with
less talent. Nor should it be used to force me to abide by the
insurance contract that you believe I would have signed, if I had had
the chance, before I knew what talents I would have. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A proper definition of justice
begins with the principles of
classical liberalism. In a just world each person is permitted to
determine the purposes to which his or her body is put--the hands and
the brain no less than the kidneys. We each have rights of
self-determination. This includes the right of ownership of what we
produce, at least, as John Locke said, when we leave as much in
natural opportunities for others as we appropriate for our own
productive activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have the right to co-operate
with whom we choose for whatever
mutually agreed purposes we choose. Thus we have the right to trade
with others, without any artificial hindrances, and we have the right
to keep any wages or interest that we receive from such trading.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the classical
liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">how
are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke qualified his
statement that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span> Locke does
not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.
One tradition in classical liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "</small>"&nbsp; ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>," as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any excess
in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental
problems with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land.&nbsp; ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you."&nbsp; ... <br>
<br>
Justice is thus a regime in which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Getting back to where we started,
is it true that, "If you want
peace-- real peace--you should work for justice?" and if so why?
Well, it's half true. To see why, consider what peace is, and how one
might create it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is unity and harmony. Peace
is people recognizing that we
are all parts of one another, that it is always for ourselves that
the bell tolls.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What keeps us from attaining
peace? One of the greatest hindrances
to the attainment of peace -- real peace -- is that resistance that so
many of us feel to tolerating oppression and injustice. When we know
that we, or others we care for, have been treated unjustly, it is
ever so difficult to attain a state of unity and harmony with others.
The leap to peace is so much easier from a position of justice. So,
even though peace and justice are very disparate things, and peace is
much the more attractive one, still it make sense, if you want to
help people reach peace, to work for justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the reason that this is only
half true is that, in fact,
justice is not actually necessary to your attainment of peace. If you
want peace for yourself, you can have it, at any time, in any
circumstances in which you find yourself. Whether you are treated
justly or not, you are a part of the being that is all humanity. Each
person's joy is your joy. Each person's grief is your grief. You
don't have to wait until you are treated justly to see this.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So if you want a peace for others,
then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But if you want peace for
yourself, simply have it.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p><a href="../docs/Tideman_ABOER.html">A Bill of Economic Rights and
Obligations</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Preamble</b>
</small><br>
<small>Our nation was founded on the idea that we are all created
equal,
that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights,
and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In living, expressing our liberty,
and pursuing happiness we
sometimes conflict with one another, so we need a shared
understanding of the extent of the sphere of equal rights given to
every person, and beyond that sphere our obligation to respect the
rights of others. This Bill is concerned with the economic aspects of
these rights and obligations. ...&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Tideman_ABOER.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Read
the entire article</span></a></small></p>
<a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html">The Political Economy of the
Gospels</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>The message of the Gospels is that our sins are forgivable,
that
death is not to be feared because our true lives are spiritual rather
than physical, and that participation in the kingdom of God -- a new
and better life in this world as well as the next -- is accessible to
all who orient themselves to God.</small></p>
<p><small>Drawing on the Old Testament, Jesus taught that our first
commandment is that we love God with all our heart, and all our soul,
and all our mind, and all our strength, and that our second
commandment is that we love our neighbor as
ourselves.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font> When
asked who our
neighbor is, he replied with the parable of the good Samaritan,
implying that anyone we encounter is our neighbor.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font> Jesus taught an
ethic in which
there are no bounds on our obligations to others:&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span></span></small></p>
<p><small>When asked by Peter, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" Jesus replied, "I say not
unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."&nbsp; In
other words, we are to
forgive indefinitely.</small></p>
<p><small>This unbounded obligation to others is reconciled with the
need to
survive through the introduction of the idea that it is not through
our own anxious efforts, but through God's provision for us that we
survive: ... </small></p>
<p><small>The message of the Gospels denies the validity of concern for
material scarcity. This is made particularly clear in the accounts of
the feeding of the multitudes with just a few loaves and
fishes.</small></p>
<p><small>comprehending this counterintuitive idea, that material
scarcity
is not to concern us, is brought out by the accounts of how even
Jesus' disciples did not understand the message:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... </i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p><small>Without a concept of material scarcity it is difficult to
construct an economic theory, as material scarcity is central to
economic theory. And yet, even without a concept of material scarcity
there is an allocation problem to be solved--the allocation of our
efforts.</small></p>
<p><small>In the parable of the talents we are told that we will be
expected
to accomplish something with the resources that are put into our
hands. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>8</i></b></small></font> This
parable is
followed in Matthew by a teaching that may be taken as an indication
of what constitutes accomplishment:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... </i></b></small></font></small><small></small></p>
<p><small>In other words, every person is a manifestation of God, and
anything that we can do to help anyone is to our credit.</small></p>
<small>There is thus an unlimited task for each of us. No one of us
will
ever be able to say, "I have done every last thing that might be
required of me. I have no further obligations." But neither are we to
be concerned that that which we have left undone might be held
against us. For if we refrain from judging others, we ourselves will
not be judged:&nbsp; ...<br>
</small>
<p><small>With this message of the Gospels in mind, turn now to the
problem
of political economy, the problem of what principles ought to govern
the organization of the production of goods and their
distribution.</small></p>
<p><small>One might first ask whether the requirement that we abandon
concern for scarcity would preclude production. The answer is no, it
is not production that we are cautioned to avoid, but anxiety. There
are any number of reasons why we might allocate some of our time to
production, without being anxious about our own material
requirements. We feel called to undertake a particular kind of work,
so we do it, trusting that any material needs we may have will be
satisfied. If we want to undertake our productive activities in
conjunction with others, that's fine, too. Associating with others
provides us with opportunities to be useful to them.</small></p>
<p><small>Among those who are close to us there is no need for prices
and
markets, because we can see easily enough how we can be of service to
them. But human discernment is limited, and prices and markets help
us to be aware of what is valued by people who are less close to
us. ... </small></p>
<p><small>Refraining from the use of force is a recurring theme in the
political economy of the Gospels. We are called to refrain from the
use of force in defense of property. We are called to refrain from
the use of force in financing public activities. We are called to
refrain from the use of force in providing for those who might
otherwise lack. And we show our love for those who do not wish to
participate in our political economy by leaving for them the same per
capita value of land and natural resources that we claim for
ourselves.</small></p>
<p><small>Consider now how this framework bears on some traditional
questions of economic ethics. Take first the problem of the just
price. This simply is not an issue. If two people have the
opportunity to trade--to cooperate--on terms that are mutually
agreeable to the two of them, it is not for us to say that they ought
to be trading on other terms. Between people who love one another,
the problem of settling on the terms of trade is no more difficult
than the problem when friends eat lunch together of deciding who will
pick up the tab, or how it will be split.</small></p>
<small>That those outside a relationship are not called upon to
prescribe
its terms is supported by a passage from
Luke: ... <br>
<br>
Relations between employers and employees are a special case of
relations between traders. ... <br>
The problem of worker management is not a problem either. ... <br>
</small>
<p><small>Corporate responsibility may be more of an issue for a
Gospel-based political economy. The corporate form of organization
permits us to participate in the establishment and management of
firms while knowing very little about the other people with whom we
are involved or the actions that are taken on our behalf. If this
leads us to support implicitly actions of managers in their concern
for the bottom line that we could not in good conscience take
ourselves, then there is something troubling about our participation
in corporations. We need to find ways of managing the resources under
our control that do not lead us to endorse implicitly and to profit
from actions that we would not endorse directly or take ourselves.
</small></p>
<p><small>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of
whether
capitalism or socialism is the more appropriate form of political
economy, is another non-question from the perspective of the Gospels.
Everyone who wants to live under socialism should be free to live
under socialism, and everyone who wants to live under capitalism
should be free to live under capitalism. In whichever group we fall,
we will want to insure that those who want to organize their lives by
different principles of political economy have their share of land
and natural resources with which to do so.</small></p>

  Henry George</a><br>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How would the world look if its
    political institutions were
    shaped by the conception of social justice advanced by Henry
    George?</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George was one of the most
    famous reformers of the late 19th
    century. Ever since the 1879 publication of his book, <b><i>Progress
    and Poverty</i></b>, his ideas have inspired people working for
    economic and social reform all around the world. He is most famous
    for proposing the abolition of all taxes except for a tax on the
    value of land. But I will argue that the single tax on land was not
    George's most important contribution, and that the power of his
    thinking can be best appreciated by focusing on the theory of social
    justice that he used to explain why a single tax on land is just.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>First I will argue that George's
    theory of social justice provides
    the dramatic climax as well as the logical foundation of
    <b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, I will discuss the functions
    of a theory of justice.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then I will address the question
    of what George's theory of social
    justice implies for relations among nations.</small></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Finally, I will ask what
    constitutes justice within nations, in a
    world where relations among nations are governed by George's theory
    of social justice.</small></p>

  <p>        <a href="../docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The Morality of Taxation:
      The Local Case</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;">
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From a moral perspective, taxation
          is dubious or worse. We tell
          our fellow citizens that if they do not pay taxes that we say they
          owe, their property will be seized or they will be sent to prison.
          Why do we treat people this way? Is there a justification?</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dubiousness of taxation
          increases when we consider its
          origins. Government seems to have originated as roving bandits who
          learned that total destruction was less profitable than protecting
          their victims from other bandits and allowing them to keep a fraction
          of what they produced (Olson, 1993). In time, scheduled partial
          plunder evolved into taxation. Over the centuries, regimes that
          started as tyrannies evolved into democracies. The public sector
          evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will of despots into a
          mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions. But public finance
          continues to rely on the power of tax collectors, developed under
          early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The wrath that
          citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the strongest
          antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a governmental
          institution. Why do we allow ourselves to do this to one another?</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a gentler side of
          taxation that provides some explanation
          of our tolerance of this coercion. Taxation can be the way that
          people achieve their common purposes. People may agree to be taxed so
          that there will be money to pay for public services that they want.
          From this perspective, taxation may be considered no more than the
          dues for belonging to a club that provides people with things that
          they would rather pay their share of than do without. However, to
          make this "voluntary exchange" theory of taxation relevant, people
          must be able to choose freely whether or not to "join the club," to
          be a citizen of the taxing jurisdiction. With all land claimed by
          some taxing jurisdiction, the choice isn't exactly free.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The problem of morality in
          taxation is the following: 
      </small></p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>How do we
          retain the possibility of people pooling their contributions to the
          cost of services that they agree are worthwhile, while eliminating
          the possibility of citizens treating their fellow citizens as targets
          of plunder? 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>What are the limits of obligations that we can justly
          impose on our fellow citizens? 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>And how do we set up a structure of
          government that will ensure that these limits are observed? ...
            </small></li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>we would probably have a much
          more efficient public sector if
          every public expenditure required two-thirds approval in legislative
          bodies.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But to make taxation truly
          voluntary, the option to leave must be
          viable. If people could move costlessly from one jurisdiction to
          another, taking all of their belongings with them, then competition
          among jurisdictions would tend to eliminate oppressive taxation. This
          would leave only the fees that people were prepared to pay to have
          public services (Tiebout, 1956).</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, moving will always have
          some costs, so the ideal will
          not be attainable. But what can be imagined is a system in which all
          taxes were local taxes. Then people would not have to move nearly as
          far to escape from taxes that they regarded as oppressive. Higher
          levels of government would not need to disappear; if the services
          that they provide are desired, they could be financed by levies on
          lower levels of government. ... </small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...Thus communities would not be
          able to raise much revenue from income
          tax or taxes on capital before they would drive residents and
          investment away. It might seem that there would be no way that
          localities could finance themselves.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Such a conclusion would be
          unwarranted, because <span style="font-weight: bold;">there is a very
          significant source of public revenue that can survive when localities
          compete for mobile residents. This source is land. When people are
          taxed in proportion to the land they possess</span>, no land moves to
          another locality where taxes are lower. Thus two questions arise:
          
</small></p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>Would taxes on land be sufficient to finance the public
          activities
          that ought to be undertaken, and 
            </small></li>
            <li><small>would such a system be fair?&nbsp; </small><small><a

          <small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
          <small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
          a case
          for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
          logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclu&shy;sions
          follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
          principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
          the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
          one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
          is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
          important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
          efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
          because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
          for taxing land has two main parts. ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
          on land
          would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
          report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
          shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
          in the Appendix.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
          taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; ... </small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
          reasons
          why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
          world peace.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
          argument for
          taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
          offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
          rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
          price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
          land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
          increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
          become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
          land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
          on
          land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
          the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
          erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
          because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
          collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
          <small>.</small><br>
          <small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
          that the
          return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
          rent.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
          what land
          is. ... </small><small><a style="font-weight: bold;"

          <small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
          <small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
          and for reasons of economic
          efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
          programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
          terms of social justice is
          founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
          absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
          and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
          economic development and government expenditures should be collected
          by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
          is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
          resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
          institutions capable of implementing a
          recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
          basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
          implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
          heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
          nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
          all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
          are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
          rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
          unimproved condition.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
          terms of economic efficiency is
          founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
          human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
          does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
          revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
          government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
          frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
          as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
          sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
          greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
          productivity.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
          the amount of tax that is due
          cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
          taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
          They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
          are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
          fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
          worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
          resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
          levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
          And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
          the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
          more detail these social justice
          and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
          for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
          potential objections are without merit.</small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The idea
          that the benefits of land, which no one produced, can be directed to
          a privileged few has no basis in justice. It is as anachronistic as a
          property qualification for voting. The gift of nature should justly
          be regarded as the common heritage of all citizens.</small><small>A
          substantial part of the value of land is not the gift of nature
          but rather the result of economic growth and the provision of public
          services. This increase in the value of land above its value in a
          natural condition is the product of economic development and
          government activity, and should justly be regarded as the natural
          source of income for financing the activities that generate the
          increase in the value of land.&nbsp; ... <a

          Conclusion</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When economists think about the
          contribution that land value
          taxation might make to economic performance, they are likely to think
          in terms of property tax reform. If taxes on structures are reduced
          or eliminated, one can expect that more structures will be built, and
          cities will be taller, more compact and more
          efficient.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font> But
          more efficient
          cities are only the beginning of the contribution that land value
          taxation can make to improving economic performance. Land value
          taxation generalizes into the principle that people should pay for
          all of their appropriations of natural opportunities, according to
          the opportunity costs of those appropriations, and the resulting
          revenue should be shared equally. There are important applications of
          this principle to questions of environmental protection, relieving
          congestion, efficient resource use, population growth, and general
          economic growth. This paper discusses these more varied applications
          of the generalized principle of land value taxation. ...</small></p>

          parameters such as the
          ones

          of the rent of land were taxed. Here are the results:

          plausible ranges of

          taxation, without reducing total government revenue.</small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Conclusion</b></small>
          <br>
          <small>Land value taxation generalizes to the principle that all
          persons
          have equal rights to natural opportunities and should therefore pay
          for their above-average appropriations of natural opportunities. This
          principle has the potential to contribute to the efficiency and
          fairness with which a wide variety of economic problems are handled.
          This paper considers in particular applications to pollution,
          congestion, use of scarce natural resources, and population growth.
          The revenue raised by managing these issues efficiently, as well as
          by the more traditional application of land value taxation, permits
          the removal of taxes on labor and capital, with the potential to
          unleash a tremendous increase in economic growth and consequent
          improvement in human welfare. ... <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

      <a href="../docs/Tideman_Changing.html">Being Just While Conceptions of
      Justice are Changing</a><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A conception of justice is a
          framework for resolving questions of what liberties people ought to
          have. The smooth functioning of society requires substantial consensus
          about conceptions of justice, because without such consensus, people
          will take actions and make claims on resources that others regard as
          intrusions upon what is properly theirs. This can be expected to lead,
          at a minimum, to disharmony and possibly to violent conflict. On the
          other hand, when people agree on a conception of justice and who is
          competent to interpret it, conflicts will be less likely to arise, and
          those that do arise can be settled more easily. Thus there is strong
          impetus toward stability in any society's conception of justice: Any
          doubts about a shared conception of justice may be suppressed or hidden
          to preserve the advantages of consensus.</small><br>
          <small>Moral evolution, however, can require conceptions of justice to
          change, as when the world came to recognize that slavery could not be
          just, or that women must be accorded the same civil rights as men.
          When, as with the abolition of slavery, a new conception of justice
          entails the elimination of the sale value of what had previously been
          assets, there will be calls for compensation, on the ground that, as
          provided in the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the U.S.
          Constitution, governments should not take property without
          compensation. ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The paper argues that there are a variety of factors that
          attenuate claims for compensation and make a justifiable system of
          compensation so complex that it may be unworkable. But if there is to
          be a system of compensation, the one justifiable source of funds to
          finance it is assets that have been acquired by appropriating or buying
          land and then selling it. ...</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The issue of compensation will be examined by considering some
          idealized cases, identifying the principles they exhibit, and then
          asking how those principles apply to the circumstances in which modern
          societies are likely to find themselves. ... </small><br>
          <small><b>Case 1</b>. A republic of the former
          Soviet Union privatizes land by selling it to the highest bidders ... </small><br>
          <small><b>Case 2.</b> There is an agricultural
          society that has been using a rule that whoever plants on land first
          in any year owns the harvest of that land that year.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
          <small><b>Case 3.</b> This is a variation on Case
          2. First the land is divided equally among existing families, with an
          understanding that land rights will be tradable.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
          <small><b>Case 4.</b> There is an agricultural society in which land is
          initially redivided equally each year among all adults. ...</small><br>
          <small><b>Case 5.</b> Land has been privately owned and rather equally
          distributed since time immemorial. One day people suddenly realize
          that land should be regarded as the heritage of all citizens. ...</small><br>
          <small><b>Case 6. </b>This is a variation on case
          5, where the recognition that equal access to land should be a
          birthright occurs gradually, over decades ... </small><br>
          <small><b>Case 7.</b> This is a variation on case
          6, where there are initially substantial taxes on labor and capital.
          ...</small><br>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Having considered these seven
          idealized cases, one can now
          summarize the principles they embody</b>. </small></p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>Case 1 and 2 both embody the principle that when a mistake
          in social rules is corrected, it is reasonable to require people to
          relinquish the expectations that the mistaken rules gave them. In one
          case this implied that compensation for the loss of sale value of land
          titles should be provided, in the other case that it should not be
          provided. </small></li>
            <li><small>Case 3 embodies the principle that it is sometimes
          appropriate to restructure past private transactions on the basis of
          new understandings of the requirements of justice. </small></li>
            <li><small>Case 4 embodies the principle that the perpetrators of
          injustice and their heirs are particularly responsible for providing
          compensation when the claims they appropriated are overturned. </small></li>
            <li><small>Case 5 embodies three principles: </small>
              <ul>
                <li><small>first, that there can be circumstances in which the
          costs of a new moral understanding must be left where they fall,
          because there is no one to whom they can properly be shifted; </small></li>
                <li><small>second, that compensation financed by taxation should
          be supported by a finding that those who are taxed are, as a class,
          particularly responsible for, or have been beneficiaries of, the
          discredited understanding; </small></li>
                <li><small>third, that if compensation is provided, a person's
          past gains from the discredited understanding offset claims for losses
          from the new understanding. </small></li>
              </ul>
            <small> </small></li>
            <li><small>Case 6 embodies the principle that public moral debate
          puts people on notice that a future political decision might eliminate
          the value of their acquisitions without compensation. </small></li>
            <li><small>Case 7 embodies the principle that if compensation is
          provided, a person's past benefits from the new understanding offset
          claims for losses from the new understanding.</small></li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One can now ask what lessons
          these principles hold for the
          situations in which actual societies are likely to find

      <a href="../docs/Tideman_PEME.html">The Constitutional
      Conflict Between Protecting
      Expectations and Moral Evolution</a><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Constitutions must be amendable,
          to allow for the possibility of incorporating new moral insights into
          them. This impinges on the protection of expectations, including those
          regarded as property. Protection of property rights is achieved by
          constitutional restrictions on the ability of voters and legislators to
          reduce the value of property by regulation, taxation or expropriation.
          But such restrictions also prevent voters and legislatures from
          reflecting new moral insights in legislation, if those insights would
          reduce the value of property. There have been times in the past when
          moral development has compelled societies to change laws in ways that
          reduced the value of property (e.g., elimination of slavery). We cannot
          guarantee that there will be no future advances in our moral evolution
          that would require similar changes in laws, reducing or eliminating the
          value of what we now consider property. Looking forward to the
          possibility of such moral advances, we should design constitutions that
          permit amendments to reflect new moral insights, while prohibiting
          legislators (or voters in referenda) from passing laws that
          redistribute in ways not explicitly sanctioned by the constitution.</small></div>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Humanity is emerging from eons
          of development during which
          survival has been promoted both by the ability to grab resources from
          others and by the ability of groups to cooperate and share natural
          resources within communities that occupied territorial homelands. In
          recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that taking from
          the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social order that
          prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out how to do
          it.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some people think of preventing
          grabbing in terms of preserving
          the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</small></p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that
          were acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status
          quo commits us to defending the indefensible.</small></li>
            <li><small>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before
          which unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and
          after which they are reversed.</small></li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A practice of allowing an
          appropriation to be treated as just if
          it has survived long enough gives aggressors an incentive to see if
          they can grab and hold on long enough. The result is actions like
          Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Only
          if we have a standard of justice that is independent of history can
          we expect to end such actions.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George's theory of economic
          justice--that every person has a
          right to his or her productive powers, and that all persons have
          equal rights to all natural opportunities--provides a simple formula
          around which opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can
          coalesce.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This may seem hopelessly
          optimistic. But no other theory that I
          have seen has anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this
          theory. ...

      or other species, the propriety of those actions is a moral question.
      But when, either because of limited resources or because of
      conflicting purposes, people cannot do all that they wish to protect
      the environment, then environmental protection is a matter of
      economics as well as morality.</small>
      <p><small>Harm to humans differs from harm to other species, for three
          reasons. </small></p>
      <ul>
            <li><small>First, we recognize greater obligations to humans than to
          other species. We recognize obligations to each human individual, while
          our obligations to other species tend to be seen as obligations to the
          species as a whole. </small></li>
            <li><small>Second, because of the possibility of communication with
          humans through language, we can have information about the adequacy of
          compensation to humans in a way not possible when seeking to compensate
          other species. </small></li>
            <li><small>Third, humans are ordinarily concerned with the well-being
          of other species, not just because other species are required for the
          advancement of their selfish interests, but also because humans
          acknowledge an obligation to all species for their own sakes. Thus any
          harm to other species is a harm to humans as well, while we ordinarily
          do not think of other species as being harmed by harm to humans. </small></li>
      </ul>
      <p><small>As beings with awareness of right and wrong, humans have
          potential
          moral obligations to all species. There are at least three types of
          effort to protect other species that a person can make out of his own
          moral convictions, while asserting at most a minimal right to impose
          his morality on others. For each type of effort, two levels can be
          identified:</small></p>
      <blockquote><small>1. He can adopt personal rules of conduct. He can
          apply these rules first to his own direct conduct, and then to others,
          as a condition for cooperating with them, as through trade. </small>
            <p><small>2. He can engage in moral dialogue with others, seeking to
          persuade them to voluntarily adopt his practices of respect for other
          species, first with respect to their own conduct, and then as a
          condition for cooperating with others.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>3. He can persuade his community to adopt a standard of
          behavior that will be required of members of the community. Anyone with
          a contrary opinion can join another community. In this way, for
          example, communities outlaw cock fights. Because there are always some
          costs of relocating, there will be some harm to those who disagree.
          Such standards are least likely to infringe on the rights of dissenting
          individuals when they are most local. At the second level, a person can
          persuade his community to require a standard of behavior of its trading
          partners. Such action is likely to be most persuasive when the
          proscribed action is directly related to a traded commodity, as when
          the Unites States outlawed the importation of tuna caught with nets
          that killed large numbers of dolphins.</small></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><small>In the absence of perfect universal divine revelation, it is
          virtually inevitable that people will disagree about the extent of
          their obligations to other species. Thus, in addition to seeking a
          common understanding of our obligations to other species, we must
          seek ways to justly accommodate disagreements about these
          obligations. This is where theories of economic justice enter.</small></p>
      <p><small>In addition to the efforts listed above, which a person can
          pursue
          on the basis of personal moral conviction, with almost no
          interference with the rights of others who do not share his moral
          conviction, a person can also advance a theory of justice that
          permits him to limit the harm to nature that others cause. In my
          view, the best basis for claiming a right to limit the harm that
          others do to nature is a classical liberal theory of justice, similar
          to that developed by Henry George in <b><i><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and
          Poverty</a></i></b> (1879) or by Bruce Ackerman in <b><i>Social Justice
          in the Liberal State</i></b> (1980). A classical liberal theory of
          justice recognizes the rights of all persons to equal shares of
          natural opportunities (that is, everything outside of human beings
          and the value created by human effort) and the right of each
          individual to pursue his personal conception of the good. Thus under
          a classical liberal theory of justice, any individual can assert a
          right to protect his share of the environment.</small></p>
      <p><small>The idea that all natural opportunities belong equally to all
          humanity is a radical idea with profound implications for many areas
          of human activity, from public finance without coercive taxes to
          world peace to the meaning of human freedom. The management of the
          environment under such a liberal theory, with each person potentially
          having a different conception of the protection that other species
          deserve, provides a challenge for economic theory but not an
          insurmountable one.</small></p>
      <p><small>Consider, for example, the protection of whales. If whales
          are not
          persons (which they might become if we found ourselves in moral
          dialogue with them), then hunting whales may be allowed but limited,
          either because some humans wish to exercise their rights to nature by
          protecting whales, or because a reduction in the number of whales
          impoverishes the world for this generation and for future
          generations. If the fraction <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">f</span> of the world's
          population wishes to
          protect whales, then that fraction of whales is off limits to whale
          hunters. For the fraction of whales that may be hunted, if hunting
          causes a loss to other potential hunters in this generation, then
          those who kill whales should be charged a fee for the economic losses
          that their behavior causes, with the proceeds shared equally among
          all potential hunters. If the level of hunting is so great as to
          cause the number of whales per capita that are available to the next
          generation of humans to fall below the number available to this
          generation, then the hunting fee should be the larger of the value of
          the loss to other potential hunters in this generation and the value
          of the loss of environmental quality to the next generation.</small></p>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">...<small><b> <a href="Vickrey.html">Prof. Vickrey</a></b> wrote a
          book in the 1940s, suggesting
          that instead of having just an income tax, it would be sensible for a
          country to use a combination of an income tax, a consumption tax and
          a wealth tax. One of his suggestions was for a system of lifetime
          income averaging. Instead of paying a tax each year on that year's
          income, one would add this year's income to the sum of previous
          years' incomes, divide by the number of years to get average income,
          compute the tax on that amount of income, multiply by the number of
          years to get the total tax, and finally subtract the total of taxes
          paid in previous year to get the tax owed this year. Prof. Vickrey
          was also renown for his suggestions of <span style="font-weight: bold;">public
          pricing schemes</span> that
          more closely approximated marginal social costs. He may have been the
          first advocate of the practice of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">airlines
          of seeking (paid)
          volunteers to wait for the next flight</span>, instead of bumping the
          last
          persons to arrive. He was an early advocate of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">peak-load pricing</span> for
          electricity, public transit, bridges, tunnels, and for city streets!
          He estimated that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">social cost of
          an hour of driving in Manhattan
          at busy times</span> (taking account of the value of the time of all
          the
          people who were slowed down by the presence of one more car on the
          streets) was $20,000! He did not want to charge people this much; he
          felt that a price of $20 to $50 per hour for driving in Manhattan
          would probably have brought the amount of driving down to where the
          benefit matched the cost. Prof. Vickrey was most famous in recent
          years for a 1961 paper that went virtually unnoticed for the first
          dozen or so years after it was published, but then came to be seen as
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">the foundation of the theory of
          efficient auctions</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In
          this paper,
          Prof. Vickrey introduced the idea of an auction in which each person
          makes just one bid, the item is sold to the person who makes the
          highest bid, but that person is only required to pay the
          second-highest bid. The characteristic of such an auction that has
          fascinated economists is that, with such a rule, it is in the
          interest of every bidder to bid exactly what the item is worth to him
          or her.</span></small></div>

          <small>Taxation began as extortion by conquerors. Over the centuries,
          regimes that started as tyrannies have evolved into democracies. The
          public sector has evolved from an apparatus for implementing the will
          of despots into a mechanism for carrying out democratic decisions.
          But public finance continues to rely on the power of tax collectors,
          developed under early tyrants, to coerce citizen to pay taxes. The
          wrath that citizens feel toward tax collectors is probably the
          strongest antagonistic feeling that citizens have toward a
          governmental institution. Nevertheless, few economists question the
          need for continued reliance on coercion to collect public revenues in
          democracies.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How do we justify coercion?
          Legislators and bureaucrats who devise
          coercive tax collection rarely bother to address the question. Nor do
          interest groups that promote expansions of the public sector, with
          their inevitable accompaniment of higher coercively collected taxes.
          Thus coercive tax collection has every appearance of a power play
          against the weak by those who have the strength to get away with
          it.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We need to reexamine our
          acceptance of coercion in public finance.
          If we are going to continue to rely on coercion, we need to develop a
          consensus about the framework that justifies it.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This paper begins with a
          definition of justice and a taxonomy of
          theories that might be used to justify coercion in public finance. I
          argue that theories based on Conservatism, Contractarianism,
          Utilitarianism, or Libertarianism all have value in some
          circumstances, but not for justifying the use of power to extract
          resources from people. None of these theories are consistent with
          what we ought to understand justice to be, because they do not accept
          the equal standing of all persons in defining what is good. A theory
          of justice that does accept the equal standing of all persons in
          defining what is good is Liberalism as elucidated by Bruce Ackerman
          (1980).</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To oblige people to pay taxes
          while satisfying the limitations
          that Liberalism sets on the use of power, three conditions must be
          met:</small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. People must be free to
          emigrate to any jurisdiction that will
          accept them.
          <br>
          2. If the fraction of natural opportunities claimed by a
          jurisdiction exceeds the fraction of population in the jurisdiction,
          the jurisdiction must compensate those who would otherwise be
          accorded smaller-than-average shares of natural opportunities.
          <br>
          3. Sub-units of jurisdictions must be allowed to secede, provided
          that they are willing to pay appropriate costs. <br>
      </small></div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
          <small><b>What is Justice?</b></small></div>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Begin with what justice is not.
          Justice is the antithesis of
          might-makes-right. A powerful person might say, "This is just because
          I say it is just, and if you voice any disagreement I will silence
          you," and he might have the power to make his threat stick. However,
          he would be misusing language.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Justice
          entails the recognition by those who have power that the
          use of power ought to be constrained by principles whose relevance
          does not depend on the views of those with power. </span>...&nbsp; <a

      Renewal of Rural Society: The Self-Financing Model</a><br>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>there is a way of raising
          revenue for local public
          services that does not have these disadvantages. That way is to use a
          combination of fees for services and public collection of the rent of
          land.</b></small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The rent of land is the amount
          of money that would be bid for
          the use of land in an auction.</b> It can be thought of as 100 rubles
          more than the second-highest bid, that is, the amount of money that
          the person for whom the use of land is most valuable must bid to
          outbid the person who places the second-highest value on it.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What land is worth to a person who
          wants to use it depends on the
          length of time for which he will be allowed to use it. For the
          purpose of defining rent, this length of time should be indefinitely
          long, but with provision for revising the rent as market conditions
          change. In other words, if similar land rents for 20% more three
          years from now, then the person who secures the use of a site this
          year would be required to pay that additional 20% at that time.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rent of land also depends on
          the condition of the land. The
          rent of land is what people would bid for unimproved land. In a town,
          unimproved land is land without any structures on it. In an
          agricultural area, many things other than structures can count as
          improvements--drainage, stone removal, fertilization, leveling, etc.
          It might be hard to find agricultural land that had no such
          improvements. Thus in agricultural areas, one must subtract something
          from observed payments for the use of land, to account for the value
          that is being paid for such improvements.</small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The comments above describe how
          one might observe the rental value
          of land. Economics can also say something about how a bidder would
          decide how much to bid. A bidder would decide how he could use the
          land most profitably, compute the net revenue from the most
          profitable use after all costs including the cost of his own
          entrepreneurial effort and a premium for the risk to his finances,
          and what was left would be the total rent of the land for the period
          of the investment. The bidder would then estimate future rent,
          subtract that from the total rent, and what was left would be rent
          for the current period. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Fundamental tax reform is on the
          agenda these days. There are a
          variety of proposals for a flatter federal income tax. There are
          proposals to replace the federal income tax with a national sales
          tax. I would like to suggest that <span style="font-weight: bold;">discussion
          of fundamental tax
          reform should be preceded by a discussion of what constitutes a good
          system of taxing and spending. When principles of good taxing and
          spending have been examined, what emerges as attractive is greater
          reliance on local decision-making and, for federal revenue, an
          allocation of financial obligation to states rather than direct
          federal taxation of individuals or corporations. ... </span></small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">On the basis of the arguments
          given, I reject conservatism,
          majoritarianism, egalitarianism, contractarianism, and elitism as
          justifications for coercive taxing and spending.</span> A framework for
          just
          social arrangements that does make sense to me is classical
          liberalism, which asserts that it is just to coerce people to accord
          others the maximum individual liberty that all can have. This means
          that people have rights to their bodies, their talents, the products
          of their labor, and the returns to their savings. Anything produced
          by human effort belong to the producer, or to the producer's
          successor in title through gift and exchange. </small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The principle of maximum
          individual liberty does not address the
          question of how the rights to natural opportunities (land, water,
          ocean fish, minerals, the frequency spectrum, etc.) should be
          assigned.</span> There are at least three approaches within the
          classical
          liberal tradition as to how these returns should be divided.&nbsp; ...</small>  </div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The third position, which might be
          called "<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoliberalism</span>" emerges
          from the work of Henry George. This is the position that all persons
          have equal rights to natural opportunities, which rights should be
          secured by having the public treasury collect the rental value of
          exclusive access to land and other natural opportunities, with the
          revenue used for public purposes and guaranteed incomes.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of these three approaches, I find
          geoliberalism most attractive.
          It fits my sense of justice that all persons should have equal rights
          to natural opportunities. In addition, by providing funding for
          guaranteed incomes, geoliberalism offers a greater prospect for
          removing more of the distorting taxes that finance the welfare
          state. ...</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In
          collecting the rental value of land, governments will collect enough
          to pay for any worthwhile local public goods that they provide.
      </small></p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Under the
          conservative or homesteading libertarian versions of
          classical liberalism, the possessor of land might say, "This is my
          land. I didn't ask for these public goods. You have no right to tax
          me to pay for them." Under geoliberalism, on the other hand, the
          community can reply, "You have as much right to the use of land and
          other natural opportunities as anyone else. If you want to exercise
          your rights in this community, these are the taxes you must pay. If
          you don't like it, claim your share of natural opportunities
          somewhere else."</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If people are perfectly mobile and
          have an unlimited range of
          communities to choose among, then they cannot be exploited and need
          not tolerate inefficiency. They will move. Competing communities will
          find that the utility-maximizing public sector equilibrium involves
          providing all local public goods with benefits greater than costs,
          financing them by a combination of fees equal to marginal costs and
          taxes on the land that benefits from differential access to the local
          public goods. There will be no taxes on labor or capital except to
          internalize externalities. ... <br>
      </small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, we are very far from
          public acceptance of geoliberal
          principles. So <span style="font-weight: bold;">the question arises of
          what might be done within
          current political understandings to reduce inefficiency and
          exploitation in taxing and spending.</span> It is hard to know how much
          more
          than what is being done might be done. Let me be on the imaginative
          side.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There
          is a proposal that tax increases be allowed only with a
          two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress.</span> That has some
          merit,
          but it carries a risk of excessive deficits. It also allows the
          existing level of taxation to go unquestioned. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It would
          probably be
          better to have a rule that every spending proposal must be approved
          by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to be enacted.
          Maybe three-fourths. If spending is truly worthwhile, then, as
          Wicksell said, there is a way of financing it that will secure the
          approval of nearly everyone. ...</span></small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The current trend toward returning
          functions to the states is a
          step in the right direction. But it encounters understandable
          objections that poor states cannot afford to do what they ought to
          do. Some form of revenue sharing is needed. But it is important to
          have the right definition of which states are rich and which are
          poor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The level of well-being in a
          state is determined in part by the
          wisdom of its public policies. </span>States should not be penalized
          for
          adopting productive policies.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Revenue
          sharing should equalize per
          capita levels of natural opportunities (mineral revenues, fishing
          rights, pre-development land rents, etc.) </span>Replacing the
          personal and
          corporate income taxes with either a flat income tax or a national
          sales or value added tax would greatly reduce the excess burden of
          federal taxes. (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Excess burden is
          roughly proportional to the square
          of the typical marginal tax rate.</span>) But almost all the gains go
          to the
          rich. Perhaps the flat tax could be combined with a guaranteed
          income.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Even
          better than a flat tax or a national sales tax, in my view,
          would be a return to the revenue system that was apparently
          envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution in 1787. I mean a rule
          that the federal revenue requirement would be allocated to the states
          in proportion to their populations.</span> The use of population as the
          allocation device seems anachronistic in this era of concern for
          impoverished regions. But the allocation could be corrected by an
          expenditure that equalized per capita access to natural
          opportunities.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I see three important virtues in
          allocating the revenue obligation
          to the states.</small></p>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>First, it gets rid of the IRS
          and its intrusions. (A national sales or value added tax would do most
          of this, leaving only firms subject to the tax man's scrutiny.)</small><br>
          <small>Second, it requires the states to compete in seeking ways of
          raising revenue that do not reduce the productivity of their economies.
          The competitive equilibrium is to raise as much revenue as possible
          from charges for exclusive use of land and other natural opportunities,
          and to tax labor and capital only as a last resort.<br>
          </small><small>The third virtue is the likelihood that placing the
          revenue obligation on states rather than on individuals would lead to
          more careful scrutiny of the value of proposed expenditures.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With only fifty states and each
          state aware of exactly how much
          each spending proposal will cost its treasury, I believe that it
          would be much harder to secure approval for inefficient or
          special-interest spending..&nbsp; <a

      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The optimal timing of development
          is an important allocative
          function that can be either enhanced or degraded by the impact of
          land taxes on land speculation. This paper discusses four types of
          taxes on land: </small></p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small>taxes on the rental value of land, </small></li>
            <li><small>taxes on the sale value of land, </small></li>
            <li><small>taxes on realized income from land, and </small></li>
            <li><small>taxes on realized gains from the sale of land. </small></li>
      </ul>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All four taxes reduce
          incentives for speculation in land, which is
          generally beneficial. The third and fourth produce distortions with
          respect to incentives to develop land, while the first and second do
          not. All four taxes have some beneficial effect of mitigating
          imperfections in capital markets. All permit reduction or elimination
          of taxes with significant dead-weight losses, such as those on
          improvements. ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html"><span

          <small>Ackerman's Liberalism</small><br>
          <small>Secession as the Resolution of Moral Disagreement</small><br>
          <small>This paper argues that a liberal theory of the resolution of
          disagreements about the requirements of justice must include the
          possibility of secession. When such a possibility is allowed, it can
          be predicted that there will be changes not only in the character of
          disputes about the requirements of justice, but also in the patterns
          of taxes and public expenditures. There will be a greater propensity
          for seeing the other side's point of view in disputes about the
          requirements of justice, and a greater tendency to support public
          activities by efficient taxes on the beneficiaries of public
          expenditures.</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The paper begins with a discussion
          of the nature of moral truth,
          its relation to scientific truth, and the way in which moral
          knowledge grows. Next discussed is the difficulty of translating
          moral knowledge into social institutions, arising from the
          inevitability and impropriety of judging one's own cause. Ackerman's
"neutral dialogue" is endorsed as the most acceptable way of dealing
          with this difficulty. But I suggest that in dialogues regarding the
          requirements of justice there should be an understanding that one
          possible outcome of the dialogue is failure to agree on mutually
          acceptable conditions for being part of the same society, leading to
          a parting of the ways. The conditions under which such a parting
          would occur constitute the most fundamental question of justice. I
          suggest that Ackerman's proposed condition of equal sharing of the
          providence of nature (Ackerman's initial manna) among all generations
          constitutes an appropriate basis for parting if agreement should be
          impossible.</small></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I argue that such an understanding
          of the possibility of secession
          would provide a better framework for the growth of moral knowledge
          than when the politically successful are able to preclude experiments
          with alternative conceptions of justice. It would also reduce
          opportunities for the politically adroit to exploit the less adroit.
          If competition among societies for citizens resulted from the
          possibility of secession, the competitive equilibrium would include
          land value taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><small><span

      the former Soviet Union for how they might best move to a market
      economy.&nbsp; Here are some of the articles related to that
      opportunity:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="../docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">Using Tax Policy to Promote
      Urban Growth</a>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
          <p><small>Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes.
          In a
          market economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from
          four factors of production: </small></p>
          <ul>
            <li><small>the rent of land, </small></li>
            <li><small>the wages of labor, </small></li>
            <li><small>the interest received from owning capital, and </small></li>
            <li><small>the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing
          investments and organizing production). </small></li>
          </ul>
          <p><small>Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy
          must
          either increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and
          entrepreneurship that are used in a city or increase the payments
          that are made per unit of each factor, or both.</small></p>
          <p><small>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does
          so at
          the expense of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect
          to land, socially productive urban growth means adopting policies
          that raise the productivity of land. Labor, on the other hand, is
          reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
          springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities.
          Therefore, in a market economy, the payments that must be made to
          attract these factors are substantially outside the control of a
          city. Thus the growth of a city with respect to labor, capital and
          entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by making the city a place
          that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates of wages,
          interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
          market forces.</small></p>
          <p><small>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the
          earnings of labor, capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors
          away. A city that desires to grow should refrain from taxing wages,
          interest or profits and concentrate its taxes on land, which does not
          have the option of moving away. </small></p>
          <p><small>Certain other sources of public revenue, in addition to the
          rent
          of land, have the characteristic of not discouraging growth. These
          sources of revenue involve either charging people for using scarce
          opportunities that no one created, as with land, or charging people
          for the costs that their actions impose on others.</small></p>
          <p><small>A city that wishes to grow should confine its search for
          revenue
          to these sources. In this way it will attract more labor, capital and
          entrepreneurship, thereby raising the rent of land, which can be
          collected publicly without discouraging growth.</small></p>
          <p><small>Additions to the stock of capital are extremely important for
          urban growth, because of the impact of abundant capital on wages and
          rents. When capital is abundant, labor and land are more productive,
          and the more productive they are, the higher wages and rents are. ... </small></p>
          <small>... Every activity that is
          continued should pass a test of providing adequate value for money.
          Most of the worthwhile activities of local governments raise the
          rental value of the land in the vicinity of the activity by enough to
          pay a substantial fraction if not all of the costs of the activity.
          </small>
          <p><small>Thus the rental value of land is a natural first source of
          financing for local public expenditures.</small></p>
          <p><small>Making the rental value of land a principal source of local
          public
          revenue has both an equity rationale and an efficiency rationale. The
          equity argument for social collection of the rent of land is founded
          on a recognition that the rental value of land has three sources.
          
    </small></p>
          <ul>
            <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Part of the rental value
          of land is the gift of nature</span>--the fertility
          of soil, the value of good rivers and harbors, the depletable value
          of minerals, and so on. This part of the rental value of land should
          be collected publicly because no individual has a just claim to more
          than a proportionate share of it. Public collection is just either if
          it is followed by an equal distribution to all citizens or by
          spending on activities that provide equal benefits to all.</small></li>
            <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A second part of the
          rental value of land comes from the provision
          of public services.</span> The local agencies that provide these
          services
          can justly claim the increase in the rental value of land that
          results from their activities.</small></li>
            <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A third part of the
          rental value of any particular site arises
          from private activities that are conducted in the vicinity of that
          site. </span>Social collection of this part of the rental value of
          land is
          particularly appropriate if this money is used to reward those
          private activities according to how much they increase the rental
          value of land.</small></li>
          </ul>
          <p><small>The efficiency argument for social collection of the rent of
          land
          has two parts. </small></p>
          <ul>
            <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> First, the rental value
          of land has the rare quality of being a source of public revenue that
          does not discourage productive activity. </span>If people are taxed
          according to their labor earnings, they can be expected to work less,
          and to tend to move from the places that tax them. If people are taxed
          on their investments and savings, they can be expected to save and
          invest less, and to find it attractive to put their savings and
          investments in other places where they will not be taxed as much. But
          when the rental value of land is collected, no one will reduce the
          amount of land in existence, and no one will move his land elsewhere.
          Thus social collection of the rent of land does not reduce the
          productivity of an economy in the way that most other sources of public
          revenue do.</small></li>
            <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second part of the
          efficiency argument is that social collection of the rent of land tends
          to make land more available to those who want to start new enterprises</span>.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When the rent of land is
          not collected publicly, those who have rights to land will tend to
          ignore the possibility of releasing it to someone who might make better
          use of it. </span>On the other hand, if those who have rights to land
          are required to make annual payments equal to the market value of the
          rights they hold, then these continuing payments will induce people to
          ask themselves regularly whether they ought to release the land to
          someone who can make better use of it.</small></li>
          </ul>
          <p><small>To achieve the potential efficiency of public revenue from
          land,
          it is important that people not be charged more for the use of land,
          just because they happen to be using it particularly productively.
          The rental value of land should be reassessed regularly, the values
          that are determined should vary smoothly with location, and they
          should be available for public inspection so that all users of land
          can see that they are being charged amounts commensurate with what
          their neighbors are being charged.</small></p>
          <p><small>Social collection of the rent of land also facilitates the
          privatization of land. If every user of land is charged annually
          according to the rental value of the land that he or she holds, then
          it is possible to undertake a just privatization of land simply by
          passing out titles to the current users of land. </small></p>
          <p><small>No one will be disadvantaged by not receiving land. Future
          generations will not be deprived by not having been awarded shares.
          And the community will have a continuing income from the rent of
          land.</small></p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><small>The
          efficiency that is entailed in using the rent of land to
          finance public activities applies to certain other sources of public
          revenue as well:</small></p>
          <blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such
          as the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for
          radio and TV broadcasts. </small>
            <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such
          payments should be set at levels that yield the greatest possible
          revenue of the resources, in present value terms.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
          pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the
          estimated cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution
          on the rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its
          cost.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental
          value of surrounding land.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in
          crowded streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for
          others. The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it
          is not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be
          handled sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent
          that they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
          which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water,
          electricity, sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to
          make every service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable
          is that each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service
          he receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
          increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs not
          covered by user charges.</small></p>
            <small> </small>
            <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land,
          at a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
          tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
          to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements). He
          pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who wishes to
          may take over possession at that price. The value of such a tax is that
          it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment, and to
          identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
          purposes.</small></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
          of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be
          collected even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any
          excess can be returned to the population on an equal per capita
          basis. </span>If these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to
          finance necessary public expenditures, then the least damaging
          additional tax would probably be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on
          all residents. If some residents are regarded to be incapable of
          paying such a tax, then the next most efficient tax is a proportional
          tax on income up to some specified amount. Then there is no
          disincentive effect for all persons who reach the tax limit. The next
          most efficient tax is a proportional tax on all income.</small></p>
          <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax
          the profits of corporations</span>. Capital
          moves from where it is taxed to where it is not, until the same rate
          of return is earned everywhere. If the city refrains from taxing
          corporations they will invest more in St. Petersburg. Wages will be
          higher, and the rent of land, collected by the government, will be
          higher. The least damaging tax on corporations is one that provides a
          complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over of tax credits
          to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making the government a
          partner in all new investments. With such a tax the government
          provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that it later
          receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
          for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when
          investment is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such
          a tax requires that everyone believe that the tax rate will never
          change. Thus it is best not to tax the profits of corporations at
          all. If the people of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of
          corporations, then they should invest directly in the corporations,
          either privately or publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would
          be best served by refraining from taxing the profits of corporations.
          Creating a place where profits are not taxed can be expected to
          attract so much capital that the resulting rises in wages and in
          government-collected rents will more than offset what might have been
          collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
          <p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two
          features. </small></p>
          <ul>
            <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is
          that it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among
          competing potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use
          of the frequency spectrum and for depleting natural resources share
          this feature. <br>
              </small></li>
            <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have
          is that of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the
          person who pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on
          pollution, taxes on other activities that reduce the value of
          surrounding land, taxes on imposing congestion and other costs on
          other residents of the city, charges for the marginal cost of
          publicly provided services, and a self-assessed tax on property,
          reflecting the hindrance to future growth represented by existing
          development. <br>
              </small></li>
          </ul>
          <small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to
          attract capital rapidly, and therefore to experience rapid growth,
          raising the wages of its citizens and the publicly-collected rent of
          its land.</small><br>

          <small>One of the reasons that the debate is so fierce between the
          advocates
          of rental and the advocates of private ownership of agricultural land
          is that each position has important strengths as well as important
          weaknesses. This paper argues that there is a third possibility between
          rental and private ownership that retains the strengths of both while
          avoiding the weaknesses of both. The third possibility is private
          possession of land.</small>
