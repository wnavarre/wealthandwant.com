<p>Weld Carter carried in his wallet two quotations:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>The law of causation is simply another way of stating the basic assumption
      behind all science. Its very essence is an insistence on the universality
    of the reign of law, and science cannot move an inch without making that
    basic
      assumption.</em> &#8212; Daniel Sommer Robinson</p>
  <p><em>Justice is a relation of congruity which really subsists between two
      things. This relation is always the same, whatever being considers it,
      whether
    it be God, or an angel, or lastly a man.</em> &#8212; Montesquieu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Born in 1900 in East Orange, New Jersey, as a young man Weld Carter was personal
  mathematician to Thomas Edison in the last years of <em>his</em> work in northern New
  Jersey. (Weld
  delighted
  in describing
  this to young people, and clarifying to them that he and Edison were
  <em>not</em> the same
  age! One of his prize possessions was an autographed picture of Edison, given
  to Weld in lieu of a requested raise!) </p>
<p>Weld discovered the ideas of Henry George about 1940, and devoted much
    of the rest of his life to sharing these ideas,  as education director of
  the Henry George School in Chicago; visiting college economics faculty
  to encourage
  their
  exploration
  of George's ideas, under the auspices of the <a href="../docs/Aller_RSF.html">Robert
    Schalkenbach Foundation</a>, in the 50s and 60s (his &quot;<a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">Intro
    to HG</a>&quot; was something
  he sent ahead of his visits) and then as Executive Secretary of the <a href="../docs/tred.html">Committee
  on Taxation, Resources and
  Economic
  Development
  (TRED)</a>,
  which was funded by Schalkenbach and later the Lincoln foundation. </p>
<p>His first wife, Marjorie Orr Carter, and his older son both took the first
  Henry George course with him in northern New Jersey around 1941, taught by
  Archie Matteson. Weld went on to take other courses, teach them and serve as
  trustee of the NJ school. Marjorie's &quot;<a href="../docs/CarterM_intro.html">My
  Introduction ...</a> &quot; (above) is her
  fictional description of the effect of that first course on family and friends.
  She went on to write short stories published in a number of magazines in the
  40s and early 50s. When they lived in Chicago in the 50s, she was assistant
  to the head of the American Bar Association. Marjorie died, too young, in 1963,
  and in 1964, Weld remarried to Jessie Tredway Matteson, who had
  long
  ago been
  Archie
  Matteson's
  wife and
  had
  later
  been part of  the Henry George School in Chicago. (Some of her writing appears
  in Georgist journals in the 1940s.) They were married for nearly 25 years.
  Both Archie and Jessie were long time
  family friends. Weld and Jessie's Georgist commitment continued throughout
  the rest of their lives &#8212; Weld through <a href="../docs/tred.html">TRED</a> and his <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html">Clarion
  Call</a> (above),
   Jessie through writing activist letters
  to encourage
  people
  to
  explore
  the contemporary
  relevance
  of George's
  ideas. I have much of their extensive library today.</p>
