<p>Bill Vickrey was a major figure among contemporary Georgists. He died, en
  route to a meeting of Georgist scholars, a few days after learning he was to
  be a joint  recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1996. Here is a collection
  of tributes which will give you a sense of both the man and his ideas.</p>

<p><b>Warm Memories of Bill Vickrey</b>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">[ed note: William Vickrey, Columbia
University, New York, born
Victoria, British Columbia, June 21, 1914; died October 11, 1996,
aged 82; joint winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize for Economics with
James Mirrlees of Cambridge University]. </p>
<p align="left">The evening of the day Bill Vickrey won his Nobel I impulsively,
hesitantly dialed his home. His phone surprised me by ringing unbusy,
and Bill surprised me more by answering, and sounding unhurried.
After congratulations, I asked "Bill, was this for a lifetime of
achievement, or some specific work?" "I don't know," he replied.
"Well," I persisted, "Is there a citation? What does it say?" "Yes,"
he said, "there is one, but I can't understand it." If you and I find
it a puzzle, we have good company.</p>

<p>Mission performed, I hastened to ring off, but Bill kept me on the
line. To Bill, the transaction was incomplete -- too one-sided. He
turned things around and said "Tell me about yourself. What are you
working on now?" I told him as briefly as I could, and he immediately
offered to help. It was not a perfunctory sham offer, he's helped me
before. "How are the wife and children?" He really wanted to know,
and report back to Cele. That was Bill, thinking of others, in the
time of his greatest triumph, at the end of a long, wearying day of
praise and celebration. What a saint! And I thank that other saint,
my wife, who nudged me to call right away: two days later Bill left
us forever. </p>
<p>Bill was born in Victoria, B.C., his mother's home. His middle
name was Spencer, as in Spencer's Stores; they had merged with, I
believe he said, Eaton's. From the Spencer side he got his sense of
how business works. His father was a preacher from Illinois who
raised money for starving Armenians -- literally. From him Bill got
his firm sense of social justice, plus a reflex against spending
money on his own creature comforts. At professional meetings he
sought out cheaper lodgings than anyone else, though his expenses
were covered. He did it inconspicuously so as not to make others
uncomfortable: his humility was not for flaunting, he just lived it.
Again, what a saint! </p>
<p>Bill had a degree in mathematics from Yale, before turning to
economics at Columbia. He was not one to hide behind phony math, as
most economists do now, nor to intimidate others; but none could snow
or intimidate him, although many tried. In spite of the phonies,
genuine math can be truly useful, and that's when he drew on this
skill plus his insight and talent, which went far deeper than mere
skill. He gave freely of them. At one point he dashed off a
mathematical appendix to an article I had struggled over for months.
His page of squiggles pretty well comprehended and tied together and
validated all the points I had spread over 50 pages. He gave it to me
gratis -- that was Bill. For him, it was effortless: "Just a matter of
inverting the order of integration," he explained casually. What a
saint! </p>
<p>Bill had high standards, but no false standards. He feared no
contamination or loss of caste by consorting with less renowned
economists, or supporting ideas that lacked mainline "respectability"
and "prestige." If he had a fault, it was projecting his own virtues
onto others. He was delightfully ingenuous in personal dealings, and
could not impute base, careerist motives to social and professional
climbers. </p>
<p>It was in 1964 or so that I called Bill impulsively and hesitantly
the first time. Art Becker and <a href="Carter.htm">Weld Carter</a> and I were growing a
committee of economists to meet annually and produce a modern
Georgist literature, but who were we in the world? Bill had published
works on financing mass transit that breathed a distinct sweet odor
of Georgism. Like a bee to a flower, I buzzed him. It was a good
impulse; he accepted, suddenly we were somebodies, and other
somebodies joined up, too. Soon we had our academic-Georgist Camelot,
if only for one brief shining moment. Our committee, named <a
 href="../docs/tred.html">TRED</a>,
produced about ten volumes of neo-Georgist literature, published by
the University of Wisconsin Press. Bill had a chapter in our first
volume, and also helped me, as editor, straighten out a headstrong
contributor who insisted on turning rents into earned incomes. When
Bill wrote, people heeded, and Bill was ever ready to lend a hand. I
thought of him as a big brother to call on in need. How I shall miss
my big brother! </p>
<p>At Columbia, Bill rubbed elbows with Harold Hotelling, the most
brilliant and creative economist of his generation. Hotelling was a
closet Georgist who never fully came out, even after a lifetime of
professional acclaim for his technical triumphs - a measure of the
pressure used to squelch academic Georgists. The nearest he came was
to let Will Lissner include him on a roster of "Editorial Advisers"
to the AJES. Francis A. Walker, first President of the American
Economic Association in 1885, had written "I will not insult my
readers by discussing a project so steeped in infamy" as taxing land
values. Bill Vickrey, President of the same Association 106 years
later, wrote on the same subject that we should tax 'em to the max.
He joined <a href="Tideman.html">Nic Tideman</a> in composing a letter to Gorbachev advising the
then-Soviets to base their privatization strategy on taxing land
values. Together they signed up 20-30 highly visible economists,
including four earlier Nobel laureates. This did not stop Bill from
winning his Nobel in 1996. Perhaps our cause has progressed within
the ivied walls, after all; or perhaps that is just a measure of
Vickrey's personal courage and conscience, and the power of courage
and conscience to overcome fear and win confidence -- even of Nobel
prize committees. </p>
<p>A reporter asked Bill what he would do with his prize money. Bill
said he didn't care about the money, and he spoke truly, for his
conscience would not let him live it up while others were down. He
said he valued the "bully pulpit" the prize gave him to spread his
ideas. He didn't say which ideas; he had many. I am morally certain,
however, that near the top of his list was implementing George's
proposal to raise public revenues by taxing land values. The last
thing he asked me before hanging up was, "Will I see you at the <a
 href="../docs/tred.html">TRED</a>
meeting?" Bill never missed. </p>
<p>Bill died, as you know by now, en route to that meeting. He drove
at night, true to his principle of easing peak-hour congestion. Had
he arrived, I know he would have raised his head from the doze he
affected and told some unwary journeyman,<em><strong> "This paper would benefit
<a name="Thispaperwouldbenefit"></a>from an application of Henry George's idea of taxing land values."
</strong></em>How do I know? Because he always did.<strong> I imagine by now
he has
mentioned it to God, too; and God has said "Actually, Bill, that's
how we've always done it here; but thank you for urging folks to have
my will done on earth as it is in Heaven."</strong></p>

  <b>Economics Nobel<a name="EconomicsNobel"></a> Awarded for Contributions in Public Finance</b>
</center>
<p align="center">&nbsp;Nicolaus Tideman</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 1996 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to two public finance
  economists, James Mirrlees and William Vickrey. James Mirrlees is Professor
  of Economics at the University of Cambridge, in England. Until his death just
  three days after receiving the Noble Prize, William Vickrey was Professor of
  Economics Emeritus at Columbia University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Both of this year's winners have made numerous contributions to economics.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Prof. Mirrlees</b> is most famous for his analysis of "optimal income
  taxation." In this analysis, Prof. Mirrlees treats the problem of the choice
  of an income tax schedule as one of maximizing the aggregate utility of the
  members of a society. One might expect an economist to shun such an approach,
  on the ground that it requires interpersonal comparisons of utility, which
  economists generally regard to be unfounded. Instead, Prof. Mirrlees said, "Let's
  solve the problem in general, and then see what results from different assumptions
  about the way that the marginal utility of income varies with income." As Prof.
  Mirrlees conceives the problem, those who choose the income tax schedule must
  deal with the fact that, the greater the tax that is imposed on income, the
  less people will earn. The identification of the optimal income tax schedule
  is then a problem in the calculus of variation, a branch of advanced mathematics.
  Besides being a very impressive example of the application of mathematics to
  an economic problem, the analysis offers some interesting insights. One is
  that under most reasonably plausible assumptions about the way that the utility
  of income varies with income, the rate schedule that would maximize total utility
  entails rather modest maximum income tax rates. Another is that, under the
  rate schedule that maximized total utility, the marginal tax rate of the richest
  person on his last dollar of income would be zero! (You want to motivate him
  to work that last minute, and you don't lose any taxes on previous work, because
  that is all taxed at higher rates.)</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Prof. Vickrey</b> wrote a book in the 1940s, suggesting that instead
  of having just an income tax, it would be sensible for a country to use a combination
  of an income tax, a consumption tax and a wealth tax. One of his suggestions
  was for a system of lifetime income averaging. Instead of paying a tax each
  year on that year's income, one would add this year's income to the sum of
  previous years' incomes, divide by the number of years to get average income,
  compute the tax on that amount of income, multiply by the number of years to
  get the total tax, and finally subtract the total of taxes paid in previous
  year to get the tax owed this year. Prof. Vickrey was also renown for his suggestions
  of <span style="font-weight: bold;">public pricing schemes</span> that more
  closely approximated marginal social costs. He may have been the first advocate
  of the practice of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">airlines of seeking
  (paid) volunteers to wait for the next flight</span>, instead of bumping the
  last persons to arrive. He was an early advocate of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">peak-load pricing</span> for electricity, public
  transit, bridges, tunnels, and for city streets! He estimated that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">social
  cost of an hour of driving in Manhattan at busy times</span> (taking account
  of the value of the time of all the people who were slowed down by the presence
  of one more car on the streets) was $20,000! He did not want to charge people
  this much; he felt that a price of $20 to $50 per hour for driving in Manhattan
  would probably have brought the amount of driving down to where the benefit
  matched the cost. Prof. Vickrey was most famous in recent years for a 1961
  paper that went virtually unnoticed for the first dozen or so years after it
  was published, but then came to be seen as <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
  foundation of the theory of efficient auctions</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In
  this paper, Prof. Vickrey introduced the idea of an auction in which each person
  makes just one bid, the item is sold to the person who makes the highest bid,
  but that person is only required to pay the second-highest bid. The characteristic
  of such an auction that has fascinated economists is that, with such a rule,
  it is in the interest of every bidder to bid exactly what the item is worth
  to him or her.</span></p>
<p>In choosing to honor Professors Mirrlees and Vickrey, the Nobel committee
  has highlighted the contribution that economics can make to the creation of
  a more productive public sector.</p>

<p> William Vickrey died on October 11, three days after the
announcement of his being awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, while
on his way to the Lincoln Institute for the annual research conference
of the Committee on Taxation, Resources and Economic Development
(<a href="../docs/tred.html">TRED</a>). </p>
<p>TRED meetings have been sponsored by the Institute for 20 years, and
Bill Vickrey was at every one of those meetings. Indeed, his connection
with TRED goes back even further, for he was one of the committee's
founding members more than 35 years ago. TRED began in discussions
among academic economists who were interested in contemporary
applications of the ideas of Henry George and were also concerned with
land and natural resources. Over the years, TRED's membership expanded
to include public finance and urban economists interested in the use of
land and economic phenomena related to how things are arranged over
space. </p>
<p>Bill Vickrey was the ultimate intellectual sparkplug of TRED from
the beginning. His wonderful inventiveness and irreverence came out in
inspired, seemingly off-the-cuff interventions in the discussion, some
of which have changed thinking about economics and economic policy
forever. For example, in one sally he imagined a linear city in which
all structures were truly mobile. This image made it possible to think
clearly about location, the effects of the durability and immobility of
structures, and appropriate land policies, without being trapped by
peripheral issues. No one could cut to the quick like Vickrey. </p>
<p>TRED member Ed Mills of Northwestern University spoke to our
assembled group at the Institute shortly after hearing the news of
Bill's untimely death. "Bill Vickrey lived his life exactly as he
wished, right to the end," Mills said. "He died with his boots on."
Those of us who have been honored to know Bill for some time have been
shaped by our contact with him, and we will miss him. </p>

<p>Here are a few more bits and pieces picked up online that will give you a
  sense of who Bill Vickrey was:</p>
<p><a href="http://pw2.netcom.com/%7Emasonc/vickrey.html#PEOPLE">http://pw2.netcom.com/~masonc/vickrey.html#PEOPLE</a></p>
Marc Lavoie wrote:
<p>Am I wrong, or is William Vickrey the old fellow that
we often see hanging around at Post Keynesian sessions,
say at the meetings of the EEA?
</p>
<p align="right">A stunned Marc Lavoie!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Marc Lavoie about Bill Vickrey:</p>
<p>The answer is, Mais Oui! He is, and gave all of us
young whippersnappers a good dose of his more
old-fashioned Keynesian concern with achieving full
employment no matter what at the Post Keynesian session
at the EEA, as did Ingrid Rima.
</p>
<p>Actually I have been somewhat amused to observe over a
number of years people at the EEA treating him with
less than proper respect. Two years ago I chaired a
session for the nonlinear crowd that does its thing at
the EEA and Vickrey was "imposed" on it by the EEA with
a paper on deficit financing to achieve full
employment, which he presented. I knew that the
sub-organizers were kind of annoyed, so I made sure
that I was the discussant, and treated the presentation
with proper respect, if not necessarily full agreement
(I expressed concern about the impact of unlimited
foreign indebtedness, to which he cannily smiled,
obviously looking like one who had heard that one
before!).
</p>
<p>I have noticed in previous years that he would
sometimes show up for odd sessions with very small
audiences, but which were actually extremely innovative
and interesting. He is a very original and innovative
thinker who remains close to the edge of the profession
at a deeper level, even if not what is generally
accepted as such by the mainstream. He has
accomplished much and I applaud his selection. For
once the Nobelers have been not so bad.

From: Max B. Sawicky
<br>
To: POST-KEYNESIAN THOUGHT
<br>
Subject: Bill Vickrey -- Live Like Him
</p>
<p>--------------------
</p>
<p>Response by Max B Sawicky:
</p>
<p>The very same. He also used to frequent National Tax
Association meetings, although I haven't seen him at
the last few. If you chanced to meet him on the
street, you might feel the urge to buy him a sandwich.
</p>
<p>As Peter Passell wrote in the NY Times, Vickrey is
famous for appearing to snooze through seminars, then
rise at the end to edify the group with "razor-sharp
questions."
</p>
<p>My best Vickrey story comes from a tax meeting a couple
of years ago. He was sitting alone down in front doing
a crossword puzzle while corporate types babbled
tediously about the international aspects of the
Federal corporate income tax. When Q&amp;A time came, he
gets up in his gruff voice and says,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Don't
you think you're just rearranging deck chairs on
the Titanic?"</span>
</p>
<p>------------------
</p>
<p>Response by Max B Sawicky:
</p>
<p>The work on which Vickrey's reputation is based defies
the prejudices of many on this list: he is rigorously
neoclassical in his microeconomics, but his choice of
subject and application of n-c theory are of great help
to anyone doing applied public finance from a liberal
or progressive viewpoint. Other examples of such
people are William Baumol, the pre-CEA Joseph Stiglitz,
and a few people on this list whom I will decline to
embarrass by naming them. To be sure, this has some
un-progressive features: Vickrey and some others are
dedicated free-traders and tend to take a jaundiced
view of "labor monopolies" (e.g., trade unions).
</p>
<p>Vickrey's macroeconomic views are certainly heterodox.
He was quoted in the <em>Washington Post</em> to the effect that
"balancing the budget is insane and would drive the
economy into a depression." He also thinks the
unemployment rate can be driven down to two percent,
and that the NAIRU theory is positively evil. Vickrey
has written a little on his scheme for "inflation
warrants" which would levy a tax on firms that raised
their prices; it resembles a value-added tax and would
not be designed to collect much revenue -- only to
enable the Fed and the Fisc to drive unemployment to
perdition. On the whole, however, Vickrey has not done
scholarly papers on macro; it's more like an avocation
for him, though you would never know it judging by the
strength of his feelings.
</p>
<p>It is worth noting (and not surprizing, if you know
Passell) that while Passell's piece in the <em>Times</em> was
complimentary, he gave no hint of Vickrey's views on
macro policy.

Subject: Nobel to Vickrey
</p>
<p>I want to echo Paul Davidson and to congratulate
Professor William Vickrey on his Nobel prize, which
ought to raise the visibility of Post Keynesian
economics in the wider world. Vickrey is a dogged and
stalward progressive who remembers exactly what the
unemployment rate was in 1926 (1.9 percent in
peacetime) and thinks that was a pretty good example.
He also has no patience for the balanced budget
nonsense that has once again taken over economic policy
discussion in this country. Congratulations, Bill, and
see you at the next meeting wherever it may be!

<p>According to Vickrey:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There is no reason inherent in the real resources
    available to us why we cannot move rapidly
    within the next two or three years to a state of
    genuine full employment." Vickrey goes on to
    define genuine full employment as "a rate of
    unemployment, as currently measured, of between 1 and 2
    percent. Practically, the desirable situation ought to
    be one in which any reasonably responsible person
    willing to accept available employment can find a job
    paying a living wage within 48 hours."

</p>
<p>Vickrey was an advisory board member and active with
the National Jobs For All Coalition, a coalition of
scholars and advocacy groups based in New York.
Vickrey proposed tradeable or "marketable growth markup
warrants", with penalties or taxes for those
corporations retaining fewer warrants than the excess
of sales revenues over amounts paid for non-prime
inputs in the preceding period. This was a variant of
Abba Lerner's plan to control inflation by creating a
market in rights to raise prices. For discussion of
the above, see: Jobs For All, by Sheila D. Collins,
Helen Ginsburg, and Gertrude Goldberg (Apex Press,

<p>WILLIAM VICKREY DIED ON October 11, 1996, three days
after the announcement that the 1996 Bank of
Sweden prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel was being
awarded to him and to Professor James Mirrlees of Cambridge "for their
fundamental contributions to the economic theory of incentives under
asymmetric information." Vickrey was eighty-two years old and had been
a
member of the National Academy of Sciences since April 1996. The press
release from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences refers specifically
to his work in the mid-forties on income taxation, then in the early
sixties on auctions. With characteristic independence, Vickrey reacted
by privileging instead his work of the late thirties on cumulative
averaging of income for tax purposes and his then current concern with
unemployment. Early insights, lifetime dedication, and late recognition
are unmistakable traits of a truly remarkable career devoted to
economics in the service of the public sector. </p>
<p>William
Vickrey was born in 1914 in Victoria, British Columbia (Canada). He
attended Yale, obtaining a science B.S. degree in 1935 and then went to
Columbia University for graduate work in economics, obtaining an M.A.
in
1937. The Ph.D. degree was awarded there in 1947 after completion of
the
"Agenda for Progressive Taxation," his 496-page doctoral dissertation
included in 1972 among the <i>Reprints of Economic Classics</i>. The
intervening ten years, including World War II, had been spent in
various
research or advisory positions related to taxation.
</p>
<p>Vickrey joined the faculty of Columbia University
in 1946
and never left, except for a few sabbaticals. His working life was
devoted mostly to teaching and research, but it also included a
significant amount of advisory and consulting services on behalf of
public institutions and utilities, and a fair amount of non-specialist
writing and lecturing.
</p>
<p>The advisory and consulting
missions encompass the major areas of Vickrey's applied research:
taxation, public utilities, transportation, and urban problems. In 1949
he and his Columbia colleague Carl Shoup laid the foundation for the
postwar tax structure of Japan. This was followed by a number of tax
missions, notably to Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Liberia. Vickrey also
spent a year as an adviser on fiscal matters for the United Nations,
working in Singapore, Malaysia, Iran, Zambia, Ivory Coast, Libya, and
Surinam.
</p>
<p>The work on public utilities started with the
electric power industry in 1939 and gained momentum in 1951 with the
famous study of subway fares performed for the Mayor's Committee for
Management Survey of the City of New York. In 1959 he studied traffic
congestion in Washington. Further studies on urban planning and
transportation took him to India,
Argentina, and Venezuela.
Over the years, he developed ideas for efficient pricing of
electricity,
telephone services, urban transportation, street and road use,
municipal
services, and airlines. He also kept up with every conceivable
technological development in these areas, visiting experimental designs
on-site and attending specialized conferences.
</p>
<p>The quest
for efficiency of public services made him a crusader, advocating
innovations not only through lectures for the National Tax Association,
the NBER, public utility conferences, and transportation symposia, but
also through testimony at hearings and letters to the <i>New York
Times</i>. Often there is an expression of impatience at the slow
acceptance of new ideas by regulatory and operating
agencies. In recent years this impatience with blatant
inefficiencies has been focused on the macroeconomic field. But the
crusade goes on. Irrational budget accounting, excessive concern with
inflation, and insufficient attention to wasteful unemployment had
become favorite themes on which Vickrey hoped to capture more attention
because of the notoriety of the Nobel award.
</p>
<p>Response to
practical challenges is only one facet of our late friend's
intellectual
curiosity. His interest in ethics and philosophy led to several
publications. Interdisciplinary contacts always appealed to him, in
particular through seminars. Bill Vickrey's fearsome participation in
seminars was part of his legend, and in particular earned him the Rip
van Winkle award from the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences "for deep and uninterrupted concentration while attending
seminars." At Columbia, he showed up at seminars in many
fields, and invariably attended the interdisciplinary ones.
</p>
<p>Vickrey was a distinguished fellow of the American
Economic
Association (president, 1992) and a fellow of the Econometric Society.
He was a past president of the Metropolitan Economic Association and
the
Atlantic Economic Association. Among various honors he received were
the
F. E. Seidman Distinguished Award in Political Economy and a doctor of
humane letters degree from the University of Chicago.
</p>
<p>William Vickrey's career was exceptionally rich,
having
extended over a full sixty years. His work included highly original
contributions over a broad spectrum and displayed some distinctive
methodological traits. His publications included eight books and some
140 articles, of which a selection with introductory reviews was
published in 1994 by Cambridge University Press under the title
<i>Public Economics</i>. The following illustrates the originality with
reference to incentives and information, suggests the spectrum in
regard
to public economics, and concludes on methodological traits.

</p>
<p>A central
  concern of economics is the extent to which decentralized decisions by
  a
  myriad of economic agents (consumers, workers, producers, asset
  holders,
  and public authorities) are compatible with efficiency and equity.
  Efficiency is a property of economic situations where it would not be
  possible to improve any one individual's circumstances without
  impairing
  those of another; in short, there is no waste. Equity is a more
  demanding and more controversial property; it relates the distribution
  of benefits across individuals to ethical premises.
</p>
<p>Efficiency of decentralized decisions becomes
possible when
individual decisions are based on information and incentives reflecting
correctly common values. In relatively simple situations, competitive
prices for commodities (goods and services) provide correct information
and incentives, as was recognized in 1776 by Adam Smith in <i>The
Wealth
of Nations</i>:</p>
<blockquote>the marginal relative values of commodities
are the same for all, since all face the same prices (information),
which they cannot manipulate (incentives); further exchanges could not
benefit both parties.</blockquote>
<p>
The "simple" situations correspond
to a surprisingly broad range of economic activities, yet fall
substantially short of universality. For instance, public services,
like
transportation and utilities, are produced under scale economies, which
suggest a single producer (monopoly). Decreasing marginal costs lead to
losses under competitive pricing. Either prices are not competitive or
losses are covered by taxes and transfers. But taxes distort relative
prices and affect incentives. Also, taxation raises at once equity
issues.
</p>
<p>In 1938 Carl Shoup, professor of public finance
at Columbia University, and his research assistant Vickrey were
discussing methods of taxing capital gains (i.e., wealth increments due
to appreciation of assets, such as houses and shares of stock):
</p>
<blockquote>The idea emerged that ideally, at least, the
method of taxation
should be such that the tax should be completely neutral with respect
to
the time at which a gain is realized (i.e., that the tax payer should
have no incentive in the long run for preferring to realize at one time
rather than another on account of the tax). From this it was a short
step to requiring neutrality with respect to the time of realization or
reporting of all forms of income. It then remained only to work out the
implications of this requirement for the formulation of the tax, and to
devise procedures for the assessment of the tax that would be
administratively feasible (1972).</blockquote>
<p>
The procedure devised
by Vickrey, cumulative averaging, is quite simple once you think about
it. It considers "all payments of income tax, with respect to income
reported since some base starting date, as interest-bearing deposits in
a taxpayer's account with the treasury. The accumulated balance on this
account would then be available as a credit against whatever tax is
found to be due for the entire period to date, on the basis of the
total
income thus far reported for the period . . . inclusive of the interest
credited on the tax deposit account (which is, in effect, to be treated
no differently from interest earned on any other type of deposit)"
(1972). This simple scheme would achieve the required neutrality with
respect to the time at which a gain is realized, that is, the tax
system
would become incentive-compatible with efficient economic decisions.
</p>
<p>Cumulative averaging has not been applied on a
significant
scale, for the same reason perhaps that major revisions or
simplifications of the income tax, whatever their nature, do not come
into being. Still, the merits stand: neutrality, equity with regard to
fluctuations and sources of income, simplification of the tax law, and
elimination of loopholes.
</p>
<p>A few years later, Vickrey was
concerned with the proper graduation of progressive taxation. He
investigated the prospect for implementing the so-called utilitarian
approach outlined by Francis Edgeworth in 1897.
Assume that
the benefits of a higher real income could be measured by a function of
income, labeled utility. Edgeworth posed the problem of income taxation
as that of maximizing, through taxes and transfers, the total utility
derived by a population from a given fixed aggregate income. Vickrey's
contribution was twofold. First, he sought a way of defining and
measuring utility that would be germane to the problem. Second, he
recognized that income tax distorts incentives to earn income, so that
the aggregate income cannot be treated as given and fixed.
</p>
<p>The first contribution consisted of adopting the
method of
representing choices among risky alternatives by comparisons of
expected
utilities, a method introduced in the eighteenth century by Daniel
Bernoulli
and axiomatized in 1945 by John von Neumann and
Oskar Morgenstern in their <i>Theory of Games and Economic
Behaviour</i>.
If a person is indifferent between an income
prospect of $50,000 and a fifty-fifty chance of either $20,000 or
$100,000, the utility difference between 50,000 and 20,000 is set equal
to the utility difference between 100,000 and 50,000. Vickrey
recognized
as follows the relevance of this construction to the Edgeworth problem:
"If utility is defined as that quantity the mathematical expectation of
which is maximized by an individual making choices involving risk, then
to maximize the aggregate of such utility over the population is
equivalent to choosing that distribution of income which such an
individual would select were he asked which of various variants of the
economy he would like to become a member of, assuming that once he
selects a given economy with a given distribution of income he has an
equal chance of landing in the shoes of each member of it" (1945). The
gedanken-
experiment introduced by Vickrey is the basis of modern
utilitarianism, an important branch of contemporary social choice
theory. It is also used, under the name of "original position, behind
the veil of ignorance" in <i>Theory of Justice </i>by John
Rawls.
</p>
<p>The second contribution is well described by the
Swedish Academy:
</p>
<blockquote>Vickrey's analysis emphasized that a
progressive tax schedule would affect individuals' incentives to exert
themselves. He therefore reformulated the problem with respect to both
incentive problems--that each individual takes the tax schedule into
account when choosing his work effort--and asymmetric information, that
in practice, the productivity of individuals is not known to the
government.</blockquote>
<p>
Vickrey formulated the mathematical
problem associated with optimal taxation and derived an appropriate
Euler equation, but he went no further, and left it to James Mirrlees
to
give an explicit characterization twenty-five years later.
</p>
<p>The Swedish Academy emphasized the link thus
established
between incentives and information. It stressed the role of that link
in
lively developments of contemporary economic research and also related
it to Vickrey's work on auctions.
</p>
<blockquote>Asymmetric information is
also an essential component of auctions, where potential buyers have
limited knowledge about the value of the asset or rights up for sale.
Vickrey analyzed the properties of different kinds of auctions in two
papers in 1961 and 1962. He attached particular importance to <strong>the
second-price auction</strong> or, as it is now often called, <strong>the Vickrey
auction</strong>.
In such an auction, an object is auctioned off in sealed bidding, where
the highest bidder gets to buy the item, but only pays the next highest
price offered. This is an example of a mechanism which elicits an
individual's true willingness to pay. By bidding above his own
willingness to pay, an individual runs the risk that someone else will
bid likewise, and he is forced to buy the object at a loss. And
vice-versa, if an individual bids below his own willingness to pay, he
runs the risk of someone else buying the item at a lower price than the
amount he himself is willing to pay. Therefore, in this kind of
auction,
it is in the individual's best interest to state a truthful bid. The
auction is also socially efficient. The object goes to the person with
the highest willingness to pay, and the person in question pays the
social opportunity cost which is the second highest bid. Other
researchers have later developed analogous principles, for example in
order to elicit the true willingness to pay for public projects. Thus,
Vickrey's analysis has not only been momentous for the theory of
auctions; it has also conveyed fundamental insights into the design of
resource allocation mechanisms aimed at providing socially desirable
incentives.</blockquote>
<p>
Recent years have witnessed
spectacular application of auctions theory, in particular to bidding
for
band spectrum licenses.
It is surprising that, to the very
end, Vickrey would label this work "one of my digressions into abstract
economics, at best of minor significance in terms of human
welfare."</p>

<p>Concern about human welfare pervades the sixty
years of
Vickrey's professional life. Considered in retrospect, with the benefit
of hindsight, his numerous and widely scattered contributions come
close
to retracing the history of the field of public economics as it evolved
over the last forty years.
The field is concerned with the
economics of the public sector, with government's effect on the
economy.
It is today a broad field, where microeconomic theory is applied on the
one hand to the revenue side, in particular taxation; and on the other
hand to the sphere of real activities carried out or regulated by the
public sector. It is a difficult, complex field. On the revenue side,
efficiency calls for second best analysis (i.e., minimizing the
dead-weight burden of taxation), whereas equity goes straight to the
ethical roots of social choice theory. On the real side, if public
intervention makes sense, there must be a reason why the market
mechanism is not fully operative--like externalities, non-convexities,
or information asymmetries. The challenge is thus to invent mechanisms
that somehow succeed where the market fails--a challenge that is never
trivial.
</p>
<p>Reference has been made above to William
Vickrey's seminal role in the emergence of modern utilitarianism.
Shortly thereafter, he had the good fortune of supervising Kenneth
Arrow's doctoral dissertation "Social Choices and Individual
Values." Vickrey himself devoted several papers to the
area. As early as 1960, he discussed in that context strategic
misrepresentation of preferences, a topic that figures prominently in
the work on auctions and in an extensive literature on demand-revealing
mechanisms.
</p>
<p>Reference has also been made to cumulative
averaging, Vickrey's "proudest accomplishment" in the area of taxation.
It was, however, only one out of twenty-one specific recommendations
listed in the <i>Agenda for Progressive Taxation</i> (1947). One
particularly innovative chapter deals with inheritance taxes, resting
again on a neutrality principle (1944). In the ensuing years, the tax
treatments of corporate income, government interest, land values, and
charitable contributions retained Vickrey's attention. An overall
evaluation of these contributions is worded as follows by Anthony
Atkinson, a leading British specialist: "Bill Vickrey occupies a unique
position among public finance economists. His contributions to
taxation,
simultaneously analytical and policy-relevant, are characterized by an
inventiveness which is unrivaled. They derive from a powerful, yet
essentially simple, view of the logic of taxation, a logic which has
quizzed his writing over more than half a century."<sup></sup></p>
<p>On the real side of public economics, Vickrey's
work is
equally extensive. Much of it derives from his interest in marginal
cost
pricing, "a device for improving the efficiency with which we use
various facilities" (1970). The principle is straightforward in simple
situations, for instance, when a specific good or service is consumed
at
a constant rate over time and produced under conditions of constant or
increasing marginal cost. Marginal cost is then well defined and
defines
in turn the efficient, competitive price. Fluctuations in demand or
cost
over time and space or in response to imperfectly foreseen
circumstances, decreasing marginal costs or heterogeneous production
complicate matters. Marginal cost pricing then becomes a subtle art,
calling for skillful application of theoretical guidelines. The
relevant
concept is that of<strong> short run marginal social cost (SRMSC)</strong> to the proper
definition of which Vickrey has contributed several useful precisions.
This is not the place to review theoretical intricacies, but it is
possible to give a flavor of some of the more innovative applications
devised by Vickrey in the areas of public utilities and urban
transportation. Here are some illustrations, listed in chronological
order to bring out the extent to which they anticipated current
developments.
</p>
<p>In 1948 Vickrey was concerned with the
assessment of SRMSC over time, when the demand for a service at a given
future date is imperfectly predicted by the seller, but is known to
some
buyers apt to make advance reservations. Seats on long-distance flights
or rooms at vacation resorts provide examples. He suggested "a fairly
elaborate pricing scheme in which the price quoted would vary according
to the proportion of seats on a given flight already sold and the time
remaining to departure, in simulation of what an ideal speculator's
market might produce, the price at any time being an estimate of the
price, which, if maintained thereafter, would result in all the
remaining seats being just sold out at departure time" (1948). Today,
some airlines and tour operators follow precisely this advice, using a
technique known as yield management, for which elaborate software is
produced commercially.
</p>
<p>In 1950-51 Vickrey was consulting
for the Mayor's Committee for Management Survey of the City of New
York.
He was assigned the problem of subway fares, with the aim of reducing
the drain of the transit deficit on the city's finances. Evaluation of
the SRMSC led him to suggest replacing the prevailing 15-cent flat fare
with an efficient set of fares varying from 5 cents to 25 cents
according to time of day and trip definition (origin and destination).
He even designed a new electromechanical turnstile permitting automatic
implementation. Today, such differentiated fares are commonplace in
many
cities, with implementation facilitated by magnetic cards and
electronic
processing.
</p>
<p>Subways operate under marginal costs that
decrease with overall traffic. Pricing at SRMSC entails losses. If
budgetary considerations place a ceiling on these losses, a second-best
solution calls for raising prices above SRMSC to an extent determined
by
demand elasticities (and just sufficient to meet the ceiling). That
principle had been discovered and translated into mathematical formulae
by Frank P. Ramsey in 1927.
That contribution had fallen
into oblivion, however. Spurred by the practical subway challenge,
Vickrey computed the Ramsey solution and extended it in one important
respect. Instead of accepting an arbitrary ceiling on the losses, he
evaluated the social cost of the distortions associated with revenue
raising by the city, summarized in a marginal cost of public funds
(MCPF). He then proposed a fare structure such that the marginal
inefficiencies associated with reducing the losses matched exactly the
MCPF. The subway study stands out as a classic in applied public
economics, the reading of which is still instructive today.
</p>
<p><strong>In 1959 Vickrey studied road transportation in
Washington,
D.C., stressing the quantitative importance of the underpricing of
rush-hour auto travel.</strong> He estimated that, if a suburbanite gave up bus
commuting to drive a $3,500 automobile into town, it would cost $23,000
in infrastructure investment to keep road congestion unchanged. The
solution was to impose road tolls in amounts corresponding to SRMSC.
These tolls would vary with the time of day, culminating at the rush
hours. They would help spread the peak and encourage bus travel.
</p>
<p>Here again Vickrey faced a technical problem of
implementation: toll booths slow down the flow of traffic. He proposed
instead the use of vehicle identifiers that could be read
electronically
without slowing down the traffic and obtained a prototype and cost
estimate from a manufacturer. Today, that system has been fully
developed, is being used in a few places, and is seen as the way of the
future.
</p>
<p>Further investigation of the optimal tolls led
ten years later to a paper described by specialist Richard Arnott as
"almost certainly the most important in urban transport economics over
the last quarter century."That paper models the dynamics
of rush-hour congestion by treating the departure-time decisions of
commuters as endogenous variables. The extended problem is made
tractable by modeling congestion as a queue behind a bottleneck. That
model has received strong empirical support from detailed traffic flow
studies, and has changed the way traffic engineers think about the
problem. An interesting property of equilibrium is that it leaves
commuters at least as well off as before, so that the toll revenues
come
free. Road tolls are an example of responsive pricing (i.e., prices
varied from moment to moment in response to observed congestion
levels).
The concept has been applied repeatedly by Vickrey to public utilities,
like telephone and electricity, but also water supply.
</p>
<p>In 1963 Vickrey published a first paper on pricing
and
financing of urban services, such as fire protection, water provision,
parks and recreational facilities, and education. Fire protection
(which
accounted at the time for 8% of all general expenditures by cities) is
an interesting illustration. Vickrey noted that a given grade of fire
protection is a matter of providing an engine company within a suitable
number of minutes of travel time, and concluded that the appropriate
charge should be a matter of land area (rather than property value
under
current practice).
</p>
<p>The interest of Vickrey for urban
problems spread to other areas, like land value taxation. Here again he
extended and clarified the theoretical basis by showing how, in
equilibrium, "the aggregate of the land rents generated by the urban
agglomeration produced by the existence of activities with economies of
scale within the city will equal the subsidies required to enable these
activities to sell their output at prices equal to their respective
marginal costs" (1977). (This is a modern extension of an approach
introduced by Henry George, of which several variants were published in
the 1970s.) That result sets the problem of land value taxation and
financing of public services in a general equilibrium framework.

</p>
<p>The review above is
partial, as it leaves out altogether Vickrey's interest in
macroeconomic
stabilization, which became his major concern from the mid-eighties on.
It also leaves out most of his writings about ethics and justice and
sundry contributions on such topics as "The Prevention of
Gerrymandering" (1961), "Application of Demand Revealing Procedures to
International Disputes" (1978), and many more.
</p>
<p>The
momentous research output of William Vickrey has some distinctive
features that give him a very special place among contemporary
economists.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, it should be clear from the foregoing that his work
combine depth and breadth--depth, by grounding specific research firmly
in the theory of economic efficiency (leading, for instance, to a
correct definition of SRMSC), as well as in a modern approach to equity
and social choice; and breadth in the treatment of a wide range of
topics covering the revenue as well as the real side of public
economics.
  </li>
  <li>Second, the starting point of Vickrey's
investigations is always rooted in real world problems. His interest
was
to solve the problem at hand. To that end, he brings in general
principles, and his proficiency as a theorist pays off. Often he is led
to extend the principles into new theory, but he is hardly interested
in
theory for its own sake--only to the extent that it carries policy
implications.
  </li>
  <li>Third, and related, Vickrey was unique
among his contemporaries for his determination to carry out theoretical
contributions all the way to practical application. This is illustrated
already in his work on cumulative averaging, which led him to develop
concrete proposals for legislation. Further examples are found in his
work on subway fares and road pricing, and there are many more.</li>
  <li>Fourth, and again related, there is "a certain
characteristic style of understatement and specificity of application
in
Vickrey's work, which has in some ways helped, in perhaps more ways
hindered, the full understanding of his originality." Vickrey's papers contain
little or no mathematics. Where they do, he is apologetic. Intricate reasoning
is typically encapsulated in a sentence
or two, as exemplified in the four original quotations used above.
Important statements like these repeatedly appear as side remarks in
the
discussion of a specific application. The generality is hardly stressed
except through reference to further applications. The modern economic
style of proceeding from numbered assumptions to numbered theorems was
quite foreign to Vickrey, in spite of his familiarity with, and
thorough
understanding of, the relevant literature--a refreshing exception,
given
the richness of content.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There is no doubt that William
Vickrey was a powerful theorist, capable of abstraction and conscious
of
generality. It is also clear that he was eager to communicate. He was
not writing for himself, but to be read. He was particularly eager to
be
understood by policy makers. Relying on the simplicity of basic
reasoning and expressing it verbally was for him a natural vehicle of
broad communication. Mostly, he was himself. His relative neglect of
systematic theoretical construction probably reflected the little need
he felt for it, being able to understand quickly principles and their
main implications. He could himself dispense with spelling out details,
unless directly relevant to his immediate purpose.
</p>
<p>Given
Vickrey's talent and analytical ability, some of us regret that he did
not put more systematic theoretical effort into his favored topics.
Given his bend of mind, it is hard to tell how successful that
different
orientation would have been. Indeed, creative theoretical work is often
produced by researchers primarily interested in real-world problems;
and
imaginative practical solutions often come from gifted theorists.
Vickrey's bend of mind was indispensable to bridge the gap between
theory and application. And it was probably an efficient division of
labor that he would let others refine the theory, while he himself
stayed on the development frontier, demonstrating the fruitfulness of
an
approach that too few among us are capable of pursuing with
excellence.</p>
<p>Ultimately, William Vickrey's
forte was originality and creativity, reaching out of the boundaries of
standard frameworks to develop a different viewpoint. In so doing, he
was saved from esoterism by his uncompromising logic. His style of
writing partook of his originality, and may have interacted with the
originality of the ideas to explain late recognition, a feature
stressed
in the citation presenting him as a distinguished fellow of the
American
Economic Association in 1978:
</p>
<blockquote>Many of us have had the
experience of thinking we were the first to show the neutrality of a
particular tax scheme, to prove the incentive characteristics of a
particular bidding institution, to deduce the redistributive
implications of the expected utility hypothesis, to invent a demand
revealing process, and so on, only to find that William S. Vickrey had
done it earlier--sometimes much earlier--and whereas our "original
contribution" may have contained minor or even a substantive error,
Vickrey had done it correctly. Some great scholars receive recognition
from the beginning, but inscrutably, with others it takes a little
longer. His numerous works, appearing in all the leading journals in
economics, law, operations research, finance and taxation, contain many
seminal contributions, and many more that would have been seminal but
for the fact that the profession was not yet ready for his ideas.</blockquote>

I once
heard from an Indian economist that, of all foreign economic advisers,
Vickrey had been the most directly helpful, because he had produced new
railway schedules that permitted substantial energy saving and improved
