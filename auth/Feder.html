Today -- Introduction to the New Abridged Edition of <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As this book was written, the
Industrial Revolution was
transforming America and Europe at a breathless pace. In just a
century, an economy that worked on wind, water, and muscular effort
had become supercharged by steam, coal, and electricity. Canals,
railroads, steamships and the telegraph were linking regional
economies into a national and global network of exchange. The United
States had stretched from coast to coast; the western frontier was
evaporating.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>American journalist and editor
Henry George marveled at the
stunning advance of technology, yet was alarmed by ominous trends.
Why had not this unprecedented increase in productivity banished want
and starvation from civilized countries, and lifted the working
classes from poverty to prosperity? Instead, George saw that the
division of labor, the widening of markets, and rapid urbanization
had increased the dependence of the <b>working poor</b> upon forces
beyond their control. The working poor were always, of course, the
most vulnerable in depressions, and last to recover from them.
Unemployment and pauperism had appeared in America, and indeed, were
more prevalent in the developed East than in the aspiring West. It
was "as though a great wedge were being forced, not underneath
society, but through society. Those who are above the point of
separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed down."
This, the "great enigma of our times," was the problem George set out
to solve in <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists will recognize his
analysis as a precursor to the
modern marginal productivity theory of functional distribution. His
story is framed in the language of what is today called classical
political economy, though George was careful to avoid inconsistencies
of definition and reasoning which, he showed, had led other
economists astray.</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A central feature of the British
classical school was the
classification of productive resources into three "factors of
production" - labor, land, and capital. Most classical economists had
conceived of these in terms of three great social classes (the
workers, the landed aristocracy, and the capitalists). George, on the
other hand, identified them as functional categories, distinguished
by the conditions under which the factors are made available for
production.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a competitive economy, the
earnings of the factors of
production measure their separate contributions to the value of the
product. Payments for the use of labor are called wages; payments for
land are called rent; the income of capital is interest. In George's
terms, the distress of the working classes had to do with a
persistently low level of real wages. "Why," he asked, "in spite of
increase in productive power, do wages tend to a minimum which will
give but a bare living?"<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The book proceeds systematically.
First, George explores the
prevailing scholarly and popular explanations, which relied
principally on the famous population theory of Malthus, in
combination with the "wage fund" theory of British political economy.
Together these theories implied that the aggregate income of labor
depends upon the amount of capital devoted to the payment of wages.
An increase in wages required an increase in the amount of capital
per worker. However, any rise in living standards above mere
subsistence motivated workers to marry younger and bear more
children, until population growth caused capital per worker - and,
therefore, wages - to recede again.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Moreover, population growth
diminished agricultural productivity
by forcing recourse to inferior soils. Technological advance and
capital accumulation might afford a period of relative prosperity -
but ultimately, increasing applications of labor to a fixed amount of
land could raise output only at a diminishing rate. In short,
immutable laws of nature - the population principle and the law of
diminishing returns to land - were widely believed to explain the
persistence of poverty.<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To George, the Malthusian analysis
was abhorrent: It asserted that
no institutional reform could fundamentally alter the pattern of
income distribution, and that charitable support for the needy only
compounded the problem - by lowering death rates and raising birth
rates.<strong> ... </strong><br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his own analysis, George takes
meticulous care to avoid
inconsistencies of definition and reasoning. <strong>... </strong><br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Public debate about economic
policy revolves today, as it always
has, around a tension between two fundamental social goals.
Economists and policymakers lament a perennial "trade-off between
efficiency and equity."&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Most economists deem it their business to evaluate the
efficiency
of policy choices, but, claiming no special knowledge of ethics, they
leave it to philosophers and the political process to evaluate
questions of justice. Can it be true that society's arrangements to
provide for common needs must always confront a divisive choice
between equity and efficiency - between what is fair and what is
feasible?</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George not only denied it;
he asserted the reverse: <b>Full
recognition of economic rights and responsibilities would reveal the
goals of equity and efficiency to be mutually reinforcing. Neither
social justice nor a well-functioning free market system can long be
enjoyed without the other.</b> "The laws of the universe are
harmonious," George proclaimed. His analysis showed that the root
cause of widening inequality lies not in the laws of nature, but in
social maladjustments which ignore them. Moreover, the breach of
justice which underlies the problem of poverty is not merely
incidental to economic development; it impedes development, leading
to wider and wider inequality.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George emphasized that unequal
distribution is itself wasteful of
wealth.<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unemployment and underemployment
of labor mean that energy and
intelligence go untapped. ...<br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In short, an unjust system of
privileges and entitlements tends to
cause misallocation of resources, macroeconomic instability and
stagnation, political corruption, and social conflict that ultimately
may threaten whole civilizations.
<b>George's central contribution was to show that the distinction
between individual property and common property forms a rational
basis for distinguishing the domain of public activity from that of
the private.</b>&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>George's insights have wide application to modern
problems.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Modern fiscal and monetary policies have not resolved the
problem
of macroeconomic fluctuations. Yet a <b>half century before Keynes,
George outlined a theory of boom and bust which explained the
underlying instability of the market economy under present fiscal
institutions. ...</b></small><br>
<br>
<small>Many American cities are plagued by the twin problems of urban
decay and suburban sprawl. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Thus, George's synthesis informs a research program of
remarkable
breadth. Some writers understand Georgism to constitute a distinct
paradigm of political economy, one which reconciles the
contradictions between the two competing paradigms dominant in the
world today - the mainstream neoclassical school, which tends to
focus on the impressive efficiency properties of free markets, and
Marxist socialism. Other Georgist writers believe that Georgism can
and should be explained in the modern language of neoclassical
economics. What is certain is that geoclassical thought bears
crucially on some of the foremost controversies in America and the
world today.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"
