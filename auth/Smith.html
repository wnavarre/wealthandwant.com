Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="3"><small>John Muir is
right. <i>"Tug on any one thing and find it connected to everything
else in the universe." </i>Tug
on the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland
loss, political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted
neighborhood tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have
failed to address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the
root could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.</small></font><br>
</div>
<font size="3"></font><br>
Jeff Smith <a href="../docs/Smith_SRTS.html">Share
Rent, Transform Society</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If society decided to share
among its members all the
annual value of society's sites and resources and air space, what
would happen?&nbsp; <br>
<font size="3"><small><br>
... </small></font><span style="font-weight: bold;">It doesn't matter
who owns what. What
matters is who gets the rent.</span> We have millions of acres of
forest we Americans own together, and we are losing rent on it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
The word property cannot convey the distinction between
rent and land.&nbsp; ... </span>A word for that is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geonomics, earth-focused economics.</span>
It
hones in on all this flow of rent that is so overlooked. Shift the
focus to sharing; then owning of land loses
importance and belonging to earth regains its importance. It is a
different identity for human beings as parts of the economic
system.&nbsp; ... <br>
<font size="3"><small><br>
</small></font><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the past, land
owners owed services to king, but in
this age of equality then we owe our neighbors. We have an equal
right to the earth. </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
The community creates rent.</span> Land value rises when
infrastructure goes on land. Technology progresses when the community
becomes more tranquil and density goes up. Density is a really good
measure of land value. No one owner by
himself is responsible for density. Rent from land value is justified
because all should share in the rent. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">If the community collected the rent,
it would motivate
owners not to speculate in anticipation of a higher future return.
There would be a tendency to infill in the city and make cities
more efficient. ... <br>
<br>
</span>When built, BART (Bay Area CA Rapid Transit) did a study and
found it could run BART free. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">If we had free
mass transit, people would choose to ride instead of drive.</span>
It becomes more efficient and more people use, increasing the
mobility of citizens in the region. If we get people out of cars,
that reduces air pollution, noises, run off, and use of
resources. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It is not just collecting ground rent
but also untaxing
other systems. Untax labor and make it more affordable.</span>
Enterprises
such as recycling and reforestation, weatherization, reconstruction,
and health enterprises are labor
intensive and made more expensive artificially by taxing labor. We
subsidize business: free roads for the timber industry, cheap water
for agribusiness. Stop those subsidies and recycling could
compete. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Now the public is paying for private parties. That is
not fair.</span></small></div>
<ul>
  <small> <span style="font-weight: bold;">If you take taxes off labor
and capital, more investment
flows into jobs, and we would have close to full employment, so labor
could demand full market value for services. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We could double the income of the
average worker with no loss in
standard of living.</span>&nbsp; If fewer demands are placed on
government by
citizens, it doesn't have to borrow so much.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you reduce
the amount of tax on the economy, and reduce the amount of
redeemable notes, then we should be able to eliminate inflation. It
is unmasked. You can see lower prices; the cost of living goes down. It
will change social relationships. Labor and
capital make up, with higher wages for labor, lower taxes for
capital, and more investment funds.&nbsp; Labor can negotiate from a
position of strength. Capital might want to share management
decisions and spread that risk of liability to workers. It tends to
reduce hierarchy and increase equality in society.&nbsp; </small>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
What other social relations might change? Increase land
ownership participation in community and it benefits community, with
town hall meetings and block parties. Those kinds of communities have
less crime.&nbsp; ... <a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Left_Must.html">What the Left Must
Do: Share the Surplus<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What would you do if you could
work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended&#8221;.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unless humanity needs militarism, corporate welfare, and debt
service,
it&#8217;s fair to say most public revenue gets wasted. Demanding a dividend
&#8211; similar to Alaska paying residents a share from oil royalties &#8211;
forces a new dialog on spending priorities. Beyond arguing &#8220;bread not
bombs&#8221;, a dividend replaces expenditures by politicians (necessarily
influenced by donors) with spending by citizens, the people who
generate the
surplus in the first place. With a dividend, citizens get to see
themselves as direct beneficiaries from reigning in the wild spending
spree on imperial aggression, disloyal
multinationals, and on &#8220;borrowing&#8221; money that never existed until
&#8220;lent&#8221; by the Federal Reserve. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Meanwhile, ignoring our common assets guarantees that we
continue to
pay rent rather than begin to receive rent. Conversely, insisting upon
a fair share could <span style="font-weight: bold;">win us the world
we want</span>. While it breaks an old habit to leave jobs behind in
favour of fair distribution, just recognizing surplus empowers people.
It reaffirms the very existence of our commonwealth and challenges the
narrow view of property as exclusively private. While the Left gets
excoriated for wanting to be big spenders, demanding a dividend in lieu
of waste and a shift of taxes from individual effort to social surplus
helps refurbish the Left&#8217;s image.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The call to share the commonwealth enjoys an unshakable moral
base and
gets high marks for real world success, unlike taxes upon true
earnings. Once implemented, sharing rent will grant us leisure &#8211; time
enough to evolve and reconnect with friends, family, and neighbours &#8211;
and drain away fortunes rather than let the fortunate continue to soak
society. Hence support for shifting taxes and paying dividends to the
citizenry grows already, without the Left&#8217;s leadership. It&#8217;s time to
run with the banner of an extra income for everyone, in the halls and
capitols of governments everywhere. To liberate humans from exploitive
labor, let us advance the sharing of society&#8217;s surplus.</small><br>

have to

&nbsp;Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SEP.html"><small><small>How Sharing Earth Brought Peace</small></small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since forever, humans have
claimed and counter-claimed every
square inch of this planet. Occasionally, these disputes have ended
peacefully. What has worked in other times and places might work
again in the Mideast. Delivering a double dividend, what settled land
disputes also developed moribund economies and revived developed
ones. Among others, New York, now aiming to rebuild, has used this
policy before. Because it's growing popular among environmentalists,
greens could lead the US to geonomics.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...&nbsp; </span>These cases
involved different classes, not different cultures.
Yet with a new twist the rent rebate that worked within society may
work between societies. The Koran urges landlords to not gouge
tenants but to consider land a trust. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In Israel, admonished to not
own land forever, since the land is Mine (Leviticus), the National
Trust leases all the land to the occupants. These strictures could
lead to geonomics.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Israel
and Palestine would establish a steward to collect land
dues and disburse rent dividends a la Alaska's oil dividend. </span>Since
land is more valuable in Israel than in Palestine, Jews would pay in
more than Arabs, yet everyone would get back the same. And since
Israelis prosper, they drive up land values; having Jews as co-owners
developing land, raising its value, fattening everyone's Citizens
Dividend Arabs might accept that. Profit does make for strange
bedfellows. Two archrivals, China and Taiwan, recently agreed to
explore for oil together. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">While sharing rent may soothe hurt
feelings, collecting it
stimulates development.</span>&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using geonomics,
people have turned some of the poorest lands into
the richest economies. Hong Kong is a barren rock owned by the
public. The city collects enough site-rent to keep taxes on effort
way down.&nbsp; </span>... </small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Where to draw a line in the sand
becomes a lot less contentious
when land and oil are no longer spoils of war and when neighbors do
not endure drastically different standards of living. Growing up, we
learn to not fight over toys but to take turns. Societies need to
learn this, too. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Early last century, Gifford
Pinchot, first head of the US Forest
Service, said: "The earth belongs of right to all its people and not
to a minority, insignificant in numbers but tremendous in wealth and
power. The people shall get their fair share of the benefit which
comes from the development of the country which belongs to us all
with equal opportunity for all and special privileges for none." A
man in a Republican administration could say that then. We need to
hear it again now. &nbsp; <a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Profit_Urban.html">How Profit
Shapes Urban Space</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Like the rest of the universe, US
cities keep expanding. Some time before the
universe begins to contract, American metro
regions may, too. What counterpart to gravity might suck
suburbia back into the hole of our doughnut cities? One of the most
fundamental forces in the world - money.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>It was the lure of cold cash that drove urbanites out of
downtown.
The usual suspect, the car, was merely a convenient ride. Despite our
present dependency on cars, the drive to profit is powerful enough to
bring people back.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Local governments have begun to modify
the profit motive. Rather than meekly pick up the
ever-rising tab for expanding the infrastructure, some
localities now charge developers a portion of this
cost. While this move may stymie development at the
edge, what&#8217;s&nbsp;
needed is something to draw
development into the
urban core.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> Without spending a penny of subsidy,
cities can make
urban renewal more profitable than
suburban
development. How is about as
commonsensical as
Einsteinian physics, but like "e=mc2",
it works. The trick
is to forget subsidies and lower one
tax while raising
another. That is, levy a tax or charge
a fee to collect
land value while eliminating any tax
on buildings or
improvements.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> The present property tax works
backwards, like an
intruder from the anti-universe. It
increases as owners
improve their property; it decreases
when owners let
buildings dilapidate. "Save money,
create slums," cities
tell owners. ... &nbsp; <a href="../docs/Smith_Profit_Urban.html"><big><big><small><small><span

Markets</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Taxes -- an aspect of politics,
not markets -- motivate misuse of
land.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The tax on buildings
discourages maintenance and breeds slums</span> (Lynn 1973). After the
neighborhood really goes down hill and the owner has milked every last
penny out of the structure, he just walks away. Thus urban cores decay
(Pickard 1966), an entropy that seems inevitable yet is policy-induced<font
 size="-1"><small><b><i>(1).</i></b></small></font> </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In growing areas, custom
design creates more valuable homes, hence more tax liability.</span> To
avoid the penalty, developers can under-build or sacrifice esthetics.
Cookie-cutter developments all in a row reduce built value and property
taxes<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(2)</i></b></small></font>. </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing sales raises the
cost of living while taxing income lowers the ability to afford to live.</span>
Like a vise, regressive taxes squeeze out the discretionary income of
the poor who cannot afford the city they may like. Necessity crams them
into the structures that cut corners. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>While taxes are creatures of
legislatures, ground rent is a
phenomenon of markets.</b> What's political is what we do with it.
Most of us forget it's there, letting it reward speculation and
sprawl. ...</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How long would it take to
ecologize cities after shifting its
property tax? While Johannesburg (South African) levied a rate of
only 3 percent on site value, it enjoyed the fastest site-recycling
rate in the world, a little over 20 years. Within a couple decades,
we could have those cities we'd love.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As cities grow more livable and
lovable, their site values rise.
The resultant increase in land dues would push owners to continually
convert to highest and best use automatically. In this positive
feedback loop, cities would constantly renew.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While generals and anarchists
might not easily find common cause,
planners and markets can, when planners paddle with, not against, the
mighty current of rent. Correcting the market, so that taxes and
rents no longer interfere with the choices of owners and developers,
would attain highest and best use of sites automatically.&nbsp; <a

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SRTS.html">Sharing
Natural Rents to Sustain Human Society</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to
stay rich, some of us can develop
land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract resources,
especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated
city. Under the current rules of doing business, waste returns more
than efficiency. We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and
resource rent -- although rent is a social surplus. As if rent were
not profit enough, winners of rent have also won further state favors
-- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies, and a host of others
designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves,
our civilization, and our
eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we
decide to do with rent, whether we let it reward our exploiting or
our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine society waking up
to the
public nature of rent. Then it would collect and share its surplus
that manifests as the market value of sites, resources, the spectrum,
and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing labor
and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and
automobile....&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Smith_SRTS.html"><big><big><small><small><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wearing pajamas outdoors in the
winter, one wouldn&#8217;t expect
to retain body heat. Yet, people do try to sustain community while
hemorrhaging its commonwealth. Losing it, residents must work more
than necessary.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When residents import food and
energy, they deprive others in the
community of income. Yet, the loss pales when compared to paying
mortgages and [income] taxes. A recent
study of Oakland, CA found torrents of dollars pumped out of town
headed for the treasuries of distant capitols and the bank vaults of
distant lenders. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While mortgages and interest
elevate an elite elsewhere, they keep
debtors on a treadmill at home. To those anxious over every next
payment, how appealing is an economy no longer expanding its girth?
In addition, what&#8217;s their debt for? Credit? The total savings of
all members of a community should suffice. Local bank "used to" be
the norm.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other major drain, taxes, at
about 40% of the average

the playing field, and local recyclers, family farmers, and freight
haulers could compete. Their success would plug the visible leaks -
imported food, energy, and materials.</small></p>

more direct ones &#8211; grants, contracts, and tax favors. To undo
and reverse this history, it's necessary to collect and share the
natural rents from all seven inconspicuous privileges. </small></p>

 style="font-weight: bold;"> would not
only eliminate poverty, it'd also erase any rationale for subsidies -
direct or indirect - to the poor or to the privileged. </span>Repealing
the
free ride of privileges would be like repealing capitalism. Without
those subtle detours imposed upon public revenue, owners would have
to work to amass a fortune, and work is one of the worst ways known
to strike it rich. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What you can do: Dry up the
milkmaid state. Dispense with the
notion that the state must meddle in enterprise. Dispense the notion
from others, too. Focus government on its lone raison d'etre - defend
rights. Demand your right to a fair share of natural revenue. ...&nbsp;

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">What To Do About the
Real Estate Bubble</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What&#8217;s bubbling, and until when?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Sellers are happy. So are developers and speculators. Real
estate has
gone all bubbly, and that bubble has gone ballistic. What goes up,
however, must soon do something else. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Actually, it&#8217;s not housing whose price has entered the
stratosphere. Buildings age &#8211; get older, more worn out. What&#8217;s getting
more valuable is the land, the location &#8211; whether it has a building on
it or not. Buildings you can make more of, but land you can not,
especially locations along the coasts or on the good side of town. None
of that would matter if you could ever get buildings to hover around in
the air. Meanwhile however, speculators are happy.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... What&#8217;s seemingly good for landowners is not necessarily good
for the economy. As people spend more on land, something nobody
produced, they spend less on output, things people do produce. As
producers get less money spent on their products, eventually they take
the hint and produce less. "Produce less" is another way of spelling
recession.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Plus, more expensive land means heavier borrowing to buy it.
More debt means more inflation and less stability. When producers cut
back, borrowers have a much harder time paying back their debts. As
people go bankrupt, they drag others down with them. A collapsing house
of cards is another way of spelling depression.</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preventing bubbles?</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If land values didn&#8217;t get
inflated, of
course they would not have to get deflated.</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Call it mutual compensation for
deprivation from part of our common natural heritage. </span> While in
rhythmic
systems, prices must rise and fall, but they need not boom then bust;
they could climb then glide. What would temper economies, preventing
bubbles? Rather than let a few lucky owners collect land values,
neighbors would have to recover land values for themselves. Nobody made
land, and no lone owner made its value; the presence of society in
general did that. Plus, for excluding everyone else from their sites,
owners owe everyone else, as each one of us owes everyone for excluding
them. </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To recover land value,
government
could either transform the property tax into a land tax or replace it
and other taxes with land dues or land use fees or an annual deed fee.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To pay the land dues, owners use their
land efficiently; owners who had been speculating get busy and develop.</span>
No longer allowed to tax anything that moves, local governments, too,
which presently let acres of abandoned urban land and buildings lie
fallow, get busy, too, and make sure to get those acres into the hands
of ambitious owners who&#8217;ll pay land dues. More locations put to use and
more buildings put up increases supply, which dampens price.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Better still, as government recovers
land rent, that leaves owners with less land rent to capitalize into
land price. Hence buyers need not borrow so much.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Land would still rise in value. With
every discovery of a nearby natural resource. With the opening of every
new bridge. With every techno-advance, as silicon wafers did for
Silicon Valley. With every jump in income and drop in crime, land value
rises. But no longer into a bubble. Because every rise would find its
way &#8211; via land dues and rent dividends &#8211; into everyone&#8217;s pockets. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>If the 18-year average holds for this cycle, then real estate
still has
a few more years of sucking all the investments and purchasing power
out of the rest of the economy. Land is still able to soak it all up,
and lenders are still willing to pump more in. So despite the premature
panic (markets almost never do what everybody says they&#8217;re going to
do), Mankiw&#8217;s 2007 would be the earliest that the current bubble would
burst, and 2008 is just as likely.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Then land prices will fall for a few years. Since the run-up was
steep,
the drop will be, too &#8211; after correcting for inflation, maybe as much
as 50%. Which will be an enormous relief for the economy &#8211; just what
the doctor ordered. With land affordable again, a new cycle can get
under way. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Whether the new one will
be boom and bust or climb and glide is up to us, whether we&#8217;re willing
to practice geonomics, to forego taxes and subsidies in favor of land
dues and a Citizens Dividend.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">While I don&#8217;t mind the current
gambling, I do mind the widening of the cavernous gulf between haves
and have-nots, and I boil over while workweek grows more onerous, and
just seethe watching vacant lots and abandoned buildings push
development out from urban cores to sprawl on suburban farmland. To
reverse that, let&#8217;s let go of the individual owner&#8217;s hold on land rent
and share Earth&#8217;s worth equitably among us all. We&#8217;ll all be glad we
did. </span>...<a href="../docs/Smith_Bubble.html">&nbsp; <big><big><small><small><span
