</span><a name="The_Uncertain_Future_of_the_Metropolis"></a><a
 href="../docs/RybeckW_Metropolis.html">The
Uncertain Future of the Metropolis</a><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The single element that makes me
apprehensive about the future of our cities is our land system.
Tentacles
of our misguided land policies are choking almost every vital aspect of
metropolitan life. This is doubly worrisome, because the full
dimensions of the land problem have barely surfaced in the public
consciousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To put it in the
vernacular, most of us don't know what's eating us. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have scarcely begun to identify the causes of today's city
land
problems. This is not to denigrate the legions of good folk --
officials and citizens alike -- who are trying desperately to cope with
the daily disasters. But without a better notion of what is producing
these disasters, we are unlikely to stem the flood.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A major problem, certainly, is
our
distorted land system that operates around the clock and around the
calendar, and under the full sanction of the law. It rips off the poor,
saps small business, and deprives municipalities of their rightful
revenue.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The people as a whole create
land
values, not only by their presence, but also through participation in
government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Decade after decade, billions of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
landlord-dominated society. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Before that happens, the opportunity
awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>

<a name="What_Affordable_Housing_Problem"></a><a
 href="../docs/RybeckW_WAHP.html">What Affordable Housing Problem?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let me say emphatically that
America has NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROBLEM.
By the time I finish my talk, I hope this startling remark (to help you
wake up this early in the morning) will not appear as ridiculous as it
may seem to you at first glance.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Like all creatures --
goldfinches, squirrels, butterflies, cicadas --
we humans are squatters on this planet. We all need a part of earth for
shelter, nourishment, a work site and a place to raise the next
generation. Otherwise we perish. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>While a select few squat in luxury, those at the bottom of the
heap
haven't a square inch of space to call their own. Carrying bags of
everything they possess, the homeless squat on sidewalks, under
bridges, in condemned buildings, and in public parks (unless police
chase them away), often sitting ducks for predators. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the 1980s, Washington, D.C., was concerned about its growing
army of
homeless. At that time I found there were 8,000 boarded-up dwelling
units in our Nation's Capital -- more than enough to accommodate some
5,000 street people. I also found there were 11,500 privately owned
vacant lots in the District of Columbia, mostly zoned for and suitable
for homes or apartments. Decent housing on these sites held in cold
storage would have provided an alternative for the many low-income
families squatting in places that were overcrowded, overpriced, overrun
with vermin and overloaded with safety hazards.</small><br>
<br>
<small>These issues spurred my research described in a 1988 report, "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Affordable Housing -- A Missing Link</span>."
Evidence from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics and other
sources over a 30-year period revealed the following average cost
increases of items that go into the building and maintenance of housing:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Wages of general building construction workers rose 14
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Wages of special trade construction workers rose 11
percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Construction material costs rose 11.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Combined wage-materials-managerial costs for residential
building rose 12.5 percent a year.</small></li>
  <li><small>Fuel and utility costs for housing rose 13.8 percent a
year. All
of these costs closely tracked the Consumer Price Index which, over
these same 30 years, rose by 12 percent a year. According to those
figures, housing prices and housing rents apparently were held in check</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Why do those statistics not seem
to jibe with what you have been told,
seen with your own eyes, and felt in your own pocketbooks?</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>How to explain that, during the last decade of my research
period, U.S.
households with serious housing problems increased from 19 to 24
millions?</small></li>
  <li><small>What caused the portion of renters paying more than 35
percent of their
income for housing doubled from 21 to 41 percent during the last two
decades of the study period?</small></li>
  <li><small>Why were over 2.4 million renters paying 60 percent or
more of their income for rent?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
The answers would be obvious except that, so far, I have not mentioned
what happened to the price of the land that housing sits on. Many of
those who talk and write about housing conveniently overlook the fact
that <span style="font-weight: bold;">housing does not exist in mid
air but is attached to the land, and
that the price of this land has gone through the stratosphere.</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In contrast to those 11- to
14-percent annual increases in
housing-related costs, residential land values nationwide rose almost
80 percent a year, or almost 2000 percent over those three decades.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>A close friend in Bethesda bought a house and lot there 40 years
ago
for $20,000. Two months ago he sold the property for a cool half
million. That 2400 percent increase was entirely land value. The buyer
immediately demolished the house to put up a larger one, so he clearly
paid half a million for the location value -- the land value -- alone.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Officials, civic leaders and
commentators who bemoan the lack of
affordable housing nevertheless applaud each rise in real estate values
as a sign of prosperity. </span>Seeing their own assets multiply
through no
effort of their own apparently makes them forget the teachers, firemen,
police and low-income people who are boxed out of a place to squat in
their cities and neighborhoods.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Many of our
Founding Fathers, George Washington included, had amassed huge estates.
But the property tax induced them to sell off excess lands they were
not using. ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One
of the many virtues of a tax on land values is that it can be
introduced gradually. Cities that take this incremental approach report
that homeowners-voters-taxpayers hardly notice the change. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What's important in modernizing
your taxation is not the speed of change but the direction you choose.</span>
If you keep the present tax system with its disincentives for compact
and wholesome growth, you will experience the treadmill effect that has
been so familiar in so-called urban and housing "solutions." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">You will
have to keep running faster and faster with patchwork remedies to keep
from sliding backward.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revising taxes as proposed here
will not end the need for
housing subsidies, at least not in the short run, but it will do three
things that should greatly reduce subsidies. </span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One, by deflating land costs it will enable the private
market to offer homes and sites at lower costs. </small></li>
  <li><small>Two, this will shrink the number of families needing
subsidies. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Three, it will stretch subsidy dollars farther because
sites for publicly assisted housing can be acquired far more cheaply.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In Conclusion, I have tried to
show that <span style="font-weight: bold;">America has a housing land
problem, not an affordable housing problem.</span> This problem can be
substantially alleviated by freeing the market of anti-enterprise taxes
and by<span style="font-weight: bold;"> turning the property tax right
side up -- that is, by dropping
tax rates on housing and by raising them on publicly-created land
values. </span></small><small><a href="../docs/RybeckW_WAHP.html"><span

 href="../docs/Rybeck_Diagnosis.html">Wrong Diagnosis Underlies Post's
Pessimism on Smart Growth</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We would be amused if Martian
observers, seeing people with crutches,
concluded that crutches had crippled these folks. Analysts cited in the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post&#8217;s</span> recent
series on sprawl are not from Mars, but many confused the crutches
localities fall back upon as the cause of our region&#8217;s crippling growth
pattern. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Post</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
paints a seemingly hopeless picture because it fails to recognize the
real engines of sprawl &#8212; high land values, land speculation, and
subsidies for development on greenfield sites</span>. Wasteful
scattershot development will outsmart Smart Growth until officials and
voters confront these matters.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">High Land Values.</span> High
land values stem from </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) regional population growth, <br>
2) public works like roads and schools and <br>
3) special natural features like waterfronts. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For example, a 1980
Congressional study found that Metro, still
unfinished, had already generated $2 billion in new land values, &#8220;the
biggest share of these new values&#8230;going to people lucky enough to own
land within easy access of Metro stations.&#8221; Neither Metro nor the
taxpayers who financed it recoup the values they generated.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speculation</span>. Sprawl
starts at
the center of the metropolis and radiates outward. Smith owns a vacant
downtown site. If he builds offices or housing, he invites risks and
sizeable property tax increases. He keeps his parcel in minimal use
like a parking lot. Brown, seeing its potential, offers to buy it. Yet
Smith who enjoys rising land values without effort asks a price so high
that Brown&#8217;s venture can&#8217;t fly. Brown approaches owners of other
first-class parcels, meets the same hurdle, and finally buys a cheaper
second-class site. More &#8220;Browns&#8221; do the same.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Soon Jones and other enterprisers find owners of second- and
third-class sites boosting their asking prices. Owners get away with
this because land hoarding in the core creates an artificial scarcity
of affordable sites. &#8220;Joneses&#8221; are driven farther into the hinterland.
Developers, denied entry by inflated land prices to close-in sites best
suited for their ventures, invade open space. This race to beat
speculators to cheap land fosters<span style="font-weight: bold;">
leapfrog growth</span>. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subsidized Sprawl.</span>
Federal and
state spending on misplaced highways, utilities, schools and the like
subsidize premature urbanization of outlying areas. Tax abatements for
malls lay waste to cornfields and forests and sap the vitality of older
communities. ... </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reality Pursues Sprawl.</span>
As
inflated land costs drive middle income families far from choice
central neighborhoods, their new localities duplicate the police, water
systems and schools left behind, plus roads to get them back to work.
High taxes to construct over-extended public facilities spur new home
seekers to go even farther a field.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
real culprits &#8212; upside-down property tax incentives and
inappropriate infrastructure investments &#8212; make it profitable for land
speculators to keep their prime locations in cold storage, to board up
rental housing, and to block the path of normal growth in appropriate
city and town centers.</span></small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sprawl Can Be Halted. </span>The
challenge is to take the profit out of sprawl so the massive inventory
of skipped-over prime locations can be put to optimal use.
Jurisdictions can deflate high land and housing costs by altering
current taxes that favor land holding rather than land using. Then the
counties&#8217; crutches, short-term palliatives at best, can be discarded.
Only then can Smart Growth rather than sprawl become the dominant
pattern in our region.</small>

Modern-day Feudalism: Land as God&#8217;s Gift</font></small></small></small></font></small></small></small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Calling
for "a modern equivalent of Jubilee," signers of a proposal
fundamentally to revise the property tax structure petitioned the
endorsement of the 1984 General Conference of the United Methodist
Church. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The proposal, which the
conference did endorse, sought to shift
taxes from labor to land values. Combining good biblical theology with
public policy insight, the plan offers a simple but critical tax change
as a way of dealing with "poverty, joblessness, slums, urban decay,
farmland destruction, the erosion of public services and facilities and
social justice."</span></small></font></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The current
property tax combines land and building
taxes; recently, it has become a tax mostly on buildings. As a result,
owner-made building improvements are overtaxed, while land is
under-taxed. And <span style="font-weight: bold;">undertaxing land
encourages its disuse</span>. The Methodist
petitioners&#8217; simple proposal was to tax land, not buildings. The
possibilities are great for achieving social justice through this
easily implemented change in the property tax. ...</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Biblical justice in this instance, as
Walter
Brueggemann asserts, "is to sort out what belongs to whom, and return
it to them." ...</span></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>The
generally held belief that ours is a nation of small landholders is a
myth. According to Gene Wunderlich, quoted in a 1979 <i>Harper&#8217;s </i>article,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
"about 3 percent of the population owns 55 percent of all American
land." And that same 3 per cent holds "95 percent of the private land."</span>
Furthermore, while 64 per cent of families own or are in the process of
buying their residences, the residential sector occupies only 2 per
cent of the 1.3 billion acres of privately held land.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Feudalism,
it seems, is still with us; its new face
is the landlordism that lets a few benefit from what belongs to
society. This lopsided arrangement denies the Bible&#8217;s insistence that
an equitable share of the Lord&#8217;s resources is the birthright of all
humans. While the U.S. is infinitely better off than the countries of
Latin America, Asia and Africa, our situation is worsening. Consider
these facts:</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226; Poor people pay inordinate rents. </span>While
in 1970,
25 per cent of income generally went for rent, today, according to
National Low-Income Housing Coalition reports, that percentage for many
renters, especially the poor, has doubled.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Early in
the century, poor immigrants in New York
City could buy or lease a shop with a fair chance of prospering. Now
many minorities face site costs that almost doom new businesses from
the start. A front foot costs more than the whole lot would have 70
years ago, a startling change even when considering inflation.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>&#8226;Large
firms are deserting the cities for cheaper suburban sites, taking with
them employment and badly needed tax revenues.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226;Large agribusinesses represent only 13 per
cent of
U.S. farms but take in 72 per cent of agricultural sales</span>,
according to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Economic Research Service. At the
other end of the scale, 50 per cent of the farms account for only 3 per
cent of sales.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8226; Land-holding is gaining ascendancy over
land-using.</span> Land speculation -- holding land for its future
worth
rather than putting it into current production -- has become standard
practice for the affluent.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What gives value to land.</span> </i>Any
real estate textbook will explain that the three factors for
determining land value are "location, location and location." And any
property owner will affirm this truth. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But
what generates locational
value? Three phenomena: God, people and public activities.</span></small></font></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small>God the creator, Genesis tells us,
"looked at
everything he had made, and he found it very good." We recognize this
goodness in the fertility of the soil, natural harbors, scenic beauty,
the availability of water, and the subsurface riches of coal, oil,
gold, iron and other substances. The land has a God-given goodness and
is one of the gifts through which God sustains us.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small>People create land values simply
because they are
social beings, consumers and producers. The more people concentrated on
a piece of land, the higher its value. The press of population
intensifies the demand for homes, jobs and services; this is what makes
Manhattan far more valuable than downtown Richmond, Virginia, and
Richmond more valuable than Anderson, Indiana, and Anderson more
valuable than an uninhabited Utah crossroad.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small>Finally, the public or government
generates land
values by providing streets, schools, police protection and other
infrastructures. Opening a subway system for the District of Columbia
in 1976 gave Washington&#8217;s blighted downtown a new lease on life. The
subway and its riders are stimulating the economy along all of its
corridors. According to a 1981 congressional study, "a minimum of $2
billion in land values has already been added to the existing land
value base." However, it concluded that "only a trickle" of these new
values finds its way back to local government through the property tax.
The biggest share goes to people "lucky enough to own land within easy
access of Metro stations." </small></font></small></li>

 style="font-weight: bold;">The immorality of landlordism.</span> </i>An
increasingly small elite is taking possession of the nation&#8217;s land,
enabling them to squeeze more and more from the landless. This is
runaway landlordism, and current public policy fuels its progress.</small></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>On the
federal level, while the wages of ordinary
workers find no shelter from the Internal Revenue Service, exemptions
and special preferences for landowners whittle down their taxes or turn
real estate losses into profits. The 1986 Tax Reform Act aims to reduce
these privileges, but landowners&#8217; past ingenuity in avoiding taxation
warrants continued vigilance over tax structures. At the local level,
the property tax rises for owners who build or improve their homes,
rental apartments or commercial buildings, while it is reduced for
those who let their land go fallow. Compare the following situation of
the Joneses, the Smiths and the Greens.</small></font></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Joneses have a well-maintained home. </span>The local
tax office, seeing that they have has added air conditioning, a
recreation room and a new roof, raises their assessment. Never mind
that the Joneses improved their neighborhood and generated jobs and
business. The result will be higher taxes not only this year, but as
long as they keep the house in good condition.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Smiths&#8217; home of the same size and age is an
eyesore. </span>The yard is full of junk, gutters are rusted, screens
are
torn, paint is peeling. The tax office says it is worth less than last
year. The Smiths&#8217; taxes are reduced, a "reward" for blighting the
community.</small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="+0"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
Greens do not use their lot at all. </span>They offer
no production or housing on it. For wasting the site&#8217;s potential, they
enjoy the lowest tax bill of the three.</small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Overtaxing
good land use while under-taxing blight
and empty lots invites slumlords and encourages land speculators. This
type of landlordism -- or modern feudalism -- is an injustice. It
allows individual landowners to siphon off the lion&#8217;s share of land
values.</small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small><i
 style="font-weight: bold;">The ethical foundations of land value
taxation. </i>The
biblical Jubilee prescription -- redividing the land every half century
-- may have been feasible for a people practicing crude agriculture.
However, a modern civilization cannot reshuffle the land without
confiscating unmovable property or discouraging economic progress. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
land value plan suggested here -- increasing land taxes, while
decreasing taxes on labor, production and buildings -- achieves the
same Jubilee goal without negative effects. It lets everyone share the
economic value of the land rather than the land itself, just as a
corporation, instead of carving up physical portions of itself each
year, lets shareholders enjoy portions of the profit. ...<br>
</span></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="+0"><small>Poverty,
joblessness and homelessness have been
central concerns of religious social-action groups. There is a growing
awareness that neither private nor public charity is sufficient in
dealing with these problems. Shifting property taxes offers an
effective way to encourage public policy to be responsive to blighted
cities, farm dislocation, declining industries, chronic unemployment
and growing poverty. The need to infuse biblical principles into
solutions for these problems seems imperative. Acknowledgment of this
necessity is already evident in the Catholic bishops&#8217; pastoral letter
on the economy and parallel works by the Presbyterians, United
Methodists and the United Church of Christ. The need to address
poverty&#8217;s basic causes, including the unhealthy concentration of
America&#8217;s land and resources in the hands of so few owners -- who have
tended to misappropriate land values -- ought to be high on our
religious and public policy agendas.</small></font></small></p>
