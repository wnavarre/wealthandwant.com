      Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The U.S. tax system is widely perceived as too complex, too intrusive, and
      too demanding of workers&#8217; paychecks. Taxes today claim a greater share
      of the average family&#8217;s budget than food, clothing, housing, and
      transportation combined.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> In 2005, the
      average American had to work 107 days just to pay taxes, compared to 44 days
      in 1930.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2 </span></small></p>
  <p> Tax reform proposals, not surprisingly, are popular among voters and the
      politicians who represent them. President George W. Bush created an advisory
      panel on tax reform. Some economists and institutes have proposed reforms to
      flatten and simplify the income tax, or to replace it entirely with a national
      sales or consumption tax or value-added tax. <br>
          <br>
      These would be an improvement, but if we seek to reform taxes, we should consider
      all the possibilities and choose, as <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Milton
      Friedman</a> puts it, the &#8220;least bad&#8221; tax. <br>
          <br>
          Even a relatively flat income tax imposes what economists call a &#8220;deadweight
      loss&#8221; or &#8220;excess burden&#8221; on society. Taxes on productive
      activity increase the price of labor or goods beyond economic costs, and
      so reduce the quantity provided. This reduction in production, income,
      and investment
      is a misallocation of resources. Resources are wasted because they do not
      go to where they are most wanted. We can reduce this excess burden by reducing
      taxes, but changing the type of tax can also reduce this deadweight loss.
      Economists
      recognize that if we tap for public revenue a resource whose quantity is
      fixed, the excess burden disappears. The tax does not reduce the supply
      and does not
      increase prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align: right;"></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This might seem too good to be true, but in fact, such a resource exists everywhere
    and is indispensable for human action. That resource is land. The supply is fixed,
    immobile, and inherently visible. If land value is taxed, the land will not flee,
    shrink, or hide. A tax on land value has no deadweight loss. If the purpose of
    tax reform is to reduce the extra costs imposed on the economy, a tax on land
    value does this
    far better than any tax on income or goods.<br>
    <br>
    If you currently pay property taxes on a home or business, you may be shaking
    your head at this point. You are not eager to read about a proposal that would
    make your taxes even more onerous. But the proposal here is not to increase taxes
    but to <span style="font-style: italic;">shift
    and reduce</span> taxation. Unless you own a valuable vacant lot, the proposal
    presented below would most likely <span
 style="font-style: italic;">reduce </span>your total tax bill, since if fully
    implemented it abolishes taxes on your earnings and spending, and it also eliminates
    the portion of real property taxes that falls on
    buildings and other improvements.<br>
    <br>
    The tax reform presented here is not new. It has been working to some degree
    in many cities and countries around the world. The idea probably obtained its
    greatest popularity in the U.S. in the late 1800s, when the economist Henry George
    analyzed taxing land value and untaxing
    labor and capital in his book, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span>.<br>
    <br>
    Many economists have since then expanded on George&#8217;s writing, examining
    both the theory and the evidence. There is even a &#8220;Henry George
    Theorem,&#8221; which proves that in a community with optimal population, the
    land rent equals the value of the community&#8217;s public goods. Modern economics
    thus affirms George&#8217;s theory in a more comprehensive and more rigorous
    form, although the empirical question of how much revenue could be obtained
    from rent would benefit from more research.<br>
    <br>
    An advance on George made by Spencer Heath, Spencer MacCallum, myself, and others
    has been to apply the economic concept of rent-based public revenue to private
    communities, showing that proprietary communities such as hotels, as well as
    associations such as condominiums, in effect use site rentals for their revenue,
    with the implication that most government programs could be shifted to private
    communities, where the rentals would be collected by contract. Examining this
    application would take us away from the focus of tax reform and the analysis
    of land rent for government revenue, but it is useful to point out that economic
    actors in a competitive market use rentals to pay for public goods because that
    is most efficient.
    <div style="text-align: right;"></div>
  </p>
  <p>The use of land value or land rent for public revenue thus has proponents
      today, but their voices have not been widely heard in the debate over tax reform,
      and there are also opponents. The purpose of this report is to give greater
      voice to land value taxation and to better inform those interested in tax reform
      about this alternative. We can best judge among options when we consider the
      whole range of possibilities. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole proposal</a></p>

normal tenant would pay for the
use of
land. Economists have divided the resources that go into production

portion that goes to landowners is rent. ...</small><br>

to the civic works. This is the infrastructure such as streets, parks,

<br>
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span>:
This paper presents
an analysis of what is termed &#8220;geo-rent,&#8221; what the
plot-devoid-of-improvements would rent for in an auction. Most of the
public finance literature and current thought has disvalued and
misunderstood the actual and potential role of land and its rent for
public revenue. The qualities of land value that make it a superior
source of revenue &#8212; having little or no deadweight loss, and
capitalizing civic infrastructure and services &#8212; are recognized but
compartmentalized, ignored in the broader policy discussions. That the
&#8220;producer surplus&#8221; is in reality mostly land rent is little recognized.
The &#8220;Henry George Theorem&#8221; that rent can optimally equal the cost of
public goods is not applied to policy issues. Public finance theorists
and economists generally presume that land rent is an insignificant
portion of national income, whereas studies have estimated that a
substantial portion of government revenue could be obtained from
geo-rent. The shunting aside and disparagement of public revenue from
geo-rent has distorted economic analysis and contributes to iatrogenic
economy-hampering fiscal policy. The paper proposes a broader and more
integrated public economics which recognizes the fundamental role of
land in economies and fully incorporates the analysis of public revenue
from land rent.<br>
<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/auth/docs/Foldvary_Living_Wage.html"><br>
</a></small></div>
<a href="../docs/Foldvary_Living_Wage.html">The Living Wage<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a proposal in San
Francisco, California, to
establish a minimum wage of $11 per hour for companies that provide
services or lease land from the city. Those who favor this argue that
the high cost of living in San Francisco warrants requiring this wage
floor so that those workers can afford housing and other living
expenses. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><a href="../docs/Churchill_LPCP.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If many workers in the city were to receive
a net
increase in wages, this extra money would be a pot of gold for their
landlords.</span></a> </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Those landlords not under rent control would be able to
raise the rents of their low-income tenants, since if the tenant could
afford to live there before the raise, he can also afford it if the
higher rent brings him back to the same after-rent income. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Those
tenants in rent-controlled apartments would get a double subsidy, rent
and wages, increasing the inequality between those with privileges and
those who were not lucky enough to get the government grants.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">So the effect of local "living
wage" laws are
generally higher taxes, higher rents and fewer services for the
residents, greater inequality, and not that much improvement in the
well-being of the poorest workers and of the city community.</span> The
superficial appeal of this programs that only treats the effects of
poverty dissolves when subjected to economic analysis.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The fundamental reason why the least-able workers
have low wages is that their labor has a low productivity and that a
large chunk of their wage is taken away by taxes. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The best remedy is to deal with the root
cause of the problem: change the school system to raise the educational
level of the students, and stop taxing wages when earned or spent.
Shift the tax base from wages to land rent.</span> These reforms would
raise the pure market wages of the least able workers. Then employers
would willingly pay the higher wages because the workers are worth
it.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Living_Wage.html">Read the whole

<a href="../docs/Foldvary_Well_being.html">Well being and being well off</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I see three ways in which one
can define "well off." </small><br>
<small><b>First,
one is better or worse off relative to the distribution of wealth or
income in a particular society. ... </b></small><br>
<small><b> Secondly, being well off can be thought of as relative to
the typical person in the economy. ...</b></small><br>
<small><b>Third, one can define "well off" in absolute terms. ...</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Being absolutely well off means, </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>first, that one is able to rise substantially above
subsistence through peaceful and honest means, whether from one's
labor, from one's rightful share of natural and contractual benefits,
or from gifts.</small></li>
  <li><small>Secondly, to be absolutely well off requires complete <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">liberty</span>, so that the only legal
restriction is the prohibition of coercive harm to others. Liberty
includes security against attack, either by government or by private
persons, since one is not really free if one is under substantial
threats of death and theft against which one is helpless.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> With liberty, one is free to
establish whatever relationships
one wishes, so long as others are also willing. With liberty and the
ability to obtain wealth, one can obtain assurance of future wealth
both because one is able to earn it and also because one is able to
store wealth and insure oneself against risk.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> My Dictionary of Free-Market
Economics defines "well-being" as
"The amount and degree to which individuals in an economy are able to
pursue and attain their ends." <b>The only requirement for absolute
well being, for someone who is mentally and physically able to
produce wealth, is liberty.</b> With liberty, one can obtain wealth,
friends, and future security, express oneself as one pleases, and
enjoy life in accord with one's values and lifestyle preference.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Being absolutely well off does
not involve any particular
level of wealth beyond subsistence, since this depends on personal
preference. An artist may prefer to live at subsistence and devote
her time to art, and that person is absolutely well off because she
is pursuing happiness in her own way. As with relative well being,
one can be well off in the absolute sense without being happy, as for
example a person who has much wealth but has lost love or has a
serious illness.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
What is required for there to be complete liberty? </span>There must
be a basic law such that any act that does not invade the domain of
others is not prohibited or taxed. In liberty, there are only
prohibitions if there are victims who are coercively harmed, and
there is restitution for damages to others. In liberty, people have
equal rights and no special legal privileges. In a free society,
nobody starves, because one is able to save for the future, because
on obtains one's equal share of natural and civic benefits, and
because the sympathy of society will not let people starve.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The economic policy of liberty
has four rules:</small></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <li><small>To the creator belongs the creation.</small></li>
    <li><small>The profit of nature's creation belongs equally to all.</small></li>
    <li><small>The benefit of what is created by government belongs to
all the people in its jurisdiction.</small></li>
    <li><small>When the initial distribution is just, the outcomes of
free exchange are just and should not be hampered.&nbsp; <a

<a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged or
Rights-Deprived?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law."
A
privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
right.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the
money.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in
special
protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
of their earnings from labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to
employers
and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and
labor,
and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
their right to work and save!</small><br>
<br>
<small>The biggest privilege world-wide is subsidies to
landowners.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>There has been confusion about what is a right and what is a
privilege. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Some consider a patent a privilege, but it too is a right. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Some also consider a corporation to be a privilege, since the
firm has
a charter from a government.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Real privileges are favors arbitrarily given to some groups and
not others.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers
and those
who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
These people lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small> <small><a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Read
