<a href="../docs/davies_Top10Land.html">The Top Ten Reasons Why Land is
More Important than Ever</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The <a
 href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/rem0.htm">Georgist
economic proposal</a> insists on the primary importance of land as a
factor in the economy. Many people dismiss that as a quaint, agrarian
notion. "Perhaps," they scoff, "land was that significant back when
most people had to work the soil for a living, but modern agriculture
has moved far past that! Nowadays we deal with modern issues of
technology, global markets, information -- land is no longer a big
deal."<br>
10. There's no place to dump your trash for free. ...<br>
9. Scratch a financial crisis, find a real estate bubble. ...<br>
8. Information (like railroads) needs routes. ...<br>
7. Cities can no longer afford to be inefficient. ... <br>
6. Global climate change is too likely to ignore. ...<br>
5. The loss of biological diversity cannot be reversed. ...<br>
4. Two out of every five people lack a safe and dependable
source of drinking water. ...<br>
3. The myth of overpopulation causes cultural sickness. ...<br>
2. We have forgotten what nations are. ...<br>
1. "The land shall not be sold forever, for ye are strangers
and sojourners with Me." ...<br>

<a href="../docs/Davies_Ownership.html">Ownership and the Law</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>President Bush's announcement of
his vision for an "ownership society"
met with thunderous cheers at the Republican Convention, and much
eye-rolling elsewhere. The Bush Administration would like to start by
encouraging private ownership of our retirement funds and our
health-care decisions. They want to get the heavy hand of government
out of such things and unleash the tremendous efficiency of millions
upon millions of Self-Interested Individual Actors, the husky,
brawling, broad-shouldered capitalism that made this country great.
Prosperity depends on the security of private property and the potency
of individual initiative! This is the self-evident truth that has been
obscured by Hollywood Socialists, Democratic Girlie-men and purveyors
of the Homosexual Agenda.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We should realize, however, that this is hardly a new
initiative. It is
really just the latest wave of an argument that has raged throughout
the history of the United States, about just what -- if anything -- and
on what basis -- if any -- the government can require us to surrender
what we possess. There are some people out there -- and actually a fair
number, after all -- who don't view the Bush Administration's
privatization proposals as extremist at all -- but, rather, too soft.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unfortunately, though, the law is not at all clear. Thomas
Jefferson
fudged the topic in the United States Declaration of Independence,
inserting "the pursuit of happiness" where people expected the more
loaded term "property". The Bill of Rights, however, is strong on
property rights. It provides for security of "persons, houses, papers,
and effects," that "private property shall not be taken for public use
without just compensation" and that rights not specifically prohibited
are reserved to the states or to the people. In fact, the US
Constitution was so bullish on property that it provided for private
property in human beings, a principle made explicit in Dred Scott vs.
Sandford and many other cases. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Slavery was made unconstitutional by means of the 13th Amendment
in
1865. This, however, left much to be resolved, and the Congress had a
very difficult job -- perhaps, in strictly logical terms, an impossible
job -- in drafting Amendment number fourteen.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The 14th amendment reaffirms the rights of life, liberty and
property,
and binds the states to the same due process and equal protection
restrictions as the federal government. However, it places the
Constitution's first limit on the right of property, stating that the
United States or any state shall not pay "any claim for the loss or
emancipation of any slave". This could be seen as somewhat fishy in
terms of the Fifth Amendment. After all the 13th amendment had taken
the slaveholders' property three years before. Had not the Supreme
Court ruled that slaves were property and had to be returned to their
owners, even if they escaped to non-slaveholding states?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Although it would have been impracticable (to say the least) to
enforce
the Takings Clause to the tune of the market value of some four million
human beings, that was what the Constitution required the government to
do.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The next amendment to the Constitution following the
Reconstruction
Amendments was another milestone in the debate over property rights.
The 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913, allows Congress to &#8220;lay and
collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived&#8221; -- contravening
the restriction of this practice that had been laid out in Article I.
The &#8220;from whatever source derived&#8221; part has been making people scream
bloody murder ever since. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The original advocates of the income tax (many of them Single
Taxers)
sought to tax accumulation, not industry and initiative. They saw that
the massive concentration of wealth among a privileged few was harmful
to the nation, and they persuaded the states to accept a progressive
tax that would compel robber barons to pay for public goods while
letting entrepreneurs gain from their contributions to overall
prosperity. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">And yet, over
the years, a tax on income &#8220;from whatever
source derived&#8221; came, one loophole at a time, to be a tax on exactly
those productive, hardworking, middle-class people that it was designed
to help. ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span>In
most people's minds, after all, land is the most solid and important
kind of property; in fact, the word "property" in general conversation
most often means "land". However, it has long been recognized that
sometimes privately-held land must be taken for public purposes. The
principle of eminent domain is not (particularly) controversial. If the
state wants to put a highway through your house, it must pay you the
fair market value of your property.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"></span>This
decision was important because it extended the Takings doctrine
beyond physical seizure to the taking of value -- but it was also
relatively uncontroversial in that the state legislature had removed
all of the parcel's market value.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>If government were to be held liable for every single action
that took
away a portion of real estate value, it could scarcely do anything at
all. That might be how some of the most strident militia-folk would
like it. However, it would certainly not suit real estate owners in
general -- who, while they might not enjoy paying for government, do
benefit from the things that government does.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What the property-rights folks are forgetting (or disregarding)
is that
if a piece of land has a market value, that means that the net benefits
conferred upon it by the community (which includes the government) are
greater than the net costs. Location value is far and away the most
important component of land value -- and location value is almost
entirely the result of services and infrastructure that the government
provides. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>It's no accident that the issue of "regulatory takings" is such
a stew
of contradictions. Indeed, the terms of the argument deny the
possibility of coherence (in much the same way as they did in 1868).
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Land is not the fruit of
human labor, and its value is not the result
of any actions taken by its owner. Therefore, private property in land
is an entirely different sort of phenomenon than private property in
the products of labor -- and as long as the law fails to recognize this
fact, it cannot hope to make sense of the issue of "regulatory takings".</span>
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>It could be suggested that "the conditions of the grant" could,
without
doing any violence to the secure right of private property, require the
payment to the community of the land's rental value, to cover the cost
of the community's expenses which, it turn, provide the land's value in
the first place. That would, of course, require a clearer definition of
the moral basis of property that the United States has ever been able
to come to. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yet -- think of
it for a moment -- what would have happened
if the original Bill of Rights had articulated the individual's
absolute right to property only in the products of labor -- and the
community's right to the community-created value of the land?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>It would have saved us an awful lot of trouble. True, the
"slavery"
states would have balked at joining the union under those rules. But
under them, the nation would have been so prosperous that they would
quite soon have seen the advantage of joining. We would have avoided
the Civil War, and probably even World War I -- it is dazzling to think
about how different -- and vastly better -- our history would have
been, had the Framers taken the brave step of setting forth the moral
basis of property along these lines.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It's interesting that we use the word "own" to mean two
different
things: the sense of possession, and the sense of personal
acknowledgment, as in "owning up" to one's responsibilities. The
relationship between the two was once closer than it now seems to be;
the word "ought" is an archaic past participle of "owe". As we consider
how to arrange our "ownership society", we'd do well to remember what
we "ought" -- and bring the two senses of the word back together.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="../docs/Davies_Cat_NYC.html">The Cat in New York</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When I taught at the <a
 href="http://www.henrygeorgeschool.org/">Henry George School in New
York</a>, our
Director, George Collins, used to give a stirring graduation speech
to students. He told them they would find that the gift of insight
they'd been given, in studying Georgist political economy, was also a
kind of curse: they would never look upon their city with the same
eyes. The land question and its ramifications, the malignant
absurdities of today's economic systems and the sheer obviousness of
the remedy, would shout at them in every day's news.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I was reminded of that when I
recently visited New York. We stayed
with cousins in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which is by all accounts one of
the sanest and most pleasant neighborhoods in the city. Things were
still running there: the coffee shops, the restaurants, Prospect
Park, the Library, the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Well, now, in the
Park, actually, the zoo was about to close because of budget cuts;
the Mayor had suggested that devotees of the zoo should perhaps
secure sources of private funding to keep it open.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists note in this budget
crunch, as in others the city has
faced, a curious disconnect between the fiscal crisis and the overall
economy. Tax receipts are way down and the budget outlook is indeed
scary, even while the underlying economy actually lurches toward
recovery. If it weren't for the large declines in the (admittedly,
very important) financial and tourism sectors, the city's economy
would not be performing badly at all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">How
unfortunate, then, that New
York will see no other alternative than to choke off economic
recovery by raising income and sales taxes while cutting back on
public services. But what can they do? The tax base is declining.</span></small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Or is it? It
turns out that land values in New York, while
modestly down in some areas, have not taken anywhere near the beating
that the Stock Market has, or the small business community, or public
services. No, the real estate market in New York City remains, all in
all, quite bullish. There are few bargains to be had. Residential
rents, of course, having been held artificially low by rent
stabilization, provide no relief even in a weak market.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, no -- despite the dire
warnings, New York City need not endure
a fiscal crisis. Its tax base -- properly defined -- is robustly
capable of providing for public needs, while actually bringing
business into the city. <span style="font-weight: bold;">They have
just been taxing the wrong things,
all along. Tourists, bulls and bears come and go, but New York City's
land values -- like its citizens -- are quite resilient.</span></small></p>
<br>
<a href="../docs/Davies_Soc_Cap_Geoism.html">Socialism, Capitalism and
Geoism</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It may seem odd that both
"capitalists" and "socialists" speak of the
justice of their system and the vile in-justice of their opponents'.
(Of course, the emotion behind such discussions is often heightened by
a kind of home-team fervor.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there any
universal standard of justice
upon which economic policy can be based?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The answer lies in clarifying
the question of the rightful basis (if
there is one) of public vs. private ownership. For the thorough-going
free-market capitalist, "public ownership" of anything is anathema: the
community's interests are best served by the unhindered interactions of
self-interested producers and traders.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the poverty, suffering and
environmental destruction that come under such a "private property"
regime cannot be denied. </span>Because of this, the great bulk of
social-policy debate revolves around how much of the efficiency of free
enterprise must be traded for public interference, imposed in the name
of equity. The question of the rightful balance between public and
private control becomes one of expediency and political fashion,
lacking any guiding principle. Indeed, modern "neoclassical economics"
denies that any such principle exists.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For Henry George, however, the
principle was clear. The value of
natural opportunities belongs entirely to the community, and the
production of wealth by labor, using capital, should be entirely
unhindered by the penalty of taxation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For George, the most important
question was not the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">amount </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should be taken by
the
community, but the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">kind </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should rightfully
go to the
community, because it is a value that the community has created.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>In recent years, this understanding of the distinctive character
of
natural opportunity (land) as a factor of production has led to the
coining of a new term: Geoism, indicating a philosophy based on the
rightful understanding of the place of the Earth (Geo-) in economic
life.</small>
