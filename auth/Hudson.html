<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>What is missing from the discussion is a sense of
proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
the stock market -- much less in new offerings -- but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>This policy brief seeks to elucidate the role of real estate in
the
capital gains issue, indicating the quantitative orders of magnitude
involved.. We offer two main observations.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">generous </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">capital
consumption allowances (CCAs) </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">greatly
magnify the proportion of real estate income taken as taxable capital
gains.</span> Capital gains accrue not only on newly constructed
buildings, of course, but also on land and old buildings being sold and
resold. Our tax code allows for properties to be re-depreciated by
their new owners after a sale or swap, permitting real estate investors
to recapture principal again and again on the same structure. When CCAs
have been excessive relative to true economic depreciation, as they
were during the 1980s, capital gains have been commensurately larger
than the actual increase in property prices. As Charts la and lb
illustrate, capital consumption allowances in real estate dwarf those
in other industries.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold;">very little of
real
estate cash flow is taxable as ordinary income, so the capital gains
tax is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate
industry.</span> CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments
combine to exempt most of real estate cash flow from the income tax.
This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public
finance onto other taxpayers.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
central conclusion of our study is
that better statistics on asset
values and capital gains are needed -- or, more to the point, a better
accounting format. The economic effects of a capital gains tax depend
upon how the gains are made. </span>The present GNP/NIPA format fails
to
differentiate between wealth and overhead; between value from
production and value from obligation. In particular, theory and
measurement should distinguish real estate from other sources of
capital gains -- aid, within the category of real estate, distinguish
land from built improvements. Markets for immovable structures and for
land have distinctive inherent features<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small> and
are shaped by distinctive institutional constraints.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our second major conclusion is
that, at least until
re-depreciation of second-hand buildings is disallowed, a capital gains
tax cut would be unlikely to stimulate much new investment and
employment from its largest beneficiary, the real estate industry.
</span>Depreciation allowances and mortgage interest absorb so much of
the
ongoing cash flow as to leave little taxable income. Mortgage interest
payments, which now consume the lion&#8217;s share of cash flow, are
tax-deductible, while CCAs offset much of what remains of rental
income. On an industry-wide basis, in fact, NIPA statistics reveal that
depreciation offsets <span style="font-style: italic;">more </span>than
the total reported income. As Charts 2a, 2b, and 2c illustrate, real
estate corporations and partnerships have recently reported net losses
year after year.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The result is that real estate
corporations pay minimal income
taxes -- some $1.3 billion in 1988, just one percent of the $137
billion
paid by corporate America as a whole.</span><small
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></small>
Comparable figures are not available on non-corporate income tax
liability, but the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, and real estate)
reported negative income of $3.4 billion in 1988, out of a total $267
billion of non-farm proprietors&#8217; income.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>These
three symbiotically linked sectors thus were left with only capital
gains
taxes to pay on their cash flow.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The central point for capital gains tax policy is that taxable
capital
gains in real estate consist of more than just the increase in land and
building prices. They represent the widening margin of sales price over
the property&#8217;s depreciated value.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Excessive
depreciation allowances thus convert ordinary income into capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains. Moreover,
capital gains are the only point at which most real estate income is </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">taxed&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small>While it is often true that the prospect of earning capital
gains is
what induces new investment to be made, applying further rate cuts to
real estate gains cannot be expected to spur much new construction
activity under present fiscal institutions. Clearly a &#8220;capital&#8221; gains
tax cut cannot cause the production of more land; land (as distinct
from capital improvements) is made by nature, not by the
landowner.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"></span>Sound
tax policy requires an understanding of the fiscal
assumptions which underlie our tax code and the mythical world of
national income accounting. Far from being a potent stimulus to new
investment, a general capital gains tax cut would preferentially
benefit owners of already depreciated buildings speculators in already
seasoned stocks, leading to further deterioration of economic health.
It cannot be expected to raise the volume of capital gains declared by
enough to increase the total tax revenue generated.</small><br>
<br>
<small><small><big style="font-weight: bold;">Depreciation and
Capital Gains</big></small></small><br>
<small><small><big style="font-weight: bold;"></big></small>Much of the
statistical measurement problem derives from
the fact that capital gains in real estate differ from those in other
industries. While all investors presumably would prefer to take their
income in non-taxable forms and to defer whatever tax obligation is
due, the tax benefits to the real estate industry have no analog in
manufacturing, agriculture, power generation, transportation, wholesale
and retail trade, or other services. Corporations in these sectors pay
taxes on their net incomes. Out of their after-tax earnings they then
pay dividends, on which stockholders in turn must pay income tax. By
contrast, little or none of the rental cash flow received by real
estate investors is taxable, because generous capital consumption
allowances are treated as costs and deducted from the net income
reported to the IRS. </small><br>
<br>
<small>The effect of calculating capital gains for real estate on the
basis of
depreciated book values may be illustrated by the following example. A
building bought in 1985 has probably been fully written off today,
thanks to the generous CCAs enacted by the 1981 tax code that remained
in place through 1986. For a parcel bought in 1985 for $100 million and
sold today for $110 million, the recorded gain is not merely the 10
percent increase in market price, but <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the entire value of the
building</span>, perhaps $65 million based on the real estate
industry&#8217;s average land-to-building assessment ratios.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Industrial investors must pay tax on their accruals of unsold
inventories as they mount up, <span style="font-style: italic;">as if</span>
they were sold for cash. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Thus the
putative
beneficiaries of cutting capital gains taxes -- direct investors&nbsp;
-- suffer
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">less from
high capital
gains tax rates than from the treatment of much of their </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">capital gain as
ordinary income, which is taxed at higher rates. In real estate, on the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">other hand,
depreciation effectively converts much of ordinary income to capital
gains.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The greatest accounting distortion for the real estate industry
occurs
in the case of re-depreciation of buildings that already have been
depreciated at least once. This redepreciation occurs following
ownership transfers; the CCA is attached not to the physical asset, but
to the change of ownership. As the building is resold at rising prices,
investors are allowed to re-depreciate them again and again -- and to
write off these CCAs against their income, as if they were suffering an
erosion of wealth. Thus, most capital gains in real estate represent
&#8220;repeat gains&#8221; over unrealistically written-down book values. This
accounting fiction enables real estate investors to continue
indefinitely to take their income in the lightly taxed form of capital
gains.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Landlords already deduct from earnings as normal business
expenses
their maintenance and repair expenditures, undertaken to counteract the
wear and tear of buildings. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A rule of
thumb in the real estate industry
is that such expenditures typically consume about ten percent of rental
revenue.</span> More importantly, although nearly all&nbsp;land
gains are made fully taxable, there is little reason to assume that
physical deterioration should be compensated by a special allowance to
enable the landlord to
recover his capital investment within a given number of years.</small><br>
<br>
<small>... Significantly, today these buildings have been fully
depreciated
and therefore are probably about to be sold, at least for book-keeping
purposes -- owners may buy their own buildings under different
partnerships, or swap them for similar buildings with other owners.
Their new owners can begin to depreciate them all over again, after
duly paying capital gains taxes on the buildings&#8217; increase over their
near-zero book value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">If they do not sell and
re-depreciate their buildings, the owners will have to begin paying
income taxes on their operating cash flow that hitherto was sheltered
by depreciation allowances that have now run out. This lends a renewed
note of urgency to the persistent campaign to cut capital gains tax
rates.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Because excessive depreciation allowances favor real estate
speculation
relative to industrial production, they discourage new direct
investment and employment. To reduce the capital gains tax -- the only
significant remaining source of federal revenue from real estate --
would divert even more savings into the purchase and sale of existing
buildings. </small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How Mortgage
Debt Converts Rent into Interest</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Depreciation rules are not the only
reason why the real estate
sector declares little taxable income. Out of their gross rental
income, landlords pay state and local property taxes, a tiny modicum of
income tax, and interest on their mortgage debt. A large proportion of
cash flow is turned over to lenders as mortgage payments. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Since the
early 1970s, interest paid by the real estate industry has been much
larger than the figures reported for net rental income.</span>... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Most cash flow now ends up neither with developers nor with the
tax
authorities, but as interest paid to banks, insurance companies and
other mortgage lenders. In fact, <span style="font-weight: bold;">mortgage
interest now absorbs seven
percent of national income, up from just one percent in the late 1940s</span>.
... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Real estate is pledged to mortgage lenders as collateral in case
the
promised interest payments fail to materialize. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Capital gains have been
collateralized into new and larger loans decade after decade,
increasing the mortgage burden that transforms rental income and
depreciation allowances into interest payments. Ultimately, the
financial rentiers end up with most of the cash flow which landlords --
and government tax collectors -- relinquish.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>... The result is that the FIRE sector as a whole has been
subsidized at
the expense of direct industrial investors and consumers. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Chart 5 tracks the relative growth of the finance, insurance,
and real
estate sector using Labor Department employment figures. It shows that
what the classical economists called &#8220;productive&#8221; labor has remained
constant since 1929, while virtually all growth has been in government
(mainly state and local) and private sector services -- mainly in the
FIRE
sector. Tax subsidies may largely explain why the FIRE sector has been
the most rapidly growing part of the economy over the past half
century. This is the conceptual context in which we should view the
NIPA statistics. </small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The effective rate is further reduced by numerous exclusions and
exemptions.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>No capital gains duties are levied on estates passing to heirs.
Indeed,
inheritors of real estate may begin re-depreciating their
income-yielding buildings afresh at the new (typically higher) transfer
price. The estates bequeathed by the richest one percent of the
population (over $600,000
in value) are now taxed at a 55 percent rate if not sheltered, but of
course these are the estates most likely to shelter inheritance and
gift bequests. For instance, assets given as gifts are taxed only at
the time they come to be sold.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">30</span></small> If
the capital gains tax were reduced or abolished, the deferral would
become
permanent. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Most capital gains reaped by business partnerships accrue to
real
estate firms, which shelter personal income by avoiding incorporation.
IRS statistics ranking capital gains in terms of how long the assets
were held show that many of these gains represent quick &#8220;flips." Often
these are land that has been rezoned from a low-value to a high-value
use. Retaining the capital gains tax would have little effect on
deterring such speculation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Reported capital gains in real estate were understated as a
result of
exclusions. On the other hand, much direct investment included the cost
of land, commercial buildings, and plant and equipment. Taking this
into account, we estimate that roughly 70 percent of the capital gains
calculated by the IRS for 1985 probably represent real estate. Even
this estimate may understate the role of land and real estate. In 1985,
anticipating the planned 1986 tax reform which would raise the capital
gains tax rate from 20 to 28 percent, many investors sold their
securities that had registered the largest advances. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Some 40 percent of the capital gains reaped
by selling these stocks probably represented real estate gains.</span>
A major spur to the LBO movement driving up the stock market was an
awareness that real estate gains were not being reflected in book
values and share prices;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36</span></small> as
land prices leapt upward-funded in part by looser regulatory
restrictions on S&amp;L lending against land -- raiders bought publicly
traded companies and sold off their assets, including real estate, to
pay off their junk-bond backers. In effect, not only were rental income
and profits being converted into a flow of interest payments; so also
were capital gains. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Economic
policy should distinguish between activities which add to
productive capacity and those which merely add to overhead </span>This
distinction
elevates the policy debate above the level of merely carping about
inequitable wealth
distribution, an attack by have-nots on the haves, to the fundamental
issues. What ways of getting
income deserve fiscal encouragement, and how may economic surpluses
best be tapped to
support government needs? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Policies
that subsidize <span style="font-style: italic;">rentier </span>incomes
while
penalizing productive effort have grave implications, not only for
distributive justice and
social harmony, but also for economic efficiency and growth.</span></small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><br>
Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in <span style="font-style: italic;">land</span>,
depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts. ...
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...
</span>The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well.,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
Both start by estimating its
market value.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts
the value of buildings from this overall value, designating the
remainder as the value of land. ...</small><br>
<small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing the
land, and treats the difference as representing the building's
value.&nbsp; ... </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve multiplies the
building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed. ...
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE DRIVING FORCE behind the
anomalies is the political lobbying
eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, The
Bubble. ...
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The Fed's statistic would be dismissed
as a comic exercise showing how economists tend to lapse into
otherworldly speculation. But in this case the motive is all too
worldly. Looking beneath the surface, one finds the not-so-invisible
hand of self-interest by the real estate industry and its financial
backers.</span>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To give the Fed economists their
due, they evidently came to the
conclusion that their statistics were fatally flawed. The September
1997 balance sheet estimates made a start along new lines by
including a calculation reflecting the original (historical) cost of
buildings. This gave land a positive value. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But nationwide totals
were no longer compiled. No longer was there a line labeled "land,"
nor does the Fed publish a residual number for market value less the
historical cost (or even the replacement cost) of buildings. Instead
of making better land estimates, the Fed has dropped what had become
a political and statistical hot potato. 1994 is the last year for
which it has estimated economy-wide land and building values.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This leaves in limbo the
macro-economists and business analysts
whose business is to explain the <b>finance, insurance and real
estate (FIRE)</b> sector's dominant role in the economy. According to
the land-residual appraisal technique, high-rise buildings seem to
have the lowest land values. Real estate interests argue that this is
realistic, because at least in New York City the higher a building
is, the more of a subsidy its developers need, given the economics of
space involved for elevators, surrounding air space and so forth. The
land itself is assigned a negative value as a statistically balancing
residual reflecting the difference between the building's high
construction costs and its lower market value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On this basis much of New York's
most highly built-up land would
seem to have a negative value, including the World Trade Center even
before its Sept. 11 destruction. While a low-rise building might be
built on this site without subsidy, a skyscraper would need a
subsidy, implying a negative land value.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>... My research has shown that
the Fed's methodology undervalues land
by as much as $4.5 trillion. ... </b><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">My estimates
based on historical values suggests that land rather than buildings
represents two thirds of the nation's overall real estate value -- $9
trillion, leaving building values at just half this amount. ...
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>One obvious problem with the
land-residual approach is that
many buildings would not be rebuilt in their existing form. ... 
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The commercial loft building in
which I lived rose in price
from $40,000 in 1986 to $120,000 in 1980 and $4,000,000 in 2000.</b>
This sharp increase cannot be explainable by rising building costs.
<b>The building itself steadily deteriorated.</b> All that increased
was its site value. ...
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IF THE APPRAISAL controversy is
framed in terms of business cycle
analysis, then the statistician finds no reasonable alternative to
seeing that when the cycle rises and falls, the difference must be in
the land, not buildings. <b>What people are buying are not
reproduction costs, whose fluctuations over the course of the credit
cycle are relatively minor. They are buying site value, which is in
limited supply, akin to a natural monopoly.</b> Most of all, real
estate investors and homeowners are buying the right to resell their
property as prices are bid up by what they expect to become an
increasingly affluent economy fuelled by an abundant supply of
mortgage credit.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The land-residual approach appears
to work as long as a fairly
constant proportion of land to buildings is maintained.</span>
Statistically, this can occur only when property prices are rising at
about the same rate as commodity prices and wages. But business
cycles snake around the economy's basic trends, rising steadily and
then plunging sharply. This fluctuation is what causes the most
serious problems for statisticians.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
a thriving real estate market appraisers typically use a rule
of thumb in allocating resale prices as between land and buildings to
reflect their pre-existing proportions. Buildings typically are
assumed to account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of the
property's value. As a result, building values are estimated to grow
along with a property's overall sales value. ...</span></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Site values as the
economy's "credit sink"</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">TO
CLARIFY MATTERS it may help to think of "land" in the broad
sense of comprising all elements of property value that cannot be
explained in terms of capital investment and its profits. </span>This
category includes the site's locational value. Site value is the
essence of long-term planning by real estate developers at the local
level. But an examination of the economy-wide figures shows property
prices to be determined by broad macroeconomic factors, headed by the
availability of mortgage credit. Real estate is the major recipient
of bank credit, and price waves or cycles are determined largely by
the supply of mortgage loans and their interest rates. ...<br>
</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>In sum, just as
real estate lending fuels land speculation, so the
withdrawal of such credit leaves property markets to decline,
sometimes with a crash, as occurred in Japan after 1990 when its
financial bubble burst. Should this rise and fall be attributed to
buildings or to land? It seems to me that inasmuch as the price rise
and fall is homogeneous, applying to parking lots as well as to
skyscrapers, we should attribute it to land. This achieves the
logical symmetry of applying to the downturns as well as upturns in
the real estate cycle. ...
</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Immortally
aging
buildings</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>INCOME TAX LIABILITY may be
minimized in two ways.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The most general -- and also the most economically
pernicious -- is through the tax deductibility of interest</b>. The
working assumption is that interest charges are a truly inherent
business expense, not simply the result of a business decision taken by
investors to leverage their equity. For interest to be an inherent
business expense, interest-bearing debt would have to be a factor of
production, which it is not. Properties would yield their rent
regardless of how they are financed. Investors choose to rely on debt
rather than equity financing because the tax laws favor it, thanks to
the political lobbying of institutional creditors ("the debt lobby").
Homeowners too deduct interest payments, which encourages borrowing.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The second way to minimize tax liability, is to
depreciation the building, that is. annually deduct from taxable income
part of the purchase price until it's all deducted and the building is
"written off" </b>It's the most unique tax advantage enjoyed by the
real estate industry. Investors are able to depreciate their buildings
based on their assessed acquisition price, regardless of the actual
building costs involved or the level of economy-wide land-price
inflation. Investors depreciate buildings at rising prices even when
prior owners already have depreciated these structures once or even
many times. For real estate owned by households and partnerships (the
latter being the preferred legal instrument for holding residential
apartment buildings and office buildings), the Fed has estimated much
higher proportions of land to buildings, but these estimates also
overvalue buildings relative to land. <b>Every time a property changes
hands at a higher price, building assessments are raised proportionally
- and begin to be re-depreciated for these higher valuations,
regardless of how often the buildings already have been written off!
There is no limit as to how often a building can be re-depreciated.</b>
What matters is simply how often the property changes nominal hands.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
fiscal privilege has created a phantom real estate economy.
Buildings acquire death-defying lives, metamorphosing time and again
for the purpose of enabling their owners to avoid paying income
taxes.</span> For commercial real estate investors as a whole, the
repeated
depreciation of buildings has made commercial real estate investment
largely exempt from the income tax. Homeowners are not permitted to
charge depreciation on their own residences, but only on buildings
that they rent out. ... <br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For
real estate, however, the economics are unique. Machinery
rarely can be re-depreciated, but this is not true of buildings as
long as they are kept in proper repair. </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance and repairs
typically consume about 10 percent of the rental value.</span> For
business
owners, the explicit purpose of this expenditure is to maintain the
building's value intact, so that it can survive year after year and
avoid obsolescence while its site value rises. If a building is sold
at a higher price, its assessment usually is raised.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Suppose a
property is sold for twice the $1 million the owner paid for it. The
local appraiser is likely to say; "I see you've sold your building
for $2 million. Under my rule of thumb, I appraise the land as half
this value, and the building as half, so that gives you a $1 million
dollar building." Under this rule, the building that was formerly
priced at $500,000 can be re-depreciated at a price that builds in
this $500,000 gain. In this way a substantial portion of the rise in
site value of non-depreciable land is treated as depreciable building
value.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The free
lunch of land-price gains is unseen as attention is diverted from the
real estate bubble and land-price inflation to building costs. These
fiscal considerations help to explain why it has been so hard to get
Washington to produce national land value statistics. ...&nbsp;</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Tax favouritism for real estate
was defended in Congress on the
ground that it was in the public interest to provide a special
inducement to the real estate industry to build more homes and office
buildings.</b> But as Adam Smith observed, every industry represents
itself as serving the public interest. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Can one really say that
investors borrowing 70 percent of private-sector loans to ride the
wave of asset-price inflation are more in the national economic
interest than favoring direct investors to build new plant and
businesses that employ labor rather than pricing homes, office
buildings and industrial sites further and further out of reach of
those who must earn their income by increasing society's productive
powers? </span>... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide the capital-gains
dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's
nearly complete success in escaping the tax
collector has placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.</span>
