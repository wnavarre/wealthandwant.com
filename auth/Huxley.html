</center>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">.... and here
is the Foreword, in full:</span><br>
</p>
<p>Chronic remorse, as all the moralists are agreed, is a most
undesirable sentiment. If you have behaved badly, repent, make what
amends you can and address yourself to the task of behaving better
next time. On no account brood over your wrong-doing. Rolling in the
muck is not the best way of getting clean.</p>
<p>Art also has its morality, and many of the rules of this morality
are the same as, or at least analogous to, the rules of ordinary
ethics. Remorse, for example, is as undesirable in relation to our
bad art as it is in relation to our bad behaviour. The badness should
be hunted out, acknowledged and, if possible, avoided in the future.
To pore over the literary shortcomings of twenty years ago, to
attempt to patch a faulty work into the perfection it missed at its
first execution, to spend one's middle age in trying to mend the
artistic sins committed and bequeathed by that different person who
was oneself in youth -- all this is surely vain and futile. And that
is why this new Brave New World is the same as the old one. Its
defects as a work of art are considerable; but in order to correct
them I should have to rewrite the book -- and in the process of
rewriting, as an older, other person, I should probably get rid not
only of some of the faults of the story, but also of such merits as
it originally possessed. And so, resisting the temptation to wallow
in artistic remorse, I prefer to leave both well and ill alone and to
think about something else.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the meantime, however,
it seems worth while at least to mention
the most serious defect in the story, which is this.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The Savage is
offered only two alternatives, an insane life in Utopia, or the life
of a primitive in an Indian village, a life more human in some
respects, but in others hardly less queer and abnormal. </span>At the
time
the book was written this idea, that human beings are given free will
in order to choose between insanity on the one hand and lunacy on the
other, was one that I found amusing and regarded as quite possibly
true. For the sake, however, of dramatic effect, the Savage is often
permitted to speak more rationally than his upbringing among the
practitioners of a religion that is half fertility cult and half
<i>Penitente</i> ferocity would actually warrant. Even his
acquaintance with Shakespeare would not in reality justify such
utterances. And at the close, of course, he is made to retreat from
sanity; his native <i>Penitente</i>-ism reasserts its authority and
he ends in maniacal self-torture and despairing suicide. "And so they
died miserably ever after" -- much to the reassurance of the amused,
Pyrrhonic aesthete who was the author of the fable.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Today I feel no wish to
demonstrate that sanity is impossible.</span> On
the contrary, though I remain no less sadly certain than in the past
that sanity is a rather rare phenomenon, I am convinced that it can
be achieved and would like to see more of it. For having said so in
several recent books and, above all, for having compiled an anthology
of what the sane have said about sanity and the means whereby it can
be achieved, I have been told by an eminent academic critic that I am
a sad symptom of the failure of an intellectual class in time of
crisis. The implication being, I suppose, that the professor and his
colleagues are hilarious symptoms of success. The benefactors of
humanity deserve due honour and commemoration. Let us build a
Pantheon for professors. It should be located among the ruins of one
of the gutted cities of Europe or Japan, and over the entrance to the
ossuary I would inscribe, in letters six or seven feet high, the
simple words: SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF THE WORLD'S EDUCATORS. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">SI
MONUMENTUM REQUIRIS CIRCUMSPICE.</span></p>
<p>But to return to the future . . . <b>If I were now to rewrite the
book, I would offer the Savage a third alternative. Between the
utopian and the primitive horns of his dilemma would lie the
possibility of sanity </b>-- a possibility already actualized, to
some extent, in a community of exiles and refugees from the Brave New
World, living within the borders of the Reservation. <b>In this
community economics would be decentralist and Henry-Georgian,</b>
politics Kropotkinesque cooperative. Science and technology would be
used as though, like the Sabbath, they had been made for man, not (as
at present and still more so in the Brave New World) as though man
were to be adapted and enslaved to them. Religion would be the
conscious and intelligent pursuit of man's Final End, the unitive
knowledge of the immanent Tao or Logos, the transcendent Godhead or
Brahman. And the prevailing philosophy of life would be a kind of
Higher Utilitarianism, in which the Greatest Happiness principle
would be secondary to the Final End principle -- the first question
to be asked and answered in every contingency of life being: "How
will this thought or action contribute to, or interfere with, the
achievement, by me and the greatest possible number of other
individuals, of man's Final End?"</p>
<p>Brought up among the primitives, the Savage (in this hypothetical
new version of the book) would not be transported to Utopia until he
had had an opportunity of learning something at first hand about the
nature of a society composed of freely co-operating individuals
devoted to the pursuit of sanity. Thus altered, Brave New World would
possess artistic and (if it is permissible to use so large a word in
connection with a work of fiction) a philosophical completeness,
which in its present form it evidently lacks.</p>
<p>But Brave New World is a book about the future and, whatever its
artistic or philosophical qualities, a book about the future can
interest us only if its prophecies look as though they might
conceivably come true. From our present vantage point, fifteen years
further down the inclined plane of modern history, how plausible do
its prognostications seem? What has happened in the painful interval
to confirm or invalidate the forecasts of 1931?</p>
<p>One vast and obvious failure of foresight is immediately apparent.
Brave New World contains no reference to nuclear fission. That it
does not is actually rather odd, for the possibilities of atomic
energy had been a popular topic of conversation for years before the
book was written. My old friend, Robert Nichols, had even written a
successful play about the subject, and I recall that I myself had
casually mentioned it in a novel published in the late twenties. So
it seems, as I say, very odd that the rockets and helicopters of the
seventh century of Our Ford should not have been powered by
disintegrating nuclei. The oversight may not be excusable; but at
least it can be easily explained. The theme of Brave New World is not
the advancement of science as such; it is the advancement of science
as it affects human individuals. The triumphs of physics, chemistry
and engineering are tacitly taken for granted. The only scientific
advances to be specifically described are those involving the
application to human beings of the results of future research in
biology, physiology and psychology. It is only by means of the
sciences of life that the quality of life can be radically changed.
The sciences of matter can be applied in such a way that they will
destroy life or make the living of it impossibly complex and
uncomfortable; but, unless used as instruments by the biologists and
psychologists, they can do nothing to modify the natural forms and
expressions of life itself. The release of atomic energy marks a
great revolution in human history, but not (unless we blow ourselves
to bits and so put an end to history) the final and most searching
revolution.</p>
<p>This really revolutionary revolution is to be achieved, not in the
external world, but in the souls and flesh of human beings. Living as
he did in a revolutionary period, the Marquis de Sade very naturally
made use of this theory of revolutions in order to rationalize his
peculiar brand of insanity. Robespierre had achieved the most
superficial kind of revolution, the political. Going a little deeper,
Babeuf had attempted the economic revolution. Sade regarded himself
as the apostle of the truly revolutionary revolution, beyond mere
politics and economics -- the revolution in individual men, women and
children, whose bodies were henceforward to become the common sexual
property of all and whose minds were to be purged of all the natural
decencies, all the laboriously acquired inhibitions of traditional
civilization. Between sadism and the really revolutionary revolution
there is, of course, no necessary or inevitable connection. Sade was
a lunatic and the more or less conscious goal of his revolution was
universal chaos and destruction. The people who govern the Brave New
World may not be sane (in what may be called the absolute sense of
the word); but they are not madmen, and their aim is not anarchy but
social stability. It is in order to achieve stability that they carry
out, by scientific means, the ultimate, personal, really
revolutionary revolution. But meanwhile we are in the first phase of
what is perhaps the penultimate revolution. Its next phase may be
atomic warfare, in which case we do not have to bother with
prophecies about the future. But it is conceivable that we may have
enough sense, if not to stop fighting altogether, at least to behave
as rationally as did our eighteenth-century ancestors. The
unimaginable horrors of the Thirty Years War actually taught men a
lesson, and for more than a hundred years the politicians and
generals of Europe consciously resisted the temptation to use their
military resources to the limits of destructiveness or (in the
majority of conflicts) to go on fighting until the enemy was totally
annihilated. They were aggressors, of course, greedy for profit and
glory; but they were also conservatives, determined at all costs to
keep their world intact, as a going concern. For the last thirty
years there have been no conservatives; there have been only
nationalistic radicals of the right and nationalistic radicals of the
left. The last conservative statesman was the fifth Marquess of
Lansdowne; and when he wrote a letter to the the <i>Times</i>,
suggesting that the First World War should be concluded with a
compromise, as most of the wars of the eighteenth century had been,
the editor of that once conservative journal refused to print it. The
nationalistic radicals had their way, with the consequences that we
all know --Bolshevism, Fascism, inflation, depression, Hitler, the
Second World War, the ruin of Europe and all but universal
famine.</p>
<p>Assuming, then, that we are capable of learning as much from
Hiroshima as our forefathers learned from Magdeburg, we may look
forward to a period, not indeed of peace, but of limited and only
partially ruinous warfare. During that period it may be assumed that
nuclear energy will be harnessed to industrial uses. The result,
pretty obviously, will be a series of economic and social changes
unprecedented in rapidity and completeness. All the existing patterns
of human life will be disrupted and new patterns will have to be
improvised to conform with the nonhuman fact of atomic power.
Procrustes in modern dress, the nuclear scientist will prepare the
bed on which mankind must lie; and if mankind doesn't fit -- well,
that will be just too bad for mankind. There will have to be some
stretching and a bit of amputation -- the same sort of stretching and
amputations as have been going on ever since applied science really
got into its stride, only this time they will be a good deal more
drastic than in the past. These far from painless operations will be
directed by highly centralized totalitarian governments. Inevitably
so; for the immediate future is likely to resemble the immediate
past, and in the immediate past rapid technological changes, taking
place in a mass-producing economy and among a population
predominantly propertyless, have always tended to produce economic
and social confusion. To deal with confusion, power has been
centralized and government control increased. It is probable that all
the world's governments will be more or less completely totalitarian
even before the harnessing of atomic energy; that they will be
totalitarian during and after the harnessing seems almost certain.
Only a large-scale popular movement toward decentralization and
self-help can arrest the present tendency toward statism. At present
there is no sign that such a movement will take place.</p>
<p>There is, of course, no reason why the new totalitarianisms should
resemble the old. Government by clubs and firing squads, by
artificial famine, mass imprisonment and mass deportation, is not
merely inhumane (nobody cares much about that nowadays), it is
demonstrably inefficient and in an age of advanced technology,
inefficiency is the sin against the Holy Ghost. A really efficient
totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive
of political bosses and their army of managers control a population
of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their
servitude. To make them love it is the task assigned, in present-day
totalitarian states, to ministries of propaganda, news- paper editors
and schoolteachers. But their methods are still crude and
unscientific. The old Jesuits' boast that, if they were given the
schooling of the child, they could answer for the man's religious
opinions, was a product of wishful thinking. And the modern pedagogue
is probably rather less efficient at conditioning his pupils'
reflexes than were the reverend fathers who educated Voltaire. The
greatest triumphs of propaganda have been accomplished, not by doing
something, but by refraining from doing. Great is truth, but still
greater, from a practical point of view, is silence about truth. By
simply not mentioning certain subjects, by lowering what Mr.
Churchill calls an "iron curtain" between the masses and such facts
or arguments as the local political bosses regard as undesirable,
totalitarian propagandists have influenced opinion much more
effectively than they could have done by the most eloquent
denunciations, the most compelling of logical rebuttals. But silence
is not enough. If persecution, liquidation and the other symptoms of
social friction are to be avoided, the positive sides of propaganda
must be made as effective as the negative. The most important
Manhattan Projects of the future will be vast government-sponsored
enquiries into what the politicians and the participating scientists
will call "the problem of happiness" -- in other words, the problem
of making people love their servitude. Without economic security, the
love of servitude cannot possibly come into existence; for the sake
of brevity, I assume that the all-powerful executive and its managers
will succeed in solving the problem of permanent security. But
security tends very quickly to be taken for granted. Its achievement
is merely a superficial, external revolution. The love of servitude
cannot be established except as the result of a deep, personal
revolution in human minds and bodies. To bring about that revolution
we require, among others, the following discoveries and inventions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, a greatly improved technique of suggestion -- through
infant
conditioning and, later, with the aid of drugs, such as scopolamine.  </li>
  <li>Second, a fully developed science of human differences, enabling
government managers to assign any given individual to his or her
proper place in the social and economic hierarchy. (Round pegs in
square holes tend to have dangerous thoughts about the social system
and to infect others with their discontents.)  </li>
  <li>Third (since reality,
however utopian, is something from which people feel the need of
taking pretty frequent holidays), a substitute for alcohol and the
other narcotics, something at once less harmful and more
pleasure-giving than gin or heroin.  </li>
  <li>And fourth (but this would be a
long-term project, which it would take generations of totalitarian
control to bring to a successful conclusion), a foolproof system of
eugenics, designed to standardize the human product and so to
facilitate the task of the managers. In <i>Brave New World</i> this
standardization of the human product has been pushed to fantastic,
though not perhaps impossible, extremes. Technically and
ideologically we are still a long way from bottled babies and
Bokanovsky groups of semi-morons. But by A.F. 600, who knows what may
not be happening? Meanwhile the other characteristic features of that
happier and more stable world -- the equivalents of soma and
hypnopaedia and the scientific caste system --are probably not more
than three or four generations away. Nor does the sexual promiscuity
of Brave New World seem so very distant. There are already certain
American cities in which the number of divorces is equal to the
number of marriages. In a few years, no doubt, marriage licenses will
be sold like dog licenses, good for a period of twelve months, with
no law against changing dogs or keeping more than one animal at a
time. As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom
tends compensatingly to increase. And the dictator (unless he needs
cannon fodder and families with which to colonize empty or conquered
territories) will do well to encourage that freedom. In conjunction
with the freedom to daydream under the influence of dope and movies
and the radio, it will help to reconcile his subjects to the
servitude which is their fate.</li>
</ul>
<p>All things considered it looks as though Utopia were far closer to
us than anyone, only fifteen years ago, could have imagined. Then, I
projected it six hundred years into the future. Today it seems quite
possible that the horror may be upon us within a single century. That
is, if we refrain from blowing ourselves to smithereens in the
interval. Indeed, unless we choose to decentralize and to use applied
science, not as the end to which human beings are to be made the
means, but as the means to producing a race of free individuals, we
have only two alternatives to choose from: either a number of
national, militarized totalitarianisms, having as their root the
terror of the atomic bomb and as their consequence the destruction of
civilization (or, if the warfare is limited, the perpetuation of
militarism); or else one supranational totalitarianism, called into
existence by the social chaos resulting from rapid technological
progress in general and the atomic revolution in particular, and
developing, under the need for efficiency and stability, into the
welfare-tyranny of Utopia. You pays your money and you takes your
choice.</p>
