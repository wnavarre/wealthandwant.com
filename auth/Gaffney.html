Nonpoint pollution goes right to a chink in the
armor of conventionally trained economists (like myself) who are
overtrained towards becoming protagonists of the price system.&nbsp; To
the skeptical we are "free market freaks": eco-freaks who are -nomic
rather than -logical.&nbsp; Whatever our faults we are zealous, and
carry the conviction of true belief.&nbsp; With the problem at hand,
however, we can't do what we do best, that is call for price signals,
punt, and slip away.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The very name "nonpoint" pollution suggests that
economists see this as just an odd bit of clutter, something
"non-regular" in their tidy world.&nbsp; Indeed, all pollution was an
exception, an "externality," until recently (at least at my age it
seems so).&nbsp; Then they learned you can meter effluents and tax
them, or trade effluent rights around like private property.&nbsp;
Thenceforth they could fit pollution right into existing models and
ideologies with minimum intellectual strain.&nbsp; They were happy as
Procrustes with a new guest.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
But we can't meter runoff &#8212; how frustrating.&nbsp;
<br>
</small>
<ul>
  <li><small>It comes from areas &#8212;how disorienting.&nbsp; <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Its damages are spread
unequally over other areas, differentially populated &#8212; how
non-homogenous.&nbsp; <br>
    </small></li>
</ul>
<small>Standard-brand economists are ill-equipped and
undisposed to face such problems.&nbsp; </small><a

<small>... <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hundreds of
books on economic theory are published with "land" absent from
the index.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></span>The discipline has not
totally eliminated land, but marginalized
it. <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The discipline has not
totally terminated land: it is too subtle for outright skullduggery,
preferring equivocation and confusion.&nbsp; Rather, it has
marginalized it.&nbsp; </span>There is a subdiscipline called "Land
Economics," and
a journal of that name.&nbsp; There are journals of Agricultural
Economics, Urban Economics, Regional Science, Environmental Economics,
Natural Resources, and more.&nbsp; There are also whole disciplines of
Geography, Economic Geography, Military Science, Biogeography, Geology,
Geometry, Surveying, Astronomy, Theology, Ecology, Oceanography,
Meteorology, Soils, Physiography, Topography, and Hydrology, all
dealing
with The Earth and Nature and Creation as definable topics distinct
from
man's works. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Common micro theory finesses Time.&nbsp; It deals with economic
relations
as though they occurred at a point in time <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(and space as well); as though they
were relations of coexistence, rather than a cavalcade of events in
sequence</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes two points
are allowed (short run and long).&nbsp; Thus micro theory can ignore
the
birth of capital, its growth, maturity, senescence, death, burial, and
replacement, vital elements of its difference from land.&nbsp; Time,
and
relations of sequence,&nbsp;are hived off to the far satellite
of "finance," usually
not even taught in departments of economics.&nbsp; Time is also
referred
to under "history of economic thought," as an obsession of some
19th century Austrians who wrote quaintly of "roundabout"
(time-using) methods of production.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5&nbsp;</span></small>
Relations of sequence are found in
macro, but not firmly integrated with microtheory, which is the
enduring
core of the discipline.&nbsp; Microtheory still deals with relations of
coexistence in time, and space as well. As A. A. Milne once wrote,
"It isn't really anywhere, it's somewhere else instead." Of
neoclassical theory we may add, "It isn't really anytime, it's some
other time instead."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6 ... </span></small></small><br>
<br>
<br>
<small>"Land" in economics means all natural resources and agents,
with their sites (locations and extensions in space).&nbsp; Land is not
just the matter occupying space: it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
space. It includes many things not
colloquially called land, such as </small></div>

 style="font-style: italic;">excludes</span> many
things, too, that are
colloquially called land.&nbsp; It excludes land-fill, for example, by
which many cities
are extended into shallow waters.&nbsp; The site and seabed are
properly
land; the land-fill is an improvement.&nbsp; There is no "made
land" in the economic sense: it is reallocated from other
uses.&nbsp; Expanding cities take farmland from producing food and

much of it for the expanding city itself.&nbsp; Filled land in shallow

primal role as

pollutants.&nbsp;
Thanks to the myopia and dereliction of economists, it has taken
militant
environmentalists to carry home this truth, developing in their
struggle
to be heard and understood a deep skepticism of economists and their
"way of thinking." Some economists and environmentalists are now coming

happens when a state radically
slashes its property tax?</small></font>

</small>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Michiganders are saying they must
wait and see, but there is no
need for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To
read your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened
since California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The obvious direct results have
been to cut public services, raise
other taxes, and lose credit rating. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>The private sector is doing badly, too.</b> Raising income
taxes, business taxes, and sales taxes is no way to stimulate an
economy; they are all a drag on work and enterprise. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>It should give one pause. It is, however, if you think about
it, the expectable result of what the voters did.</b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They turned property from a functional concept into a
sacred one; from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce
goods, and pay taxes into a welfare entitlement. </small></li>
  <li><small>They rejected the concept of a tax on inert wealth in
favor of the rival concept of taxing liquidity and cash flow. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The predictable result is to
inhibit economic activity, and
encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.</small><br>
<br>
<small>David Shulman tersely summarized the distributive effects of
Prop.
13 as he left us for Salomon Brothers in Manhattan: "it breached the
social compact." ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>1/8 of all new businesses started in the U.S. were in
L.A., 1945-50. </b>These were small, creative, flexible, and too
varied to classify. No Linnaeus could sort them in conventional
categories: the new Angelenos simply stayed here and started
producing everything for themselves, some things previously imported,
and others never seen before.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Why is that not happening
today, 1995?</b> An invisible,
pervasive change is <b>Proposition 13</b>, which makes it possible to
hold land at negligible tax cost. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In 1945 land was taxed at 3% every
year, building a fire under holdouts to turn their land to use. </span>Today
that same tax cost is well below 1%. Using <b>Gwartney's Rule of
Thumb</b>, it is about 1/8 of 1%: a rate of 1%
applied to 1/8 of the true value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landowners are only taxed now
if they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they meet the drag of our
high business and employment and sales taxes, necessitated by the
fall of property taxes. A handful of oligopolistic landowners control
most of the market; small businesses are squeezed out. This helps us
segue from being at the cutting edge of industrial progress to a
third-world economy - from the NH model to the AL model - with little
relief in sight. ...<br>
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California displayed amazing
growth up to 1978, and the resilience
to shrug off the loss of war industries after 1945 and still grow
"explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we have a string of
reverses. The timing, along with a priori causative analysis, plus
various direct observations too numerous for this time-slot, support
an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1955, Spiro Agnew was a
Maryland State Assemblyman on the rise.<span style="font-weight: bold;">
He carried a new law that let tax assessors value farmland on its
"use-value" as farmland, instead of market value. It let owners who
were farming for unearned increments around Baltimore and D.C. hold
out with low carrying costs.</span> "Farmland" meant land used for
farming,
and any play at farming would qualify. Under this law, a relative of
mine with 102 acres in Maryland near Western Avenue, the D.C. line,
kept just two steers thereon to validate his farmland assessment
status. Holding for the rise "never crossed his mind." Right --
except, whenever such land is condemned for public use, courts
everywhere have held that compensation must be based on speculative
market value. ...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><small></small>It is not just peri-urban land speculators who
gain. A large
chunk of land value in rural regions is not based on cash flow from
food and fiber, but on amenities. Wisconsin is a major playground
for rich urbanites from nearby Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and
St. Paul. "Use-value" assessment exempts this chunk of value
completely, for use-value is based on capitalizing the net cash farm
income from growing crops, and, in the Wisconsin law, specifically
corn. The highest land values per capita in the State are in Vilas
County up in the north woods, once dismissed as worthless "cutovers."
Vilas' barren podzol soils are worthless for corn, but sparkling
lakes bedizen the County. Values per capita in Vilas are 6 times
those in Milwaukee. Rich recreationists and "investors" (read
speculators) are gobbling up the "wild forties." Shoreline parcels
are like diamonds among coal. ... </small><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">100
years ago, American Georgists made a big point that city land
outvalues rural land many times over. One implication is that
taxing city land is taxing the rich, and we can ignore farmland. </span>Some
land-taxers counsel that farmers are easily misled to oppose us,
so leave them alone and convert the cities. But rich city folks also
own choice rural lands.

</span>in most states gets the

(mostly
huge corporations) may put the land into the <span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
standing timber is then exempt, and taxed only at harvest, at 2.9%,
much too low a rate to make up for a 60-year lifetime of exemption.</span>
County assessors have to value the land separately on its putative
value for growing timber, following a State-legislated formula that
is tailored drastically to understate even that low value (California
Revenue and Tax Code, Section 434.5). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Much
of that land, though, has
alternative uses, e.g. for retirement and vacation homes and resorts,
the outliers and pioneers of urban sprawl. There are also mineral
values, hunting, fishing, rifle ranges, grazing, campsites, tourism,
rights of way, lumber camps, loading sites, water sources, lakes, log
storage, landings - there are many things to do with 1/3 of a
nation's land. <span

all declared "compatible" with timber,

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Blight is not restricted to
stagnant or declining cities. In
booming Los Angeles, there is Watts. In nearby Riverside, one of the
fastest growing cities in the nation, the CBD [Central Business
District] is surrounded by blight
which, among other things, frustrates years of subsidies aimed at
reviving the moribund CBD itself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These extreme cases are not
anomalies, not simply ghettoes and
embarrassments; <span style="font-weight: bold;">they are symptoms of
systemic malfunction</span>. They could
be portents and symbols for the rest of the economy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Blight may be
defined as failure to maintain, replace, and renew capital inherited
from the past. </span>Studies indicate that all of American industry
faces
this problem, compared with vigorous foreign competitors. In learning
to cure blight, we may learn to restore the greatness and pride of
this whole troubled nation. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There
is also good news: some cities have risen from the grave.
Indeed, all land development is resurrection in a sense: all land has
been used before for something.</span> The history of a city lot
usually
shows that there were several antecedent improvements, layered like
the ruins of ancient Troy. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The goal
should be to make renewal happen
faster and more widely, while we are still here to benefit. ...</span></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some cities
should be abandoned.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Towns around played-out mines are
obvious examples. A farm town
becomes redundant when new roads let customers patronize a larger or
better town. Salvage what you can and move on. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Some would apply the
same logic to all cities. </span>Dead cities aren't
lost, they say, but rebuilt elsewhere; they were cash cows that have
been milked dry. Their depreciation allowances are reinvested on new
frontiers; people and vitality move with the capital. It is an
important half-truth, but a half-truth is also half wrong. The basic
original site stays put; land cannot move. Public and private social
capital cannot move, either. </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We cannot afford throwaway cities
in a finite world. New natural
sites are not common. There is only one Hudson Valley with only one
mouth, and here New York City has stood for 350 years. </span>We
cannot
abandon the Bronx and duplicate its environment somewhere; we cannot
rebuild the natural setting, and the sunk social capital is too
costly. Relocating to suburbs involves commuting cost in terms of
money and congestion. And then, when we tire of the new suburbs,
where will we go next?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Furthermore, blighted areas have
high potential market values.
Picture a topographic map of a city where the contour lines represent
points not of equal elevation, but of equal market value per square
foot. The peaks, the Everests and McKinleys, are in the city retail
centers, where just one square foot rises to $2,000 (about $90
million per acre). Land just a few miles away from dizzying altitudes
can hardly be worthless. Harlem is near Park Avenue; Watts is near
Beverly Hills; South State Street is very near the Sears Tower.
Newark is 15 minutes by train from Manhattan. Newark office rents are
$25/sf per year. That is less, of course, than in Manhattan, but in
Riverside, California, we are throwing up offices to get rent of
$12/sf per year, while Newark stagnates.</small><br>

<small>George saw cities as <i>foci</i> of civilization's basic
mechanisms. People with mutual access, associating on equal terms,
expedite cooperation and specialization through the market.
Multivariate interactions are synergistic. Indeed, while each parcel
is developed in the stage of decreasing returns, the composite city
is generally in a stage of increasing returns, thanks to synergy: the
whole exceeds the sum of its parts, and increases to the whole yield
more than the sum of increases to the parts. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Synergistic surplus</span>,
said George, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">lodges
in urban land rents.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus he
explained a
phenomenon which other economists overlooked: the unparalleled rise
in urban rents and land prices, and in owners' wealth and power. ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">To understand
ground rents and land prices is to
understand cities; not to understand is to remain mired forever in
confusion and fallacy. Ground rent continues forever, generally
tending to rise; therefore, to buy title to land, people pay prices
that look high relative to current cash flows. </span>....<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Urban land
prices take your breath away.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
prices vary extremely from city to city or block to block.
The cost to build a square foot of floor space is fairly constant
from place to place, but demand varies with location.</span> A small
rise in
floor rental translates into a large rise in ground rent and land
price, because the land owner gets everything above what is required
to operate and amortize the building. Thus, <br>
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>in Riverside,
neighborhood mall space rental of $12 just pays for the building,
with only a little left over, resulting in land prices of perhaps
$5-$8/sf. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In Manhattan, rentals are triple those in Riverside; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">all
surplus accrues to ground rent,</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">resulting in land
prices 300 times
higher than in Riverside.</span></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At key locations in bigger
cities, land prices are not just high
per square foot, they are higher per capita than in small cities.
They are even higher relative to building values, in spite of the
high-rise buildings. Remember that each additional floor adds more
ground rent, because floor space rental is more than enough to cover
the added cost. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land prices across cities and
neighborhoods are much more
differentiated than other measures economists commonly cite. For
example, the median income in upper east side Manhattan is about 8
times higher than north of Central Park, while the price of land per
square foot is probably 40 times higher. Urban land is also highly
concentrated in ownership; a handful of people and corporations own
most of it. A growing share of income property is held by wealthy
aliens, who want to diversify and acquire secure wealth they can
manage by remote control. Aliens even hold a good deal of residential
property in international "jet set" communities.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Because
urban rents are a social surplus, not a payment for
anyone's making or supplying land, parties other than the landowner
have a claim. A good deal of American politics deals with how to
assert that claim and share in the surplus.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Dividing a big pie seems a pleasant enough task, but Confucius
knew better: "It is easier to face a common enemy than to share a
surplus." The common ways of sharing surplus are clumsy, divisive,
and destructive; they bear some responsibility for dead cities. With
too much quarreling over spoils, there are no spoils to dispute.
Consider how spoils are shared, and how we might do better.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Rent control</small></li>
  <li><small>"French Equity"
(Equity in Kind):&nbsp; Today we approach French Equity indirectly, and
expensively. We
distribute land haphazardly, but seek to make every parcel equally
good by extending utilities and roads to all parcels on the same
terms, regardless of cost or location. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Economists call such schemes
"postage stamp pricing," because
postal rates do not vary with delivery costs. Manhattan has 64,000
residents per square mile; Montana has 5.4. It costs a lot more to
collect or deliver mail in Montana. The reason postal rates rise is
that the U.S. urban population is spreading out more like Montana and
less like Manhattan (which once had over 100,000 per square mile).
Here are five other examples: </small></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The key to renewing cities is
shifting from obstructive ways of
sharing rent, like rent control; and destructive ways, like looting
and subsidies; to constructive ways. Henry George showed us how
equity and efficiency go hand in hand, how the magic of justice
combines with the magic of incentive.
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, by George, equity need not be in kind. The monetary
mechanism overcomes the clumsiness of in-kind equity. If four
families inherit a one-family house, all four don't crowd in; they
sell and divide the money, or one buys out the others. There is
equity in money as well as in real estate. Money is often better; the
reinvestment opportunity puts the house on a magic carpet to follow
you anywhere. Money is wonderful!</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, by George, use the tax mechanism. Do not divide
land into
unusable morsels, or shackle the market with rent controls, or
dissipate rent in subsidies. Give land to the highest bidder, and tax
ground rents to support government. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Higher
Taxes that Promote Development." The fixed tax is levied on land
value, based on opportunity cost. The owner uses land harder and
improves it more to meet a fixed tax; or sells, releasing surplus
land to those needing more space. Taxes stifle enterprise only if
they increase with enterprise. Land tax increases only with
opportunity cost, which is independent of the enterprise of the
owner. The only activity this tax impairs is withholding land from
use.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's land tax promotes equity
toward the landless in at least
four ways: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>it relieves them of taxes, to the extent that landowners
pay more; 
  </small></li>
  <li><small>it supplies them with more goods and services, as land is
used better; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>it offers them jobs producing those goods and services;
and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>it offers them a better chance to acquire land, as
surpluses are
released to the market.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is supply-side economics
with a kick.&nbsp; ... George's program not only reconciles efficiency
and equity, it squares taxes and incentives. What more can we ask of
economic policy than to resolve stand-offs that have confused us, and
dead-locked constructive action, for generations? ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Camden has the highest tax rate in New Jersey, causing a vicious
circle as high rates drive away capital and further erode the tax
base. What if only land value were taxed? The depressant would become
a stimulant by the simple magic of converting a variable charge into
a fixed, unavoidable one. So it is with most depressed cities, which
today look vainly to Washington for salvation. They need enabling
legislation from their states, on the Pennsylvania model, but given
this power can save themselves.</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
counterpart of sharing rent through taxation is to untax
things, like buildings, that involve human endeavor.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">This doubles the
incentive effect.</span> If land tax is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">stick</span>,
untaxing buildings is the
corresponding <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">carrot</span>,
and George's program makes both larger. Every
lot with an old "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Defender</span>"
building has a potential replacement, the
"<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Challenger</span>."
Taxing buildings rigs the fight against the Challenger.
Say the lot-cum-Defender is worth $100K, and the Challenger would
cost $500K to build. Challenger cash flow must exceed Defender cash
flow by enough to pay $500K, plus added taxes based on it.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist tax, by contrast, is
impartial between Defender and
Challenger; the market decides. </small><br>
<br>
<small>New buildings face liquidity crises; almost all are built on
credit and need time to yield cash. The timing of tax on a building
maximizes the damage during the crisis period, for any given tax
yield over time. Of course, every building uses public services, but
new buildings in older cities pay for more than they receive, while
old ones receive more than they pay for. Think of building tax as a
forced loan to the Treasury, to be recovered when the building is
older. What could be more counterproductive than forcing a loan from
a builder passing through a credit crisis? The Georgist tax is low
when the builder's cash needs are pressing, and rises slowly over
time as the site ripens to its next best use.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Urban blight is cumulative and
self-reinforcing: blighted
buildings cast a pall on land around them, discourage upkeep, and
stifle renewal.</span> Whatever slows renewal of one site slows the
neighborhood in a vicious, downward spiral. Conversely, new buildings
stimulate renewal. There are exceptions; some new buildings sterilize
blocks with blank walls.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But the exception is not the
rule, and abuse is not the precept.
The rule is that new buildings draw tenants from old and weaken other
Defenders, so that other owners also renew. </span>When they do, where
better than next to the newest building? Renewal, like blight, is
cumulative, but in a benign, upward spiral. Competition for sites
raises the tax base if land values are derived from ground rents. The
higher base allows the city to improve public services without taxing
buildings or scaring away generators of fiscal surpluses. In this
scenario, buildings raise the tax base indirectly, by raising the
value of land around them.</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Riverside built a downtown
pedestrian mall when they were in
vogue, and has been sorry ever since. It did not work; retailers
deserted, and half the stores are empty. I asked the developer of a
successful mall why he thought downtown failed, and got a two word
answer: "absentee ownership." I should have known, having preached it
for years. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Farm advisers say, "The best
dressing for soil is the owner's
shadow, applied daily." In town they ask, "Who's keeping the store?"
Absentees aren't the only negligent owners, nor are they all bad.
Torpid owners are the problem, and they come in many forms. A city
wants to be rid of owners who see real estate as a cash cow for their
retirement, and to replace them with owners who see it as a vehicle
for enterprise and who apply their shadows daily. The shadows follow
them to local civic clubs and to enterprising downtown or
neighborhood associations for making joint improvements. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The surplus to land attracts
outside buyers. Absentees, redundant
parties in production, are often top bidders for pure ownership,
which is the legal right to receive land rent plus unearned
increments that accrue over time. Georgist taxation cuts directly
into rents and unearned increments, which attract absentee owners; it
spares the rewards of enterprise. It thereby effects a market
transfer of ownership from absentees to occupants, with the community
benefits that follow. In a period of rising concern over alien
takeovers of U.S. real estate, these points merit focused
attention.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Untaxing buildings attracts
outside capital to an area, but does
not result in new capital formation for the economy. In Keynesian
models, however, reducing tax on new capital raises the rate of
return after taxes (marginal efficiency of capital) and creates new
capital. In supply-side models, increasing saving is more important.
Land taxation helps here, too.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>Land taxation, if vigorously
applied, tends to reduce the
investment value of land, through a process called "tax
capitalization." </i>With land devalued, those needing wealth acquire
substitute assets by saving more, and investing the savings in real
new capital rather than land. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist taxation tends to
reduce the need for public spending in
two obvious ways. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One is to increase job opportunity, which in turn
reduces welfare spending. More productive job opportunities should
reduce pressure for military spending of a boondoggling, make-jobs
nature as well. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The other is to eliminate urban sprawl and its
wasteful cross-subsidies.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Slum clearance" in the 1950s
had a negative caste, with a name
catered solely for middle class consumption. Reuse of cleared land
was often at lower density, inevitably throwing unhoused people on
the private market. Federal "urban re-newal" in the 1960s, while
better named, emphasized clearing, not rebuilding. The inventory of
cleared, unrebuilt land under the program grew each year. Cynics'
cracks of "bombing out" and "Negro re-moval" were on the mark, though
blacks were not the only evictees. Any talk of demolition and renewal
evokes the specters of those cruel, wasteful programs. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But George's program begins with
fostering renewal and intensive
use. Clearance is involved only to serve renewal, never as a goal in
itself. The first land taken would generally be vacant or with
boarded-up buildings. New buildings would draw renters and buyers
from old ones, releasing more space. The idea and impact are to
increase rentable, salable floor space. There would also be more
firms to compete in selling and hiring. How do we know there would be
an aggregate increase in supply? 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Higher density is one test. Untaxing
buildings fosters higher density because density, exemplified by high
buildings, substitutes capital for land. Untaxing capital obviously
makes it more economical.</small></li>
  <li><small>Higher quality is the other test. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The richer the new tenants or
buyers, the more space is released when they move. This is the
hardest point for advocates of the poor to accept. There will always
be specific cases where the rich bump the poor, leading to
contemptuous names like "trickle-down" that dismiss effects on the
market. But the aggregate is what should concern us.</span> If tenants
mobilize against new construction, a minority with a vested interest
harms everyone else, including the poor. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Building new
homes for the
rich, who can afford them, releases usable space for everyone
else.</span></small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There
are three kinds of slums.</span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Only the narrowest kind, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
slum
on high-value land</span>, causes eviction of the poor to benefit the
rich.
Owners in these uncommon areas neglect their buildings, expecting to
demolish them for expanding commerce or high-rise apartments. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
second kind is on bad land which will stay bad</span>. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The third, and most
common, kind is on good land with old buildings that have filtered
down to people who generate bad neighborhood effects</span>. Units go
vacant; land value is low. The market renews these slums not in a
stroke, but by nibbling at the fringes. Yet as it nibbles
incrementally in, it unavoidably creates more space than it consumes,
raising aggregate supply.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The poor also must fear <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">gentrification</span>, in which new gentry
displace the poor in the same old buildings. This is one result of
not renewing; renewal as such is innocent. It seems carping, too, to
criticize people for restoring old buildings. The alternative may be
seen in ungentrified neighborhoods, where buildings simply go out of
use, sheltering no one. But the ultimate end of Georgist policy is
viewed in terms of the nation, pitting cities against each other to
attract people.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nothing
is better for people than to be competed for. It raises
their bargaining power as tenants, buyers, and workers.</span><br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With all that talk of capital and
efficiency, remember that we
began with a quest for justice in sharing rent surplus. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Justice and
efficiency are not at odds; we can have both.</span> The trade-off
expounded
by many economists is to enervate us so we won't do anything. Yet we
have shown not just that we can have both, but more; we cannot have
either without the other. If we do not share rents in the efficient
Georgist manner, social and political pressures will cause
inefficient sharing and eventual dissipation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is what economic policy can
do. The basic impulses, however,
the striving for justice and brotherhood, and the sense of personal
ethics, come from within, and from family, community, schools, and
religion. So does the sense of workmanship, the striving for
excellence without which no system works. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are city councilpersons who
can corrupt the best system ever
blueprinted. The Georgist program may even help to straighten them
out. Lincoln Steffens taught us that the villain in Eden was neither
Eve nor the serpent, but the apple! The apples of discord that
corrupt city councils are unearned increments to land value, which
they create or deny with every decision on extending sewers or
changing zoning. Georgist tax dehydrates those apples by attaching
higher tax to each unearned increment.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist policy has been shown
as a means to revive dying cities,
and in the process to reconcile equity and efficiency; to reconcile
supply-side economics with taxation; to reconcile capital formation
with taxation of the rich. It can be seen as a means of harmonizing
collectivism and individualism, in the most constructive ways
possible. I know of no other program whose proponents can even make
such claims, let alone substantiate them. In a world that has already
priced younger people out of the real estate market, we should find
George's program worth our intense study and support.</small><br>

hard-earned savings and supply them with free air, when the market
has a solution at hand. All they need do is buy offset rights from

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now we are witnessing a major
effort to revive the exclusion
of part or all of capital gains from taxable income, partly on the
grounds that much of the gains are "phantom" income, an illusion of
inflation. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land is not formed, like
capital, by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls). ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Ignoring land and its distinctive attributes has the effect
of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
in the normal course of life and business. It lets advocates of
investing and capital formation abuse the legitimate case for macro
incentives, exploiting the case to camouflage unearned, nonfunctional
rents and increments to land value.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tantamount to ignoring land is
minimizing its weight. </span>Thus
one may acknowledge it indulgently, while actually dismissing it. In
fact, though, land comprises some half the assessed value of taxable
real estate in California, and is not dismissable. Half the assessed
value means more than half the market value because of assessment
discrimination favoring land. A raft of studies of assessment
discrimination, like the sales/assessment ratio studies of the U.S.
Census, show consistent patterns of discrimination favoring land. In
addition to ordinary assessment discrimination there is much
legislated underassessment, for land in forest, farm, country club,
and other favored uses. ///</small><br>

<small>We are not pushing for a general wealth tax, but for

about the good old days when Governor Pat Brown was spending heavily

at $1 million or more. If so, there are 50 x 15,000, or 750,000 homes

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Outline of remarks by Mason
Gaffney, for use at Moscow Congress,
5/21/96&nbsp;
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
Rents are a taxable surplus. I estimate that this
taxable surplus constitutes 35% or more of the national income in
most nations with market economies, and more in resource-rich
nations</span>. ...<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 2. The value of rent is huge.
Every economy produces a
large excess over wages. To be sure, not all of it is surplus. Some
of it goes to replace capital that wears out each year. This is not
part of the net surplus, nor income to the capitalist; it is a return
of capital.</span> ... </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Second, some goes as a return to
capital, over replacement.
This is pure income. Income to capital is not a taxable surplus, but
a functional incentive: it moves people to form and supply capital.
This entails securing new capital (by saving, and borrowing) and
conserving old capital (avoiding dissaving, and avoiding export of
capital).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Capital income serves another
useful function: it steers
capital into the most productive uses. Steering capital to its best
uses has the same useful function as securing new capital, and
conserving old. Using capital effectively is as beneficial as
securing more capital, and ever so much cheaper. The Great Transition
in Russia now is learning to allow income on capital, to secure these
benefits. The trick is to do it without allowing more than is
needed.</small></p>
<p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>
The rest of the excess over wages is captured in the rent of
land. It is a true taxable surplus. The amount is already huge, and
will become huger yet when existing taxes are abated.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The size of rent is not reported
in capitalist nations,
except to trivialize it. Their national accountants, dominated by
landowners, neglect or conceal it artfully, to protect it from being
taxed. Local governments do, however, measure and tax property by
value. More than half the value of property is land. In Vancouver,
B.C., 73% of the value of all property assessed for taxation is land,
even though much land there is exempt from tax, and not assessed at
all. In California's major cities it would be just as high if only we
assessed land here as accurately as they do there.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
3. Rent will become huger yet when you abate taxes
presently levied on production and exchange, because these now
depress the rent of land. </span>That is, in a tax-free market
economy, the
benefit of abating present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The
taxable surplus simply shifts from one form to another.<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This is more than a simple shift
of a fixed amount. When you
substitute land revenues for existing taxes, the surplus actually
grows, as if by synergy. You gain more revenue base than you lose,
because existing taxes now suppress much latent production. Payroll
taxes directly drive workers from taxable jobs to untaxed gains from
crime. Abating those taxes will unleash suppressed economic giants,
along with all the new surplus values their latent production will
generate. "Monetarists" warn you that "there are no free lunches." In
fact, however, good policy creates lots of "free lunches." It makes
the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine the benefits,
alone, of turning people from destructive careers in crime to useful
jobs producing goods.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> At the same time, the effect of
socializing land revenues is
to stimulate better land use - the opposite of the effect of existing
taxes. Every landowner, to pay the required land charge, is pushed to
steer his land to the best use (just as paying interest steers
capital to its best use). Thus, the shift to rent-based revenues
doubly induces new production: it releases the brake of present
taxes, and replaces it with an added push to produce. This is
"supply-side economic policy" in the best and truest sense. It
generates yet more surplus. You may take all of rent to support
government functions, without damaging private market incentives, but
only sharpening them.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> This policy lets us achieve and
reconcile two policies that
many now believe are incompatible, viz.: free markets, and common
rights in land.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;4. Some of the benefit of
abating existing taxes will lodge in higher after-tax wage rates,
rather than higher rents. ... </span></small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
5. Many varieties of natural resources generate rents.
City land is the greatest single source.</span> For example, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">one city,
Vancouver, contains half the value of taxable property in B.C. - a
province of 934,000 sq. kilometers, or 70% larger than France.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
However, many other resources
yield rents. </span>Some of them are
also huge in value, even though some are inconspicuous. Here are a
few varieties of them: <br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It seems to me therefore that we
need to face up to the question
that is known in my trade as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal
Federalism, that is, how is money
going to be distributed by the federal government out of its
so-called surplus, either to people or the States, or localities? ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The reason it's so hard
to sell growth policies at the local level
today in the United States is very much due to the fact that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">t</span><b style="font-weight: bold;">he
United States federal government taxes people and it gives
subventions</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"> to landlords. So the
landlords can get the
subventions without having the people. So who needs people?</span>
That's it
in a nutshell. We need to reverse that, I think, if we're going to be
able to make Georgism work at the local level. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>At any rate, let's begin by looking at the similarities between
the federal systems in the United States and Canada. In both
countries we find something called '<b>vertical balancing'</b> which
means that the senior governments send money to the junior
governments. We find also something called '<b>horizontal
balancing</b>' which means that the payments are made more to the
poorer governments, those that are poorer on a per capita basis, than
to richer ones. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;... <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cannan's Law</span>.
... But the general idea is, you may
think you have tenure control of land but if the municipal government
can tax that land and use that money to finance public welfare
services, public education and other things that are open to all
comers, then you will end up with an uneconomical distribution of
population. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>At the same time, in both countries you find something I will
call
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hammer's Law</span>. This is not a
carpenter's tool but again the name of a
man, an economist in Missouri, who observed in 1935 that if you
compared population to land values in the different counties of his
State (in the very poor counties of the Ozarks the land was hard
scrabble land of very little value, with the very rich lands in the
north-western part of the State, which resembles Iowa) you found that
the population density was much greater on the very poor land of the
Ozarks than it was on the very rich land of the northwest. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Now another similarity to the two countries us that the
subventions that do go from the federal government to the provinces
in Canada (and you find a similar thing in the United States) do not
come from the richer provinces. They come instead from the general
fund, the general taxpayer.<b> There is in other words more vertical
balancing than there is horizontal balancing (horizontal balancing
you remember means equalization among the different
jurisdictions).</b> It's a little like what somebody said about
foreign aid. 'Foreign aid is a device by which poor people in rich
countries are taxed to subsidize rich people in poor countries.'</small><br>
<br>
<small>We'll see that equalisation in most countries works something
like
that; that is, in addition to this inter-provincial equalisation,
there's a tax shift involved where local sources of taxation like the
property tax are being displaced by the federal income tax. I suppose
Ferdinand Marcos would be a splendid example of the kind of person I
was talking about in the poor country and in West Virginia you have
all these coal companies whose owners live in Palm Beach, whose
shareholders live in Palm Beach and such places, who benefit from an
inter-state equalisation that benefits West Virginia. Well these are
similarities.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The federal aid in Canada goes to provinces, whereas in the
United States it goes to specific cities, The U.S. Congressman likes
to have his fingerprint, as they say, on every dollar that goes from
Washington. ... So in the
States the idea has been: <b>Tax the States according to their
population and then give the money back according to political
power.</b> In the United States Senate it means that the smallest
State has just as much clout as the biggest State or would have if
their senators weren't so merchantable. (I mean, in California when
we need something we just look to Nevada or one of those places for a
Senator who is having difficulty raising funds for his next election.
But that's another story.) ...</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the most delightful
distinction about Canadians is the strong
and explicit recognition among almost everyone, even if he's an
economist, who discusses this subject, that different resource
endowments are the basis of inter-provincial differences.</span>
<b>Equalisation in Canadian politics means sharing the economic
rent.</b> Everybody talks that way. Canadian economists even when
they come to the States talk that way. Just as though rent were a
permissible word in polite discourse. It's very refreshing. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">However
there's a very selective attitude towards rent -- towards what rents
are shareable, I should say.</span> </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Rents from oil and gas are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Forest revenues are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Mineral revenues of other kinds are fair game. </small></li>
  <li><small>Water power is fair game. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But now how about the rents that
are generated by the valuable
lands of Montreal, or Toronto, or some of those other big and
powerful cities in the east?</b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><b
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>They are not fair
game.</i></b> As a matter of fact, if you pore through the fine print
of the equalization law, which I did on the airplane, you find the
most interesting exception to what's included in the formula. I'll
explain the formula to you in a moment if you are still awake. ... <br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now let's look at the sharing
formula. <b>The sharing formula in
Canada is essentially based on population and potential tax base.</b>
And it can be made to look very complicated but I think I've boiled
it down to its essence. <b>You take a province's percentage of the
population of Canada, and then you take the percentage of the tax
base that it has, subtract that and that gives you another
percentage. And then you multiply that times the total tax revenue
that's collected throughout Canada from that tax source, and then you
pay them that amount out of the provincial treasury. ... </b></small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The conclusion of all this is that
the Canadian system is
really better in terms of its Georgist implications because the
payments to the provinces, with all the faults that I've described,
are essentially based on population. Population is in the formula.
And if you compare this with the way things are done in the States,
population plays a very minor role in the formula for equalisation
payments in the United States. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, how should it be done?
Well, there's a well known Georgist
economist who figured this out a long time ago and wrote an article
about it. His name is Colin Clark. ... He came up with a plan for
collecting economic rent at the federal level, and he said what we
really should do, and this I think is the ultimate equalisation
payment, is <i>we should classify local jurisdictions according to
land value per capita, and those that have the least land value per
capita, we'll leave all of that land value for them to use for local
purposes. But then we will graduate the federal land tax according to
the amount of land value per capita in the jurisdiction, and thus we
will have a federal tax that automatically achieves inter-regional
equity, without all this razzmatazz that I've been describing about
inter-regional equalisation payments. </i></small><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The hardest
choices are those regarding land use, because there is just so much.
We can build more houses, cars, and boats, write more music and
drama, spawn and educate more people, but we cannot make another
Hudson Valley. ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;">economics
shows how the market sorts and
arranges land uses, giving us a corn belt, a wheat belt, and a cotton
belt.</span> Economists pride themselves on this achievement. (Some
preen
themselves too much, as we will see, and pride goeth before a
fall.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>Sometimes the rich take land from the poor, provoking sympathy,
strong rhetoric, and occasionally effective rear-guard resistance to
such changes. Actually, a well-oiled market is often quite democratic.
People of moderate income, by crowding, can outcompete those of high
income for the same land ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other worthy goals that
conflict are open space and water
conservation. ... </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Something
has to give. Thus far it has been wetlands that gave.
</span>Once, perhaps, we had too much wetland, but that was long ago. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">We
cannot accommodate all those uses, and save wetlands too, just by
having restaurants stop serving water, or putting bricks in toilet
tanks. Those are just token or "Goo-Goo" measures for parlor
reformers; they distract us from real problems, and substitute for
real solutions. What is the highest and best use of water? Wetlands,
maybe; more golf courses, maybe not. But we need a rule to gauge
"highest and best use." Is it the market? Read on.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some of the losers in the market
game are not willing to grin and
bear it. Instead, they write new rules; they want to play a different
game. Soilsmen did this long since. They like to classify land and
rank it by its potentiality for growing crops. Farming is - to them -
the ultimate value, so it is the highest and best use: cities may
have what's left over. It is perhaps poetic justice that
habitat-savers are now doing the same thing to farmers. They conceive
highest use as that which saves endangered species: soils and farming
may be damned, right along with housing, commerce, transportation,
industry, storage, water supply, waste disposal, fire control,
education, religion, mining, government, national defense,
recreation, and whatever else needs land. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">All human activities, and
survival itself, need land, so that list is a long one.</span> Each
constituent of the other uses becomes an enemy.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both Soilsmen and
habitatspersons have a point, we will see, but
they have a fatal weakness. Neither has a system that composes
conflict with other worthy goals, including each others'. As to
cities, both soilsmen and habitat-savers would direct cities away
from low-cost, high-productivity land to the high-cost leftover
lands. They would not make this an end in itself, of course, but it
is the necessary by-product of downgrading urban usage in the
competition for land.</small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, to
restore citriculture and habitat in what is now L.A. we
would move the city folks to hazard-prone floodplains, steep slopes
subject to fire and erosion, quake-prone fault lines and liquefiable
soils, etc. We would also move them away from the center, imposing
longer commutes, greater auto-dependency, longer utility lines,
longer hauls to dispose of solid wastes, more air to protect, more
aquifer surface to protect, more land to protect from flooding,
etc. ...<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is another kind of
fundamentalist, the private property
kind. The economics profession (my tribe) has, in recent years,
largely abdicated its proper role as an arbitrator and gone over
mainly to the side of private-property extremism. This is the
essential meaning of "Neo-classical Economics," which is the idiom of
most discourse in the field today, both in business and in the
profession.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How did economics get so twisted?
Don't blame Adam Smith, or David
Ricardo, or John Stuart Mill, or John E. Cairnes, or Knut Wicksell,
or Philip Wicksteed, sterling 19th Century writers. Rather, blame
J.B. Clark, Karl Marx, Richard T. Ely, Alvin Johnson, Frank Fetter,
Frank Knight, George Stigler, and a host of lesser figures who
gradually warped economics into its present form. How did they do
it?</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They wiped out land, resources,
nature, and the environment as a
separate class for analysis. In official Neo-classical doctrine, the
world is an infinite reservoir of raw land and resources. Raw land
has no value until man does two things:</small></div>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small>Man subjects land to private tenure.<strong> ... </strong></small></li>
    <li><small>Man improves the raw land, pumping value into it<strong>. ... </strong></small></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In a proper view of things, I
submit, private property is a means
to an end. It is not an end in itself; it needs a functional
rationale. The end is to get land put to the best use. All the
private land in the world was originally granted by some sovereign
public person or body, mainly for that purpose, not as a welfare
entitlement. Landowners and their lawyers have slyly, over time,
turned the means into an end, a fetish they endow with "sanctity."
This is a term they borrowed from absolutist medieval theology.
"Sanctity" means the quality or state of being holy or sacred, hence
inviolable. It means property may not be challenged, or even
questioned. It has become an end in itself, its own voucher. You're
not even supposed to think about it, it is above thought. Taboo!</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Neoclassical economics,
historically, marked the final, total
surrender of the profession to this fetish. The modern economist's
view runs something like this: "I pledge allegiance to the 14th
Amendment, and to the overinterpretation of private landowner
supremacy for which it has come to stand." It is ironic to recall
that Radical Republicans passed that Amendment, at a time when a
"Radical Republican" was one who favored freeing the slaves. The 14th
Amendment was designed to protect the rights of freedmen. As
interpreted now, the 14th Amendment means that The Emancipation
Proclamation itself was unconstitutional! Fortunately, no one has
brought that case - yet.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Neo-classical economists' view
of their proper role is rather
like that in The Realtor's Oath, which includes a vow "To protect the
individual right of real estate ownership." The word "individual" is
construed broadly to include corporations, estates, trusts, anonymous
offshore funds, schools, government agencies, institutions,
partnerships, cooperatives, the Duke of Westminster, the Sultan of
Brunei, the Medellin Cartel, Saddam Hussein, congregations,
Archbishops, families (including criminal families) and so on, but
"individual" sounds more all-American and subsumes them all. This is
a potent chant that stirs people to extremes of self-righteousness
and siege mentality when challenged.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The resemblance between
Neo-classical economics and the Realtor's
Oath is easier to understand when you learn that Professor Richard T.
Ely, founder of the modern discipline of Land Economics, was heavily
subsidized by the National Association of Real Estate Boards, the
utilities, the major landowning railroads, and others of like mind
and property interests.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When
it comes to violating property rights, air pollution today is
perhaps the greatest invader and confiscator of property.</span> Where
do
economists stand? Once a few of them tried to say, following A.C.
Pigou, "let the polluter pay," and in parts of Europe they still do.
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">In our
modern backward thinking here at home, however, it's not the
polluter who is invading the property of others, nor the human rights
of those not owning property. Rather, when you tell them to stop, the
government is invading their rights.</span> The wage-earning taxpayers
must
pay them to stop, else you are violating both the 14th Amendment and
the "Coase Theorem," a rationalization for polluting now dearly
beloved by Neo-classical economists.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leapfrogging
is when developers jump over the next eligible
lands for urban expansion, and build farther out, here and there. ... </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have met the enemy, and it is US (Urban Sprawl). Let's
analyze
this beast, US. ...</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Urban sprawl, which creates a
psychological effect of great
crowding, is not the product of development as such, but of
leapfrogging. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Leapfrogging means
chaos, with development in the wrong
places and times. Infilling, on the other hand, is anti-sprawl. It is
the cure for sprawl. </span><br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
common belief is that the search of open space is the main force
behind sprawl</span>. You may test that by observing high density,
cookie-cutter subdivisions scattered throughout the land. Within each
such development, you are living at urban densities. It is when you
get onto the freeway to commute, or shop, or take the kids to school
or the dentist, or worship, that you experience open space. You
experience it as a negative resource, an obstacle between where you
are and where you want to go.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A favorite fallacy is that
sprawl results from free individual
choice. In fact, sprawl results mainly from subsidies to sprawl,
enforced through taxation and/or utility rate regulation. Thus it is
imposed, not freely chosen. </span>The classic case, which exemplifies
the
whole genus, is postal service. It costs you 29&cent; to send a
letter across the street downtown, or from rural Idaho to rural
Florida. The generic name for such subsidies to sprawl is
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">postage-stamp pricing</span>" (a
species of spatial cross-subsidy), which
gives you the idea. ... </small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In British Columbia, people move
around a good deal by car-ferry,
because of the terrain. The Provincial Government ("The Crown
Provincial") runs the system. There are many lovely little islands in
the Straits of Georgia, between Vancouver Island and the mainland,
favored by the wealthy, the exclusive and reclusive. Being more
sybaritic than Henry D. Thoreau, and politically puissant, they have
demanded and received car-ferry service. This service costs about $10
for every $1 in revenue. The resulting deficit is covered by raising
rates on the main plebeian line, Victoria-Vancouver. Naturally, these
cheap ferries attract new visitors to the islands, and new demand for
land there.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Here
is how we get urban sprawl with leapfrogging. Remember the
last time you moved and went househunting? You saw some mouthwatering
homes, but they were not for sale. You had to find motivated sellers,
and pick from what they offered. </span>It's the same with builders.
They
scour the exurbs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seeking
motivated sellers</span>. Ideally the most
motivated sellers would line up by distance from the existing city,
but the market is not ideal. Each seller is moved by his personal
circumstances, not the geographical location.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Potential
builders are little concerned with the social costs they
might impose, so long as others are to bear them.</span> Thus, they
sometimes settle for and build 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>on steep lands (like Malibu Hills)
with flammable brush and erosion problems, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>on flood plains (like
Victoria Woods subdivision in Riverside), 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>on soils subject to
liquefaction in quakes (like Northridge), 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>in canyons and arroyos, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>on
lands with limited access for emergency equipment. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>They even build on
lands without water supply, even in arid southern California, then
demand water and get it, secure in the knowledge that Sacramento
rejected a recent move to ban development in areas with no assured
water supply. ...
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those are the carrots. A good
stick is also needed. We have seen
how leapfrogging results from the scattered locations of motivated
sellers. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We
can motivate sellers near-in, and in compact increments
as we expand spatially, by raising land taxes there. </span>Proposition
13
makes this difficult, but not impossible: many special assessments
have the essential motivating quality of land taxes, with a different
legal form, that exempts them from Proposition 13.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I could wax rhapsodic about the
results to expect from such
taxation, but have done so elsewhere and will leave it with a word:
visit Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, Copenhagen, or Johannesburg, which
have made use of this principle to excellent effect.<br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These are basic issues, and call
for bold actions. Do not waste
your time on wimpish meliorism, or "Goo-goo" thinking. For
example:</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is said we need a land
use inventory. We already have lots of them: people have been
classifying land for decades. The question is, what shall we do with
them? </small>
  <p><small>It is said we need "risk ratings." These are subject to
manipulation and juggling, like benefit/cost analyses of recent ill
fame. The question is, who will control the ratings, and to what ends?</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>It is said we need fire models. We have fire models; they
were already chic in 1950. The question is, how to keep scattered homes
out of fire-prone areas, where they make prescribed controlled burning
nearly impossible. The question is how to keep the State and the fire
insurance industry from cross-subsidizing these homes by averaging
their risks in with others.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rather, let us study how to
emulate the model of Butchart Gardens,
near Victoria, B.C. Butchart doesn't sound like a gardener's name,
and sure enough, Mr. Butchart was a hardrock miner who attacked the
earth and left a great ugly gash in it. Ah, but Mrs. Butchart, she
wanted space for a garden, so she made one there. She rediscovered
the truth that land is not just the matter that occupies space, it is
space, always renewable and reclaimable. Now Butchart Gardens is one
of the world's great beauty spots, drawing visitors from everywhere -
in the summertime you hear every language there. Our decayed central
cities, too, may bloom again like Mrs. Butchart's garden. Let us make
it our model.&nbsp; </small><small><font size="+1"><small><b><a

<a href="../docs/Gaffney_18F.html"><br>
Eighteen Fallacies</a>&nbsp; [this has the first 7; until I get the
other 11, it hasn't been cross-reffed into the themes pages.]<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>1. "Water rights
are real property" ... </b>The evidence is, you do not find water
licenses recorded like
title deeds to real property. More important, you do not find them on
the real estate tax rolls. Never have I heard a licensee demand to be
taxed because he holds real property. ... </small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>2. "Real Property
is Sacred and Untouchable"&nbsp; </b>Wrong! Suppose this layman writer
and the Oregon Chief Justice
were in error, and water permits were real property. That is out of
the frying pan, into the fire. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What does 'real' mean, applied to
property or estate? It is not
the opposite of 'imaginary.' No, 'real' is an elided English form of
the French 'regal' taken into English when English kings spoke their
native French. <i style="text-decoration: underline;">Real property is
The King's. </i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We threw out kings in 1783, but
not the royal powers. Rather, we
transferred those powers to our State governments. By succession,
real property means government property! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Every landowner is a tenant of the
king or his successors in
interest.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The very word 'own'
comes from 'owe.' An owner is one
who owes. What he owed historically was fealty to his sovereign.</span>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That used to mean bending the
knee, kissing the royal foot,
swearing allegiance, and showing up on demand to smite the enemy.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It has evolved into servitudes
like eminent domain, police
power, the public trust doctrine, and something else that our lawyers
may have glided over, but economists underline: the tax power.<b>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These concepts are basic to common
law which has been brought into
every U.S. state constitution (save Louisiana's). Moses was not just
whistling Dixie when he quoted The Lord as saying "The land shall not
be sold forever; for the land is mine, and ye are strangers and
sojourners with me." ... <br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>3. "You cannot
take real property without compensation"&nbsp; </b>Wrong! Whoever said
that has not been following zoning law. As a
rule of thumb, zoning can take away about 85% of the use value of
land before it is declared an unconstitutional 'taking' of property.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The owner must be left with some
'economically viable' use,
meaning almost any use whose revenues exceed expenses, however small
the net gain. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to other property, well! No one
has yet been compensated for
losing the fruits of his sweated brow to the IRS, at rates which once
soared as high as 90% in the top bracket. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>4. "If property
falls, America falls" </b>Wrong, at least in my opinion. Property is
not an end in itself;
it is a means of getting resources put to their best use for the
general good.</small><br>
<small><b>5. "The cost of
water is passed through to consumers in higher prices"&nbsp; </b>Wrong!
At last I'm in my own field. Prices are determined by
supply and demand, not cost. If you sell in a national or world
market, or even a competitive local market, you are a price-taker,
not a price-maker. You can't pass cost hikes on to consumers; you
have to eat them. ...</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With dearer water you use less by
controlling it better, switching
from primitive furrow irrigation to sprinklers, spitters and drip.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This in turn lets you do new
things like growing avocados on steep
hillsides formerly barren, yielding more dollars of product for less
water (and in this case on waste land). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The above facts point to a
fascinating, portentous corollary:
you can tax water withdrawals without wrecking the water economy.
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the contrary, such taxes
(carefully crafted to be constructive)
can encourage conservation, getting more bins and bales for the
bucket, so to speak. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Americans are raised on anti-tax
slogans masquerading as economic
analysis, always presuming taxes destroy good incentives and wreck
the economy. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a kind of tax
that
raises revenue while strengthening the
economy. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>6. "You can't stop
a landowner from pumping on his own land"&nbsp; </b>Wrong! You can
even control his hunting and fishing there, and
apply police power. As to pumping, it depends on whether he owns what
is under his land. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is oil, we all know mineral
rights are routinely severed
from surface rights by sale, reservation or lease. Water can be
subject to constraints, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A simple solution to half our
tractable water problems would be
a severance tax on water withdrawals. If you can regulate it you can
tax it. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A tax can be viewed as nothing
more than an economic price
charged by the owner of water (the state) for using its property. ...<br>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>7. "Economics is
hostile to environmentalism"</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Partly wrong, although some
economists are guilty as charged.
Economics, properly pursued, deals with how best to meet human wants.
<b>Recreation, fishing, wildlife, amenities, clean air, pure water,
sustained resource supply, watershed protection, good health, and
conservation are legitimate human wants. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Many economists, I confess and
deplore, are blind to such
values, and think only of maximizing GNP measured in the brutal
old-fashioned way, developed during World War II for war's emergency
purposes and never revised. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Others, cowed by cow college
deans, dare not think at all, and
write only of sustaining farm land values: damn the cost to others.
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many others, however, are
leaders in developing environmental and
resource economics. Today wise environmentalists, rather than sniping
at all economists, are allying with the last kind. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Here are four reasons why environmentalists and economists are
natural allies.</small><br>
<small><b>(a) Economizing is conserving. ...</b></small><br>
<small><b>(b) Subsidy wastes both dollars and ecologies. ...</b></small><br>
<small><b>(c) Correct economic analysis prescribes more water for fish
...</b></small><br>
<small><b>(d) Correct economic analysis presumes public trusts ...</b></small><br>
<br>
<small>You would be amazed to hear anyone say 'I will pay any price,'
There are many documented instances of a person swearing under oath his
land is worth no more than $X for tax assessment purpose and soon
thereafter swearing again it is worth $15X when being condemned for a
park or other public use, because he wouldn't sell it for less. </small><br>

For Want of a Landlord </a><br>
<br>
<a href="../docs/Gaffney_HG100YL_Reconciler.html">Henry George 100 Years
Later: The Great Reconciler</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George (1839-1897) is best
known today for <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress
and Poverty</i></b></a> (1879). Eloquent, timely and challenging, this
book soon became and remains the all-time best-seller on economic
theory and policy.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1879, George electrified the
world by identifying one
underlying cause for two great economic plagues: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>chronic poverty arising from insufficient demand for
labor, and </small></li>
  <li><small>cycles of boom and bust. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These twin plagues arose from
concentrated ownership of land,
compounded by land speculation. Large landowners and speculators
(often one and the same) held the best land idle or underused,
forcing labor onto marginal land and driving down wages. Collapse of
speculative land price bubbles caused periodic slumps.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>(By "land" George meant
exclusive rights to use natural
resources in a specified territory. It included mining, water,
fishing, and timber rights, road and rail rights-of way, and some
patents. George emphasized the high value and productivity of urban
land, which facilitated communication and trade. Today, we would add
to "land" such items as taxi medallions, telecommunications licenses
and pollution "rights".)
</i></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>George followed his analysis
with a plausible, practicable
remedy: eliminate all taxes except for a tax on land values.</b> The
"single tax," as it later became known, would invigorate the economy
by breaking up large idle holdings, making land available to those
who would use it. And it would suck the air out of speculative
bubbles, damping the boom and bust cycle. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Taxing land is very progressive because land ownership is
highly concentrated among the most wealthy, far more concentrated than
income. </small></li>
  <li><small>Taxing land is fair, because the community rather than the
individual landowner creates land values. </small></li>
  <li><small>Taxing land is economically efficient, because the owner
cannot avoid a land tax ("shift" it) by choosing less-taxed options. ...</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George toured the world as an
immensely popular political
activist, orator and folk hero. He died suddenly in 1897, while
running a second time for Mayor of New York City. A hundred thousand
mourners marched at his funeral.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the US, "Georgism" melded into
the populist movement, and later
into the Progressive Movement. At the national level, the Progressive
Movement dominated both major political parties for 17 years,
1902-19. At the local level, its influence continued through the
early 1920s. Local property taxation was modified along Georgist
lines: land assessments were raised relative to improvements and
rates were increased substantially. California water districts
financed by land taxes catapulted California to the top-producing
farm state in the Union, using land that had been desert or range.
California generated farm jobs and homes, while other states
destroyed them by allowing well-connected speculators and "robber
barons" to grab large tracts of land. A Georgist, Congressman Warren
Worth Bailey of Pennsylvania, drafted <b>the first Federal personal
income tax law on Georgist lines: falling mainly on very high incomes
from property. ...<br>
</b></small></p>
<p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Neo-classical
economists give us only a hard choice: we may have
equity, or efficiency, but not both. By contrast, George's program
reconciles equity and efficiency. Think of it! George takes two polar
philosophies, collectivism and individualism, and composes them into
one solution. He cuts the Gordian knot. Like Keynes after him, George
inspires us by saying, "Forget the bitter tradeoffs; we can have it
all!"<span style="font-weight: normal;"> &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b><a

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Epilogue: how the
public demonstrates its preference for resolutions over dismal
choices</b> </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is part of George's genius that
his proposals solve one problem
by resolving it with another, turning two problems into one solution.
It is something like tuning up the orchestra for a concert, turning
dissonance into harmony, and keeping the beat together, turning
cacaphony into rhythm. It is the mark of good solutions that they
reconcile and resolve, rather than simply "trade-off." <font size="-2"><small>[If
you ever immerse yourself in mathematics deeply enough to find
different proofs of the same proposition, you recognize the epiphany
when it all comes together, and everything supports and confirms
everything else. Then you know you have the right answer. Good ideas
and good policies support and reinforce each other.] </small></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That is what George means when
he writes that "the laws of the
universe are harmonious." That is what Founding Fathers like
Washington, Jefferson and Franklin meant by a "natural order." Like
them, George is a deist in spirit, a believer in the consistency of
the universe. The concept that some things are more "natural" than
others is not arbitrary. The clue that one has found the "natural"
law is that it makes forces harmonize and team together instead of
clashing, and neutralizing each other.&nbsp;<font size="-2"><small><i></i></small></font>The
principle of constructive
synthesis - a touch of Hegel - is another way of perceiving the value
of turning cacaphony into harmony.<font size="-2"><small> </small></font></small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists today offer us mainly
"trade-offs" and hard choices. For every good thing we must give up
another, so net gains are just
marginal. That is the approved posture: it makes one seem
hard-headed, worldly, and practical. Too much positive thinking
sounds suspiciously optimistic, and invites rebellious cynical
muttering that "there ain't no free lunch." It goes back at least to
Malthus, who offered mankind the hard choice of food vs. sex. That
sort of thinking is what made people call economics "the dismal
science."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A true resolution is much more to
be desired. To get one good
thing we get a second one as well. It is remarkable how many "hard
choices" are turned into benign resolutions in George's program. He
is a genius at finding the essential harmony of interests now
concealed beneath confused thinking. Instead of a dismal trade-off,
there is a "free lunch," or "synergy": the whole is greater than the
sum of its parts. Such grand resolutions, when possible, deserve to
be called "true win-win solutions."&nbsp;<font size="-2"><small><i>
</i></small></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
most obvious such true win-win solution is putting the
unemployed to work. </span>Recognizing this truth is no monopoly of
George:
Keynesian economists long insisted that there is no social cost in
putting the unemployed to work. It is a measure of the bankruptcy
and myopia of many economists today that even those voices are muted,
and that obvious gain is denied: working is called a "sacrifice of
leisure," just another trade-off. Unemployment has become
"job-searching."&nbsp;<font size="-2"><small><i></i></small></font><font
 size="-2"><small>[Before long, some economist will proclaim that
sleeping on heating grates is "home-searching."]</small></font>&nbsp;
It is more likely a
sacrifice of burglary, vandalism, drug-use, jail time, loitering,
looting, collecting welfare, and sullen misery. Trading such bad
time for the gratification, pride, on-the-job learning, and moral
uplift of working is not a trade-off, but a double gain. It is a
true "free lunch," if you will.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Many economists today react to
such ideas with reflexive
disbelief. They put down optimistic claims by calling them
"panaceas," too good to be true. <span style="font-weight: bold;">TAANSTAAFL
</span><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-2"><small>["There Ain't
No Such Thing As A Free Lunch."]</small></font><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> is their slogan</span>; cynicism their
preferred posture. However, false pessimism is just as false and
damaging as false optimism. A truer slogan is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TITSTAAFL: "There Is
Too Such a Thing As A Free Lunch."</span> It's rather a question of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">WIGGI?:
"Who Is Going to Get It?"</span>. Many dismal alleged trade-offs are
just
someone's mental blocks that stand athwart the path to abundance, or,
worse, ways to control and exploit us. Often, in fact, "we can have
it all." Is it too good to be true? Let us itemize the many
resolutions of alleged trade-offs and standoffs that George's program
will achieve. ...<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the state or local level,
George's program is the answer to
California Governor Pete Wilson' dilemma, and every governor's
dilemma: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>it untaxes and attracts capital, and encourages capital
formation, without giving away the store, or untaxing the rich, or
starving the schools and police. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>It raises state revenues from the
richest people while attracting business and wealth with the very
same stroke.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
unique, remarkable quality of a property tax based
on land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land, however high the tax rate. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Not one square foot will walk out
of town. The only bad thing to say
about this tax's incentive effects is that it stimulates
revitalization, and makes jobs.</span> If some people think that is
bad,
maybe they are the problem.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So George's simple program not
only reconciles efficiency and
equity, it squares taxes and incentives.</small><small>...</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Summary</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Dismal trade-offs, deadlocks, and
standoffs are just mental blocks
and smokescreens. Henry George began with a quest for justice in
sharing the rent surplus. He found that justice and efficiency are
not at odds, we can have both. This trade-off that many economists
expound is a stall, a put-off to enervate and unman us so we won't do
anything. It may ease the conscience to think justice must be
sacrificed for efficiency, and schools starved and libraries closed
to free up incentives, so nothing, really, can ever be done. We all
feel compassion by nature but, to survive and stay whole in this
world of beggars and bandits, learn to harden our hearts and cork it
in. We learn to screen out evidence of suffering and injustice, and
rationalize what we cannot deny. This mindset, while understandable,
is unaffordable in a period of dangerous national decline, and
growing division between haves and have-nots. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What we have shown here is not
just that we can have both justice
and efficiency, but more, we cannot have either one without the
other. If we don't share rents efficiently, in the Georgist manner,
social and political pressures will continue to cause inefficient
sharing and eventual dissipation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economic discourse is afflicted
with pessimists who firmly cling
to mutually inconsistent positions at the same time, each posing an
insoluble problem. Some, for example, believe the world is racing to
starvation, and favor limiting demand through birth control, while in
another context they deplore "overproduction," or "underconsumption,"
and favor choking off farm production to keep farmers from losing
money. George, of course, would see demand as the answer to supply,
and land as the field on which the twain may meet and satisfy each
other, leveling them upwards.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Again, some favor cheap power and
good roads for rural areas,
regardless of cost, and then favor low-density zoning to keep people
out. George, of course, would favor infilling to make full use of
short interior lines at high capacity, and lower cost per
customer.</small> <small><a href="../docs/Gaffney_HG%27sEoA.html">Read

in the Teaching of Economics and
History within the American Education System?</a><br>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Q: ... How, why and by whom
do you think the teaching of economics in America has been
corrupted?
</small><br>
<br>
<small><b><i>Mason Gaffney</i></b> - Generically, it goes back
thousands
of years: <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">every
system that divides mankind into rentiers and proles
requires a rationale.</span> Those with leisure have time and resources
to
provide it: sometimes directly, but usually through hired guns.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> - Do you believe this purchasing of
economic
theory still going on today, and if so, what well-known economists do
you suspect of being involved with it?</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - It pervades the
culture of the profession. Most
members are looking for grants and promotions to put frosting on
their cake. They call it, "Responding to the incentive structure,"
giggle nervously, and shuffle the blame onto "the system." They
abandon personal moral responsibility, and quickly become part of the
system themselves. They rationalize their own dereliction by
attacking those who expose it, turning themselves into a generation
of vipers. Grants come from those with money. Follow the money trail.
Most administrators are even worse: they push faculty members to get
outside grants, whatever the source. They only occasionally decline
one when faced with embarrassing publicity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Look at the names and histories of
major grantors and patrons of
the past: Stanford, Rockefeller, Russell Sage, Carnegie, Hewitt,
Cornell, Wharton ... Look at the governing boards of major private
and public institutions. It's all there to see, for those that have
eyes to see, minds to draw the obvious conclusions, and hearts to
carry on the good fight for the public interest. Upton Sinclair
spelled it out pretty well back in 1923 or so, in "<b><i>The Goose
Step: a Study of Education in America</i></b>".</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It's partly a matter of coopting
people by dangling money before
them, and partly a matter of selecting and supporting those whose
ideas are already more simpatico to the major grantors. It's hard to
tell the difference, so it's hard to say who's been corrupted, and
who corrupted himself at an early age.... </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All that interesting Georgist
history is blanked out of most
history books. <br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> - If what you're saying is true, this is
a
pretty big story; why aren't you doing this interview with Larry
King, or at least Geraldo? Do you think the press is getting paid
off, too or do you just need a better press agent?</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Once the public
domain was handed over to a
handful of rich, politically connected people, they consolidated
their position by taking control of the media, of education, and the
churches. This has become so much a part of our being that people
hardly think about it, and what it implies. <b>No one needs to pay
off the press: in most cities, the biggest single downtown landowner
is the press itself. No one needs to pay off radio and TV stations:
their spectrum assignments are the basis of their being.</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are all kinds of
corruption. </small><br>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>There are physics Profs. who consult for nuclear
firms; </small></li>
  <li><small>entomology Profs. who consult for pesticide firms; </small></li>
  <li><small>Profs. of
medicine who switch mothers' eggs around; </small></li>
  <li><small>Profs. of natural resource
economics who are promoted for protecting the privileges of water
hogs and land speculators; </small></li>
  <li><small>Profs. of agronomy who tailor their work
to the needs of giant landowners; etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>TPR</b> -
What's your take on the Pennsylvania story?
Are the landlords running scared from the new 'Whiskey Tax
Rebellion'?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Pennsylvania
allows its cities what is called
"local option" on property tax policy. This gives each city the
option of down-taxing buildings and up-taxing land. An accelerating
number of cities have chosen this option, the latest being
Allentown.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Landowners can't run, not without
leaving their land behind; and
the idea is not to scare them, but show most of them they have more
to gain from un-taxing buildings than they lose from up-taxing land.
Un-taxing buildings encourages new building, with all the gains that
brings. When a city gets old and rundown, a lot of people get the
point.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The opponents have
several
points from which to attack. Now they
are focusing on the State Legislature. As it happens, Harrisburg
itself is one of the cities that has adopted the option of
down-taxing buildings, and the good results may be seen by looking
out the window; but many legislators get their ideas and motivations
from elsewhere. The great danger to the movement in Pa. is that about
when half the cities will have chosen to down-tax buildings, the
legislature will follow the bad example of California and replace
the property tax by raising state income and sales taxes. ...&nbsp;</small></div>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>TPR</b> -
Explain exactly what would happen if America
began shifting taxes off of everything else and onto land value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Exactly? The
effects are too great, too
pervasive to predict exactly. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It would unleash massive forces of production, exchange,
capital formation, and building, forces now trapped and frustrated in
the coils of our complex, counterproductive tax mess. </small></li>
  <li><small>It would enhance the supply of goods and services while
simultaneously lowering taxes on the poor and the workers, thus
reconciling the needs of both efficiency and equity, in one stroke. </small></li>
  <li><small>It would raise taxes on the richest Americans, and alien
landowners, too, without diluting in the least their incentives to
work, to create capital, or to hire workers: it would actually fortify
those incentives. </small></li>
  <li><small>It would spring people loose to renew large parts of our
older cities, and rehab what they do not re place. </small></li>
  <li><small>It would let local school districts support education at
much higher levels than now, without fear of driving away business. </small></li>
  <li><small>It would satisfy the demand for housing on land that
Nature suited for housing, without invading flood plains, steep slopes,
remote deserts, and other places that cost society dearly to serve and
rescue. </small></li>
  <li><small>It would raise the demand for labor, taking people off
welfare and keeping them out of jails.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One could go on at length, but
Henry George summed it up in three
words: "<b>Association in Equality</b>." Civilization advances when
those conditions are met, and declines when they are denied. America
has been denying them; we are all paying the price.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b style="font-style: italic;">TPR</b><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> - For an economics professor, you're said
to be
quite an expert on the environment, what's the connection?</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Economic
analysis, properly used, can serve the
cause of environmentalism. The neo-classical economists abused both
economics and the environment badly, as a byproduct of their drive to
discredit classical political economy, and Henry George. John Bates
Clark wrote that land is not scarce, that mankind can convert capital
into land without limit, and create as much as we please. He wrote
that natural resources have no value to mankind until and unless they
are privatized; that privatization itself is what creates value. Our
universities churn out thousands of new economists yearly, imbued
with such attitudes. When Rachel Carson kicked off the new
environmentalism in 1962 with her "<b><i>Silent Spring,</i></b>" most
economists trashed or disdained her: they 'd been trained that
way.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Faced with the obvious growth of
environmental sentiment,
economists dealt with it as they have with other problems: they
absorbed it in the discipline, then marginalized it. Now they can say
it is part of economics, while they proceed to ignore or trivia lize
it in their major policy pronouncements, wherein endless territorial
expansion continues to be not just a goal, but a necessity to make
the system work.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The legitimate goals of
environmentalists, they coopt and distort.
Here are two examples. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>They'll tell you that it's not OK to promote oil
conservation by taxing withdrawals, but it is OK to do so by
monopolizing the industry - monopolists are our best friends. </small></li>
  <li><small>They'll tell you it's not OK to check polluters by taxing
their effluents, but it is OK to give them property rights to pollute,
based on past emissions, and then buy those rights back from them at
their price. You think I'm just making that up? I wish I were! The EPA
is actually applying that idea around the country. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thank you, John B.
Clark;
thank you, neo-classical economics. It
all follows from Clark's efforts to avoid any recognition that
natural resources are common property: in this case, the air itself
is turned into private property. Your very right to breathe, you have
to buy from major owners of the air. And how did they establish that
ownership? By their track records of dumping their crud in the air in
the past. It beggars belief, but there it is: it shows what the war
against Henry George has made of the discipline of economics.</small><small>
<br>
</small></div>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>TPR</b> -
If Earth's ecosystem and poorest people will
be the largest beneficiaries of the reform you advocate, how will it
ever gain public acceptance in America's increasingly money-driven
political system? If the press will never acknowledge it and the
education system is so lost and blind, how can this reform ever
happen? Are Georgists like the character in 1984?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>MG</i></b> - Every system
must purify itself from time to
time, or be destroyed. How long that takes depends on how strong a
base you started from, and how strong your rivals are. The USA
started from a strong base, built in part by the Progressives
(including many Georgists) and the New Dealers (in spite of some of
their destructive moves). Now, our leaders think we are riding high,
just because the stock market is rising, even though real wage rates
have fallen for 25 years, our debts are staggering, our liabilities
and contingent liabilities exceed our assets, our biggest growth
industry is building jails, our population is losing its literacy,
our major cities have decayed, and so on. Marx was right about one
thing, at least: the system carries the seeds of its own
destruction.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our leaders have done a good job
of subverting our rivals, in part
by forcing on them the ideas of neo-classical economics, the ideas
that originated as part of the anti-Georgist campaigns. Japan gave us
a good run for a while, but got suckered into aping our worst habits,
and hence a good old-fashioned American-style land boom and bust that
has knocked them out of the race for a while. Most of S.E. Asia has
now followed suit.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It's a delicate balance. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The haves can brainwash the have-nots
just so long, until reality breaks through, as in 1929. When it does,
you want to be ready with a plan tailored to the times, which
Georgists at that time were not. </span>Meantime, we keep the idea
alive by
recording and publicizing important facts, such as that the
prosperity of Hong Kong was a product of Georgist policies; likewise
that of Taipei, Sydney, Johannesburg, and other great cities. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>We support object lessons like those in Allentown, Pa.,
and go for a really visible one like Philadelphia. </small></li>
  <li><small>We combat moves to raise sales and income and payroll
taxes, and awaken people to the benefits of lowering them. </small></li>
  <li><small>We awaken people to the possibilities of including more
land income, and less payroll income, in the base of the income tax. </small></li>
  <li><small>We support efforts to democratize the media. </small></li>
  <li><small>We alert people to the corruption of academia and the kept
think-tanks, and provide alternative venues by mobilizing the resources
of the few Georgist-oriented foundations. </small></li>
  <li><small>We get on social action committees of various churches,
and try to give their well-meant but often foggy-minded efforts some
clearer focus, with more punch and less platitude. </small></li>
  <li><small>We remind people of their common rights, and the history
of common property in land. </small></li>
  <li><small>We expose and ridicule the inconsistencies and hypocrisies
of kept economists, hoping that embarrassment will convert those whom
truth will not.</small></li>
  <li><small>We avoid the temptation to play Jeremiah, but seek
to
join the
system and make it work better, even as Henry George and his friends
did.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Megabucks for Negabucks: Solving the Water
Crisis</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... When Henry George
wrote &#8220;We must make land common property&#8221; it was in a place
and at a time when most land in sight had been privatized only
recently, using crude methods. &#8220;Force and fraud&#8221; were not
dim memories in 1879, but a living presence. So George&#8217;s phrase
did not strike people then as being any more shocking than it is
today to remind them that the public domain, with its pasturelands,
waters, rights of way, the air, radio spectrum, fish, mineral riches
and timber, belongs to us all in common.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The California Constitution and
Water Code, like those of most
states, are explicit that &#8220;The waters of California belong to
the people of California.&#8221; Water is not private property,
evidenced by its not being taxed as such (except indirectly, as it
adds to the value of fee simple land). Water is not, therefore,
subject to the limits that Prop. 13 (and cognate laws in other
states) impose on property tax rates. The State, as owner, can
presumably charge whatever the legislature decides, without its being
considered a tax at all. Water claimants would of course resist
strenuously, with all the lawyers and pawns and media that money can
buy, and social pressure sway, but the public has a strong case.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It&#8217;s not just water <i>per se</i>,
but also the lands under
what were originally <b>shallow waters</b>. Most coastal cities have
increased their areas greatly by filling in shallow waters.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>There are four major ways that individuals and corporations
acquire the use of waters. <b> One is by riparian rights</b>. To own
the bank of a lake or stream is to have a right to the water,
theoretically &#8220;undiminished and unpolluted,&#8221; that nature
put there - subject to the equal rights of other riparians, but not
of anyone else.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>A second way to claim water is by owning land overlying
ground
water, and the aquifers that store it.&nbsp; ... </b></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>A third way to claim water is by &#8220;prior
appropriation.&#8221; </b> The key rules are &#8220;first in time,
first in right&#8221;; &#8220;due diligence&#8221;; &#8220;beneficial
use&#8221;; and &#8220;history of use.&#8221; The precondition for
putting water to &#8220;beneficial use&#8221; is owning land on which
to spread it.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Part of appropriating water is securing sites for dams and
reservoirs and rights of way, either from public domain or from
private owners by use of eminent domain. A major case is San
Francisco&#8217;s seizure of the site of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
inside Yosemite National Park. This scenic site on the Tuolumne
River once rivaled Yosemite Valley itself, on the neighboring Merced
River.<i> Rent has been $30,000 a year, fixed since the 1920s. The
Administration is now proposing $8 million a year. However this case
goes, the charge is for the site alone, not for the water or the
power drop. </i><b><i>San Francisco seized so much more than its own
needs that it sells 2/3 of what it takes to other cities, for a fat
profit that helps keep land values in San Francisco nearly the
highest in the U.S.A., and its housing the least
affordable.</i></b></small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A fourth way to claim water is
by getting
&#8220;sweetheart&#8221; contracts from large supply systems: Federal
water from the Bureau of Reclamation; State water from the State
Department of Water Resources; and mixed-source waters from the giant
MWDSC.</b> No sooner are these contracts inked than learned
counselors go to work to convert them into perpetual obligations of
the taxpayers and other ratepayers. The original 40-year contracts
that the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation executed on the 1950s at giveaway
prices came up for renegotiation in the 1990s, and only a few old
timers even remembered their origins. <b>Meantime the once-surplus
water had multiplied many times in value, and the contractors were
busy securing rights to resell water that they buy for some $10 per
acre-foot to coastal cities for $200-$500 per acre foot. </b> A
rather shocking decision by Senior Judge John Wiese, December 31,
2003, requires the Feds to compensate the Tulare Lake Basin Water
Storage District for withholding some of &#8220;their&#8221; water to
comply with the Endangered Species Act to save fish downstream. Said
District is a front for the J.G. Boswell Company, owner of 200,000
(sic) acres in the Basin.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What&#8217;s the moral? We can turn
&#8220;Negabucks into
Megabucks&#8221; for state and Federal treasuries by charging water
takers a market price for what they get, instead of subsidizing them
to get it, as now. The stakes are huge; the barriers are
surmountable. Besides raising revenues we would institute a regime
of &#8220;demand management,&#8221; promoting water conservation in the
most economical way. We would solve our factitious &#8220;water
crisis&#8221; and &#8220;revenue crisis&#8221; in one stroke. <a

&nbsp;<br>
</font>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Those who do define
Socialism, explicitly or implicitly, use the
word for different things. A major difference, treated here, is
between <b><i>Managerial Socialism</i></b> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">(who decides)</span>
and
<b><i>Distributive Socialism</i><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> (who gets)</span></b>. These may
overlap,
but are independent of each other and often conflict. For example,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Riverside, CA, owns its own electric
utility </span>(on whose Board I sit,
losing battles). This is Managerial Socialism, municipal style. Its
traditional rate structure includes large elements of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cross-subsidy,
mainly taking from the lower middles for the rich, tempered by crumbs
thrown to the very poor. </span>The same is true of our water system,
and of
most municipally owned and managed utilities around the nation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Water
and sewer service are common examples of Managerial Socialism (from
which the mnemonic "sewer socialism"). They have little in common
with Distributive Socialism.</span> ... </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Another form of Managerial Socialism is
direct administration of
public lands.</span> Our National Forests are an example. ...</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Distributive
Socialism, in contrast to Managerial, means tapping
surpluses in the private sector and using them for the public good.</span>
The revenues may </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>provide public services that are available to all,
like schooling and social security; or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>be used to abate regressive
taxes; or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>be used to finance social dividends paid in cash, as in
Alaska. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Revenues may also be used to finance public works, even
though these benefit only a few specific landowners. 
  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This becomes
Distributive Socialism when the enhanced land rents are tapped to
recoup more than the allocated expenditure. (If only expenditures are
recouped, it is more like a contract between the state and the
landowners.)&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, to define Distributive
Socialism we need to define
"<b><i>surpluses</i></b>." These are primarily rents from lands and
resources given by nature. In an open tax jurisdiction, labor and
capital are mobile and their supply is elastic; only land is fixed.
Land rent is the basic taxable surplus. Where there is no land rent,
an attempt to levy any tax can only abort production and land use,
rather than collect the tax. Where is there no land rent? 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First,
there is no rent generated on "marginal" land that is just barely
worth using at all. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, and more generally, there is no rent
generated by marginal increments of labor and capital applied on any
land, from the best to the worst. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Otherwise, all production on land
generates some rent, which is a taxable surplus. ...
  </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital,
  unlike land, migrates among taxing jurisdictions.</span> The
  return to reproducible, depreciable capital is not, therefore,
  generally a surplus. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capital differs
  from land.</span> Capital has to be
  attracted, and, if domestically generated, dissuaded from emigrating.
  It is true that in the short run existing capital, if affixed to
  land, cannot be exported. Its returns thereby become a temporary
  taxable surplus -- hence the name "quasi-rent." Capital can still be
  dissaved, however, through neglect of maintenance, and will not be
  replaced. The demonstration effect of disappointing old investors'
  earlier expectations will have a high cost in repelling future
  investing by them and others. Old buildings, unmaintained, will shed
  blight on their surroundings. Non-replacement, in a dynamic world,
  guarantees early obsolescence. Capital finds many subtle ways of
  emigrating, or being disinvested and consumed. Its yields are not
  really a taxable surplus when we factor in the consequences of trying
  to tax them: withering away of the community.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Distributive
Socialism, then, means tapping land and resource
rents for the public.</span> On the public domain, acknowledged to be
public
property, the institutional basis of Distributive Socialism is fully
in place. We need only apply a good leasing system, keeping rent
payments up to current values. On fee simple lands, Distributive
Socialism means and requires modifying tax systems to rifle in on
rents. <strong>...&nbsp; </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether on public domain or fee
simple lands, Distributive
Socialism has three compelling attractions. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One is, it requires no
Managerial Socialism; it may work through the free market.</span> It
does not preclude elements of Managerial Socialism, where these are
otherwise desirable; it simply does not require them. </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The second attraction is
that it lets taxes be progressive without impairing incentives.</span>
Taxes that rifle in on rents are progressive and distributively
socialistic because the ownership and control of rent-bearing lands is
highly concentrated in a few hands. </small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The third attraction is
that taxes on rent may be heavy without impairing incentives, precisely
because rent is a surplus. </span>The land-tax component of the
existing property tax is a good model. With this tax, there is no
"taxable event" required. Taxes are simply due periodically, based on
an external assessment of the land's market value, which in turn
derives from rent of its highest and best prospective use. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
political leaders live and orate in a world of dismal choices
and trade-offs. To them, there is no cutting the deficits, either
state or federal. We must cut taxes or lose jobs. We must make taxes
regressive or destroy useful incentives. On the other hand, once we
define, identify, and rifle in on rent as taxable surplus, those hard
choices vanish. We can have higher taxes and more jobs, both at once.
We can tax progressively while simultaneously enhancing incentives to
produce and save.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Likewise, on lands still in the
public domain, we can rifle in on
rent by framing and administering a good leasing policy. Leasing does
have some transaction costs, but the private market does it anyway.
There is a reasonable, if less than perfect, track record. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ground
leases are common in downtown real estate, nationwide, even under
imposing structures like the Empire State Building, and Rockefeller
Center.&nbsp;</span></small></li>
  <li><small>The Irvine Company, holding 20% of Orange County,
California,
has long declined to sell land, but only lets it for intermediate
terms. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Much of Hawaii is developed on the same terms. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Most oil and
gas is developed by lessees on private land, yielding large rents to
the lessors. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why cannot the U.S.
  Government as lessor do what private lessors
  do, extracting the surplus for the owner? </span>Here we meet the
  obstacle
  of Pseudo-Socialism, to which we turn.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small><b><i>Pseudo-Socialism is what happens when resources in the
  public domain are leased below a market rental, giving away part of
  the public interest. </i></b>That has the effect of installing the
  lessee as though he were the owner. The BLM, leasing grazing
  privileges on Federal lands in the west, has fallen into this pattern
  conspicuously and notoriously, subject to pressure from western
  Senators who have the power of many votes in the U.S. Senate relative
  to their state populations. The dollar values are small, but the
  object lesson is visible, depressing, and cautionary.&nbsp; ... <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
  <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
  <small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Who buys to hold these vast reserves for
  distant future use? They
  are of investment grade only for those with waiting power.</span>
  Unripe
  lands and resources are probably the most closely held assets there
  are. Poor people and small businessmen need busy capital right now.
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Only a few of the wealthiest people
  have the deep pockets and slack
  money to buy far ahead, to maintain high reserve/output ratios. These
  markets in far future values are their special preserve. ...&nbsp;</span></small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
impact of land taxes is analogous to that of credit sales. The
specter of future taxes is capitalized into lower current land
prices</span>. </span>They in turn let one buy cheaper up front, in
return for a
higher level of deferred payments. The net effect is like extending
permanent credit on equal terms to all potential buyers, something
private credit markets never do or could be expected to do. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, the property tax, especially
on land, is twice effective as
an instrument of Distributive Socialism. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, it rifles in on the rent surplus and socializes it.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, it democratizes the ownership and operating
control of land. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus it achieves something akin to
the "worker control" that is an
ideal avowed by many modern Socialists, melding egalitarian
distribution with egalitarian management and control. To be sure, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it
does so in a small-business framework, an ideal that is traditionally
Populist</span>, not Marxist. However, in this new post-Communist age,
when
Socialists are seeking new ways to express their yearnings for the
good society, they might want to reconsider the value of this
approach to worker control. Perhaps Marx, like other reformers of his
generation, was oversold on the economies and inevitable triumph of
large scale capital and organization, and the substitution of capital
for labor. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Perhaps small is
beautiful, after all. ...</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here are four corners of an
effective policy for socializing rent
from public lands: participate in revenues; control time of lease
sales for the seller's best advantage; participate in exploration;
and participate in marketing. Some detail follows. The writer has
elaborated the points elsewhere.&nbsp; ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>What must be inculcated in
everyone's thinking is the essential
difference between competition with front money, and competition
where payments are deferred. </b></small></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small><b>The first is limited competition, with
places reserved for an affluent few. <br>
      </b></small></li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The second is evenhanded,
democratic competition on a more level playing field, where
preferential access to credit confers no differential advantage.</b>
This is the condition under which Distributive Socialism can coexist
with, and reinforce, a free market economy. It is achieved on fee
simple lands by subjecting them to heavy land taxes, whereby
newcomers can buy in at low prices in return for paying more over
time. It is achieved on public lands by writing leases with high
lessor participation over time, and low bonuses required up front. <small

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"Make no small plans: they have no
magic to stir men's blood,"
quoth Daniel Burnham. As a successful architect and planner, he knew
how to stir his clients' blood. However, his ringing phrase is
negative and preemptive, hence overstated. Leo Tolstoy noted in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">War
and Peace</span> that wars are won and lost by the sum of individual
confrontations on chaotic battlefields, where generals lose control.
Folk wisdom says "The Devil is in the details." We do need small
plans, lots of them, to implement big visions. My hat is off to the
trench warriors who are advancing the two-rate property tax reform
plans in Pennsylvania and New York, one small city at a time.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let's rephrase Burnham in the
affirmative: "<b><i>Make big plans:
they have magic to stir people's blood</i></b>." Big Plans imply
Grand Visions. Henry George had few peers at stirring his hearers'
blood, and agreed.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"If you would move men, to what
shall you appeal? Not their
pockets, but their patriotism; not selfishness, but sympathy.
Self-interest is a mechanical force, but in loyalty to higher impulses
men will give even life."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Big Plans and Grand Visions
inspire small ones. They also help
orient and coordinate them. They help us divide the major from the
minor, to direct our work most efficiently. This is what I will
attempt here.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Big Plans can also scare people,
it is true. We see this right now
when drastic changes and new philosophies are moving in Congress.
That does not mean they won't prevail, however. They scare some
because they move many others. Abstract philosophies, living only in
intellectual undergrounds, build up slowly until suddenly they take
command. <b><i>This is how change occurs</i></b>.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Superficially it seems "sudden,"
but intellectually the way has
been paved by years of Grand Visions and Big Plans.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The upshot is, we need Big Plans
with Details Ready. I speak here
of Big Plans with magic to stir the blood of those who<b><i> see the
benefits of supporting government from land and resource
rents.</i></b> I'll sketch the big picture, where details fit in, and
how they all fit together. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTBaR.html"><span

<a href="../docs/Gaffney_RSaGC.html">Rent Seeking and Global Conflict</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>National governments originate
historically to acquire, hold and
police land. Other functions are assumed later, but sovereignty over
land is always the first business. Private parties hold land from the
sovereign: every chain of title goes back to a grantor who originally
seized the land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When economists today speak of
"rent-seeking" they usually are
thinking not of basic land rent, but in subtle and sophisticated
terms, looking at dribs and drabs of transfer rent derived from
contracting advantages. They develop abstract models for gaming
optimally with imperfect information, and so on. By emphasizing the
arcane while ignoring the basic they are in danger of matching the
proverbial expert who fine-tunes all the details and elaborations as
he forges on to the grand disaster. ... </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>We would be more useful to
statesmen if we looked first at
rent-seeking in the grosser sense of "land-grabbing", where the whole
bundle is at stake. </b>When William of Normandy conquered England
the prize was land rent, all of it. He and his retainers dispossessed
the local rent-collectors. It was simple, gross, and basic, and much
more consequential than the trivial rent-seeking we model today.
<b>The bulk of the natives may have been affected only marginally:
they just paid Lord B instead of Lord A. But it made all the
difference to Lords B and A, the ones who made basic decisions about
global conflict and cooperation.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Again, from the 17th century
Europeans invaded North America,
dispossessed the natives and each other, until today we meet here,
overlooking beach and ocean, paying our daily rent for a little slice
of land which has been won and kept by a long chain of wars.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The roof over our heads is
different, it is the product of
capital formation.</b> Someone saved from income, and paid workers to
construct the building. Its present value is that less the obvious
depreciation and obsolescence, so it is rentable today mainly for its
appreciated site, to which therefore an economist or an appraiser
must impute most of the market value here.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>But the site never was nor
could be the product of capital
formation.</b> It pre-existed man, who could only acquire it by
taking. It is fair to say that<span style="font-weight: bold;">
throughout most of history that is
what warfare was about, seizing and holding and policing land. </span>This
is not to deny ancillary causes and issues of war, such as disputing
the pathway to Heaven, ethnic pride, paranoia, acquisitive genes, and
a leader's need to divert people from domestic problems. Economists
should certainly make it their business to address the last, a major
source of global conflict. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economists conventionally bury
this point when they submit that
"national defense is a public good".</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">Defense</span>" is a
loaded word which rationalizes as it describes. "Military spending" is
more neutral, and will be used here. It is worth remembering that the
German Schutz (as in Schutz-Staffel) and Wehr (as in Wehrmacht) both
translate as "defense". Lebensraum is a more forthright term, and
explains much more about Nazi aggressions.</small></li>
  <li><small>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">Public good</span>" says
that all gain equally. But that is not true even of pure defense
proper. What is defended behind the defense wall is land previously
seized. The Lords and Barons have much at stake; the serfs and vagrants
very little. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is what is being
defended, along with, no doubt, traditional feelings of machismo and
some local folkways and mores.</span></small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Wages, as well as the return for
capital formation, ultimately
need little defense because they are economically functional. They
are paid for real service and sacrifices, and will command a return
in almost any viable system. Labor is also more migratory. "Fixed"
capital also migrates economically as capital recovery funds are
reinvested elsewhere. Land, in contrast, does not migrate among
nations. Nations are defined as areas of land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>But it is outside the defense
wall of the nation proper that
rent-seeking is most dynamic and destabilizing.</b> Military force
(often in tandem with finance) is used to project sovereignty into
foreign nations, and over no-man's-lands like the oceans, polar
regions, radio spectrum, and outer space.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Offshore rent-seekers are of two
general kinds. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>1. "Caciques."</b> Cacique is
a generic term for <b><i>local cooperating rulers</i></b> from the
native population. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><b>2. Rent-seekers of the second kind are U.S. or allied
multinational interests, mostly corporations. </b>The cacique is
expected to assign to them, or be complaisant in their taking
concessions and resources like minerals, transportation routes,
communications, bank charters, plantations, etc.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Natives normally control more
of the traditional resources like farmland. Foreigners specialize more
in less visible, more novel and sophisticated resources like 
</b></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>undiscovered minerals (exploration rights), 
    </b></small></li>
  <li><small><b>navigation rights, 
    </b></small></li>
  <li><small><b>radio spectrum, 
    </b></small></li>
  <li><small><b>overflights, 
    </b></small></li>
  <li><small><b>bank charters, etc. ...</b></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>More destabilizing yet is the
ambitious rent-seeker offshore, who
finds his biggest gains in the riskiest ways, ways that unfortunately
impose high risks on the U.S. The biggest gains to rent-seekers come
from buying in on the ground floor, cheap, when tenures are
precarious or uncertain.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then one invokes the U.S. armed
forces and the sanctions of
ancillary statecraft to raise the value of one's acquisition. The
three main concerns are 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>to firm up precarious tenures (as by
supporting the government that granted them); 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>to hold down taxes (as
by lending the U..S. armed forces); and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>to avoid pure competition (as
by giving preferential access to the U.S. market, or Pentagon
procurers).</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There have been spectacular
success stories. <b>Aramco</b> is one.
It originated in 1933 with a capital of $100,000. By 1970 it was
valued at well over $5 billion. Of course that increase might
represent accumulated capital flows from the US owners; but such was
not the fact.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are four sources of value of
foreign holdings: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>capital flows, </small></li>
  <li><small>plowbacks, </small></li>
  <li><small>appropriations, and </small></li>
  <li><small>appreciation. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In many cases like Aramco the last
two far outweigh the first. But
they are products of statecraft and force, not of capital inputs
proper.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tenure
granted by unstable governments is not worth much, and is
therefore cheap to acquire.</span> In 1960, for example, Patrice
Lumumba
pledged a substantial share of the Congo in return for a relatively
modest loan from a Wall Street financier.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course there
are also failures and losses, and someone might
even try to show that aggregate losses exceed aggregate gains. But
Adam Smith observed long ago that when an occupation offers a small
number of extremely high rewards, its attractiveness is enhanced out
of all proportion to their aggregate value. It is not just the
successes, but all the attempts that provoke global conflict. ...<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The views above have been
characterized by some as "Marxist",
because of the explicit recognition of special class interests. If
this be Marxism make the most of it; the point if any is ad hominem.
But the views here differ from Marx's. 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>For one, Marx was an
underconsumptionist who attributed imperialism to a search for
overseas markets, not rent-seeking. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>For another, Marx made no sharp
consistent distinction between land and capital.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The present views point toward

CONCLUSION</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is a common belief that
property tax relief is "good for
farmers." It certainly raises the private share of economic rent.
That in turn raises the investment grade of farmland and encourages
its purchase as a store of value, a place to park slack money. This
may be at odds, however, with using it as a vehicle for enterprise
and an outlet for workmanship. Lower farm property taxes are
associated with lower ratios of capital to land, and labor to land,
both over time and among states. They are also associated with bigger
mean farm size and less equal distribution of farm sizes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the sections that follow, I
first document the rise of
inequality in the distribution of farmland that followed a sharp drop
in farm property tax rates after 1930. Then I show, by
cross-sectional analysis, a positive relationship between higher
property tax rates and more intensive use of farmland, which in turn
is associated with more equal distribution of farmland. Conversely, I
find property tax relief associated with underuse and
underimprovement of land.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A priori</i>, a tax on
buildings works to suppress building and
to penalize smaller farmers, whose building to land ratio is higher
than that of bigger farmers. The findings seem to show, therefore, a
stronger countereffect, proincentive and pro-subdivision, of the
other part of the property tax, the part based on land value.<br>
... <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, however, 34 percent
of all irrigated land is in the top bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. </span><font size="-1"><small><b><i>(10) </i></b></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Control of irrigated
land means control over water. Control of water gives control over
arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. For farms with irrigated land, GR = .82,
</span><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><small><i>(11)</i></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> substantially higher than
the GR of .76 for all farms. ...</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To sum up,
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>rising acreages mean there are fewer farms overall.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising labor prices per farm mean aspiring farmers who
lack prior wealth can no longer buy in.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gini Ratios mean acreage is less equally shared
among a given number of farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gamma factors mean the higher quality land is
moving into bigger farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>The Gamma data are confirmed by rising shares of cropland
and irrigated land in vast farms.</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising P/C ratios reflect a higher LSREV, and they mean it
is harder for a newcomer to acquire any farm acres.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The combination means the
agricultural ladder has been pulled up.
Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside finance; exit
and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes accompanied and
followed a 40 percent drop in farm property tax rates.&nbsp; ...<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE LESSER
IMPROVEMENT OF BIGGER FARMS</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A result of rising concentration
is the separation of land from
capital. With some exaggeration, American latifundia are now lands
without buildings, but buildings cluster on smaller farms, many
without enough land. This implies at least three points.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, building wealth is more equally distributed than
land wealth.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, the property tax would be more progressive if
changed to a pure land tax, exempting buildings.</small></li>
  <li><small>Third, many latifundia are not being used to their
potential, while capital on some small farms is undercomplemented with
land. I support the case first using national data, and then by
comparing states.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is awkward that the 1987
Census of Agriculture defines "farm
size," and ranks farms, only by acres rather than value.&nbsp; ...<br>
<br>
<b>Concentration of
irrigated land</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The yield per acre of most crops
stays level or rises with
harvested acres per farm. At the same time, sales per dollar of real
estate fall somewhat. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(21)</i></b></small></font>
The
most likely reason is that the quality of harvested land rises with
quantity. There is, to be sure, a trade-off between quality and
quantity, but there is also a bond. Whoever can afford more can
afford better. Which effect is stronger? The question must be
resolved by data.&nbsp; ... <br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>Comparing different crops,
high values of GR go with crops
that are mostly irrigated.</i></b> For example, 85 percent of tomato
acres and 14 percent of silage corn are irrigated. For tomatoes, GR =
.91; for silage corn, GR = .52.

</i></b></small></font></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-2">(26) Those who find GR
index numbers too abstract will find more meaning in these raw data.
For tomatoes, the top acreage bracket contains 1.1 percent of the
farms, 45 percent of the harvested acres, and 52 percent of the
irrigated acres in tomatoes. For silage corn, the top bracket contains
1.0 percent of the farms, 11.3 percent of the harvested acres, and 26
percent of the irrigated acres in silage corn. ...</font><br>

the last to separate $L from
$B, overall. In 1940 the <b>building share of real estate value

lowest acreage bracket, .31 for all farms, and .12 for farms of 1,000

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>AELOS (1988) gives no comparable
comprehensive data, but it does
give two series that test the point and have the advantage of
disaggregation. One is for "owner-operators" and one for "landlords
with debt." For the owner-operators, ranked by acres per farm, BSREV
was .63 for farms under 10 acres; .29 for all farms; and .12 for
farms of 2,000 acres and over. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(37)

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>CONCLUSION</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One may at least firmly conclude
that large farm units are less
improved and less peopled than small and medium-sized farms. There
are two possible interpretations. One is that big farms are more
efficient, getting more from less, but that is refuted by their
getting less output per $L. The other is that Veblen was right, many
of them are oversized stores of value, held first to park slack money
and only secondly to produce food and fiber, and complement the
owner's workmanship.&nbsp;<font size="-1"><small><b><i></i></b></small></font>The
Florida 9 [the high LSREV states] may represent a home grown rural
"third world" of large,
underutilized landholdings that preempt the best land and force
median farmers onto small farms on low-grade land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The issue cannot be settled in a
few words, but the implications
for tax policy are the same either way. If large units are more
efficient, they can bear heavier taxes. If they are less efficient,
heavier PTRs will induce them to release surplus land for others,
which will tend at the margins to equalize factor proportions, moving
more states from the Florida toward the Wisconsin model. </small><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;1. The base is not
erodable (tax capitalization is not erosion)</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;2. There is no taxable
event, hence no Laffer Effect or Excess Burden (except as in #4, above,
where the slow-down is deliberate, for conservation and congestion
reasons).</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;3. The base is highly
concentrated, making the tax progressive in impact</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;4. The tax encourages
both saving and investing, leveling them upwards, the macro-economists
dream.</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;5. The tax base is the
after-tax value of land, making the real rate much lower than the
apparent rate</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;6. Using the tax to
obviate other taxes raises the tax base via the ATCOR Effect </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;7. The tax fosters
better allocation of the tax base, raising its taxable capacity.</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;8. The tax hits
absentee owners of land, without discouraging the inflow of capital.
There is a strong local multiplier effect from taxing absentee owners.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pundits since November have
noted an apparent anomaly: lower-income
states voted red, and higher-income states voted blue.&nbsp; Within
each state, lower-income counties voted red, and higher-income counties
voted blue.&nbsp; In California, the inland counties went red, while
coastal counties, plump with wealth and income, went blue. Depressed
upstate New York went red, while rich New York City went blue.</small><br>
<br>
<small>On purely economic grounds, &#8220;it&#8217;s a puzzlement.&#8221; <span

support the party of big corporations and the rich?</span>&nbsp; </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

morality, family values, horse-sense, freedom from liberal education,

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Before regressing into
sub-adolescent cultural wars, though, there may
be some economic causation here after all.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">We just need better
economic analysis.</span>&nbsp; Wendell Willkie wisely told us in 1940
that &#8220;A
good catchword can set back analysis by fifty years.&#8221; The catchword is
an economic one: INCOME.&nbsp; It may have slipped by you in my opening
sentence.&nbsp; Willkie was too optimistic, though: his fifty years
expired in 1990, with no discernable progress.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To understand the politics of
New York
City or San Francisco we need to
begin by noting that they have about the highest residential rents and
home prices in the U.S.A., along with the highest tenancy rates. It
takes a high monetary income even to be poor in such places, <span
 style="font-style: italic;">unless you
own land</span>.</span> Federal statisticians who publish the Consumer
Price Index
(CPI) delicately refrain from comparing different cities - they just
compare different times, city by city. This helps them finesse tough
questions about rents, and housing prices. Common observation, however,
and various semi-popular publications, fill the gap.&nbsp; The C.O.L.,
especially its rent and home value elements, is a lot higher in the big
glamorous cities, so real incomes there are a lot lower than they look
- unless you own land. ...</small><br>
<small>High land prices also raise the credit requirement for owning a
business.&nbsp; That screens out many who otherwise would have enough
capital to enter or remain in business.&nbsp; It forces business owners
to be tenants, and look at life and politics as renters, not owners. </small><br>
<br>
<small>It is not just average incomes per capita that define the
economic
position of most people in a state or city.&nbsp; The distribution of
income and wealth makes a lot of difference.&nbsp; But wait again: IRS
data, and other data derived from IRS sources, vastly misstate the
concentration of real income because they omit the imputed income of
owner-occupied housing.&nbsp; Thus, a salary-earner paying high rent in
the Gold Coast of Chicago has the same reported income as one on the
same salary on the same Gold Coast who owns his own million dollar
house or coop or condo, and pays no rent. More: the renter&#8217;s income is
actually reported as higher, because the owner gets to deduct the costs
of ownership, interest and property taxes.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It&#8217;s the renters who
turn Chicago blue -- along with most big cities.&nbsp; ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small>The difference between tenants and owners is stark and
obvious.&nbsp;
There are also differences among owners.&nbsp; In poorer cities, the
&#8220;skew&#8221; of home values is much less than in richer cities.&nbsp; &#8220;Skew&#8221;
means inequality, and is measured in many ways.&nbsp; An easy way is
the ratio of the mean home value to the median value: the higher the
ratio, the greater the skew.&nbsp; In southern California, as we move
from the red interior to the blue coast, the skew rises a lot, meaning
the top values rise faster than the other values.&nbsp; Thus, in the
blue counties the homeowners are less equal to each other. Here, too,
there is a greater gap between tenants and homeowners; and there are
more tenants.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The blue counties report higher incomes per person than the red
inland
counties.&nbsp; You might think this would compensate for their higher
home values, but you&#8217;d be wrong.&nbsp; Moving from red to blue, home
values rise faster than incomes.&nbsp; The National Association of
Realtors (NAR) and its state affiliates report &#8220;Affordability Indexes&#8221;
for different cities.&nbsp; These indexes show what fraction of the
residents can afford to buy the median-priced home.&nbsp; The higher
the median income, the lower the Affordability Index.
Counter-intuitive?&nbsp; Again, that is because home values rise faster
than incomes.&nbsp; The blue counties are those with lower
affordability indexes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The same pattern prevails nationwide. Median income ranges from
a low
of $36.3K in El Paso to a high of $91.5K in Washington, D.C., a ratio
of 2.5/1.&nbsp; Median home values range from a low of $87K in
Buffalo/Niagara Falls to a high of $531K in the San Francisco Bay area,
a ratio of 6.1/1.&nbsp; This is a general pattern: incomes vary a
little among places; home prices vary a lot.&nbsp; Blue states and blue
counties are generally those where land is out of reach of a high
fraction of the people.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What that means for social psychology and voting patterns I
leave to
you. One thing is clear: &#8220;income&#8221; is a catchword that has obscured
analysis for Willkie&#8217;s fifty years, and more.&nbsp; To solve the
red-blue voting puzzle, we must study land values.&nbsp; <a

<a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable Capacity of Land</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem. ...</small><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Most California land, on
the other hand, is now taxed at
well below the allowable max of 1%</b>. <b>Speculators may sit on it
at little tax cost, however many highways and water and sewer lines
run to and past it, however many policemen are guarding it from
trespass.</b> Little wonder that California enterprise, once so
dynamic, flexible, and vital, is giving way to stasis and decay. We
used to lead the nation in making jobs; now in losing them. We used
to lead in school quality; now in jail population. <br>
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When
you tax land,
the market moves each owner to join it with labor and capital as a
vehicle for enterprise or shelter.</span> </small><br>
<small> </small><br>
<small>"Hold on again," I have heard, "how much revenue can land
yield by itself?" It is my job to address that. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I assure you it
can
yield more than local governments need.</span> I have already pointed
out
you can raise the rate to any level without fear of driving away
jobs, capital, people, or building. That is a remarkable quality in a
tax, especially one as progressive as the land tax. I will also
support the point in several other ways.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The taxable capacity of land
is camouflaged in our times
by a consistent modern tendency to underassess it, relative to
buildings. There are several studies in point. The most general one
is the quinquennial Report of the U.S. Census of Governments. It
actually understates the tendency a lot, by omitting the class of
land most underassessed, that is, raw acreage in and near
cities.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have here data ... I worked
up in Milwaukee from 1969 data indicating that, if land were assessed
correctly, the land fraction of the real estate tax base would be
over twice what the City Assessor reported. His fraction was 31%; it
should have been 70%.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How does one come to so startling
a finding? Wisconsin is not a
backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
administration. <b>What I did was study sites on the eve of
demolition.</b> <span style="font-weight: bold;">When you buy an old
junker to tear down and replace
with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that
the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the
land. However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the
building was worth about three times as much as the land, just before
tear-down. </span>That is a good way to measure to what extent land is
underassessed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan. When
the visitor first gapes at its
skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you
poke around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the
exception. Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of
it tumbledown, commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Check the Empire State
Building. Old as it is, it is
still nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is
in a so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the
<a name="100% location"></a>100% location (57th Street, I would
guess). Even so, when the site and the building sold in separate
transactions a few years ago, the site represented 1/3 of the total
value. What does that say about the land fraction on neighboring
parcels, covered only with the remains of ordinary old structures?
What does that say about the land fraction nearer the 100% location?
...&nbsp;<b>
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"How about corporate
stock?", I hear. "Should we exempt
corporate wealth from the property tax?" Actually, almost all
jurisdictions already exempt stock and all other "intangible"
property. Not to worry, however, you tax corporate assets. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">When you
rank property owners by value of holdings, the top ten on most tax
rolls are all corporations. </span>None of their multi-national
profit-shifting through layered ownership of foreign subs, and
creative transfer pricing, can hide their taxable property on your
assessor's maps. This makes sense anyway. Why should you think you
can tax a corporation for its business in Malaysia? What concerns you
is its property in your town. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;"Hold on once more," I hear, "not so fast, <b>how about
the
mansions of rich people?</b>" Another fair question: how, indeed, can
you justify exempting them from taxation? The answer may astonish
you. Here are some data from British Columbia that speak to the
point. They are from the area around Vancouver (The "Lower Mainland")
and the southern part of Vancouver Island, around Victoria, where
over half the people in the province live. B.C. practices high
quality professional assessment; data from its rolls are quite
reliable, as such things go. ...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Cities and districts around
Vancouver and Victoria are
ranked, in Table 1,
according to the land value per property (single-family residences).
These range from nearly $700,000 each in the "University Endowment
Lands" district (very posh), to around $40,000 each in the "Victoria
Rural" district (more modest). The last column, LSREV (Land Share of
Real Estate Value), shows the land value (L) as a share of the total
value (B+L).<br>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These shares range from a high of
80% on the<b> University
Endowment Lands (UEL)</b> down to 38% in Colwood (the lowest), and
39% in Victoria Rural (next to lowest). In between, the numbers
follow the trend closely. The dearer the land parcels, the higher is
the "land fraction" (the fraction of total real estate value that is
land value). From such data, one might formulate a rule along the
lines that "the lot value increases with the square of the house
value." It is hard to be so precise, and not necessary. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The relevant
rule we need here is just that people's house values are more alike
than their lot values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
lot value, more than house value, that
divides the rich from the poor.</span></span>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;The average house (ex
land) in the posh UEL jurisdiction
is worth 2.8 times the average in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($173.1/$61.9). The average land parcel (ex building) in the UEL is
worth 17.5 times the average in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($692.5/$39.6).</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Now do us both a favor,
please. Pause and savor that
comparison. Let it linger, as though you were testing a slow sip of
wine from Fredonia's famous grapes. Roll it on your tongue, mull
sensually over its aroma and bouquet, and, getting back to business,
mull cerebrally over its full import<b>. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The house that shelters the
very rich family is worth 2.8 times the house of the modest family;
but the land under the house of the very rich is worth 17.5 times the
land of the modest.</span></b><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Seventeen
and one half times as much! Again,
it is lot value, more than building value, that divides the rich from
the poor. Seldom will you find an economic rule more strongly
supported by data. It's just a matter of presenting the data so as to
test and bring out the rule.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An American counterpart of
Vancouver's "University Endowment
Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
something like a million dollars. Beverly Hills, with its great
wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." Every year many a
grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;What do those data tell us?
The rich as a rule do not live
next to the poor. Rather, they cluster in neighborhoods with much
higher lot values. <b>The poor seek shelter first, and go where it is
affordable.</b> The rich put a high premium on location,
neighborhood, views, and grounds, resulting in higher land fractions
in their real estate. Mansions are visible evidences of wealth,
impressing viewers powerfully; land values are invisible. The
perceptual bias is to underrate the invisible, if you are not
regularly in the real estate market. In the numbers, however, land
and buildings are equally visible, and their message is clear. <b>It
is land value more than house value that divides the rich from the
poor. Ergo, a tax shift from buildings to land is a shift from the
poor to the rich, even though the houses of the rich are exempted. It
makes the property tax more progressive. ...<br>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Making the property tax more
progressive is not just
equitable, it raises its revenue capacity. That is because visible
damage to the poor and marginal puts a cap on any tax. You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip, and if you try you'll look like the
Sheriff of Nottingham. <b>A land tax won't drive the poor from their
humble huts, because it exempts the huts, and the sites have low tax
valuations. It may tax a few off valuable land, if their poor huts
are there and they own the land. However, if they own such land, are
they really poor?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;They may be "land-poor:" a
few folks always are. They have
non-cash assets, but are illiquid. "Illiquid" may be just a euphemism
for "holding out for more" -- there is always a market at a price.
Even so their plight, genuine or affected, traditionally evokes
sympathy and support. We must address it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;California, although
backward in many ways, has addressed it
effectively. In our <b>special improvement districts (SIDs)</b>,
State law allows the SID to contract with the landowner as follows.
<small><small><small><strong>You don't have to pay your annual
charge in cash. If
you choose not to, we take an equity in your property, charging a
modest rate of interest. Our equity accumulates over time. When you
die, we sell the property and take our share; your estate gets the
rest. Should our equity reach 100% during your lifetime, you stay
there for the duration, tax free.</strong></small></small></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Objectively, it looks like a
good deal for the taxpayer.
They can't come out behind, even if they die soon; if they live long,
they come out ahead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The instructive
result is that very few people
take this apparently advantageous option.</span> UCLA's Donald Shoup
has
published several works on the program. One way or another, they
manage to pay on time. Perhaps it attracts the attention of potential
heirs, in a compelling way, but somehow the cash comes forth. While
intending only to relieve distress, the program seems to have called
a great bluff. The lachrymose plea of the cash-poor widow is
unanswerable in debate, without appearing callous, doctrinaire, and
jackbooted. Meantime wealthy interests, thoroughly undistressed, hide
behind the widow's skirt and get their way. ...</small><small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those getting the cold shower,
meantime, may resist it. In
California, the land of extremes, we got Howard Jarvis and <b>Prop.
13. This Constitutional Amendment capped the property tax rate at 1%,
and virtually froze assessed values until land sold. </b>Then the
boom really went wild. I myself, after campaigning hard against
Jarvis, unexpectedly made $200,000 in a few months after it passed.
Buyers were chasing me around the block, just to buy a scrap of land
I happened to have in the right place at the right time. It was blind
luck, but the money was as good as though I had earned it honestly:
better, in fact, because 60% of the gain was not even reportable as
taxable income. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but buyers
and sellers came to regard it as normal, and only fair. They saw
regular annual increments as a divine right of property. For a few
mad years, they were.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>It was the lack of a tax
stabilizer that took the cap off
land prices. When my lot rose to $240,000, it was still assessed at
$10,000, and capped there by constitutional law! Taxes were 1% of
$10,000 - that's right, $100/year, 1/24 of 1% of the market value.
Was I in a strong bargaining position? You bet, and I loved it, just
as you might. Now we are paying the price, or beginning to, as our
public services collapse and our criminals outgun our police. This
year they are cutting faculty salaries (that's me) 5%, and raising
college tuition (that's my three children) 100%.</b> I'll pay all
right. All tax rates other than property are headed north; land
prices south. Our once-vibrant economy is dying; our unemployment
rate leads the nation. Our largest city was torched last year by the
frustrated unemployed. Our once-leading schools trail the nation; our
murder rate leads it. Those are the economic consequences of Howard
Jarvis. Like Tokyo and London and Faust, we signed with
Mephistopheles. He showed us a grand time, but now his bill is due.
To paraphrase Kipling, "Be warned of our lot, which I dread you may
not, and learn about Jarvis from me."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive
feature of land taxation is its
interesting positive effect on the economic base of a city. It
strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder than
resident owners.</b> The land fraction in real estate is generally
highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place for
absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. <b>About 2/3 of downtown
Los Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh
winters.&nbsp; ... <br>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>When you observe cities
much, the positive neighborhood
effects of replacing old buildings with new are irresistible and
contagious, raising land prices all around. The converse is also
true: the negative neighborhood effects of letting old junkers stand
without replacement are depressive. Thus, when you take the tax off
new buildings, and put it on the land under old tumbledowns, you kick
off a general process of revitalization that turns gloom into hope
into optimism: optimism that boosts land prices and the land tax
base.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There are three kinds of
slums.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Type I slums</b> develop on
land in the van of downtown expansion, on land held for a future higher
use. The speculators are milking the old structures for any residual
value. They don't much mind when the tenants leave, and spare them the
trouble of an eviction when they want to sell or rebuild. That's what
they're in it for: the current use is incidental.</small><br>
<small><b>Type III slums</b> (listed here out of numerical order)
develop on land that is no good, and may never be, like floodplains and
earthquake faults. They also develop around abbatoirs, dumps,
stockyards, etc., although these are subject to change. In either case,
people are driven there by the inadequate development of good land.</small><br>
<small><b>Type II slums</b>, our focus here, are the most extensive.
They occur on good or superior residential land originally developed
over fifty or a hundred years ago. It may once have housed the upper
crust, but as the buildings aged without replacement they "filtered
down," and down, and down, until their occupants began radiating
negative neighborhood effects. There comes a tipping point where the
neighborhood self- estructs cumulatively, because no one wants to build
new in a decayed, menacing neighborhood. The renewal value of land is
lost, the tax base is lost, nothing remains but social and public
costs: a municipal disaster area. The city that fails to renew itself
on time is steering itself to this fate, like Camden, the Bronx, East
St. Louis, Benton Harbor, MI, and Detroit.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;That's the bad news. How do
you turn it around? When you
drop buildings from the property tax base, you change the arithmetic
of incentives, as we have discussed. Parachuting into the middle of a
slum is still hopeless, as before. Change will come first to the
fringes of the Type II slum, where it merges into healthy
neighborhoods. New development likes to anchor onto healthy
neighborhoods. Richard Hurd, father of urban studies in America,
taught us in 1902 that land values are marked by continuity in space.
It's still so. Fashions and technology change, but principles last.
<b>Hope survives at the edge of the slum; land there retains some
renewal value. There is where you'll first see change, because there
is where the forces are evenly balanced. Tip the forces for renewal,
and there is where it begins.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Once it begins, it
proceeds incrementally through the
Type II slum. When it's through, your oldest neighborhood has become
your newest, the cutting edge of progress, the showplace of the town.
That is how it has got to work; that is how it will work when you
exempt buildings and tax only land. When it is through, you have a
high tax base where now you have nothing but fire and police
calls.</b></small></p>

Compatible with the Market
Economy.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The very people who gave us the term laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have
learned to measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.</span>&nbsp; ...&nbsp; &nbsp; <a

California's recall
election</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California homeowners are
wallowing in unearned increments beyond
the dreams of avarice, while its governments are courting bankruptcy. <a
 href="../docs/Buffett_Prop13.html">Warren Buffett</a> dared point this
out, and overnight changed from
the Oracle of Omaha into the Numbskull of Nebraska because he does
not understand the "reality of California politics," the oxymoron du
jour.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most candidates for Governor fled
like startled deer. Buffett's
sponsor, well-tailored Mr. Muscles, recalled meeting a tearful widow
who said she would have been taxed out of her home were it not for
Prop 13. Poor thing, her home had risen in value. No one asked her
name, or whether she knew what she was talking about, or had her
claims audited - being a tearful widow "on a fixed income" insulates
one from reality checks. The press chimed in with pix of poster
oldsters, gazing from their multi-million dollar perches over the
blue Pacific, fretting about Buffett's solecism and its possible
effect on them, never mind anyone else.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Fact is, unearned increments ARE
income, at the time they accrue. Illiquid? They are better than cash
income because you can turn them
into cash by borrowing on them, and pay no income tax on the cash. If
you have trouble with that, the tax man himself will arrange it
for you by placing a tax lien on your appreciated home, rather than
foreclose and evict you. This helps explain why we never actually
see one of these evicted widows suffering from unearned increments --
they are maudlin figments for mythmakers. The evictees we do see
are renters who couldn't pay, and had no equity to mortgage. Who
cries for them? ...</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Governor Gray Davis, supposedly
fighting to close a deficit,
chimed in endorsing Prop 13, citing the mythical widow again to

<small>4. INSTITUTIONS</small><br>
<small>Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends
to
stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.</small>

<a href="../docs/Gaffney_GRaCoM.html">Geoism, Recession and Control of
Monopolies</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As for the coming "boom," I
simply repeat my observation that there is
no U.S. economy; there are only regional economies competing with one
another as well as with other nations. We have the beginnings of
speculative booms in some places, stability in others, and continuing
recessions in others. People who cannot sell their houses because they
owe more on them than they are worth cannot take their services
elsewhere to seek employment. So much for the mobility of the labour
force. This is one of the unfortunate</small><small>sides of the American dream of home ownership; when a lease
expires, one simply does not renew.<br>
<br>
Only around 25-30% of households own their own homes. By good fortune,
I just read something that helps resolve the difficulty. It seems that
a great deal of anti-trust legislation from the Progressive Era had
been aimed at monopoly in the flicks, which had started with Thomas A.
Edison, who was as much a patent-litigation bully as he was a pure
inventor. Much of this legislation became unravelled under President -
guess who? - Ronald Reagan, spawn of the "entertainment" industry, and
political voice for same. Vertical integration and media mergers and
monopolization then ran wild. Disney under Eisner, of course, has
played a role in this. Disney as real estate developer throws its heavy
weight around brutally.<br>
<br>
This question arose in connection with Georgist taxation, and what it
would do about Mr. Eisner, and overpaid CEOs like him. The answer, I
think, is that "Georgism" involves more than taxation. It also involves
promoting competitive markets and smiting or breaking up mergers, monopolies,
and restraints of trade, by various means. It was, after all, part of first the
Populist, and later the Progressive
Movements. <br>
<br>
"Georgism" may be construed narrowly as a limited fiscal reform. Some
of its votaries present it that way. As such, it is rightly suspected
of being a bit cranky, and too limited. I see it as a broad front
program to limit centralized monopoly control of industry, and promote
free entry and free competition with proper regard for both consumers
and workers.</small>
