<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We face a far greater problem on
account of the way in which
America has allowed its landscape to be configured than most people
today realize. Over-reliance upon the car causes inefficiencies in
transportation patterns and thereby disenfranchises the poor, the
disabled, the young and the old from their right to mobility. One 1993
study concludes that "when the full range of costs of transportation
are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public
a total of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. This is equal to about
one-quarter of the annual GNP and is greater than our total national
annual expenditure on either education or health." Just the costs of
motor vehicle accidents nothing else represents a figure equal to 8
percent of the American Gross Domestic Product. Conventional American
land use configurations and the automobile dependent lifestyle that
goes with it sap our resources and what effort could be used for other
ventures and activities. Since so much of this activity is consumption
and not production, it weakens America's world economic position and
precludes reinvestment in more productive areas. Because of the way in
which we have encouraged development, people who need jobs are
frequently too poor to own the cars necessary to get to them.</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Because our society is characterized by suburban sprawl and is
therefore motor vehicle dependent, community is destroyed. George
Kennan expresses this well in the book cited earlier, but it is more
empirically documented in a recent article entitled "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Bowling Alone</span>", which David Broder
of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Washington Post</span>
considered the most important academic article of 1995. The author of
that piece, Harvard Professor Bob Putnam, shows that our communal
relationships are declining, and that an ever smaller proportion of the
population is involved in social activities of a cooperative and
communal nature. As Tocqueville noted, this used to be the unique
strength of American society; we're now losing it. Suburban sprawl and
the automobile play a large part in this. And the reason we have these
land-use configurations is in good part, to my way of thinking, due to
our property tax policies and our subsidies to motor vehicle
transportation.</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>It doesn't take much reflection to realize that the practices
which we
are following are unsustainable. This is true not only environmentally
but also economically and socially. Author James Howard Kunstler
recently has described in his book <span style="font-style: italic;">Home
from Nowhere</span> how our cities are becoming not only ugly but
unlivable. The irony is also that, by having followed the legacy of
classical economics, we could easily have provided for all our
government services through taxes based on land
value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><a href="../docs/Batt_HOTGTW.html">Read

"Three-Legged Stool" Metaphor</a><br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tax experts, especially at the
state level, ply their
trade by invoking one metaphor above all others: the three-legged
stool.&nbsp; It rests on the claim that a sound and successful tax
regime for any government needs to rely on a three tax bases: income,
property and sales.&nbsp; This is repeated so often that it passes
today without much examination. ... </small><br>
<small></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small></small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The power with
which the three-legged stool analogy has underpinned tax policy is in
fact rather disconcerting, because a close examination of its premises
shows that they are very questionable.&nbsp;</span> These benchmark
measures of a tax regime are scrutinized here in order to cast doubt on
the claims so often made on their behalf. <span

</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Three arguments for the
application of site value
taxation are
normally offered in contemporary political discussion. It addresses the
problems of </small><br>
<small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) the burdensome structure of
current
taxes, whether on homeowners or on business and industrial
organizations; <br>
2) the destruction and expense of current land development patterns,
typically known as sprawl; and <br>
3) the deterioration of infrastructure, particularly transportation and
school facilities, which policy makers widely acknowledge cannot be
allowed to proceed. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All of these concerns been
addressed by public policy measures
of
varying and imaginative quality over the course of the past half
century, but success is at best mixed. It is difficult, however, to
talk about the implementation of site value taxation without also
taking into account how such a policy would fit with application of
other instruments.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>When one looks at the value of land in any broad way, its value
will be
highest at the center and falls as one looks out to the frontier. The
highest value land, that with the greatest accrued rent, is at the very
center of the city -- usually where the commercial parcels are located.
In the spring of 1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed)
of less than an acre and split in two pieces in New York City's Times
Square was sold by Prudential Life to Disney for an estimated $240
million,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small>
more than the value of all the land and buildings together in the lands
north of the Mohawk River/Erie Canal in New York State. The highest
value land is
typically surrounded by a belt of residential areas, and with farmlands
starting at the fringe. The more valuable parcels are taxed, the more
their titleholders will find ways to recover their carrying costs. And
it cannot affect the behavior of tenants as any change in burden is not
passed through. In this sense,
land value taxation fosters clustered development and reverses the
egregious patterns of sprawl. ...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>And since we know that it is typically the wealthier element of
the
society that owns there is a certain fairness in this. Of those parcels
that currently pay taxes on their real property, about half are
homeowners, and the remainder are commercial, industrial, and
agricultural titleholders. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Agricultural
parcels </span>typically have very little market value because their
location is so remote; they would have little if any tax burden. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Commercial
parcels</span>, in contrast, are usually sited in very high value
locations, and therefore would pay the most. A shift of taxes away from
buildings and onto land alone typically relieves homeowners, and adds
to the burden of high value parcels (usually in commercial cores) that
are underused relative to their value -- fully depreciated structures,
parking lots, drive-in banks, gas stations, fast food services, and so
on. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><small

most widely known as
Professor
Kingsfield in the long-running TV series, The Paper Chase, later became

<small></small><br>
<small>That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts
of
others seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its
cogency in contemporary economic thought. More than a century ago John
Stuart Mill noted that</small><small></small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords
grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
title.</span><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1)
</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Today, on the other hand, the unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent attaches to monopoly titles -- largely the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span

surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement. ...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><small></small> ... capital investments affect the market value
of
locational sites by conveying rent to those in any way benefitting from
the service. That rent accruing to proximate sites and can easily
recaptured to pay off the debt service of project construction.
Typically rent collection is ignored, however, left instead in the
hands of titleholders whose sites are serviced by the infrastructure
investment. This drives speculation in land, with all the negative
effects it brings both economically and politically. In fact the rent
created by capital investment in transportation can be enormous. </small><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small></div>

Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This paper constitutes an effort
to compare, and if
possible to integrate, the emerging discipline of ecological economics
with Georgist economics. Ecological economics has the current
distinction of having established, to its credit, a collegial,
cross-disciplinary organization, a professional journal, and at least
one graduate program authorized to grant doctorates in this subject. It
has established itself sufficiently to have had annual international
conferences for a decade and a half, and seen its works cited in
several other scholarly disciplines. Georgist economics, while having
no established doctoral program so distinctively tailored, has among
its fold many economists of established pedigree, and many others
outside the academy who contribute significantly to its discourse.
There have been Henry George Schools in major cities around the world
for decades, a network of organizations, frequent conferences, and at
least thirty websites that exist to explicate and purvey the Georgist
outlook.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><small></small></span><small>The
starting point of the Georgist framework is
rigorous definition of
the three factors of production&#8212; land, labor, and capital, as in
classical economics. It should be further pointed out that these
factors are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all things of
economic value. Something must necessarily be in one category or
another; there is nothing <span style="font-style: italic;">outside </span>this
total classification. Understanding of what constitutes labor differs
little from definitions given elsewhere, regardless of which theory is
used. But definitions of land and capital differ somewhat from common
practice as well as sometimes in theory. Therefore, it is helpful to
spend time explicating the definitions of each as they are used in
Georgism, and to point out where these definitions diverge from those
most often employed in neoclassical economics applications. Many
contemporary economics texts begin by taking note of the
land-labor-capital distinction, but then make little use of it later.
These distinctions will make apparent why Georgist economics leads to
very different explanations of economic phenomena as well as to
different policy solutions.</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Critical to an understanding of Georgist economics is its
recognition
of land as a special and unique factor of production. &#8220;Land,&#8221; to
Georgists, as true for classical economists throughout the 19th
century, is taken to mean not just the surface of the earth and
locational space; it means also any and all those natural resources and
non-human works that today can exact a market price. It includes the
wealth of the earth in all its natural forms, the air and water as well
as material elements. It includes phenomena of value like the
electromagnetic spectrum used to transmit communications signals, and
landing time slots such as have value at airports. As the world
economies enter a new age of high technology, these radio spectrums and
time allotments have gained ever increasing value. So also with
geosychronous satellite
orbits and most recently the genetic codes of all the biota on earth.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10</span></small></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Sites have value relative to their location, and this is largely
a
function of where people choose to congregate. The highest value lands,
in urban areas and in developed nations, have market worth many times
that of sites even short distances away. Remote land sites sometimes
have no market value whatsoever, and they are typically not &#8220;owned&#8221; by
private individuals or corporations because they are not attractive for
economic use.</small>
...<br>
<br>
<small>... it becomes important, critically important, to understand
the
meaning of &#8220;ownership&#8221; and &#8220;property&#8221; in the Georgist lexicon. But it
is not difficult, for they continue to have their classical meanings,
just as for John Locke, Adam Smith, and all the major forerunners and
thinkers of classical economics until the advent of neoclassical
economics. What was the meaning of ownership and property in their
classical sense? Property was the product of human labor and capital,
and that alone. Items of property were household goods, personal
attire, armaments, and similar such goods. Property belonged in the
category of capital. Land was not part of property, but rather was its
own category. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Land, broadly
defined,
belonged to everyone and was the common heritage of all humanity.</span><small
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"> One could no
more &#8220;own&#8221; land than one
could own water, air, or other parts of nature, at least in the sense
of ownership that people often use today.</span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>Much like the
native-American concept of ownership, it was part of what was
classically called &#8220; the commons.&#8221;&nbsp;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small> &#8220;What
is this you call property?&#8221; Massasoit, a leader of the Wampanoag, asked
the Plymouth colonists whom he had befriended in the 1620s. &#8220;It cannot
be the earth, for the land is our mother, nourishing all her children,
beasts, birds, fish, and all men. The woods, the streams, everything on
it belongs to everybody and is for the use of all. How can one man say
it belongs to him?&#8221;&nbsp;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Indeed Georgists see a moral
equivalency between monopoly ownership of
land and nature and the ownership of slaves!</span></small>&nbsp;&nbsp;
... <br>
<br>
<small>Lastly, one must appreciate that the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of
every
sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
all found in nature, not the result of human creation. They are, in
19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. That
bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
collection and the exploitation of land without
recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
is central to its tenets. </small><small><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>During the height of debate
about American involvement in
Vietnam, the argument
was frequently made that, if we didn&#8217;t stop the communists in Southeast
Asia, they would be at the shores of California in five or ten years.
The challenge to America, it was proposed, was to stop the initiatives
far from where there would be any danger threatening to us, even at
great cost, and even if the immediate threat to us was inconsequential.
You will recall this as the &#8220;domino theory,&#8221;1 one of the prime
arguments for American involvement in Southeast Asia. </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>We often hear opposition to a policy proposal because it
approaches a
practice that
&#8220;down the line&#8221; we find abhorrent, even though there is nothing
particularly offensive about the proposal itself. The English language
is replete with metaphors about practices which, once started, will
evolve beyond the capacity of our own control. We speak, for example,
of chain reactions (here the reference obviously to nuclear energy), or
of things being inexorable or inevitable once begun. The metaphors are
usually mechanistic and from the physical world, even when discussing
political, economic, social or psychological dynamics.</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Consider some others which you will recognize immediately. We
must be
wary of &#8220;letting
the genie out of the bottle,&#8221; or allowing &#8220;the camel&#8217;s nose under the
tent,&#8221; or &#8220;opening Pandora&#8217;s box, &#8220;or &#8220;leading [anyone] down the garden
path.&#8221; So we must &#8220;nip things in the bud,&#8221; because otherwise we will
&#8220;open up the floodgates&#8221; and &#8220;if we give them an inch, they&#8217;ll take a
mile.&#8221; If you can think of others, let me know; I&#8217;m making a collection
of them. </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>These are known in philosophy as wedge arguments. We&#8217;re hearing
them
more and more, perhaps because public policy matters are framed
by politicians and pundits in sound bite format. Search &#8220;slippery
slope&#8221; on the web and you&#8217;ll come up with hundreds of hits. The
arguments seem, on their face, difficult to answer, even if we&#8217;re often
nonetheless vaguely uncomfortable with them. What I hope to do here is
to explore in an analytic way what in these arguments is sound and what
is fallacious or preposterous. Some recent textbooks in logic have
taken pages to analyze these patterns of thought &#8212; but how many of us
have taken a course in logic recently!
...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Some explanations reflect downright corruption. The earliest
cars
manufactured in
this country and in Europe were electric; streetcars also were largely
electric powered until a conspiracy of the automobile and petroleum
industry exerted its force to ensure that fossil fuel powered motor
vehicles would dominate our transportation and land use patterns.15 Our
motor-vehicledependent and urban sprawl configurations can be explained
by powerful interests continually pressing for policies to make us so.
One might even conclude that the decision to drive on the right side of
the road was equally as much a defining moment. </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>And I hope that you will forgive me for mentioning another great
conspiracy in American
history, the subject of my Torch presentation about four years ago.
That story recounted how the American railroad industry, in collusion
with the banks, induced the founders of the American economics
profession to change definitions and formulas so that they would be
relieved of taxation on their land holdings and speculation would be
rewarded.16 This dividing line between classical and neoclassical
economics is responsible I believe for many of our economic problems
today&#8212;economic cycles, an inequitable tax structure, poverty and
unemployment, urban sprawl and the gutting of urban centers. Only now
is this economic ideology, almost sacrosanct for a century, falling
apart and seen for what it is. <a href="../docs/Batt_FOTSS.html"><b>Read

The railroad barons of the 19th century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or as
benefactors to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885. The actual
intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got appointed and
promoted, who was funded in research, which were given endowed chairs,
who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation with defeating
Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount preoccupation of all of
these figures. The central figures were:</small></small></small></small></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><small><small><small><small>Francis
Walker, first president of the AEA, then President of MIT and Director
of the Census Bureau.</small></small></small></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><small><small><small>Richard Ely,
also founder of the AEA, and professor of economics at University of
Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his own Institute with
railroad money.</small></small></small></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><small><small><small>John Bates
Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia University, and whose patron
was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and then Smith College.</small></small></small></small></small></li>
  <li><small><small><small><small><small>E.R.A.
Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at Columbia University
and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></small></small></small></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small><small><small><small>These
figures are
even today the honored founders of an esteemed profession. So great was
their victory over rival schools of thought that they are a century
later seen as paragons of clear thinking and virtue. The intrigue and
the inside deals are long forgotten. The lineage to contemporary
scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken from Seelye to Clark to
Johnson to Knight to Stigler, <a href="../themes/Friedman.html">Friedman</a>, Harberger and now thousands of
Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed, when Henry George ran for mayor
of New York in 1897, it was against the wealthy patrician Seth Low,
President of Columbia University, who had recently recruited Clark to
come to Columbia. To really understand the academic tension of the
period, one must look at the published papers, the speeches and
debates, the newspaper articles, and the citations at the end of those
articles. These, even more than the interlocking directorates of
faculty appointments, explain how much George was opposed, perhaps more
feared. Was it for the falsity of his views? Clearly not, as few
critics then or since then have managed to strike a knock-out blow
against his theories. Rather, it was the threat George represented to
powerful interests that required him to be defeated, and in doing so
they succeeded but only in the short run, as they were within decades
victims of their very successes. Today we see that the railroads have
failed in this country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident
why.&nbsp;<small> <b><a href="../docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">Read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
is often argued that the
most
efficient solution to the challenge of providing water to all people is
to employ a paradigm that recognizes water as a good and service to be
priced by market mechanisms. But many conventional economic models fail
to see <span style="text-decoration: underline;">water as the natural
birthright of all people</span>.</span> To reconcile these positions,
one needs to step back to a framework of thinking arising from 19th
century classical economics. Renewed interest in these, especially by
environmentalists, offers a way of resolving distributive justice with
market efficiency. If you search on Google the words "economic
justice," it brings up first the work of the Banneker Center and
associated sites that rely on a social philosophy especially applicable
to questions about the ownership of nature and its services.</small> ...<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But only
recently, with the advent of data availability and increased computer
power, is it possible to demonstrate that Henry George was right: i.e.
that taxing what he called "land" - really meaning all natural capital
and resources rather than labor or human capital - constitutes the best
possible tax design we could have.</span></small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">If these natural resources are
a
"commons" worthy of being preserved as the birthright of all humanity,
their use can be rented at rates sufficient to cover the costs of not
only the provision of those services but for all public needs. </span>All
taxes are ultimately shifted through the economy to rest on what
classical economists call land rent in any 9case, and levying the taxes
directly on rent improves efficiency by eliminating "deadweight loss."
Moreover,<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
taxing or collecting what classical economists call economic rent bears
all the hallmarks of a perfect tax -- fairness, simplicity, stability,
administrability, neutrality, and efficiency.</span></small>
