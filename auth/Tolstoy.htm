<p>Kenneth C. Wenzer, <em><strong><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/store.php?crn=86&rn=345&action=show_detail">An Anthology of Henry George's Thought, Volume
    I of the Henry George Centennial Trilogy</a></strong></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/store.php?crn=86&rn=345&action=show_detail">, University of Rochester Press, 1997.</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>      from <em>An Introductory Essay on George's Philosophy</em>, p. 5</p>
  <p>One of the more concerned nobles was Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy. In his search
      for universal absolutes, purer spiritual values, and a solution to society's
      moral and economic problems, the famed novelist avidly read Confucius, Jean-Jacques
      Rousseau, Charles Dickens, John Ruskin, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman,
      Edward Bellamy (the author of <em>Looking Backward</em>), and the abolitionist William
      Lloyd Garrison to name but a few. But Henry George most fired his imagination,
      and he was instrumental in publishing George's works in Russian.<font size="-2">38</font> On February
      24, 1885, Tolstoy wrote to his collaborator, Victor G. Chertkov:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I was sick for a week but consumed by George's latest [<em>Social Problems</em>] and
            the first book <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, which produced a strong
            and joyous impression on me. . . . This book is wonderful, but it
            is beyond value, for it destroys
            all the cobwebs of Spencer-Mill political economy &#8212; it is like
            the pounding of water and acutely summons people to a moral consciousness
            of
            the cause and
            even defines the cause. There is weakness in it, as with anything
            created by man, but there is a genuine humanitarian thought and heart,
            not scientific
            trash. . . . I see in him a brother, one of those who according to
            the teachings
            of the Books of the Apostles [has more] love [for people] than for
            his own soul..<font size="-2">39</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Still mesmerized by <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, Tolstoy in a letter the
    next day advised Prince L. D. Urusov, an avid Tolstoyan, to read it. George
    is &quot;a
      marvelous writer &#8212; a writer, who will usher in an epoch.&quot;<font size="-2">40</font> Nine years
      later, on November 24, 1894, Tolstoy wrote to Ernest Crosby, an American disciple:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The more I know of him [George], the more I esteem him, and am astonished
            at the indifference of the civilized world to his work.</p>
    <p> If the new Tsar [Nicholas II] would ask me what I would advise him to do,
              I would say to him: use your autocratic power to abolish the land property
              in
              Russia and to introduce the single tax system; and then give up your
              power and [grant] the people a liberal constitution. </p>
    <p>      I write this to you, because I know that you are one of the coworkers
              of H. George, and that you. . . [believe in] his ideas.</p>
    <p>      I wish you success in your work.<font size="-2">41</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By 1908, two years before his death, Tolstoy had become obsessed with George's
      single tax, regarding it as vital for the moral and economic regeneration not
      only of his homeland, but of the world. This <em>idee fixe</em> is amply illustrated
      in the following correspondence.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I read through your letter and I find your thoughts about land to be correct.
            The land is God's. It should not and cannot belong to anyone. All people have
            an equal right to it and the only concern is how to distribute it. ... Many
            people like you truthfully say that the land cannot be anyone's property. Genuine
            property is determined only by labor and people must work in harmony on it.
            Many truly understand that to distribute the land among the people is important
            and wise. These matters were resolved in a very just form by the American scholar
            Henry George. . . . [Whoever uses the land] would pay. . . to society i.e.,
            to the government for community needs. . . . There will be no domestic taxes
            or foreign duties, i.e., there will not be requisitions or taking anything
            away from people's work, because all taxes will be replaced by this land payment.
            Henry George was wise concerning this. . . . The injustice of landownership
            is now becoming as obvious to people as what occurred fifty years ago when
            the evil of serfdom became blatant. It could not last long, and when the time
            came, it was abolished. The slavery of people and the stealing from their labor
            through landownership cannot long remain in the same manner.<font size="-2">42</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For over a century, a single tax movement in the United States and abroad
      has been devoted much in the same manner as Tolstoy to the alleviation of economic
      and social injustice. George's philosophy still inspires the hearts of a small
      but active body of men and women attracted to its simple reverence for nature,
      its exaltation of the individual, its lack of compromise with injustice, and
      its minimalist solution to social ills.</p>

                    today women faint and little children moan. . . . If the conclusion that we
                    reach run counter to our prejudices, let us not flinch; if they challenge institutions
                  that have long been deemed wise and natural, let us not turn back&quot;</font></p>

<p>Count Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910), cited at <a href="http://www.earthsharing.org.au/node/88">http://www.earthsharing.org.au/node/88</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>People do not argue with the teachings of George, they simply do not know
      it. ... He who becomes acquainted with it cannot but agree.</p>
  <p>Of all indispensable alterations of the forms of social life there is in
    the life of the world one which is most ripe. ... The method of solving the
    land
      problem has been elaborated by Henry George to a degree of perfection that
      under the existing state organisation and compulsory taxation, it is impossible
      to invent any better, more just, practical and peaceful solution.</p>
  <p>Quite difficult matters can be explained even to a slow-witted man, if only
      he has not already adopted a wrong opinion about them; but the simplest things
      cannot be made clear even to a very intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded
      that he already knows, and knows indubitably, the truth of the matter under
      consideration.</p>
  <p>The only thing now that would pacify the people now is the introduction of
      the Land Value Taxation system of Henry George. The land is common to all;
      all have the same right to it.</p>
  <p>Solving the land question means the solving of all social questions.... Possession
      of land by people who do not use it is immoral &#8212; just like the possession
      of slaves.</p>
  <p>The earth cannot be anyone's property.</p>
  <p>I sit on a man's back choking him and making him carry me and assure myself
      and others that I am sorry for him and wish to lighten his load by all possible
      means - except by getting off his back.</p>

<p>Leo Tolstoy, Letter to a German Reformer, quoted by James Dundas White in
    a pamphlet entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/white-james_land-value-policy.html">Land-Value
    Policy</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;It is Henry George's merit that he not only exploded all the sophism
        whereby religion and science justify landed property and pressed the
    question to the farthest proof, which forced all those who had not stopped
    their ears
        to acknowledge the unlawfulness of ownerships in land, but also that
    he was the first to indicate a possibility of solution for the question.
    He was
      the first to give a simple, straightforward answer to the usual excuses
    made by
        the enemies of all progress, who affirm that the demands of progress
    are illusions, impracticable, inapplicable. The method of Henry George destroys
      these excuses
        by so putting the question that by tomorrow committees might be appointed
        to examine and deliberate on his scheme and its transformation into law.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leo Tolstoy, A Great Iniquity, quoted by James
  Dundas White in a pamphlet entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/white-james_land-value-policy.html">Land-Value
  Policy</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &quot;Certain persons have driven a herd of cows, on whose milk they live,
      into an enclosure. The cows have eaten and trampled the forage, they have chewed
      each others' tails, and they low and moan, seeking to get out. But the very
      men who live on the milk of these cows have set around the enclosure plantations
      of mint, they have cultivated flowers, laid out a race-course, a park, and
      a lawn-tennis ground, and they do not let out the cows lest they should spoil
      these arrangements. &#8230;The cows get thin. Then the men think that the cows
      may cease to yield milk, and they invent various means for improving the condition
      of the cows. They build sheds over them, they gild their horns, they alter
      the hour of milking, they concern themselves with the treatment of old and
      invalid cows &#8230; but they will not do the one thing needful, is to remove
      the barrier and let the cows have access to-S pasture.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leo Tolstoy, To the Working People, quoted by James Dundas
  White in a pamphlet entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/white-james_land-value-policy.html">Land-Value
  Policy</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The only indubitable means of improving the position of the workers,
      which is at the same time in conformity with the will of God, consists in the
      liberation of the land from its usurpation by the landlords. &#8230;The most
      just and practicable scheme, in my opinion, is that of Henry George, known
      as the single-tax system.&quot; [Leo Tolstoy, To the Working People, xiii]</p>

  Dundas White in a pamphlet entitled &quot;<a href="http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/white-james_land-value-policy.html">Land-Value
  Policy</a>&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The injustice of the seizure of the land as property has long ago been
      recognised by thinking people, but only since the teaching of Henry George
      has it become clear by what means this injustice can be abolished.&quot; [Leo
