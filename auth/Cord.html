  <p>I&#8217;ve got a dilemma: while doing research for a book I&#8217;m writing
    entitled <a
 href="http://www.authorhouse.com/BookStore/ItemDetail.aspx?bookid=30025"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Golden Key to Continuous
    Prosperity</span></a>, I have come across 237 bona fide empirical studies &#8211; 237!
    - showing that the higher taxation of land values (LVT) always produces:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Economic growth</li>
    <li>Reduced taxes for most people (while govt. revenues remain constant).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are other benefits resulting from land value taxation. ... </p>

<span style=""></span>In bumper-sticker format: land tax good, all
other taxes bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or you might prefer &#8211; tax
locations, not things produced. <b><span style="">&nbsp;</span></b><i>This
book will show you how a simple change in the law can greatly increase <u>your</u>
net income. </i><b><span style="">&nbsp;</span></b>The proposal
advocated in this book can ensure prosperity for all and end
involuntary poverty and unemployment.
<br>
<br>
<span style=""></span>Let&#8217;s
be perfectly clear about &#8220;land tax good&#8221; &#8211; the revenue from it is nice
(sort of a bonus) but if it were thrown away or burned up in a huge
annual bonfire on the White House lawn (or wherever) the economy would
still greatly prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, better
uses can be found for the revenue, like reducing taxes on wages or
sales.
<br>
<br>
<span style=""></span>Let&#8217;s not tax what people produce, let&#8217;s tax land
instead.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<br>
<br>
Has this proposal already been tried?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><b>Yes,
many times, and <i><u>all</u> </i>empirical (factual) studies of
these applications show a much-improved economy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></b>See
chapter three.<b><span style="">&nbsp; </span></b>In fact, as we will
see, the long-run continuance of democracy depends on it. <br>
<br>
If jobs aren&#8217;t taxed, won&#8217;t there be more jobs?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
we don&#8217;t tax what people produce, won&#8217;t the prices of produced things
be lower?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Won&#8217;t involuntary poverty be
eliminated?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cannot this tax lay claim to
being the most important idea in the world&#8217;s history?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In comparison, isn&#8217;t every other attempt at social improvement
like rearranging the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic?<o:p></o:p></i>
<br>
<br>
It&#8217;s important that we reduce or replace taxes on jobs and produced
things with another source of governmental revenue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This book will show how that can be done.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><br>
<br>
But don&#8217;t believe any of these claims until you see their ethical
justification and factual substantiation; read on, then judge.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This book will be presenting ample logic and
evidence, but we can&#8217;t do everything at once.
<br>
<br>
This all sounds almost too good to be true &#8211; but remember,<i> it has
been tried on a small scale many times and has <u>always</u> succeeded.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Chapter
three will present some of the factual support in easy-to-read form and
you can get brief summaries of 215 more empirical studies (preferably
by email) and there are many more such studies!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do
you require any more factual proof?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><br>
The explanation starts with our treatment of land, of nature.<span

 align="center"><b><i><span style="font-size: 14pt;">How The Proposal
Works</span></i></b><i><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
Every
land parcel can be rented out annually, and it is this potential annual
rent, even if is not actually collected by landowners, that should be
taxed, replacing as many other taxes as possible.<span style=""> <br>
&nbsp;</span><br>
Important: do <i>not</i>
merge land rent into the sale price of the building on it &#8211; these
entities are entirely different and should be taxed differently.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Land-rent income is clearly <i>actual</i>
when the landrentowner and the improvement owner are different people,
but when they are the same, as it is for most homeowners, the annual
land-rent income is <i>imputed</i> - it exists even if it doesn&#8217;t
actually change hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The land&#8217;s sale
price is based on it.<span style="">&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</span>We
are currently taxing land rent by taxing the land&#8217;s sales price, but
eventually we should tax the annual land-rent income directly (and not
the value of the building on it).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
a land tax replaces other taxes, most people will save because they
have little taxable land income.<span style="">&nbsp; <br>
<br>
</span>Even vacant lots have an annual rent, which is why they can be
extremely valuable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
annual rent is based on the land&#8217;s highest-and-best potential use (as
permitted by zoning) and not at all on its current use.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
</span>This book does <i>not</i> advocate a higher tax on vacant land
than on built-upon land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s a terrible
idea.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather it advocates a higher
tax on <i>all</i> land rent, whether the land is built upon or vacant,
instead of on buildings or other human-produced goods and services.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br>
<br>
<b>This higher tax on land rent is hereafter referred to as LRT.</b><span
 style=""> </span>It can <i>gradually&nbsp; </i>replace such harmful
and regressive taxes as the local property tax on buildings or the
federal tax on payrolls.<span style="">&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<br>
Since one tax will replace other taxes, government revenue will not be
diminished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most
people will get tax reductions because they have little land rent
income, actual or imputed, but are hit hard by taxes on what they
produce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You will be one of the savers
unless a
significant portion of your income comes from land ownership (but even
then, you would benefit from a production-tax-free economy).
<br>
<br>
Lower taxes on things you produce while the government gets the revenue
it needs - can you support that?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This book
will even propose a way for <i>all</i> wage earners to get take-home
pay increases.
<br>
<br>
Consider
this: every American&#8217;s share of the national debt, as of 12/04, was
$24,510 (source: Heartland Institute), probably more now.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then add to that each American&#8217;s share of federal taxes, as well
as the taxes and deficits of localities and states: <i>the total
exceeds what the average American earns yearly!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>Then
multiply all this by four to see how the typical American family would
be affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>
<br>
<br>
The largest single expense of an average lifetime is taxes, especially
for those high up on the career ladder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many
Americans won&#8217;t have enough money for their entire retirement.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We won&#8217;t be able to pay for social-security
privatization unless we tax land values or rent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
are gradually becoming socialized as we increasingly tax labor &amp;
capital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation is worse in most
other countries - but this book will show how this burden can be lifted.<span
