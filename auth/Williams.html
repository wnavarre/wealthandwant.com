It Over Us</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Geoism holds that there&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with being rich &#8211;
indeed, an economic system exists whereby we could ALL be rich (in
wealth, education or leisure time). The justification for riches all
depends on whether a wealthy person has become so through creating
wealth (in the form of goods and services that people willingly buy in
a free and fair market) or through living off the wealth really created
by others. Earned wealth might arise through talented or arduous
inventing, writing, sports ability,
entertaining, entrepreneurialship or whatever. Such examples of fairly
earned wealth should not be subject to any (confiscatory) taxation,
which would be legalised robbery. There is, of course, a natural form
of public finance, in the form of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural
Resource Charges.</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>Geoism seeks to expose the many forms of unearned wealth, or
privilege,
that exist in our monstrous economic system. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Monopoly rights are the more obvious
examples of economic privilege, but less noticeable is the massive
wealth to be gained by using the Global Commons (especially land)
without reimbursing the rest of us. </span>Where such wealth is purely
misappropriated (as opposed to created), Geoism maintains that the
whole lot be given over to community coffers through natural resource
charges (such as land value taxation or eco-taxes).</small><br>
<br>
<small>Here we&#8217;re going to look at one of the most obvious examples of
unearned wealth &#8211; the massive riches accumulated by the great
landowners of Britain. Remember, it&#8217;s not the acreage of land that is
important, but the value of the land.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>But the rewards of land go far beyond status, evidenced by how,
over
the centuries, the land-owning elite has pulled the levers of power in
society, politics and the world of commerce. The Earl of Derby&#8217;s 1881
candid analysis of the benefits of owning land perhaps says it best, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>&#8220;One, political influence; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>two, social importance; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>three, power exercised over tenantry;</small></li>
  <li><small>four, residential enjoyment including what is called
sport; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>five, the money return &#8211; the rent.&#8221;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since then, the reform of the
House of Lords has dented the political
influence that was previously wielded by the landowning class (titles
and land were once synonymous). But who needs status? &#8211; let&#8217;s get crass
and just go for the cash. The great windfall profits which are dropped
into landowners&#8217; laps (which rightly belongs to the community) occurs
with rezoning and the growth in residential/industrial values. In the
UK between 1991 and 2001, the total return by this measure (including
capital growth and rental income) averaged a healthy 12.6% per year.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The gross injustice of handing over community-created values to
landowners is revealed by cold, hard figures. According to Yolande
Barnes, head of research at FPD Savills, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the average UK building plot &#8211;
at &pound;709,650 for a greenfield acre &#8211; is worth around 403 times the
equivalent agricultural land. </span>Nationwide, through this form of
rezoning, around &pound;5bn. windfall profit is handed over to UK
landowners each year. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Barnes explains further, &#8220;In many parts of the South and
Southeast, it
is certainly true that prices are paid for agricultural land that
wouldn&#8217;t be justified by its agricultural value.&#8221; ... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">farmers buy around
towns because they can&#8217;t lose. They&#8217;ll farm the land anyway, and if
permission is given to build, they&#8217;ve won the lottery. </span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A great way to run a casino,
but what sort of way to run an economy and
a society? </span>It makes you wonder how someone who realises the
scale of
these windfall profits can accept them so unquestioningly. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Britains' wealthiest man gets rich the easy way -- he has his
underlings collect and bank his rent. And if the rents from his vast
land holdings weren&#8217;t enough, soaring property prices have escalated
his net worth sky high &#8211; to be exact, UK&pound;11.5 billion. To give
him his full title, he is <span style="font-weight: bold;">His Grace,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gerald Grosvenor</span>, OBE,
Sixth Duke of Westminster</span>.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Forget the vast tracts of rural land, including a 100,000-acre
estate
in Scotland which contains no less than three mountains. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">300 acres
the duke owns in central London,</span> comprising Mayfair and
Belgravia, are
today one of the most valuable patches of ground on the planet.</span>&nbsp;
... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Is it any wonder that, given how there is little or no land
value
taxation, the duke has all his many eggs in the land investment basket?
But it&#8217;s not just for economic considerations that he could never
contemplate selling his vast acreage, for he has a philosophical reason
for not selling. (Have a bucket ready before reading the following!) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">&#8220;This is part of my
heritage, my birthright. It is not to do with anything materialistic,
but is deeply ingrained.&#8221;&nbsp; </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"

<a href="../docs/Williams_OE-T.html">Land Value Taxation:
The Overlooked But Vital Eco-Tax</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land value taxation (LVT)
has often been omitted from the lists of natural resources for which
eco-taxes are being advocated. LVT provides strong financial
encouragement for land to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate
speculation on land, as occupants must pay the full LVT whether the
land is being fully utilised or not. This leads to better land
management, a reduction in urban sprawl, less urban smothering of
agricultural land, and less farmland being pushed into hinterland.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actually increases
over
time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue base. <br>
<br>
</small><small>This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>You are about to experience a new way of thinking. It concerns a
single, simple economic reform that will improve almost every facet of
our lives.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It's an idea that's so simple, so timeless and so natural that
you will
probably be amazed that it is not already in place. At its very heart
lies the basic fact that none of us, rich or poor, corporation or
individual, indigenous or otherwise has the right to own land.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Land and the rest of the Global Commons belongs to all of us -
now and
in the future. Use the Global Commons as we may, but as surely as no
person ever created a mountain range or a river system, the idea that
we can own - in perpetuity - natural resources, however large or small,
is frankly outrageous. Furthermore, we believe that it is also the root
cause of a great deal of social, economic and political injustice. ...</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;This is not communism, anarchism, tribalism or any other
grand vision
which imposes all sorts of ideas about how we should behave or think -
in fact, personal liberty is its very core. Yes, there are many details
of this new economy and its way of caring for our natural environment,
but <span style="font-weight: bold;">everything flows logically and
consistently from a simple fact. That is, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">land and natural resources are
ours only to use and to be passed on to future generations</span>.
By an elegantly simple but profound change in our relationship with the
land itself, we believe we can improve not only the natural
environment, but the social and economic environment as well. </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>
</small><br>
<small>Much of what you'll discover will sound refreshingly new but, in
fact,
the details of this have been around for over a hundred years, and the
outline for thousands! Some of the greatest philosophers, social
reformers, philanthropists, scientists and economists in history have
heartily endorsed what you are about to read, from biblical prophets up
until modern giants such as Einstein. Supporters have come from all
cultures, from each side of politics and from every religious
persuasion.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">So why hasn't such a strong and
simple
idea been adopted around the world? The history of these proposals is
varied and fascinating, but the basic cause boils down to the greed of
a few with vested interests.</span> But now technology, a growing
social conscience and other opportunities mean that this idea has
reemerged for good, and now we shall lay before you some pretty
exciting possibilities.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But there's a catch. We have to warn you that, once you
understand what
we're talking about, the world will appear very different. And you'll
be hard pressed to see much justice in the way we presently do things.
This is an old idea whose time has finally come.</small>

We're going to continue to move in a spiral, rather than on a
narrow-focused reductionist path. That is, to keep you with a vision of
this big picture, we'll carry on moving around and around this great
body of Geonomics, observing a number of its many aspects. With the
wider perspective in view, we'll then start to grapple with the
details. This Intermediate Kit revisits some of the topics covered in
the Introductory Kit, but it also introduces some new subjects.<br>
<br>
In a sense, there'll always be new aspects to discover with Geonomics.
Economics is unfortunately a dirty word these days in many circles,
which is a tragedy because it's really an awesome and endless source of
insights. Some of the many fields related to economics which we'll
visit are:<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But - incredibly - who bothers
to study economics today besides
professionals? Yet is there anything more important to understand than
economics - the great attempt to find out what makes our world go
around - except the great Journey to understand our very selves?<br>
<br>
All the facets you gaze upon are not of equal size or luminosity, and
there's one area that clearly outshines all the rest. If this is the
only facet upon which you gaze and understand, then the energy you've
spent on Geonomics will have been amply rewarded. This facet is, in
many ways, the keystone of the arch of economics. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">We refer to the
mystery - some would say the madness - of unemployment.</span><br>
<br>
The existence of unemployment should strike one as being quite absurd. <br>
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>On the one hand there are millions of people - many
highly-skilled - wanting to work, some desperately so. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>And on the other hand there is work aplenty to do - to
care for
the elderly, to clean up the environment, to build better housing, to
improve our teacher-student ratio, to expand our infrastructure etc.
etc. <br>
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And yet, these two things can't
presently come together to satisfy each other.<br>
<br>
So we're spiraling around, looking at all sorts of interesting aspects,
but not haphazardly. For we're deliberately preparing ourselves to
reach the top of the spiral, to find the great economic key which will
impact on just about every other aspect. For if you solve unemployment
then you unlock one of the mighty doors to prosperity, and if you
abolish the great curse of poverty then you'll find that there are
powerful and positive impacts on all the other problems concerning the
environment, social problems, war, education and more.<br>
<br>
Sounds mad, doesn't it? That we should claim to have an answer to
something on which politicians can never deliver, over which think
tanks continue to scratch their heads, that highly-educated academics
cannot answer. Now just visualise all these important people striding
back and forth, heads down and deep in thought over the Riddle of
Unemployment. The wonderful irony is that they're looking at the
solution! In fact, they're standing on it - it's the Earth itself! The
Earth Belongs to Everyone! And, factoring into our economic theories
the distinguishing features between land and capital, the laws of
economics are turned the right way up and now stand out by themselves!</small><br>
