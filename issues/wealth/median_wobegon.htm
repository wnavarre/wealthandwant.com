<p align="center"><strong>Wealth: Median and Mean
</strong></p>
<p>If you're well familiar with the difference between these two terms, skip
  this section and <a href="#Okay">continue on</a>. There is useful data following this explanation.</p>
<p>News headlines frequently provide rosy news about total income, or total wealth,
  or productivity gains. Sometimes they will report that such-and-such a measure
  is up X% in total, or that the average  per capita something-or-other 
  is up Y%, or that the median of yet a third measure is up Z%. These are usually
  treated
  as unmitigated
  causes for widespread relief and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The truth, however, is often a bit more complex, and knowing what you're reading
  -- and noticing what is <strong><em>not</em></strong> being said -- is not
  all that difficult. Here's a primer to get you started.</p>
<p><strong>Total</strong> &#8212; When the total of a particular measure rises,
  that sounds as if it should be good for everyone, right? One might infer that
  this is good for all of us; that  we are all likely to be sharing in it equally,
  or at least that
  some
  of
  the
  benefit
  will &quot;trickle down&quot; to most of us. Maybe. But keep in mind that population
  continues to increase, and that the increase in whatever measure may not be
  enough to keep up with population growth, or may look a lot less impressive
  when population growth is factored in. (Population growth is usually sufficiently
  small year to year that we don't need to think about it, except when one starts
  looking at places like, say, Las Vegas, whose population has been rising rapidly.)</p>
<p><strong>Average,  &quot;mean,&quot; &quot;per capita&quot; or &quot;per household&quot; </strong>&#8212; This
  measure factors out population growth, so it tells you a bit more than you
  knew before. But it still doesn't tell you anything about how the gains are
  distributed. Do we all get equal amounts? Do 70% of us get some and 30% of
  us none? Do 50% of us gain nothing,  50% get something, and 90% of the gain
  go to 5% of us?</p>
<p>&quot;Average&quot; and &quot;typical&quot; are two different
  things, and even if you are from Lake Wobegon, where all the children are above
  average, the
  odds are strongly against any particular person making out as well as
  &quot;average,&quot; if the measure being discussed has to do with income or
  wealth. Depending on the measure,
  about 75% of us are &quot;below average,&quot; and sometimes the percentage
  is a lot higher than that! (see &quot;median as a percent of mean&quot;)</p>
<p>How could 75% of us be &quot;below average,&quot; you ask? And surely if that's
  true, you are  probably part of the 25% who are &quot;above average,&quot; aren't
  you? Or you will be, soon, when, as the old expression goes, your &quot;ship
  comes in.&quot;</p>
<p>Before I answer that first question, let me go to the third measure you need
  to know about, the <strong>Median</strong>. Median is a measure of the &quot;typical&quot;
  individual or household. More precisely, if one is looking at a population
  of 100 people, and lines them up by income, or wealth, or height, the income,
  wealth or height of #50 is the median: half have less, half have more. This
  gives you a sense of the middle that is not affected by what happens to the
  people
  who
  have very
  low
  or very
  high amounts of whatever is being measured. Adding three basketball players
  to the group doesn't change the <em>median</em> height much, though it may
  increase the <em>mean</em> a bit; replacing any three people in the 100 with three basketball
  players won't change it much either.  Adding Paul Bunyan to the group
  may also increase the mean, but
  doesn't
  affect the median height much. Similarly, adding Bill Gates to a group of people
  with more ordinary wealth or income may increase the mean a great deal, but
  doesn't change the median.</p>
<p>Okay<a name="Okay"></a>. Those who have skipped the explanation are back with us. Let's proceed. </p>
<p>Two  of the striking things one notices when one looks at the wealth distribution
  data are </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) how concentrated wealth is, and <br>
    (2) that, despite  the ownership
        of homes, stock and retirement assets becoming more <em>widespread</em>,
        overall wealth is becoming more concentrated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does this relate to totals, means and medians? Well, if we hear that,
  say, productivity has increased by x% over the same period year ago, is that
  good news for everyone listening, or is it only good news for some of us? To
  whom <em>should</em> productivity gains go? Should workers benefit from it?
  Should those who invest in manufacturing plants and equipment be the beneficiaries?
  Should those who invest in land be the beneficiaries? Should top management
  be the main beneficiaries? If those benefits are going <em>disproportionately</em> to
  one of those groups, is it just to collect some of that benefit by taxation
  of particular kinds of income? </p>
<p><strong>Median as a Percent of Mean</strong></p>
<p>When both the median and the mean are provided, you can get a sense of the
  distribution of the data. Many of the studies on this website provide both
  medians and means for income or wealth, or subsets of it, and some also provide
  trend data. Wealthandwant has added rows or columns to the appropriate tables
  so that you don't need to calculate the median as a percent of mean. The
  trend you'll see is that the median as a percent of the mean is generally dropping
  across
  time. When you delve into the data, you'll see that what is going on is a major
  increase in the wealth or income among those in the top 1%, and sometimes the
  next 4% and occasionally 5%. Seldom do you see even the second 10%'s share
  increasing.
