</p>
<p>This document is a guided tour of the Wealth Distribution tables on the Wealth
  and Want website. You'll get the most out of it if you open a <a href="90-9-1_Tables.html">second</a> and <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm">third</a>  window
  next to this one for the tables. [Right click on the links, and choose &quot;open
  in new window.&quot;] Resize them so you can see the tables and this tour side by
  side.  Each table is numbered, and within each
  table, the
  columns
  are
  numbered
  and
  each line has a number. If you want to print out the tables, you might experiment
  with your browser's ability to zoom and to resize the type. You might also
  want to print out the <a href="SCF_defs.html">SCF Definitions</a> for easy
  reference. Most of the discussion will start with the W-90 series of tables,
  which look at
  the
  Bottom
  90%, Next
  9% and Top 1% of the Networth distribution.</p>
<p>The main data source for these tables is <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Currents_Undercurrents_8904.htm">Currents
and Undercurrents: Changes in the Distribution of Wealth, 1989&#8211;2004</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is a Networth Distribution?</strong> Very simply, it is a picture of a group of
   households, which have been lined up according to their Net Worth,
  (that is, the difference between the sum of their assets and the total of their
  debts). Once they're lined up, one can look at various measures of the groups.
  First, one might look at the household in the exact center, and see what their
  Networth is. That is the <em><strong>median</strong></em>. One might look at
  the <em><strong>average</strong></em>, or <em><strong>mean</strong></em> Net
  Worth, which is generally a much higher figure, because it sums up all the
  Networth figures and divides by the total number of households.  </p>
<p>One might choose to look at various groups within that Networth distribution.
  This website is working with several different quantiles. The <a href="90-9-1_Tables.html">90-9-1
  tables</a>  group households into three groups: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the <em><strong>bottom 90%</strong></em> of
        us (that is, the 90% of households who have the <em>least</em> wealth per household),        </li>
  <li>the <em><strong>next 9%</strong></em> and </li>
  <li>the<em><strong> top 1%</strong></em>.            </li>
  </ul>
<p>The <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm">50-40-5-4-1
              tables</a> look
              at more detail. For some purposes, we can also look at 25-25-25-15-10
              data, which may provide some additional texture
              to our analysis. We'll look first at the <a href="90-9-1_Tables.html">90-9-1
              tables</a>. There are 9 tables in each set. [Hint: the most interesting
              material is in the last ones, but you may want to understand what
              leads up to them
              well, first!]</p>
<p><strong>Table 1<a name="T1"></a></strong>, <strong>Dollar Holdings and change,
      by Networth Quantile &#8212; 1989 and 2004, </strong>shows the total, or
      aggregate, dollar holdings of the various classifications of assets and
      debts in 1989 and
      2004. Line
      01 is NETWORTH, which is the difference
  between
  ASSET and DEBT. Total NETWORTH rose from $25,854 billion in 1989 to $50,251
  billion in 2004. (Just for reference, the number of households increased by
  20.5% during that period, from 93.0 million to 112.1 million.)</p>
<p>Of that increase, the Bottom 90% [hereafter <strong>B90</strong>] of us received
  $6,847 billion, the Next 9% [hereafter <strong>N9</strong>] received $8,551
  billion and the Top 1% [hereafter <strong>T1</strong>] received $8,999 billion. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Obviously,
      not all of us were in the same group in 2004 that we were in in 1989; some
      people who were alive in 1989 are dead now, and many who were in their
    parents' households in 1989 are in their own households now. Some have moved
    into
    a higher quantile, and some may have moved into a lower quantile. (Having
    said that, if everyone who was in the T1 and N9 quantiles in 1989
    either
      died or dropped into the B90, only 1 out of every 90 in the B90 quantile
    would have
      moved into the T1 in 2004, and 9 out of the 90 into the N9! And
    that doesn't take into account the possibility that immigrants might be in
    either of the upper quantiles.)</p>
  <p><font size="-1">The thresholds, in 2004 dollars, were, for the 90th percentile, NETWORTH
    of $827,600 and for the 99th percentile, $6,006,000. (For 1989, expressed in
    2004 dollars, the corresponding figures were $519,300 and $3,345,400.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also on Line 01, one might note that among the three quantiles, in 2004 the
  N9 had the most NETWORTH and the B90 had the least (columns
  6, 7 and
  8); in 1989, the T1 had less than the B90 (columns 2, 3 and 4).</p>
<p>When we move to ASSET (line 02), which is the sum of FIN (financial assets)
  and NFIN (nonfinancial assets), but doesn't take into account DEBT (liabilities),
  we
  see (column 10) that the B90 of us had more of an increase than the
  N9 or T1. We won't discuss shares here; that data is on a later
  table.</p>
<p>Line 03 is FIN, financial assets. It is the sum of liquid assets [LIQ], CDS,
  Savings Bonds [SAVBND], BOND, STOCKS, non-money market mutual funds [NMMF],
  retirement assets [RETQLIQ], cash value life insurance [CASHLI], other managed
  assets [OTHMA] and other financial assets [OTHFIN]. For 2004, the B90 quantile
  has about 10% less than the T1 group, and showed the least increase from 1989. </p>
<p>Skimming the financial assets section of Table 1, lines 03-13, one notes that
  the big numbers are in RETQLIQ (retirement assets, such as IRAs and 401(k)s),
  STOCKS and NMMF. Retirement assets showed the largest increase ($4.8 trillion
  &#8212; column 9, line 10). Interestingly, RETQLIQ is one of the categories
  where the B90 group has significantly more than the T1, though still less than
  N9.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">It is important to keep in mind here that RETQLIQ is gradually
      becoming the replacement for Pension wealth, which is not calculated
      in this study. As of 1992, among households
      whose head was under age 65, Pension Wealth in aggregate was equal to 48%
      of Aggregate Assets and 60% of Aggregate Networth, so that is a lot to
      replace!
      [Source: <a href="pension/pensions_ss_dist_wealth.htm">Pensions, Social
      Security and the Distribution of Wealth</a>, <a href="pension/pensions_ss_dist_wealth.htm#Table%204|%20Holdings%20and%20Distribut">Table
      4</a>.]
      Further, Pension Wealth was far more evenly distributed than even gross
      housing wealth in 1992. One might also want to consider Social Security
      Wealth, which, for most of us is more than the rest of our wealth! [source: </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other category of assets is the nonfinancial assets, NFIN, at line 14.
  In total, this category is nearly twice as large as FIN (column 5). The B90
  group has more than either the N9 or the T1, though quite a bit less than 50%
  of the total. The increase from 1989 to 2004 is distributed very differently
  from the FIN, too, with B90 reaping the most increase and N9 the least (columns
  10, 11 and 12).</p>
<p>A quick scan of the cells in the Nonfinancial Assets section (lines 14 to
  20) reveals that the single largest number is the B90's holdings of HOUSES,
  at $11.8 trillion.
  T1's holdings of BUS, business equity, at $6.1 trillion, is the second largest
  piece of non-financial wealth.</p>
<p>The final component of NETWORTH is DEBT. The single largest figure in this
  section is the B90 mortgage holdings, at $5.1 billion (line 22, column 6).
  This figure compares
to the gross HOUSES value of $11.8 billion for that quantile. INSTALL &#8212; installment
loans &#8212; is the second largest category.</p>
<p>Line 28 provides data on Equity, which is includes Stocks held directly as
  individual shares and as part of other categories, including NMMF and RETQLIQ.
(?) </p>
<p>The final line that comes directly from the Currents and Undercurrents study
  is INCOME. Income is more widely distributed than is NETWORTH or any of its
  components. </p>
<p>The remaining lines in Table 1 are aggregations of individual lines from the
  Currents and Undercurrents study. Each represents a sort of hypothesis about
  which Assets are &quot;consumption assets&quot; and which are &quot;power assets&quot; whose purpose
  is not consumption but savings toward retirement or wealth generation.</p>
<p>Lines 31 and 32 show the combinations of STOCKS and NMMF and then add to
  them RETQLIQ, with the thought that individuals might be most likely to have
  
  these kinds of holdings.</p>
<p>Lines 33 and 34 show the combinations of STOCKS and BUS (thus, shares of
  publicly held companies and equity in privately held companies) and then add
  in NMMF.</p>
<p>Lines 35 through 39 add in more asset classes: 35 adds NNRESRE, the value
  of nonresidential real estate holdings. 36 adds ORES, other residential real
  estate. 37 adds OTHMA, other managed assets. Line 38 adds BONDS. Line 39 adds
  RETQLIQ.</p>
<p>Line 40 combines the two most widely held &quot;consumption&quot; assets, VEHIC and
  HOUSES. Line 41 nets out of VEHIC and HOUSES the two kinds of debt held against
  them, MRTHEL and INSTALL. B90 has over half of this category!</p>
<p>Line 42 adds retirement assets to VEHIC and HOUSES, and Line 43 nets out
  debt as Line 41 does. The Bottom 90% of us have a bit over half of this category,
which represents about 40% of NETWORTH (column 5)</p>
<p>Line 44 provides Home Equity, the difference between HOUSES and MRTHEL. This
  represents about 25% of household NETWORTH in 2004.</p>
<p>Lines 45 and 46 look at the remainder of the NFIN and FIN categories that
  aren't represented in line 42. </p>
<p>Line 47 shows all Networth not included in line 40; Line 48 shows all Networth
  not included in line 42; the difference between the two figures is RETQLIQ,
  retirement assets.</p>
<p>Lines 49 through 55 were created to take advantage of some 2004 data provided
  in a later table [#18] in the original report; they will be explored in
  later tables.</p>
<p>Lines 56 and 57 are &quot;catchall&quot; categories for Assets other than those in
  lines 38 and 42, and for Debts other than those in lines 22 and 24.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Table 2<a name="T2"></a>: Corner Percentages</font></strong></p>
<p>This table provides a quick way to see the relative importance of the various
  classifications of wealth (columns 1 and 5). </p>
<p>Line 1 shows that the Bottom 90% of us own 30.50% of the NETWORTH in 2004,
  down from 32.79% in 1989. The share of the Next 9% of us has decreased from
  37.13% to 36.12%. The share of the Top 1% has increased from 30.08% to 33.38%.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">(A detour to the <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm#W502">corresponding
        50-40-5-4-1 table</a> shows
    us that within the N9 group, the share of the upper 4% has remained almost
    constant, and the share
      of the lower 5% has decreased by over 1% from 1989 to 2004. So if we
        looked at the Bottom 95% versus the top 5%, we'd see that, in 2004, the
        Bottom 95% of
        us
        have
        42.49% of the aggregate NETWORTH,
        down from
      45.84% in 1989. If we had access to more detailed information, we might
        find that the 96th and 97th percentiles had lost share.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Line 2, ASSET, needs to be looked at carefully; it is not quite what it might
  seem. Columns 1 and 5 show that DEBT as a percent of NETWORTH rose from 13.8%
  to 17.6% between 1989 and 2004. Comparing Lines 01 and 02 shows
that the largest effect of debt is in the B90 group. </p>
<p>Lin 03, FIN, has increased in importance from 35.1% to 42.0% of total NETWORTH,
  but virtually all of the increase has gone to the N9 and T1 quantiles. The
  N9 quantile has of the FIN category than either the B90 or T1 quantiles.</p>
<p>Several
    categories of financial assets have diminished in overall importance: LIQ,
  CDS, SAVBND, BOND, CASHLI and OTHFIN; most of the decrease has been in the
  B90 group.</p>
<p>Other categories have increased: STOCKS, NMMF, RETQLIQ. The largest increases
  show up in RETQLIQ, particularly in the N9 quantile, and NMMF and STOCKS in
  the T1 quantile.</p>
<p>Nonfinancial Assets (Line 14) have decreased in overall importance, except
  in the T1 quantile (columns 4 and 8).</p>
<p>HOUSES have increased from 35.8% to 38.0% of aggregate NETWORTH. The largest
  share of the increase has gone to the T1 quantile. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(Readers who have spent much
      time exploring the wealthandwant.com website might not be surprised
    at this: the homes of the wealthy tend to be on far more valuable than the
    land
    on
      which
      middle class people live, and those sites appreciate much faster. Check
    out <a href="../../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a> and <a href="../../themes/LSREV.html">LSREV</a> if you're
interested.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, NNRESRE has gone down in importance (line 18). One might hypothesize
  that this might be a function of the increase of REITs (Real Estate Investment
  Trusts) replacing ownership by individual families. Stock in these REITS might
be held as STOCK, or in NMMF, or RETQLIQ, or possibly be included in BUS.</p>
<p>As noted above, in the difference between ASSETS and NETWORTH, DEBT has increased
  in all quantiles. Mortgage debt on primary residences represents most of
  this, and has risen from 9.5% to 13.3% of NETWORTH.</p>
<p>Home equity [Line 44, HOUSES minus MRTHEL] has dropped from 26.3% to 24.8%
  of aggregate NETWORTH. B90's share has dropped, N9 has remained steady, and
  T1's share has increased by nearly 50%. This is quite different from the experience
  for HOUSES. (above)</p>
<p><strong>Table 3: Shares<a name="T3"></a></strong></p>
<p>Table 3 shows the shares each quantile held of each asset class in 1989 and
  2005. Line 01 of Table 3 matches Line 01 of Table 2. </p>
<p>Comparing lines 01 [NETWORTH] and 02 [ASSET], one notes that the higher debt
  levels in the B90 group reduce their 36.8% share of ASSETS to 30.5% of NETWORTH
  (line 21 shows that the B90 quantile carries 72.8% of the DEBT).</p>
<p>Columns 10, 11 and 12 show the percentage point changes in shares. For Networth,
  the T1 quantile gained 3.3 points, with 2.3 of that coming from the B90 and
  1.0 coming from the N9 quantile.</p>
<p>Scanning down column 8, one notices that BOND and STOCKS are the most concentrated
  FIN assets, and BUS the most concentrated NFIN asset. Scanning column 6, one
  notes that VEHIC and HOUSES are the only two asset categories where as much
  as 60% of the value is held by the B90 quantile. Continuing in column 6, one
  notes that 76% of mortgage debt is held by the B90, 86% of installment
  debt and 93% of installment debt.</p>
<p>EQUITY, line 28, is rather concentrated in the top 1%, with 36.8% of
  the value, but as one scans down the remaining rows, it is far less concentrated
  than many of the other combinations of assets.</p>
<p>INCOME, line 29, is far less concentrated than NETWORTH. The B90 Wealth Quantile
  received 63.8% of the income. The N9 received 22.6% and the T1 13.6%. </p>
<p>When STOCKS and NMMF are combined, the B90 quantile has only 14.5% of the
  value (line 31); adding RETQLIQ (line 32) brings that up to 28.0%.</p>
<p>By the time we get to Line 39, which incorporates most of the wealth-building
  assets, we find that 19.7% of value belongs to the B90 quantile, 37.2% to the
  N9 quantile, and 43.1% to the T1 quantile.</p>
<p>At Line 40, VEHIC+HOUSES, we find 63.2% of the value in the hands of the B90
  quantile. Line 41 nets out the debt against these two asset classes, leaving
  55.1% of the value in the B90 quantile. One might contrast these figures
  to Line 39.</p>
<p>Line 42 adds RETQLIQ to line 40, and line 44 does the same with line 41. These
  two lines might be best compared with Line 38 (wealth-building assets other
  than RETQLIQ).</p>
<p>Line 44 shows home equity, HOUSES minus MRTHEL. 54% of this value is in the
  hands of the B90 quantile, down from 60.7% in 1989. Most of the share gain
  has gone to the T1.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Table 4<a name="T4"></a>: Changes from 1989 to 2004</font></strong></p>
<p>Table 4 looks at what has happened between 1989 and 2004: the absolute change,
  the percentage change and the share of change for each quantile. A quick scan
  of columns 6, 7 and 8 shows that the T1 quantile showed the fastest gains,
  and the B90 generally the slowest. T1 got 37% of the NETWORTH gain, and B90
  only 28%. </p>
<p>The main exceptions to this were in RETQLIQ (line 10), where N9 picked up
  46% of the gain and B90 41% (columns 10 and 11).</p>
<p>HOUSES (line 16) showed the highest percentage gains for the T1 and the lowest
  for the B90 (columns 6, 7 and 8).</p>
<p>NNRESRE showed larger gains for the B90 quantile than for the N9, which were
  in turn larger than T1's (line 18). </p>
<p>Interestingly, holdings of EQUITY, line 28, gained at roughly the same rate
for all three quantiles.</p>
<p>Line 43, home and car equity plus retirement assets, showed faster gains in
  the upper quantiles.</p>
<p>Line 44, HOUSES minus MRTHEL increased 62% for the B90, 94% for the N9 and
  190% for the T1, again consistent with what readers of this site might expect.</p>
<p><strong>Table 5<a name="T5"></a>: Ownership Rates</strong></p>
<p>Table 5, Ownership Rates, begins to get at some of the underlying dynamics.
 It is the first of two tables on Ownership.</p>
<p>Table 5 reports the data as it shows up in the
    Currents and Undercurrents report. Some categories of assets have declined
    in ownership,
    most notably
    CDS, line
    05,
    (from 19.9%
    to 12.7%, with much of the loss falling in the B90 quantile; SAVBND, BONDS
    and CASHLI. </p>
<p>Financial Assets showing increases in ownership rates include STOCKS (from
  16.9% to 20.7%); NMMF (from 7.3% to 15.0%); RETQLIQ (from 37.0% to 49.7%).</p>
<p>Nonfinancial Assets showed some increases in ownership: VEHIC increased in
  the highest and lowest quantiles; HOUSES increased in all three quantiles --
  and most in the top quantile. Ownership of ORESRE and NNRESRE fell somewhat. </p>
<p>Ownership of BUS equity fell slightly in the upper quantiles and rose somewhat
  in the B90 quantile. </p>
<p>DEBT ownership increased in all quantiles, but fastest in the B90. Mortgage
  debt (MRTHEL, line 22) increased from 39.5% to 47.9%; homeownership increased
  from 63.9% to 69.1%, so the percentage of households owning their homes free
  and
  clear
  declined  from 24.4% to 21.2%. (Given the aging of the Baby Boom generation,
  this is striking.) </p>
<p>The use of INSTALL (line 24) fell somewhat in total and in the lower two quantiles,
  but rose somewhat in the top quantile.</p>
<p>The percentage of households carrying CCBAL rose from 39.7% to 46.2%, and
  in the B90 from 41.9% to 48.8%.</p>
<p>The percentage of households with EQUITY (line 28) rose from 31.8% to 48.6%.</p>
<p>A footnote to Currents and Undercurrents provides another snippet of information
  reported in Table 5: that the net ownership of NNRESRE and BUS in 2004 is 17.5%.
  This compares to 11.5% ownership of BUS and 8.3% ownership of NNRESRE, and
  suggests that  2.3% own <em>both</em> BUS and NNRESRE. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Table 6<a name="T6"></a>: Additive Ownership Rates</font></strong></p>
<p>Table 6 is calculated from Table 5. Each cell in Table 5 is multiplied by
  the size of its quantile -- 100%, 90%, 9% or 1%. The result is ownership rates
that <strong><em>add up to</em></strong> the total ownership rate. These are
useful for seeing where the increases and decreases in ownership rates occurred.
In general, the increases in ownership have come mostly from the B90; not surprising,
since there is little room to increase in quantiles where ownership is already
high and where even a large increase within the quantile only represents a small
increase at the total level.</p>
<p>For example, in RETQLIQ
    (line 10), where ownership increased from 37.0% to 49.7%, we see that most
    of that increase came from increases in the B90 quantile (from 30.0% to 41.4%).</p>
<p>Similarly, ownership of HOUSES (line 16) increased from 63.9% to 69.1%, and
in the B90 quantile, ownership increased from 54.6% to 59.4%, for the B90.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Table 7<a name="T7"></a>: Holdings Per 1% holding</font></strong></p>
<p>Table 7 looks at the other half of the ownership equation: how much each &quot;1%
  of households who own&quot; owns, on average. </p>
<p>One caution goes with this data: keep
    in mind that from 1989, the number of households increased by 20.5%, so each
    1% of 2004's households is a larger group than 1% of 1989's households. But
  within each year, comparisons up and down the columns and across quantiles
  are valid. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1">This table was calculated by dividing the dollar data in
      Table 1 by the (additive) ownership rate from Table 6. (If you are familiar
      with reach/frequency
    calculations from the media-buying world, this corresponds to frequency.)</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1">(Note
      that the column does not and should not add to the total assets figure.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Line 2, ASSET, shows this well. On average, in 2004, each 1% of the those
  with assets (97.9%, per Table 5, line 2) have $604 billion in assets. </p>
<p>In the
  B90 quantile, average holdings per 1% who have assets (97.7% of the quantile)
    are much lower than the national average, at $248 billion. In the N9 quantile,
    average holdings are $2,212b, or about 9 times the B90. In the T1 quantile,
  average holdings are $17,425b, or 70 times the average holdings in the B90.</p>
<p>Looking at a few individual lines can be instructive. Retirement assets [RETQLIQ]
  are a good example. Average holdings per 1% who hold are $136b. The average
  1% holding in the B90 quantile is about half that, at $68b. The T1 quantile's
  average holdings-per-1%-holding are 1,109, or 16 times the B90 group. The
N9 quantile's holders average  6 times the B90 group.</p>
<p>HOUSES (line 16) holdings are interesting, too. The average holdings in the
  N9 quantile are about triple the holdings in the B90, and in the T1 are about
  10 times
those in the B90.</p>
<p>Average holdings of BUS equity (line 19) in the T1 quantile are more than
  10 times those of the average holdings in the N9 quantile, and 67 times what
  the average holder of BUS in the B90 quantile owns.</p>
<p>HOUSES minus MRTHEL shows that the average holdings of home equity among those
  in the T1 quantile are 14 times those of average holdings in the B90 quantile.
(Check out the corresponding table in the 50-40-5-4-1 group for more detail.</p>
<p>This data helps answer the question that many people ask: is increasing homeownership
  the answer to helping poor people be less poor? After all, those who own homes
  have a lot more wealth than those who don't. The gross answer might take the
  form of multiplying a, say, 10 point increase in the B90 quantile's ownership
  rate
  by the $113b home equity per ownership point. A finer look would be to look
  at the average home equity holdings of the B50 group, from the 50-40-5-4-1
  tables, which show that B50 (where 21.7 out of 50.0 own HOUSES) holds $33b
  per homeownership point, and the N40 (where 37.7 out of 40.0 own HOUSES), hold
  $159b per ownership point. So the increase would have to come in the B50 group,
  where average home equity per 1% ownership point for 2004 was $33b, well below
  the national average of $180b.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Table 8<a name="T8"></a>: Change in holdings per 1% holding</font></strong></p>
<p>Table 8 is drawn from Table 7, and shows the change from 1989 to 2004 in holdings
  per 1% who hold (columns 1 through 4), and the percentage change (columns 5
  through 8). As mentioned earlier, anything less than a 20.5% change represents
  a decrease in average
  holdings
  per household.</p>
<p>Line 44 shows that average holdings of home equity [HOUSES minus MRTHEL] rose
  the most among the T1 and the least among holders in the B90. </p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Table 9<a name="T9"></a>: Changes in ownership and holdings per 1% holding</font></strong></p>
<p>Table 9 collects four columns from Table 5 and four columns from Table 9,
  to facilitate comparisons of the direction and size of changes of the incidence
  of ownership (Columns 1-4) and the amount each 1% who holds possesses.</p>
<p>It becomes pretty clear that most of the gains are coming in the holdings-per-holder,
  not in the percent of each quantile who holds. Despite the huge run-up in housing
  values we keep hearing about, the holdings-per-1% holding have risen most for
  the T1 and N9 quantiles, and at a slower rate for the B90 quantile, and ownership
  rose faster in the top group than in the bottom! Business equity has risen
  fastest in the top quantile. RETQLIQ, which will gradually become the replacement
  for Defined Benefit pensions, has risen fastest in the N9 group, and spread
  only slightly faster in the B90 group.</p>
<p>Use of DEBT has become more widespread in all groups, by faster in the B90
  quantile. Home equity (line 44), which represents the largest share of the
  B90's networth, has risen fastest for the T1 group, both in incidence and in
  holdings per holder.</p>
<p>So far, we've lumped together a very large share of our society: the Bottom
  90% contains households whose situations are very different from each other,
  and we've generally been looking at averages within that large group. The <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm">50-40-5-4-1
  tables</a> break that 90% down into two component pieces, the Bottom 50% and
  the Next 40%. The &quot;N9&quot; quantile is also divided into two parts, 5% and 4%,
  which also look quite different from each other.</p>
<p>Finally, when one starts to look at fractiles (subsets of the top 1%), one
  finds that the top and bottom half of that top 1% look quite different from
  each other as well. While the data is older (1992 SCF), you might take a look
  at <a href="pension/pensions_ss_dist_wealth.htm#Table%204|%20Holdings%20and%20Distribut">Tables
  4</a> <a href="pension/pensions_ss_dist_wealth.htm#Table%205|%20Holdings%20and%20Distribut">and
  5</a> from <a href="pension/pensions_ss_dist_wealth.htm">Pensions, Social Security
  and the Distribution of Wealth </a>(1997).</p>
<p>Also on this site, you'll find more quantile detail on ownership from the
  2004 SCF in <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm">Recent
  Changes in U.S. Family Finances: Evidence from the 2001 and 2004 Survey of
  Consumer Finances</a></span> (2006), where the quantiles include the bottom
  quartile (less than 25th percentile), the second quartile (25th to 49.9);
  the third quartile (50-74.9), the next 15% (75 to 89.9) and the top decile.</p>
