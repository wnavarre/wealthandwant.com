    <p> <a name="A"></a><strong>Is increasing homeownership the answer to the wealth problem? </strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Not to the extent that its boosters might suggest. Yes, the data generally
          show that on average, people who own their homes have far more wealth
          than those who do not, both in home equity and in other kinds of wealth.
        (See <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm">Recent
        Changes in U.S. Family Finances: Evidence from the 2001 and 2004 Survey
        of Consumer Finances</a></span>, particularly
        <a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm#Table3">Table 3</a>  , <a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm#5B2004">Table
        5</a>, <a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm#Table6">Table 6 (stock ownership)</a>,
        and <a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm#Table8">Table
        8</a>.)        </p>
      <p>However,
          viewed in detail, the data also show that the average net housing equity
          of holders in the bottom half of
          the wealth
          distribution
          are
          extremely
            low, and that increasing homeownership from, say, 69% to 70% by increasing
            homeownership among people in that quantile would itself provide
        very few benefits to them. See <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm">Wealth Tables 50-40-5-4-1</a>,
      especially <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm#W505">tables 5</a> and <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm#W507">7,</a> line
      44, column 8 and the comments in the <a href="tour.htm">guided tour</a>.</p>
      <p>If in order to become homeowners, people must take on huge amounts of
        debt, particularly adjustable-rate mortgages, promoting homeownership
        alone is not the answer but a diversion and an disservice to those we
        seek to help: our working poor and our young people. You'll need to read
        further to see why promoting homeownership is a bandaid, not a remedy.</p>

    <p><a name="D"></a><strong>Should we eliminate the Estate Tax? How widespread would the benefits
          of that be?</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Estate Tax is in the process of being phased out. Currently, only
        estates over $2 million that aren't left to a spouse are taxed at all.
        For 2006, this is estimated to be 0.27% of estates, or <em><strong>1
        out of every 370 deaths</strong></em>. The exempt amount will continue
        to rise through 2010 (to $3.5 million). But in 2011, the EGTRA law of
        2001
        will &quot;sunset,&quot; and return
        the exemption to $1 million. </p>
      <p>The question is, what <em>should</em> the
          exemption level be? The wealthiest among us are campaigning to get
        rid of the tax completely, and they have spent, as the title of a recent
          study puts it, &quot;millions to save billions&quot; (see below)
          to convince the public, and our elected representatives, that family
          farms and small businesses will have to be divested
          to pay the estate tax. Are they right? You can see a lot of the data
          on this website, and make your own judgments.</p>
      <p>The <a href="90-9-1_Tables.html">Wealth 90-9-1</a>          tables,
        and the guided tour, show how concentrated wealth is in the top 1% of
        our society. </p>
      <p>You may also want to look at the <a href="fractiles.htm">wealth
          fractile</a> data, which provides some support for the idea that the
          appropriate horizon is somewhere in the Top 1%.</p>
      <p>If you think it worth considering whether we should expand the estate
        tax to a somewhat wider segment of our society, you might look at the
        &quot;Next 4%&quot; group in the <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm">Wealth 50-40-5-4-1</a> tables.
        A case could be made that some share or  kinds of the &quot;Next
        4%&quot; wealth should be taxed at some point. (More about that elsewhere
        on the site!)</p>
      <p>If you are interested in the lobbying that has been going on to abolish
        the estate tax, read <a href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/EstateTaxFinal.pdf">Spending
        Millions to Save Billions: 
        The Campaign of the Super Wealthy to Kill the Estate Tax</a>, (April,
        2006), and Chapter 6 of David Cay Johnston's book <em>Perfectly Legal:
        The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit The Super Rich --
        and
        Cheat Everybody Else</em>. </p>
      <p>Does the estate tax represent double taxation? No. Quite the contrary.
        It represents the only opportunity to collect for the commons a share
        of several kinds of gains which are quite concentrated in the wealthiest
        portion of our population: stocks, privately held companies and <a href="../../themes/Wealth_from_Land_Appreciation.html">land
        value</a>. Upon one's death, the taxable basis for one's assets is &quot;stepped
        up&quot;
        to its
        value
        at the
        time
        of one's
        death;
        all the
        accrued
        appreciation on one's land or one's business holdings is free of tax &#8212;        except
        for the folks who fall into that top 0.27%. </p>
      <p>For more data on the size of unrealized capital gains, see <a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm#Table9">Table
        9</a> of <a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm">Recent
        Changes in U.S. Family Finances: Evidence from the 2001 and 2004 Survey
        of Consumer Finances</a>; mean holdings of unrealized capital gains in
        2004 were over $900,000 in the top decile.</span></p>
      <p>Why should they be treated
          differently? Well, their holdings are generally our best. Their land
        is in the choicest places, with the highest value: the central business
        district of our most vital cities, the choice waterfront locations. For
        more about this, see these themes: <a href="../../themes/Capital_Gains.html">capital
        gains</a>, <a href="../../themes/Land_Different_from_Capital.html">land
        different from capital</a>, and two articles: <a href="../../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real
        Estate and the Capital Gains
Debate</a> and <b><a href="../../docs/Hudson_Lies.html">The Lies of the Land:
How and Why Land Gets
Undervalued</a></b></span>. Buildings depreciate, but land appreciates, and that
value is vital to all of us. We are all <a href="../../themes/Highest_Best_Use.html">highly

      <p>But the estate tax is not the best solution. As long as we have our
        existing system of taxes, and the <a href="../../themes/Wealth_Concentration.html">awesomely
        skewed distribution of wealth</a>        that results from it, we do

        the <a href="../../themes/Unearned_Increment.html">unearned

    <p><a name="e"></a><strong>Who benefits when we reduce the taxes on capital gains and dividends?</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Stock ownership has now reached roughly 50% of American households,
        and when the legislation was put forward a few years ago to reduce the
        taxes on dividends and capital gains, it was said that this legislation
        would benefit the middle class. </p>
      <p>For more information about the how many of us own stock, you might take
        a look at these data:</p>
      <p>1. <b><a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm#Table6">Table 6</a>: of <a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm">Recent Changes in U.S.
            Family Finances: Evidence from the 2001 and 2004 Survey of Consumer
        Finances</a></b></p>
      <p>This shows that 48.6% of us owned stock (2004), directly or indirectly.
        Some hold publicly-traded stock directly, some through mutual funds,
        some
        through retirement assets, others through managed assets. (See the <a href="SCF_defs.html">SCF
        definitions</a> for details.)</p>
      <p>But having said that 48.6% of households own stock (directly and indirectly),
        the percentage who own them outside retirement accounts is much smaller:
        20.7% hold STOCKS, and 15.0% have Mutual Funds. Median holdings are $15,000
        and $40,400 respectively, and mean holdings are $547,000 and $184,000
        respectively (<a href="Rct_Chgs_01-04.htm#5B2004">Table 5</a>). [See
        also: Medians, Means and Wobegon]</p>
      <p>2. The Top 1% have 36.8% of the equity holdings, the Next 9% have 42.0%
        and the other 90% have 21.2%. (<a href="90-9-1_Tables.html#W903">Table
        W90-3.</a>) <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm#W503">Table W50-3</a> reveals that
        the Bottom 50% have 1.2% of the EQUITY and the next 40% have 20.0%.</p>
      <p>3. The <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm">50-40-5-4-1</a> and <a href="90-9-1_Tables.html">90-9-1</a> tables
          provide a sense of the relative holdings of equity: Average holdings
          among those in the top percentile are about 20 times those of holders
          in the bottom 90% (<a href="90-9-1_Tables.html#W907">Table W90-7</a>,
          line 28, columns 6 and 8).</p>
      <p>But an equally important source of &quot;capital&quot; gains is the ownership
          of land, with or without buildings on it. This may fall into a number
          of categories in the <a href="90-9-1_Tables.html">90-9-1</a> and <a href="50-40-5-4-1.htm">50-40-5-4-1</a> tables:
          ORESRE, NNRESRE and BUS, as well as HOUSES, all have land as a significant
          share of the value.</p>
      <p>The Congressional Budget Office published a study at year-end 2005 which
        provided  some data on capital income &#8212; that is, income from interest,
        dividends, rents and and capital gains &#8212; has become more concentrated
        over time. In 1980, the top 1% of income recipients (note that
        this is <em>not</em> the same as the top 1% of wealthholders!) received
        35.6% of capital income. By 1990, this figure was 39.7%, by 2000 49.1%
        and
        in
        2003 57.5%. See <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/1-29-06tax2.htm">http://www.cbpp.org/1-29-06tax2.htm</a> and

        The top 10% of the income recipients received 79.4% of the capital
        income.</p>
      <p>A table at <a href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/cg0306.pdf">http://www.ctj.org/pdf/cg0306.pdf</a>          shows that 69.9% of taxable long-term capital gains
        in 2005 went to the top 1% of the <em>income</em> spectrum!</p>

    <p> <a name="f"></a><strong>Should we give corporations special privileges? To whose benefit do
            they accrue?</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When we permit corporations to pollute the air, or water, or use up
        nonrenewable resources without paying the commons for the privilege,
        in effect, we are
          permitting the shareholders to privatize that which should be our common
          treasure. The benefits go to the shareholders. (see: <a href="../../themes/Pollution.html">pollution</a>, <a href="../../themes/Externality.html">externality</a>,
          <a href="../../themes/Privatization.html">privatization</a>, <a href="../../themes/Air_Water_Land.html">air-land-water</a>, <a href="../../themes/Polluter_Pays.html">polluter

        resources</a>, <a href="../../themes/Natural_Opportunities.html">natural
          opportunities</a>.)</p>
      <p>When we permit corporations to renege on pension liabilities, the beneficiary
        is those who own the stock, and those who have the highest paying jobs
        in the corporations, whose compensation is tied to profitability and
        stock prices. (See <a href="../../themes/Privileges.html">privilege</a>)</p>
      <p>A case could be made, perhaps, that since many of us who don't own stock
        directly are beneficiaries of pension funds which own stock and are enriched
        by these privileges, it is acceptable to pollute the air for &quot;private&quot;
        gain. But as long as there are people in the world, created equal,
        who don't have their fair share of the value of corporate shares, this
        is
        a false case. And as long as we anticipate that there will be future
        generations of humans, this is a false case.</p>

    <p> <a name="g"></a><strong>Does wealth trickle down? Under what conditions?</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Certainly looking at the trends in wealth distribution over recent years,
          it would be hard to make the case that wealth trickles down. To the
        extent that ownership of the kinds of resources that all of us depend
        on is concentrated in a relative few, those few are in a position to
        collect payment from the rest of us for their use. I refer here not to
        buildings, but to choice <a href="../../themes/Location3.html">locations</a> for buildings, and to other parts
        of the natural and social creation that are not subject to increases
        in supply following increases in demand. When we must pay large amounts
        of our income for a place to live, and when in order to secure a worthwhile
        site for a potential business, we must pay the current owner of that
        site exorbitant rents, we have little left to meet our other needs or
        to pay for things for which increased demand leads to increased supply.</p>
      <p>Wealth seems to trickle to those who are permitted to pocket the economic
        value of our natural resources. (For more about this, see: <a href="../../themes/Land_Different_from_Capital.html">land

    <p> <a name="h"></a><strong>How many people lack sufficient savings and resources to meet their
          most simply defined needs for a few months?</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the flip side of the concentration-of-wealth issue. It is also
        one of the intersections of wealth and income, two focuses of this website.
         How much does one need to get by? Having determined that, how many people
        have sufficient assets to cover themselves for, say, 3 months? </p>
      <p>The question of how much one needs to &quot;get by&quot; has been answered
        by a number of studies. Perhaps the most accessible of these are the <a href="../income/sss_etc.htm">Self-Sufficiency
        Standard Studies</a>, which have been conducted in over 35 states in
        recent years. The answer, briefly, is &quot;a lot more than the federal poverty
        line would suggest.&quot; How much more? Here is one part of that answer,
        for a family of four in </p>
      <p>The second half of the question has also been explored in a couple of
        very useful studies about &quot;asset poverty&quot; by Edward Wolff,
        of New York University. They use the 2001 SCF, and make the (counterfactual)
        assumption that an individual
        or family can &quot;get by&quot; at the poverty level, that is, that
        (1) one can live at least somewhat acceptably, in any part of America,
        on spending
        equivalent to the <a href="../pov/hhs_pov_gdlines_hist.htm">Federal
        Poverty Guideline</a>; and (2) that one can reduce one's necessary expenses
        down to that level rather quickly. The <a href="../income/sss_etc.htm">Self-Sufficiency
        Standard Studies</a>        make rather clear that the first assumption
        is a dubious one (though it should be noted that some tax expense, partially
        offset by tax credits, would disappear); most people's experience would
        suggest that the second assumption is
        also
        open to question.
        Having said that, Wolff's studies on asset poverty are useful. Check
        the pages on <a href="../assetpoverty/index.htm">Asset Poverty</a> for
        more detail on this. </p>
