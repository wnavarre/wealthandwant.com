<p align="center"><strong>300 Million Population</strong></p>
<p>In mid-October, 2006, the population of the US passed 300 million.
  Some people regard this as a bad thing. Others regard it favorably. The milestone
  gives us a chance to reflect on the dynamics of population growth, and to explore
  for whom population growth is a good thing, and for whom it is a bad thing,
  and why, and how we might go about making it into a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Some are concerned about population growth because they fear that our planet
  cannot support more people than it has now without having serious negative
  effects. One might observe that their fears relate to the product of two factors
  -- the number of people on the earth and the average amount of resources consumed
  by each one. Those of us at the upper end of the global consumption range --
  which includes most Americans, particularly those in the upper half of the
  income
  spectrum -- are certainly consuming a lot more of our fair share of the clean
  air and non-renewable natural resources, and so there is legitimate reason
  to be concerned that adding more people
at our own levels of resource consumption may not be a good thing.</p>
<p>But we must differentiate the two factors -- population and load on the environment
  -- if we are going to think precisely.</p>
<p>One might also be tempted to ask whether the increase in population leads
  to more competition for other scarce or finite resources, and thereby drives
up prices for all of us. Now we are getting close to the heart of the matter. </p>
<p>We've watched as housing affordability has gone from a point where most of
  us are spending about 25% of our income on housing, to one where the average
  is closer to 30%, and the percentage of families who spend more than 40% of
their income on housing is high.</p>
<p>What is it that is in fixed supply? What is it that is scarce? Those who answer
  the question by saying &quot;housing&quot; may be correct in the short term,
  but more precisely, what is scarce is not the <em>houses </em> or <em>apartments </em>themselves
  or the materials or labor with which to build them. These things are all in
  reasonable
  supply,
  and supply will rise to meet demand. No, what is in short supply is well-located
  land on which to build housing. Well-located residential land is land within
  a reasonable commuting distance of good jobs, located in districts with good
  schools and
other amenities and existing infrastructure. </p>
<p>There is plenty of land available, but what is available as virgin land (that
  is, not previously built on) is on the fringes, far from jobs, without public
  transportation, highways, emergency
  services, schools, and all the other amenities that make a neighborhood a desirable
  place to settle. Some of us genuinely want to live far from our neighbor's
  chimney, at least during parts of our lives, but many more of us need or want
to live in places where the benefits of community are present abundantly.</p>
<p>If we want to live in one of those choicer places, we find that we must buy
  an older home, and accept that it may not have all the modern amenities,
  interior space or technological features that we
  might be able to afford if we lived on less expensive land. The transportation
  tradeoff is of both time and money, not just for commuting to job(s) but also
to schools, shopping and some forms of recreation. Or we could choose an older
  house not for its own amenities but because it occupies a well-located site,
  then replace it with a new structure.</p>
<p>As population increases, land that had little value when America's population
  was 200 million, or 250 million, begins to acquire value, and sometimes significant
  value. Some land is naturally valuable -- that is, valuable due to natural
  amenities like ports, falling water, navigable rivers, magnificent views, waterfront,
  fertile soil, favorable growing conditions, water supply -- and grows in value
  as population
  increases. Some of that increase in value is due solely to the increase in
  population. Some of it is due to public investment in infrastructure (think
  of the Verrazanno
  Narrows and Tappan Zee Bridges' effects on Staten Island and Rockland County's
  land value, or the Jubilee subway line's effect on land values in parts of
  London, or the railroad and highway systems that connect to ports) and
  services. And some of it is due to technological advances (consider
  how air
  conditioning
  has increased
  the
  value
  of residential and commercial land in
  the southern half of the US, or how elevators make urban land more
  valuable, or how low-maintenance fiberglass pleasure boats
have made waterfront sites more desirable, ). </p>
<p>This article began with the suggestion that the effects of population increase
  due to
natural growth, longer lifespans and immigration could be turned into a win-win
  situation. <em><strong>How might that be?</strong></em> We alluded to housing becoming increasingly unaffordable,
  something that has been noticed for at least 25 years but which is spiraling
  outward at an alarming and painful rate today. No one seems to be relating
  this to the increasing concentration of wealth which has also been occurring.</p>
<p>As population increases, well-located land increases in value. Our current
  approach is to treat that increase in value as private treasure. We tax it
  little (a 15% long term capital gain only on the increase of more than $500,000
  per couple over 2 years or more, a step-up in basis upon death, and, for fewer
  than 1% of us, an estate tax). And yet the landholder doesn't lift a finger
  to reap that gain! Why on earth should it be his private treasure, while others
  struggle to pay large downpayments to sellers and 30 years of mortgage payments
  to lenders?</p>
<p>That community-created treasure should be treated as our common treasure.
  To do this does not mean that we will affect title to property at all. It simply
  means that instead of taxing land at 1% or 2% per year (and taxing buildings
  similarly), we ought to be collecting more of the economic value of land (and
  leaving buildings untaxed). Were we to make this shift, we would be in a position
  to reduce or eliminate sales taxes on other essentials, which plague our lowest-income
  brethren and serve to decrease demand for those products, thereby reducing
  employment and wages, and reduce or eliminate wage and income taxes, starting
  at the bottom of the income spectrum, thereby leaving to the worker and the
  saver more of the fruits of his labor and his deferred gratification!</p>
<p>Were we to do this, all of us would share in the land value increase produced
  by population growth, by technological progress and from public investment
  in infrastructure, instead of unevenly enriching some of us while impoverishing
  many more of us. </p>
<p>It isn't all that complicated to do, and the societal and justice benefits
would be awesome in their effects.</p>
