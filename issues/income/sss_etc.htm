<p align="center"><strong>The Self-Sufficiency Standard Studies, <br>
  and other Methodologies for Calculating
a Bare-Bones Cost of Living </strong></p>
<p>In the mid-90s, a series of studies started appearing, under the name Self-Sufficiency
  Standard. The title refers to the point that for a young family to be self-sufficient,
  it needs to be able to meet its own needs without depending
  on relatives for housing, childcare or other essentials. How much does that
  cost, for families of various configurations in various parts of the country,
  to
  meet
  their most
  simply defined needs?</p>
<p> The SSS studies  are done one state at a time, or occasionally, for
    a metropolitan area that
    encompasses
    parts
    of several states. In a few cases, the second and even third studies have
  been conducted for the same area.</p>
<p>Each uses a consistent methodology to calculate a no-frills cost
  of living. The lifestyle it provides is below the level most of us would define
  as the
  bottom of middle class. It assumes that all adults are employed full-time.</p>
<p>In the body of each study, tables provide monthly and annualized costs of
  living for four typical configurations of family: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a single adult</li>
  <li>an adult and a preschooler</li>
  <li>an adult, a school-age child and a preschooler</li>
  <li>two adults, a school-age child and a preschooler</li>
</ul>
<p>In the appendices, costs for other configurations of families are provided.</p>
<p>Further, because some of the costs of living vary greatly from one geographical
  area to another, the costs are calculated on a local basis. The body of the
  study typically includes a table for each of three   cities
  and one or two of the rural counties. (The appendices will list similar data
  for every metropolitan area and rural county in the state.)</p>
<p>Before we describe what this no-frills lifestyle <em>does</em> include,
  let's name what it <em>doesn't</em> provide
  for. It doesn't provide for savings,  debt repayment (whether it be student
  debt or credit-card debt, or even interest payments), birthday gifts,
  Little League,  babysitting other than work-day childcare. It doesn't
  provide for diapers,  furniture,  dry cleaning,  a car payment (it assumes
  an older, paid-off car for each adult, except where public transportation is
  the norm),  any meals not prepared at home, or charitable contributions. </p>
<p>Having said what it doesn't include, here's what the Self Sufficiency Standard
  <em>does </em>include, and the assumptions it uses. Five expense categories,
    plus miscellaneous and taxes, are calculated. Here are the assumptions:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Housing</strong> &#8212; The Self-Sufficiency Standard studies
    assume that a single person lives in a one-bedroom rental apartment. An adult
    or a couple with
    one or two children lives in a two-bedroom apartment. (This may mean that
    opposite-gender siblings will share a bedroom, but that parents and children
    will not.) Costs are based on HUD FMR's (Housing and Urban Development's
    Fair Market Rents), which are generally the 40th percentile of rental housing
    available in that city for that size apartment. This means that they are
    not luxury and that they are not in the worst neighborhoods, however that
    is defined locally. They may or may not be near public transportation. HUD
    FMR's are available at <a href="http://www.huduser.org/datasets/fmr.html">http://www.huduser.org/datasets/fmr.html</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Food</strong> &#8212; The SSS calculates food costs using the USDA's
    Low-Cost Food Plan. (The Department of Agriculture provides four food plans:
    Thrifty,
  Low-Cost, Moderate and Liberal. (see the  <a href="../pov/USDA_foodplans_2006_03.htm">March,
  2006 figures</a>). The SSS assumes that all meals are prepared at home, from
  food purchased at grocery stores. For a family of four including two school-age
  children, the Low-Cost Food Plan allowed <a href="../pov/USDA_foodplans_2006_03.htm#182">$1.82
  per person per meal</a> in March,
  2006 (line 20, column 2). (The Thrifty Food Plan allowed $1.42 per person per
  meal.)</li>
  <li><strong>Childcare</strong> &#8212; Childcare costs are collected on a local
    basis. To quote from the 2005 Connecticut study, &quot;the Standard assumes that
    infants [under age 3] receive full-time care in family day care homes. Preschoolers,
    in contrast, are assumed to go to child care centers full-time. Schoolage
    children
    are assumed to receive part-time care in before- and after-school programs.&quot;</li>
  <li><strong>Transportation</strong> &#8212; In places where there is an adequate
    public transportation system, the budget calls for a monthly pass for each
    adult. Where public
    transportation is used by less than 7% of the population, the assumption
    is that each adult will have a paid for &quot;average&quot; car; the costs of operating
    it are calculated into the budget, but not the acquisition cost. Variable
    costs will take into account local commuting patterns, a single shopping
    trip each week, and a bit of extra mileage for one adult to get to childcare
    at the beginning and end of the workday.</li>
  <li><strong>Health care</strong> assumes employer-provided insurance, and takes into account
    the percentage of premium costs that employees pay in the particlar state,
    plus additional out-of-pocket expenses for copayments, uncovered expenses
    and deductibles.</li>
</ol>
<p>To the subtotal of these five costs is added an allowance of 10% of that
  sum for <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>, which is assumed to cover clothing,
  shoes, paper products, non-prescription medicines, laundry, dry cleaning, cleaning
  supplies, non-prescription medicines, personal hygiene
  items, diapers,
  cribs, car seats, furniture,
  telephone service,
  union dues, bank fees, toys, school supplies, haircuts, and everything else.
  This is a very conservative assumption, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Taxes</strong> are calculated, based on local tax structures,
  to represent the amount that someone <em>netting </em>the subtotal of the preceding
  6 categories would be paying out. The methodology  also shows 
  the earned income tax credit, child care credit and child tax credit, where
  applicable.</p>
<p>The sum of these seven categories is the Self-Sufficiency Standard,
  the amount of income needed  for a
  family of a specific configuration in a particular place, to meet
  its most simply defined needs. Notice that it doesn't assume that the family
  can get into public housing (for which the waiting lists are
  often years long or are not  accepting newcomers) or Section 8 (ditto). </p>
<p>The SSS, then, is a localized measure of a no-frills, bare-bones lifestyle.
  All one's basic needs are being met, but there are none of the extras that
  most Americans think are part of a middle-class lifestyle.</p>
<p>Here are links to at least some of the studies. Choose one for a state you
know. Read one in detail, and get to understand how it is set up, and then skim
  a couple others (looking primarily at the first five or so tables). Choose
  a
  state you
  think
  of as poor,
  and others
  you think of as high-income. Take a look at Louisiana's, though its data is
  from a few years before Katrina. </p>

<p>When you read these studies, you may find it difficult to
  remember that the lifestyle that (in 2003) cost</p>
<ul>
  <li>$48,590 in Los Angeles, </li>
  <li>$60,274 in San Francisco,
    or </li>
  <li>$34,736 in Tulare County, California, for a family of four is just
       as austere as the lifestyle that costs </li>
  <li>$40,940
             for
            a
            family
            of
            four
            in
            Birmingham,
        or </li>
  <li>$28,153 in Cherokee County, Alabama, or </li>
  <li>$30,101 in Orleans Parish,
            Louisiana, or</li>
  <li>$54,590 in upper Manhattan, New York &#8212; the <em>least</em> expensve in the
    five NYC boroughs (2004) .</li>
</ul>
<p>As you read these studies, look for a couple of pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How does the Self-Sufficiency Standard figure compare to the <a href="../pov/hhs_pov_gdlines_hist.htm">Federal
      Poverty Guideline</a> for that year for each size of family (1, 2, 3 and 4 people)? (One
    might borrow  the phrase &quot;economic reality gap&quot; to describe the difference.)</li>
  <li>How does the Self-Sufficiency Standard figure compare to the local Area
    Median Income?</li>
  <li>What percentage  of the no-frills income
    goes for rent and taxes? </li>
  <li>What percentage of local residents are renters? California and New York
    have the highest rents and among the lowest homeownership rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>and consider these  questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How might a single adult reduce their cost of living below this level?
    What would they forego?</li>
  <li>How might a single parent reduce their cost of living below this level?</li>
  <li>How might a couple with children reduce their cost of living below this
    level? </li>
  <li>How might someone living at or below this level be able to respond to any
    unexpected adversity?</li>
  <li>How do children growing up in these circumstances view the world and their
    opportunities and place in it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, think about the question of what society's response should
  be to this. </p>
