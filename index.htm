                        opportunities to unburden the economy and

                      <p>In several different places, I've found myself
                        wanting to share four of Henry George's
                        speeches, because they are very moving, and
                        provide both a sense of George's ideas and a
                        distillation of much longer works. So I'm going
                        to link to them right up front, and hope that if
                        you haven't had the pleasure of reading them,
                        you will take a look. If your orientation is not
                        theological, don't be put off by the titles: the
                        topic is the universal one of how we might order
                        ourselves so as to create a just and prosperous
                        society — for all! (Would that our worship

                            suffer. I hold, and I think no one who looks
                            at the facts can fail to see, that poverty
                            is utterly unnecessary. It is not by the
                            decree of the Almighty, but it is because of
                            our own injustice, our own selfishness, our

                            times? Overproduction! There are so many
                            clothes that men must go ragged, so much
                            coal that in the bitter winters people have
                            to shiver, such over-filled granaries that
                            people actually die by starvation! Want due
                            to over-production! Was a greater absurdity
                            ever uttered? How can there be
                            over-production till all have enough? It is
                            not over-production; it is unjust

                        thought provoking. Not only does it speak to
                        issues of race, but it makes some important
                        points with respect to immigration. It speaks to
                        infrastructure spending, schools, bubbles and
                        bursts, Old Testament land laws... </p>
                      <blockquote>
                        <p>In the Promised Land of the Old Testament,
                          there was no land speculation and no
                          possibility of speculative bubbles, because
                          you couldn’t sell land in perpetuity.
                          According to the 25th chapter of Leviticus,
                          every 50th year was to be a Jubilee, and you
                          could only sell a lease on the land up to the
                          next Jubilee. As the time remaining on the
                          lease was always getting shorter, the lease
                          was always falling in value, so you couldn’t
                          make a capital gain on it. Nowadays, if we
                          somehow don’t consider ourselves bound by the
                          commandment that “The land shall not be sold
                          for ever” (Leviticus 25:23), we need another
                          method of preventing speculation. <strong>Land-value

                            taxation not only discourages speculation,
                            but also reduces inflationary pressure,
                            allowing a reduction in the natural rate of
                            unemployment, so that members of the
                            dominant ethnic group face little risk of
                            unemployment and have little to gain by
                            trying to offload that risk onto some
                            minority.</strong></p>
                        <p>Alternatively, America can retain the present
                          inflationary taxes, and the Fed can fight the
                          inflationary pressure by creating
                          unemployment, the burden of which will
                          continue to fall disproportionately on Blacks.
                          Meanwhile the opportunity to make capital
                          gains on land, together with the lack of
                          pressure to earn income from it, will maintain
                          a permanent artificial demand for land,
                          exacerbated by periodic speculative bubbles.
                          The artificial demand will inflate rents and
                          prices of residential land, which is a
                          necessity of life, and for which workers will
                          have to pay out of wages that have been
                          depressed by the competition for scarce jobs,
                          eroded by income tax, and devalued by indirect
                          taxes. This is the <strong>Ownership Society</strong>,
                          the caricature of the Promised Land offered by
                          those who call themselves conservatives. </p>
                        <p> But let’s conclude on a more conciliatory
                          note. In the present recession, which has been
                          triggered by a collapse in land prices,
                          land-value taxation would reverse the collapse
                          — not by re-inflating a temporary speculative
                          bubble, but by inducing investment in
                          infrastructure that permanently enhances the
                          utility of the land. So maybe it takes a
                          recession to induce a conservative
                          appreciation of land-value taxation as a
                          substitute for existing taxes. Maybe that’s
                          one way in which “only when it is dark enough
                          can you see the stars.”</p>

                          I-95 Went Down:</strong> Where do we get the
                        money required to build, maintain and upgrade
                        America's infrastructure? The answer is under
                        our feet. The logical source — largely untapped
                        in some of its richest lodes — is in the value
                        of our best land and our natural resources. Is
                        it sufficient? It will go a long way to funding
                        this very necessary spending, without burdening
                        the economy — and without depriving anyone of
                        something they are morally entitled to. See <a

                            Even if your own orientation is not
                            theological, I think you might find little
                            to disagree with in those pieces whose
                            titles are Biblical references. You'll
                            notice that some of these pieces are 100 or
                            more years old — and that they describe
                            clearly phenomena we see today, which we
                            tend to think of as new problems. Read them

                      <p>"Yes, there are taxes I like. For example, the
                        gasoline tax, which pays for highways. You have
                        a user tax. The property tax is one of the least
                        bad taxes, because it's levied on something that
                        cannot be produced — that part that is levied on
                        the land. So some taxes are worse than others,
                        but all taxes are bad." <font size="-1">—
