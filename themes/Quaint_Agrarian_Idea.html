  Agrarian Idea?&nbsp; Quaint 19th Century Idea? Too late now?</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;"></div>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Sometimes when one brings up Henry
  George's name and ideas, the response one gets is something to the
  effect that his ideas were and are only relevant in an agrarian
  society, or that they would have been fine if we'd enacted his remedy at an
    early stage of our development.&nbsp; On
  the contrary!&nbsp; Land
  values vary far more in cities than they do in rural areas, and the difference
  between
  prime
  land and marginal land is much greater in the city.&nbsp; The well
  known three rules of real estate &#8212; location, location and location!
  &#8212; speak <em>exactly</em> to that issue.&nbsp; What could be more current?
  <br>
  <br>
  George often uses agricultural examples (fertility of soil), but his points
  are primarily about urban affairs, where land value differences and effects
  were,
  even then,
  exponentially higher.&nbsp; In <em>The  Land Question</em> (excerpted
  below), he speaks directly to the universality of the matter.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">    <span style="font-style: italic;"> I
        merely wish to correct that impression which leads so many people to
        talk and write as though rent and land tenures related solely to
    agriculture and to agricultural communities.&nbsp;</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">Nothing could be more
        erroneous. Land is necessary to all production, no matter what be the
        kind or form; land is the standing-place, the workshop, the
        storehouse of labor; it is to the human being the only means by which
        he can obtain access to the material universe or utilize its powers.
        Without land man cannot exist. To whom the ownership of land is
        given, to him is given the virtual ownership of the men who must live
        upon it. </span>  </div>
  <p>These ideas hold the key to understanding and solving some of our most serious
    social and economic problems of <em><strong>our</strong></em> time, and to
    creating the kind of society we'd like all our grandchildren to live in.</p>

    George 100 Years Later: The Great Reconciler</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In 1879, George electrified the
world by identifying one
underlying cause for two great economic plagues: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>chronic poverty arising from insufficient demand for
labor, and </small></li>
  <li><small>cycles of boom and bust. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">These
twin plagues arose from concentrated ownership of land,
compounded by land speculation.</span> Large landowners and speculators
(often one and the same) held the best land idle or underused,
forcing labor onto marginal land and driving down wages. Collapse of
speculative land price bubbles caused periodic slumps.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>(By "land" George meant
exclusive rights to use natural
resources in a specified territory. It included mining, water,
fishing, and timber rights, road and rail rights-of way, and some
patents. George emphasized the high value and productivity of urban
land, which facilitated communication and trade. Today, we would add
to "land" such items as taxi medallions, telecommunications licenses
and pollution "rights".)&nbsp; </i><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Neo-classical economists give us only a hard choice: we may have
equity, or efficiency, but not both. By contrast, George's program
reconciles equity and efficiency. Think of it! George takes two polar
philosophies, collectivism and individualism, and composes them into
one solution. He cuts the Gordian knot. Like Keynes after him, George
inspires us by saying, "Forget the bitter tradeoffs; we can have it
all!"<a

    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic
    Cause of Poverty</a> (in the unabridged: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Book
    V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The truth is self-evident. Put to any one capable of consecutive thought this
      question:</p>
  <p>&quot;Suppose there should arise from the English Channel or the German
    Ocean a no man's land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should
    be able
      to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and
    of free access, like the commons which once comprised so large a part of
    English
      soil. What would be the effect upon wages in England?&quot;</p>
  <p>He would at once tell you that common wages throughout England must soon increase
      to thirty shillings a day.</p>
  <p>And in response to another question, &quot;What would be the effect on rents?&quot; he
      would at a moment's reflection say that rents must necessarily fall; and
    if he thought out the next step he would tell you that all this would happen
    without
      any very large part of English labor being diverted to the new natural
    opportunities, or the forms and direction of industry being much changed;
    only that kind of
      production being abandoned which now yields to labor and to landlord together
      less than labor could secure on the new opportunities. The great rise in
    wages would be at the expense of rent.</p>
  <p>Take now the same man or another &#8212; some hardheaded business man, who
      has no theories, but knows how to make money. Say to him: &quot;Here is a little
      village; in ten years it will be a great city &#8212; in ten years the
      railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach, the electric light
      of the candle;
      it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously
      multiply the effective power of labor. Will, in ten years, interest be
      any higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Will the wages of common labor be any higher; will it be easier for
      a man who has nothing but his labor to make an independent living?&quot;</p>
  <p>He will tell you, &quot;No; the wages of common labor will not be any higher;
      on the contrary, all the chances are that they will be lower; it will not
    be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living; the chances
    are
      that it will be harder.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What, then, will be higher?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Rent; the value of land. Go, get yourself a piece of ground, and hold
      possession.&quot;</p>
  <p>And if, under such circumstances, you take his advice, you need do nothing
      more. You may sit down and smoke your pipe; you may lie around like the lazzaroni
      of Naples or the leperos of Mexico; you may go up in a balloon, or down a hole
      in the ground; and without doing one stroke of work, without adding one iota
      to the wealth of the community, in ten years you will be rich! In the new city
      you may have a luxurious mansion; but among its public buildings will be an
      almshouse.</p>
  <p>In all our long investigation we have been advancing to this simple truth:
      That as land is necessary to the exertion of labor in the production of wealth,
      to command the land which is necessary to labor, is to command all the fruits
      of labor save enough to enable labor to exist. ...</p>
  <p>... For land is the habitation of man, the storehouse upon which he must
    draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be applied for
    the
      supply of all his desires; for even the products of the sea cannot be taken,
      the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the forces of nature utilized,
    without the use of land or its products. On the land we are born, from it
    we live,
      to it we return again &#8212; children of the soil as truly as is the blade
      of grass or the flower of the field. Take away from man all that belongs
      to land, and he is but a disembodied spirit. Material progress cannot rid
      us of
      our dependence upon land; it can but add to the power of producing wealth
      from land; and hence, when land is monopolized, it might go on to infinity
      without
      increasing wages or improving the condition of those who have but their
      labor. It can but add to the value of land and the power which its possession
      gives.
      Everywhere, in all times, among all peoples, the possession of land is
      the base of aristocracy, the foundation of great fortunes, the source of
      power.

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
      of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Do you know that I do not think
that the average man realises what land
is? I know a little girl who has been going to school for some time,
studying geography, and all that sort of thing; and one day she said to
me: "Here is something about the surface of the earth. I wonder what
the surface of the earth looks like?" "Well," I said, "look out into
the yard there. That is the surface of the earth." She said, "That the
surface of the earth? Our yard the surface of the earth? Why, I never
thought of it!" That is very much the case not only with grown men, but
with such wise beings as newspaper editors. They seem to think, when
you talk of land, that you always refer to farms; to think that the
land question is a question that relates entirely to farmers, as though
land had no other use than growing crops. Now, I should like to know
how a man could even edit a newspaper without having the use of some
land. He might swing himself by straps and go up in a balloon, but he
could not even then get along without land. What supports the balloon
in the air? Land; the surface of the earth. Let the earth drop, and
what would become of the balloon? The air that supports the balloon is
supported in turn by land. So it is with everything else men can do.
Whether a man is working away three thousand feet under the surface of
the earth or whether he is working up in the top of one of those
immense buildings that they have in New York; whether he is ploughing
the soil or sailing across the ocean, he is still using land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Land! Why, in owning a piece of ground, what do you own ? The
lawyers will tell you that you own from the centre of the earth right
up to heaven; and, so far as all human purposes go, you do. In New York
they are building houses thirteen and fourteen stories high. What are
men, living in those upper stories, paying for? There is a friend of
mine who has an office in one of them, and he estimates that he pays by
the cubic foot for air. Well, the man who owns the surface of the land
has the renting of the air up there, and would have if the buildings
were carried up for miles.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This land question is the bottom question. Man is a land animal.
Suppose you want to build a house; can you build it without a place to
put it? What is it built of? Stone, or mortar, or wood, or iron &#8212; they
all come from the earth. Think of any article of wealth you choose, any
of those things which men struggle for, where do they come from? From
the land. It is the bottom question. The land question is simply the
labour question; and when some men own that element from which all
wealth must be drawn, and upon which all must live, then they have the
power of living without work, and, therefore, those who do work get
less of the products of work. ...<a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html"> <span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today the value of land in New
York city is over a hundred million annually. Who has created that
value? Is it because a few landowners are here that that land is worth
a hundred million a year? Is it not because the whole population of New
York is here? Is it not because this great city is the center of
exchanges for a large portion of the continent? Does not every child
that is born, every one that comes to settle in New York, does it not
add to the value of this land? Ought it not, therefore, get some
portion of the benefit? And is it not wronged when, instead of being
used for that purpose, certain favored individuals are allowed to
appropriate the fund of land values?</small><br>
<br>
<small>We might take this vast fund for common needs; we might with it
make a city here such as the world has never seen before &#8212; a city
spacious, clean, wholesome, beautiful &#8212; a city that should be full of
parks; a city without tenement houses; and we could do this, not merely
without imposing any tax upon production, without interfering with the
just rights of property, but while at the same time securing far better
than they are now the rights of property, and abolishing the taxes that
now weigh on production.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We have but to throw off our taxes upon things of human
production; to cease to fine a person who puts up a house or makes
anything that adds to the wealth of the community; to cease
collecting taxes from people who bring goods from abroad or make
goods at home; and &#8212; in substitution for all these taxes &#8212;
to collect that enormous revenue due to the growth of the community
for the benefit of the community that produced it. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>What we propose to do is to divide up the rent that comes from
land; and that is a very easy thing.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We need not disturb anybody in possession, we need not interfere
with anybody&#8217;s building or anybody&#8217;s improvement. We only need to remit
taxes on all improvements, on all forms of wealth, and put the tax on
the value of the land, exclusive of the improvements, so that the
dog-in-the-manger who is holding a piece of vacant land will have to
pay the same amount of tax for it as land of similar value with a
building or other improvements upon it. In that way we would treat the
whole land of such a community as being the common estate of the whole
people of the community.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The people of New York could manage their estate just as well as
any corporation, or any private family, for that matter. But for the
people of New York to resume their estate and to treat it as their own,
it is not necessary for them to go to any bother of management. It is
not necessary for them to say to any landowner, this particular piece
of land is ours, and no longer yours.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We can leave land titles just as they are. We can leave the
owners of the land to call themselves its owners; all we want is the
annual value of the land. Not, mark you, that value which the owner has
created, that value which has been given to it by improvements; but
simply that value which is given to the bare land by the fact that we
are all here &#8212;that has attached to the land because of the growth of
this great community. And, when we take that, then all inducement to
monopolize the land will be gone &#8212; then these very worthy gentlemen who
are holding one-half of the area of this city idle and vacant will find
the taxes they have to pay so high that they will have to go to work
and build houses or otherwise use the land, or give it away to somebody
who will build upon it, or put it to other productive use. And so it
will happen all over the country. ...&nbsp;<a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Land Question is not merely
a question between farmers and the
owners of agricultural land. It is a question that affects every man,
every woman, and every child. The Land Question is simply another
name for the great labor question, and the people who think of the
Land Question as having importance simply for farmers forget what
land is.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If you would realize what land is,
think of what men would be
without land. If there were no land, where would be the people? Land
is not merely a place to graze cows or sheep upon, to raise corn or

of every human being. We are all land animals; our very bodies come
from the land, and to the land they return again.</small></p>

<br>
</small>1. It would dispense with a whole army of tax gatherers and
other officials which present taxes require, and place in the treasury
a much larger portion of what is taken from people, while by making
government simpler and cheaper, it would tend to make it purer. <strong>... </strong></small><strong>
</strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><small>2. It would
enormously increase the production of wealth--</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>(a) By the removal of the
burdens that now weigh upon industry and thrift. If we tax houses,
there will be fewer and poorer houses; if we tax machinery, there will
be less machinery; if we tax trade, there will be less trade; if we tax
capital, there will be less capital; if we tax savings, there will be
less savings. All the taxes therefore that we would abolish are those
that repress industry and lessen wealth. But if we tax land values,
there will be no less land.</small><br>
<small>(b) On the contrary, <b>the taxation of land values has the
effect of making land more easily available by industry,</b> since it
makes it more difficult for owners of valuable land which they
themselves do not care to use to hold it idle for a large future price.
...</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;(c) The taxation of the processes and products of labor on
one hand, and the insufficient taxation of land values on the other,
produce an unjust distribution of wealth which is building up in the
hands of a few, fortunes more monstrous than the world has ever before
seen, while the masses of our people are steadily becoming relatively
poorer. ... </small><br>
<small>(d) The unjust distribution which is giving us the hundred-fold
millionaire on the one side and the tramp and pauper on the other,
generates thieves, gamblers, and social parasites of all kinds ...</small><br>
<small>(e)<b> The taxes we would abolish fall most heavily on the
poorer agricultural districts, and tend to drive population and wealth
from them to the great cities</b>. <span

destroy that monopoly of land which is the great cause of that
distribution of population which is crowding the people too closely
together in some places and scattering them too far apart in other
places. Families live on top of one another in cities because of the
enormous speculative prices at which vacant lots are held.</span> In
the country they are scattered too far apart for social intercourse and
convenience, because, instead of each taking what land he can use,
every one who can grabs all he can get, in the hope of profiting by its
increase in value, and the next man must pass farther on. Thus we have
scores of families living under a single roof, and other families
living in dugouts on the prairies afar from neighbors--some living too
close to each other for moral, mental, or physical health, and others
too far separated for the stimulating and refining influences of
society. The wastes in health, in mental vigor, and in unnecessary
transportation result in great economic losses which the Single Tax
would save. ...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html"> read the whole article</a></small><a href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html"><br>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">2. THE PRODUCTION OF WEALTH</font></strong></p>
  <p>When considered in connection with primitive modes of production, the vital
    importance of this truth is self-evident. 55 If those modes prevailed, involuntary
    poverty would be readily traced either to direct enslavement through ownership
    of Labor, or to indirect enslavement through ownership of Land. 56 There
    could be no other cause. If both causes were absent, every individual might,
    if he wished, enjoy all the Wealth that his own powers were capable of producing
    in 'the primitive modes of production and under the limitations of common
    knowledge that belonged to his environment.57</p>
  <p>But in the civilized state this principle is so entangled in the complexities
    of division of labor and trade as to be almost lost in the maze. Many, even
    of those who recognize it, fail to grasp it as a fundamental truth. Yet it
    is no less vital in civilized than in primitive modes of production.</p>
  <p><strong><em>a. Division of Labor</em></strong></p>
  <p>The essential difference between primitive and civilized modes of production
    is not in the accumulation of capital which characterizes the latter, but
    in the greater scope and minuteness of its division of labor.58 Capital is
    an effect of division of labor rather than a cause. Division of labor, by
    enhancing labor power and relieving man from the perpetual pursuit of mere
    subsistence, utilizes capital and makes civilization possible.59</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">58. It is his failure to realize this that accounts for
        the theory of the socialist that laborers in the civilized state are
        dependent upon accumulated capital as well as upon land for opportunities
        to produce. See ante, note 49, and post, note 81.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">59. Here are two men at a given point. Each has an errand
        to do a mile to the east, and each has one to do a mile to the west.
        If each goes upon his own errand each will travel a mile out and a mile
        back in one direction and the same in the other, making four miles' travel
        apiece, or eight miles in all. But if one does both errands to the east
        and the other does both to the west, they will travel but two miles apiece,
        or four in all. By division of labor they free half their energy and
        half their time for devotion to other work, or to study, or to play,
        as their inclinations dictate.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The productive power of division of labor may be illustrated by considering
    it as a means for utilizing differences of soil and climate. If, for example,
    the soil and the climate of two sections of a country, or of two different
    countries (for the effects of division of labor are not dependent upon political
    geography 60), differ inversely, one being better adapted to the production
    of corn than of sugar, and the other, on the contrary, being better adapted
    to the production of sugar than of corn, they will yield more wealth in corn
    and sugar with division of labor than without it.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">6o. No more than are the effects of a healthful climate.
        Protectionists who argue that there should be free trade between villages,
        cities, counties and states in the same nation, but protection for nations,
        thus making the effect of trade to depend upon the invisible political
        boundary line that separates communities, are like the colored woman
        who, when her house, without being physically removed, had been politically
        shifted from North Carolina to Virginia by a change of the boundary line,
        expressed her satisfaction in the remark that she was very glad of it,
        because she &quot;allus yearn tail dot dat yah Nof Kline was an a'mighty
        sickly State,&quot; and she was glad that she didn't &quot;live dyeah
        no me'!&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us imagine a Mainland and an Island, which, as to the adaptability of
    their soil and climate to the production of corn and sugar, so differ that
    if the people of each should raise their own corn and their own sugar they
    would produce, with a given unit of labor force, but 22 of Wealth &#8212; 11
    in corn and 11 in sugar. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>Production in that manner would ignore the opportunities afforded by nature
    to man for utilizing differences of soil and climate; but by such a wise
    division as Labor would adopt in similar circumstances, if unrestrained,
    the same unit of labor force almost doubles the product. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>Nor is it alone because it utilizes differences of soil and climate that
    division of labor is so effective. Its effectiveness is enhanced in still
    higher degree by its lessening of the labor force necessary to accomplish
    any industrial result, whether in mining, manufacturing, transporting, store-keeping,
    professional employments, agriculture, or the incidental occupations. Minute
    division of labor, instead of accounting for poverty in the civilized state,
    makes it all the more unaccountable. ...</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">65. If every man were obliged, unassisted by the co-operation
        of others, to supply his own needs directly by his own labor, few could
        more than meagerly satisfy even the simplest of those desires which we
        have in common with lower animals. Though each labored diligently the
        aggregate of wealth would be exceedingly small compared with the necessities
        of those who wished to consume it, while in variety it would be very
        limited and in quality of the poorest kind. But by division of labor,
        which has been carried to marvelous lengths and is still developing,
        productive power is so enormously increased that the annual wealth products
        of the present time, in quantity and quality, in variety, usefulness
        and beauty, almost appear to be the work of giants and fairies. </font></p>

  and Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now it is interesting to note that the economic vision presented in the
    bible is not a precursor of communism. Two of the ten commandments explicitly
    support
    the institution of private property, and the prophets consistently railed
    against landlords and rulers who robbed the people of the fruits of their
    labor. The
    laws of Leviticus, which Jesus said he &quot;came not to destroy but to fulfill,&quot; envisioned
    a community in which everyone was secure in his own home and property, &quot;beneath
  his vine and fig tree&quot;. </p>
  <p> (Incidentally, the quote on the American Liberty Bell, from Leviticus,
    chapter 25, was a direct reference to these principles : &quot;Proclaim liberty throughout
    the land and to all the people thereof.&quot; It was a reference to the Jubilee,
    and the freedom it provided was from debt and servitude.)</p>
  <p> The division is clear: there is to be a sacred right of private property
    in the things that are made by people. But people were not to own the things
    that were made by God. The 7th commandment sums up both principles in 4 words: <em>Thou
    shalt not steal</em>.</p>
  <p> Modern society has looked away from these principles, calling them quaint,
    naive, inapplicable to the complexities of our time &#8212; yet, modern society
    finds itself mired in chronic economic and social problems for which it can
    find no solutions &#8212; and which threaten to pull down all the advances
    of civilization into a dark age &#8212; occasioned by some combination of
    war, financial implosion or ecological collapse. </p>
  <p> If there is any way out of this dark future, it can only come by way of solving
    the problem of land and justice. </p>
  <p> Fortunately, there exists a plan for that. </p>
  <p> This plan takes the shape of a &quot;fiscal reform&quot;, because it applies
    a definition of the relationship between the individual and the society that
    is consistent with both economic efficiency and moral law. It calls for us
    to respect the right of labor to create and to save wealth, and we acknowledge
    that the value of land is created not by its &#8220;owners&#8221;, but by
    the entire community. </p>
  <p>Therefore, we will abolish all taxes on income, products and sales &#8212; and
      collect the full rental value of land and other natural resources for public
      revenue.</p>
  <p> What would happen, if we did this? </p>
  <p>Let&#8217;s consider the great problems we were discussing earlier.</p>
  <p> Land in cities would be used efficiently. Cities would not become over-crowded;
    regulation of land use would still be in their power, as it is now. But urban
    blight and decay would be banished. Public transportation, like other public
    services, could be provided free, funded out of the value of locational advantages
    that it created.</p>
  <p> The unnatural pressure on farm land near cities would be eliminated as
    development proceeded to &#8220;infill&#8221;. It would no longer be necessary
    to haul produce halfway across the world. </p>
  <p>Wealth production and employment would be released from the burden of taxation
    that currently weighs it down. The banking system would be freed from its unhealthy
    dependence on land for collateral. Combined with the newly-efficient use of
    urban infrastructure, unemployment could be cut or even eliminated, even while
    inflation decreased!</p>
  <p> But the best benefits of all would be in the developing world. If they
    were charged the market rental value of the land they hold, then neither
    the land-baron
      cronies nor the multinationals would hold onto it. Access to good farmland
      would be restored, and the disastrous migration of peasants to ill-equipped
      poor cities would be reversed. The resulting vitality would bring these
    poor nations new sources of domestic economic strength &#8212; no longer
    would they have to grovel to maintain foreign credit.</p>
  <p> Despite the current flood of bad news on just about every conceivable topic &#8212; and
    although I do accept that many things in my children&#8217;s world will probably
    get worse before they get better &#8212; I am optimistic about our long-term
    prospects. </p>
  <p>Eventually, I believe that human society will adopt the biblical and georgist
    wisdom, and organize itself as it must, to achieve justice, efficiency and
    sustainability. </p>
  <p> Eventually we will have tried everything else. That's how Clarence Darrow &#8212; one
    of the reform's many prominent supporters &#8212; saw things. He said this: &#8220;The &#8220;single
    tax&#8221; is so simple, so fundamental, and so easy to carry into effect
    that I have no doubt that it will be about the last reform the world will
    ever get.
    People in this world are not often logical.&#8221;</p>
  <p> True enough. Yet I have to believe that eventually the obvious truth will
    start to dawn on us. ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read

    using property tax assessments to monitor the economic landscape</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The &#8216;real world&#8217; in which human
society exists is not
confined to natural, physical phenomena. From earliest times, human
beings have interacted socially and economically. As they do so, they
have specialised and traded in goods and services which are the
products of combinations of labour, capital, enterprise and the
fourth &#8211; often forgotten but distinct &#8211; factor of all production:
land.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land comprises all natural
resources, not just &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">terra
firma</span>.&#8217; It is the universe minus man&#8217;s products. Even the
simplest of human activities, sleep, requires each of us to occupy
exclusively a space, a location, preferably a bed in a home of our
own. But that word &#8216;own&#8217; conjures emotions and political
postures.<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Property taxes have always been a
major source of revenue for
governments, especially local governments. Their relative importance
declined around a hundred years ago, as classical economic theory was
eclipsed by the still ruling neo-liberal or Washington orthodoxy and
&#8211; for some seventy years &#8211; its formidable challenger
Marxist socialism. Both Marxist and neo-liberal economists share the
view that land is neither a factor distinct from capital nor
important in an industrial age.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land conjures up visions of
rolling prairies or Constable
landscapes, not skyscrapers or dark Satanic mills. Land reform was
indeed characterised during the latter half of the nineteenth and
early twentieth century in much of the now developed world by massive
increases in landless rural and urban poor, as economies switched
from subsistence agriculture to industrialised farming and then
manufacturing. It also invariably incorporated calls for
registration, sub-division and taxation of land. Henry George&#8217;s
book <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b> </a>massively
out-sold Marx&#8217;
<b><i>Das Capital</i></b> and policies based on his Single Tax (on
land values) achieved remarkable results as far apart as China,
Japan, Chile, Australia, Denmark and the USA (Andelson, 2000).
Between 1915 and 1975 the use of LVT was generally in steep decline,
although many local jurisdictions that were given the choice to adopt
it continued to do so. Taxes based on land-and-buildings, typically
like the British rating system, also declined in relative importance.
Nevertheless the vast majority of developed countries continue to
value property for tax purposes and many assess land/site values
separately from building values, even where they do not levy a land
tax at a separate rate. There is some evidence that, with the
collapse of Communism and the globalisation of capitalism, the
importance of land as a source of public revenue may be increasing.
This is because most other taxable entities are mobile and can with
increasing ease escape the grasp of national &#8211; let alone local
&#8211; treasuries. Location is local: it cannot be moved, hence a tax
on the economic rent of land and other fixed natural resources cannot
be evaded. Nor can it be passed on, as are taxes on wages and
profits, to the consumer via the supply chain, thus adding to
inflation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Rent will remain with the owner
unless and until recovered for
the community that created it, through taxation. On the other hand,
economies competing for the active agents of production &#8211;
capital and labour &#8211; are engaged in a &#8216;race to the
bottom&#8217; of lower tax rates on corporations and high-paid
individuals.</b> Governments wishing to invest in public services are
finding the most secure source of revenue is the property tax. And
within the range of possible property taxes, studies have shown that
cities which shift taxes off buildings onto land values out-compete
those who do not (Plassman &amp; Tideman, 1999; Hartzok, 1997).

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What gives to the Irish Land
Question its supreme significance is
that it brings into attention and discussion &#8211; nay, that it forces
into attention and discussion, not a mere Irish question, but a
question of world-wide importance.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What has brought the land
question to the front in Ireland, what
permits the relation between land and labor to be seen there with
such distinctness &#8211; to be seen even by those who cannot in other
places perceive them &#8211; is certain special conditions. Ireland is a
country of dense population, so that competition for the use of land
is so sharp and high as to produce marked effects upon the
distribution of wealth. It is mainly an agricultural country so that
production is concerned directly and unmistakably with the soil. Its
industrial organization is largely that simple one in which an
employing capitalist does not mind between laborer and landowner, so
that the connection between rent and wages is not obscured. Ireland,
moreover, was never conquered by the Romans, nor, until comparatively
recently, by any people who had felt in their legal system the effect
of Roman domination. It is the European country in which primitive
ideas as to land tenures have longest held their sway, and the
circumstances of its conquest, its cruel misgovernment, and the
differences of race and religion between the masses of the people and
those among whom the land was parceled, have tended to preserve old
traditions and to direct the strength of Irish feeling and the fervor
of Irish imagination against a system which forces the descendant of
the ancient possessors of the soil to pay tribute for it to the
representative of a hated stranger. It is for these reasons that the
connection between Irish distress and Irish landlordism is so easily
seen and readily realized.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But does not the same relation
exist between English pauperism and
English landlordism &#8211; between American tramps and the American
land system? Essentially the same land system as that of Ireland
exists elsewhere, and, wherever it exists, distress of essentially
the same kind is to be seen. And elsewhere, just as certainly as in
Ireland, is the connection between the two that of cause and
effect.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>When the agent of the Irish
landlord takes from the Irish cottier
for rent his pigs, his poultry, or his potatoes, or the money that he
gains by the sale of these things, it is clear enough that this rent
comes from the earnings of labor, and diminishes what the laborer
gets.</strong> <span style="font-weight: bold;">But is not this in reality just
as clear when a dozen middlemen
stand between laborer and landlord?</span> Is it not just as clear
when,
instead of being paid monthly or quarterly or yearly, rent is paid in
a lumped sum called purchase-money? Whence come the incomes which the
owners of land in mining districts, in manufacturing districts, or in
commercial districts, receive for the use of their land? Manifestly,
they must come from the earnings of labor &#8211; there is no other
source from which they can come. From what are the revenues of
Trinity Church corporation drawn, if not from the earnings of labor?
What is the source of the income of the Astors, if it is not the
labor of laboring-men, women, and children?<strong> When a man makes a
fortune by the rise of real estate, as in New York and elsewhere many
men have done within the past few months, what does it mean? It means
that he may have fine clothes, costly food, a grand house luxuriously
furnished, etc. Now, these things are not the spontaneous fruits of
the soil; neither do they fall from heaven, nor are they cast up by
the sea. They are products of labor &#8211; can be produced only by
labor. And hence, if men who do no labor get them, it must
necessarily be at the expense of those who do labor.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It may seem as if I were
needlessly dwelling upon a truth apparent
by mere statement. Yet, simple as this truth is, it is persistently
ignored. This is the reason that the true relation and true
importance of the question which has come to the front in Ireland are
so little realized.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">I
merely wish to correct that impression which leads so many people to
talk and write as though rent and land tenures related solely to
agriculture and to agricultural communities. Nothing could be more
erroneous. Land is necessary to all production, no matter what be the
kind or form; land is the standing-place, the workshop, the
storehouse of labor; it is to the human being the only means by which
he can obtain access to the material universe or utilize its powers.
Without land man cannot exist. To whom the ownership of land is
given, to him is given the virtual ownership of the men who must live
upon it. </span>When this necessity is absolute, then does he
necessarily
become their absolute master. And just as this point is
neared &#8211; that is to say, just as competition increases the demand
for land &#8211; just in that degree does the power of taking a larger
and larger share of the earnings of labor increase. It is this power
that gives land its value; this is the power that enables the owner
of valuable land to reap where he has not sown&#8211;to appropriate to
himself wealth which he has had no share in producing. Rent is always
the devourer of wages. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The owner of
city land takes, in the rents he
receives for his land, the earnings of labor just as clearly as does
the owner of farming land. And whether he be working in a garret ten
stories above the street, or in a mining drift thousands of feet
below the earth's surface, it is the competition for the use of land
that ultimately determines what proportion of the produce of his
labor the laborer will get for himself.</span> This is the reason why
modern
progress does not tend to extirpate poverty; this is the reason why,
with all the inventions and improvements and economies which so
enormously increase productive power, wages everywhere tend to the
minimum of a bare living. The cause that in Ireland produces poverty
and distress &#8211; the ownership by some of the people of the land on
which and from which the whole people must live &#8211; everywhere else
produces the same results. It is this that produces the hideous
squalor of London and Glasgow slums; it is this that makes want
jostle luxury in the streets of rich New York, that forces little
children to monotonous and stunting toil in Massachusetts mills, and
that fills the highways of our newest States with tramps. ...<a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html"> <span

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The premises of discourse</strong></p>
  <p>What is most called for today is a return to basic analysis. Elementary economics
      starts with the recognition that there are three factors of production in the
      creation of social wealth. Each of those factors are mutually exclusive and,
      taken together, are jointly exhaustive of all sources of market value. The
      first of these is what classical economics from Adam Smith on called land.
      Land meant every aspect of nature to which industry can be applied; it meant
      not just locations of space but air, water, and mineral wealth. Today sunlight,
      radio waves, and even time, on occasion, would be added. The second factor
      of production is labor, referring quite simply to the effort applied by people's
      minds or bodies to land. The third factor is the product of past application
      of land and labor to current production: capital. Each factor in classical
      economics has its price, the product of which is the creation of wealth as
      we commonly understand it. The price of labor is wages; the price of capital
      is interest, and the price of land is rent. Rent, as understood in economics,
      is not payment for the use of property owned by others; it has, rather, a more
      technical meaning, one which will require greater explication below.</p>
  <p>We have largely lost sight of these basic premises of economic thought,
    and it has led to our general inability to address the urban challenge of
    taxation
      with a perspective that offers an easy solution. Returning to these fundamental
      building blocks makes things much simpler and more comprehensible. Labor
    continues to be easily understood; its meaning has not changed in the course
    of a shift
      from classical to neoclassical economic thought. But capital, which had
    earlier encompassed only those creations that were the result of human enterprise&#8212; the
      product of labor and land, has now been redefined to include land. Land
    by itself in contemporary neoclassical economics has dropped out of the equation
      altogether, and so for the most part has the concept of economic rent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4] </em></strong></font>Mathematical
      formulas in neoclassical economics are entirely changed.</p>
  <p>There is good reason, however, to recover the use of the terms land and
      rent as they were employed in 19th century classical economics: rent is the
      surplus
        produced by the collective enterprise that can provide the necessary revenue
        to easily support public services, if it were only collected in the form
      of taxes.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5]</em></strong></font> In fact, by
      shifting taxes off labor and capital and onto land rent, the performance
      of markets
        would be made fully efficient and would be essentially painless to taxpayers.
        This is the thesis I am arguing here, and which is now possible to demonstrate
        with the advent of computer power and available data. It amplifies and
      validates what has been for a century only a plausible theoretical claim.
      We can now
        show that collecting economic rent can provide for all the services demanded
        of cities and avail themselves of the proper tax base that exceeds all
      others.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> And
        unlike other taxes there is no downside impact; in fact it's positive.
      Economic rent is the surplus created by the community, and it circulates
      through the
        markets until it ultimately comes to settle on land sites<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[7] </em></strong></font>The
        result of its accretion to land sites is to raise their market price. Economic
        rent is sometimes called land rent or ground rent for this reason, and
        comes about not through any titleholder's individual enterprise but by
        the consequence
        rather of society's collective effort. British political economist David
        Ricardo first conceived of land rent in terms of its relationship to agricultural
        production
        in the early 1800s, but its applicability today is understood far more
        easily with regard to the site values in cities. <strong>Whereas ground
        rent to Ricardo reflected the differential gifts of nature inherent in
        various land sites, it is today
        better understood as reflective of locational differentials in the capacities
        of communities. </strong>... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent becomes critically
important in Georgist economics,
because rent is the increment of market gain that accrues to choice
land parcels. This insight arose originally in the context of
agricultural societies, where differential qualities of land were
recognized by varied payment in rent. An individual&#8217;s return on
investment was represented by his labor &#8212; that was his and his alone to
keep. So also were whatever capital goods he acquired through the
efforts of his past labor. On the other hand, whenever land offered a
higher yield separate from whatever the individual&#8217;s labor investment
might represent, this constituted a windfall gain above and beyond what
might be minimally expected. This is land rent, and it exists even if
it isn&#8217;t collected. Today, as earlier noted, the greatest land rents
derive from their location, grown out of nearby social investment.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The concept of rent needs further explication precisely because
it is
so foreign to 20th century students, even those who have been schooled
in economics at it is currently taught. Land rent has no relationship
to the word rent as it is used in contemporary vernacular, that is,
when one rents a car or an apartment. Rather, rent is a surplus,
defined as the return on investment above and beyond what is minimally
required to bring a service into production. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To take just an elementary example,
consider that there are three parcels of land available for farming and
three farmers of equal ability and enterprise.</span> But suppose the
parcels differ in their productive capacity, due perhaps to their
fertility, access to water, and so on. If planted with similar quality
seed, the three parcels will yield different quantities of harvest, the
one with the highest quality land having the best return. The one with
the lowest quality land would in like fashion have the&nbsp;lowest
return. Economic rent is defined as the amount of surplus harvest
qualitatively measured by the difference between the parcel with the
highest return and that with the lowest return. ... <a

pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as

and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This

rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential

developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus

claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>SUMMARY</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For hundreds of years property's
value has been calculated by
discounting its flow of rental income at the going rate of interest.
The lower the interest rate, the higher the price a given rental
stream will justify -- or as property owners express it, the more
years' rent a property will bring. What is so striking about land
values today is that they are rising for reasons independent of their
earnings stream. The major new consideration is their prospect for
future "capital" (that is, land-price) gains. In sum, the ultimate
aim of real estate investors no longer is so much to seek income --
most of which is pledged to their bankers as interest payments on the
property they acquire -- as much as to seek property gains.
Politically opportunites abound. <b>Merely changing zoning in New
York City in the 1980s to allow using commercial loft spaces for
residential purposes had the effect of multiplying asset values five
or tenfold.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whether the gains come from
selling the property or from borrowing
more money against it, the essential phenomenon is the rapid growth
in asset values and real estate's uniquely favored tax treatment.
That's why investors choose real estate instead of bonds or stocks,
and much of the strategy underlying corporate takeovers has followed
the strategies they developed over the past half century.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nationwide the capital-gains
dimension needs to be incorporated
into the rental revenue statistics to measure real estate's total
returns. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This sector's
nearly complete success in escaping the tax
collector has placed an enormous tax burden on everyone else.</span></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George is largely remembered for
the single tax. But the single
tax came at the end of a long trail as a means -- <i>the</i> means,
he said -- by which to remedy ills previously identified and
diagnosed. Behind the single tax lay a closely knit system of
thought. To understand George, it is necessary to go behind the
single tax and explore that system for its major characteristics.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Notable in George's work is the
emphasis he laid on the relation
of man to the earth. "The most important of all the material
relations of man is his relation to the planet he inhabits."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George might well be called a land
economist, indeed, the foremost
land economist. For George, the basic fact of man's physical
existence is that he is a land animal, "who can live only on and from
land, and can use other elements, such as air, sunshine and water,
only by the use of land."&nbsp; "Without either of
the three elements, land, air and water, man could not exist; but he
is peculiarly a land animal, living on its surface, and drawing from
it his supplies."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So man not only lives off land,
levying on it for its materials
and forces, but he also lives on land. His very life depends on land.
". ..land is the habitation of man, the store-house upon which he
must draw for all his needs, the material to which his labor must be
applied for the supply of all his desires; for even the products of
the sea cannot be taken, the light of the sun enjoyed, or any of the
forces of nature utilized, without the use of land or its products.
On the land we are born, from it we live, to it we return again -
children of the soil as truly as is the blade of grass or the flower
of the field. Take away from man all that belongs to land, and he is
but a disembodied spirit."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land and man, in that order! These
two things are the
fundamentals. They are, for instance, the fundamentals of production.
It is said that without labor, certainly, there can be no production.
Similarly, without land, clearly there can be no agricultural
production or mining production. It was just as clear to George that
there could be no production of any kind without land. There could be
no factory production, no trade, no services rendered, and none of
the multitudinous operations of town and city. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All these processes require land:
a place, a spot, a site, a
location, so many acres or square feet of the earth's surface on
which to be performed. "In every form ...the exertion of human labor
in the production of wealth requires space; not merely standing or
resting space, but moving space -- space for the movements of the
human body and its organs, space for the storage and changing in
place of materials and tools and products. This is as true of the
tailor, the carpenter, the machinist, the merchant or the clerk, as
of the farmer or stock-grower, or of the fisherman or miner."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The office building, the store,
the bank, as well as the factory,
need land just as do the farm and mine. Land is needed as sites on
which to build structures. Likewise, businesses need land as the
locations on which to perform their subsequent operations. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George adds: "But it may be said,
as I have often heard it said,
'We do not all want land! We cannot all become farmers!' To this I
reply that we do all want land, though it may be in different ways
and in varying degrees. Without land no human being can live; without
land no human occupation can be carried on. Agriculture is not the
only use of land. It is only one of many. And just as the uppermost
story of the tallest building rests upon land as truly as the lowest,
so is the operative as truly a user of land as is the farmer. As all
wealth is in the last analysis the resultant of land and labor, so is
all production in the last analysis the expenditure of labor upon
land."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The railroad needs land, not just
for its terminals and depots but
for its very roadbeds; whoever uses the railroad uses the land that
the railroad occupies, as well as the improvements the railroad
affords. The State needs land not only for parks and reservoirs but
for schools and courts, for hospitals and prisons, and for roads and
highways with which to link its residents together. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our homes require land, whether
the home is a country estate, a
city apartment, or a room in hotel or tenement. Our diversions
require land, whether for a ride in the country, a round on the golf
course, a seat at the theatre, or a chair in the library or before
the television set. "Physically we are air-breathing, light-requiring
land animals, who for our existence and all our production require
place on the dry surface of our globe. And the fundamental perception
of the concept land -- whether in the wider use of the word as that
term of political economy signifying all that external nature offers
to the use of man, or in the narrower sense which the word usually
bears in common speech, where it signifies the solid surface of the
earth -- is that of extension; that of affording standing-place or
room." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In George's view, man's dependence
on land is universal and
endless, "...for land is the indispensible prerequisite to life."&nbsp;
"What is inexplicable, if we lose sight of
man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear when we
recognize it."</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Here then is the main element,
the distinctive characteristic, of
George's work. In George's view, man's relation to the earth is his
primary material relation. All other influences, therefore, must be
appraised as to how they affect, or are affected by, this basic
relation. It is perhaps this to which Soule refers when he says, of
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>, "This book expounded a theory
developed with superb logic."&nbsp;</small><small>...<a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"> <span

<blockquote>
  <p>An illustration has already been given of the case of a piece of farm land.
      Let us take an example in a large city. Let us take a corner lot centrally
      located in New York City, the title to which lot is held by, say, Mr. John
      William Rhinelastor. This lot was a part of an old Dutch farm, and is an heirloom.
      It did not cost the present owner anything, nor his father nor his grandfather.
      There is a little old building on it, which has always been rented at a figure
      ten times as large as the taxes imposed, so that the owner has been handsomely
      subsidized each year for storing his title-deeds during a period of the city's
      growth in which the increase in population and the expenditure of public money
      in that neighborhood have raised the value of this corner location to, say,
      two hundred times its early value.</p>
  <p>About now, Mr. Rhinelastor decides that he will go abroad to live, and can't
      be bothered with this piece of property. But knowing that the pressure of population
      is sure to increase and that the expenditure of public money to the benefit
      of this land must continue, he will not sell it. So he gives a twenty-one year
      lease to the corner for, say, $20,000 a year net, with a privilege to the lessee
      of renewals at advancing figures. The lessee agrees to pay all taxes.</p>
  <p>Now what is this net $20,000 a year, which will be regularly remitted to
    Mr. Rhinelastor, in Europe or wherever he may be, given in payment for? Not
    for
      the old building &#8212; the first thing the lessee does is to pull it down.
      Not for the land itself &#8212; it is all rock, which has got to be blasted
      out as part of its improvement.</p>
  <p>Clearly it is paid for a location or site value, which the community, and
      the community only, has built up and paid for. In other words, the present
      $20,000 rental, and the larger one which that location will command in later
      years, is strictly a community product, and as such belongs to the community
      and not to Mr. Rhinelastor.</p>
  <p>That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
      that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
      give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
      have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
      render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
      of public or
      private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we
      call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
      results.</p>
  <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
      the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year to
      its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would become of
      taxation,
      with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and

    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land is the most basic of all economic resources, fundamental to the form
    that economic development takes. Its use for agricultural purposes is integral
    to the production of the means of our subsistence. <strong>Its use in an
    urban context is crucial in shaping how effectively cities function and who
    gets the principal
    benefits from urban economic growth.</strong> Its ownership is a major determinant
    of the degree of economic inequality: surges of land prices, such as have
    occurred in Australian cities during the last decade, cause major redistributions
    of wealth. In both an urban and rural context the use of land &#8211; and
    nature more generally &#8211; is central to the possibility of ecological
    sustainability. Contemporary social concerns about problems of housing affordability
    and environmental quality necessarily focus our attention on &#8216;the land
    question.&#8217;</p>
  <p>These considerations indicate the need for a coherent political economic
    analysis of land in capitalist society. Indeed, the analysis of land was
    central in an earlier era of political economic analysis. The role of land
    in relation to economic production, income distribution and economic growth
    was a major concern for classical political economists, such as Smith, Ricardo
    and Malthus. But the intervening years have seen land slide into a more peripheral
    status within economic analysis. Political economists working in the Marxian
    tradition have tended to focus primarily on the capital-labour relation as
    the key to understanding the capitalist economy. Neo-classical economists
    typically treat land, if they acknowledge it at all, as a &#8216;factor of
    production&#8217; equivalent to labour or capital, thereby obscuring its
    distinctive features and differences. Keynesian and post-Keynesian economists
    have also given little attention to land because typically their analyses
    focus more on consumption, saving, investment and other economic aggregates.<br>
    <br>
    However, there is an alternative current of political economic thought for
      which &#8216;the land question&#8217; is central. This is the tradition
      based on the ideas of Henry George. This article seeks a balanced assessment
      of the usefulness of George&#8217;s ideas in the modern context. It outlines
      how insights derived from Georgist thinking can help in dealing with contemporary
      economic, social and environmental problems, while noting deficiencies
      and additional concerns. Following a general summary of Georgist ideas
      and policy proposals, six themes are addressed:</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li> the moral issue,</li>
      <li> wealth inequality,</li>
      <li> housing affordability,</li>
      <li> environmental concerns,</li>
      <li> urban development and</li>
      <li> economic cycles.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
      <p>In each case it is argued that Georgist insights provide a valuable
        but incomplete basis for analysis and policy. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>
