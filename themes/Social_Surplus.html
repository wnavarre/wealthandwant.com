<blockquote>
  <p>The combined effects of our individual efforts produce more than the sum
    of the parts. Here's the big question: <em>Who is entitled to the difference
    between the sum of the parts and
  the total? </em>All of us? Some of us? One major  reason that wealth and income
  are becoming increasingly concentrated in a relative few of us is that our
  current
  ststem
  of taxation &#8212; what
    we tax and, more important, what we don't tax &#8212; allows certain segments
    of our population to privatize that difference, the social surplus.</p>
  <p>The social surplus can either continue to go into private pockets -- or corporate
    pockets, which works out to be the same thing -- or it can be collected as
    our common treasure, and used to fund our common spending. Which approach do
    you think better serves the common good? Which approach do you think better
    serves
    justice
    and
  equality? </p>
  <p>Fortunately, fixing this is not all that complicated. That's what <a href="About_HG.html">Henry
      George</a>  laid out in <em><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em>.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? Is it not a plain promise that if Rent be treated
    as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical
abuse of land is less a problem, actually, than the fall of
value that results from social decay.&nbsp; Much of land value is a
social product.</span>&nbsp; When a society sickens, declines, and
self-destructs, as we know may happen, it lowers ground rents, which
mirror social progress and decay.&nbsp; We cannot surely forecast that
our own society will not self-destruct, as parts of cities already
have.&nbsp; However, until it does, land will outlast capital
economically.&nbsp; Even when it does, landownership may remain the
last
bastion, as happened in the feudal system.&nbsp; Even if barbarians
overrun us, it is the land they will take: little else will
remain. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Usually the given flow is steady or seasonal, but not always or
necessarily.&nbsp; Seasons change, climates change, environments
change,
blights and pestilences come and go.&nbsp; The essence of land service
flow is<b> </b>not steadiness, but exogeneity.&nbsp; Alfred Marshall
defined the "public value of land" as the product of three
factors exogenous to the private owner: nature, public services, and
spillovers from the use of nearby private land.&nbsp; This
"neoclassical" was classically right on this point (great
economists seldom fit snugly into tight boxes).&nbsp; ... <a

</span>Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Metropolis.html">The
Uncertain Future of the Metropolis</a><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The single element that makes me
apprehensive about the future of our cities is our land system.
Tentacles
of our misguided land policies are choking almost every vital aspect of
metropolitan life. This is doubly worrisome, because the full
dimensions of the land problem have barely surfaced in the public
consciousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To put it in the
vernacular, most of us don't know what's eating us. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have scarcely begun to identify the causes of today's city
land
problems. This is not to denigrate the legions of good folk --
officials and citizens alike -- who are trying desperately to cope with
the daily disasters. But without a better notion of what is producing
these disasters, we are unlikely to stem the flood.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A major problem, certainly, is
our
distorted land system that operates around the clock and around the
calendar, and under the full sanction of the law. It rips off the poor,
saps small business, and deprives municipalities of their rightful
revenue.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The people as a whole create
land
values, not only by their presence, but also through participation in
government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Decade after decade, billions of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
landlord-dominated society. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Before that happens, the opportunity
awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>
