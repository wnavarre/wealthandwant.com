  <p>It may seem that our current way of doing things works moderately well for
      the elderly, particularly those who were able to buy a home early in their
      adulthood. But it clearly is not working well for our young people, and the
      problem is getting progressively worse. If the reasons for this are not obvious
      to you, go take a look at <em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em>. What most surprised me when I
      read it was that, 125 years ago, Henry George had already been able to see
      the precursors of the most serious social and economic problems we face today,
      and that they were serious enough by that time to merit determined study. He
      begins the book by asking what Benjamin Franklin would have expected America
      to look like after 100 years of technological progress. Could he have imagined
      that with all the technological advances that had taken place, there would
      be such great poverty in America?</p>
  <p>Consider the technological advances that have occurred since 1880. Should
      we have poverty in America in the early 21st century?</p>
  <p>Now look ahead 50 or 100 years. What sort of world do you want all our grandchildren
      and their grandchildren to live in? What are <em>you</em> going to do to transform
      our society, to create a level playing field? If you don't already know, read
      widely on this site, and see if you share George's vision. He dedicated <em><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress
      and Poverty</a></em> &quot;to those who, seeing the vice and misery that spring
      from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege, feel the possibility
      of a
      higher social state and would strive for its attainment.&quot;</p>

   Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">A little Island or a little World</span><a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"></a></p>
  <p>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world swimming
    in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings. Let them divide
    the land, share and share alike, as individual property. At first,
    while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and
    primitive, this will work well enough.</p>
  <p>Turn away the eyes of the mind for a moment, let time pass, and
    look again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly
    multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased, and
    even supposing there have been no important inventions or
    improvements in the productive arts, the increase in population, by
    causing the division of labor, will have made industry more complex.
    During this time some of these people will have been careless,
    generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some
    of them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how
    they themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to
    inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond
    their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
    pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
    trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
    fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many
    things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
    happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others
    again will have devoted all their energies to the extending of their
    possessions. What, then, shall we see, land having been all this time
    treated as private property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive
    equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more
    than one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very
    many will have no land at all. Suppose that, in all things save this,
    our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are
    no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
    taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency;
    imagine, if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is
    utterly abolished; yet inequality in the ownership of land will have
    produced poverty and virtual slavery.</p>
  <p>For the people we have supposed are human beings &#8211; that is to
    say, in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can
    live only on land and by the aid of the products of land. They may
    make machines which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps
    to fly in the air, but to build and equip these machines they must
    have land and the products of land, and must constantly come back to
    land. Therefore those who own the land must be the masters of the
    rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land, he is their
    absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the land
    only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
    land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as
    his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in
    everything as he wills.</p>
  <p>If, however, the concentration of landownership has not gone so
    far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
    land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is
    competition between them as well as between those who have only their
    labor &#8211; then the terms on which these non-landholders can live
    will seem more like free contract. But it will not be free contract.
    Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor; labor can
    produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
    factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary
    factors of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts
    as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors of
    these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
    very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have
    his stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but
    labor cannot exist without land. If I own a piece of land, I can let
    it lie idle for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the
    laborer must eat every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the
    making of terms between them, the landowner has an immense advantage
    over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that the intense
    pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
    urged by hunger. And, further than this: As population increases, as
    the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
    are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a
    larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it
    produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
    steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation
    of future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the
    effects of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a
    constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less and less or to
    give more and more (put it which way you please, it amounts to the
    same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity to
    work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our
    little island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some
    of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all
    the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others
    would be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</p>
  <p>But let us introduce another element into the supposition. Let us
    suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the
    steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the
    reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that
    are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</p>
  <p>Manifestly, the effect of all such discoveries and inventions is
    to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the
    same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
    amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen
    the necessity for land. Until we can discover some way of making
    something out of nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as
    to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or
    invention which can lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And,
    this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving devices, land
    being the private property of some, would simply be to increase the
    proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for
    the use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and
    inventions would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more
    dependent.</p>
  <p>And, since we are imagining conditions, imagine laborsaving
    inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to
    perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done
    away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
    to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one
    else. For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they
    continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of
    the landowners!

<blockquote>
  <p>The galleys that carried Caesar to Britain, the accoutrements of his legionaries,
    the baggage that they carried, the arms that they bore, the buildings that
    they erected; the scythed chariots of the ancient Britons, the horses that
    drew them, their wicker boats and wattled houses&#8211;where are they now?
    But the land for which Roman and Briton fought, there it is still. That British
    soil is yet as fresh and as new as it was in the days of the Romans. Generation
    after generation has lived on it since, and generation after generation will
    live on it yet. Now, here is a very great difference. <strong>The right to possess
    and to pass on the ownership of things that in their nature decay and soon
    cease to be is a very different thing from the right to possess and to pass
    on the ownership of that which does not decay, but from which each successive
    generation must live.</strong></p>
  <p>To show how this difference between land and such other species of property
    as are properly styled wealth bears upon the argument for the vested rights
    of landholders, let me illustrate again.</p>
  Captain Kidd was a pirate. He made a business of sailing the seas, capturing
  merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and appropriating their cargoes.
  In this way he accumulated much wealth, which he is thought to have buried.
  But let us suppose, for the sake of the illustration, that he did not bury
  his wealth, but left it to his legal heirs, and they to their heirs and so
  on, until at the present day this wealth or a part of it has come to a great-great-grandson
  of Captain Kidd. Now, let us suppose
that some one &#8211; say a great-great-grandson of one of the shipmasters whom
Captain Kidd plundered, makes complaint, and says: "This man's great-great-grandfather
plundered my great-great-grandfather of certain things or certain sums, which
have been transmitted to him, whereas but for this wrongful act they would have
been transmitted to me; therefore, I demand that he be made to
restore them." What would society answer?<br>
<p>Society, speaking by its proper tribunals, and in accordance with principles
    recognized among all civilized nations, would say: "We cannot entertain such
    a demand. It may be true that Mr. Kidd's great-great-grandfather robbed your
    great-great-grandfather, and that as the result of this wrong he has got things
    that otherwise might have come to you. But we cannot inquire into occurrences
    that happened so long ago. Each generation has enough to do to attend to its
    own affairs. If we go to righting the wrongs and reopening the controversies
    of our great-great-grandfathers, there will be endless disputes and pretexts
    for dispute. What you say may be true, but somewhere we must draw the line,
    and have an end to strife. Though this man's great-great-grandfather may have
    robbed your great-great-grandfather, he has not robbed you. He came into possession
    of these things peacefully, and has held them peacefully, and we must take
    this peaceful possession, when it has been continued for a certain time, as
    absolute evidence of just title; for, were we not to do that, there would be
  no end to dispute and no secure possession of anything."</p>
<p>Now, it is this common-sense principle that is expressed in the statute of
    limitations &#8211; in the doctrine of vested rights.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> This is the reason why it is held &#8211; and as
    to most things held justly&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8211; that peaceable possession for
  a certain time cures all defects of title.</span></p>
<p>But let us pursue the illustration a little further:</p>
<p>Let us suppose that Captain Kidd, having established a large and profitable
    piratical business, left it to his son, and he to his son, and so on, until
    the great-great-grandson, who now pursues it, has come to consider it the most
    natural thing in the world that his ships should roam the sea, capturing peaceful
    merchantmen, making their crews walk the plank, and bringing home to him much
    plunder, whereby he is enabled, though he does no work at all, to live in very
    great luxury, and look down with contempt upon people who have to work. But
    at last, let us suppose, the merchants get tired of having their ships sunk
    and their goods taken, and sailors get tired of trembling for their lives every
    time a sail lifts above the horizon, and they demand of society that piracy
  be stopped.</p>
<p>Now, what should society say if Mr. Kidd got indignant, appealed to the doctrine
    of vested rights, and asserted that society was bound to prevent any interference
    with the business that he had inherited, and that, if it wanted him to stop,
    it must buy him out, paying him all that his business was worth&#8211;that
    is to say, at least as much as he could make in twenty years' successful pirating,
    so that if he stopped pirating he could still continue to live in luxury off
  of the profits of the merchants and the earnings of the sailors?</p>
<p>What ought society to say to such a claim as this? There will be but one answer.
    We will all say that society should tell Mr. Kidd that his was a business to
    which the statute of limitations and the doctrine of vested rights did not
    apply; that because his father, and his grandfather, and his great- and great-great-grandfather
    pursued the business of capturing ships and making their crews walk the plank,
    was no reason why lie should be permitted to pursue it. Society, we will all
    agree, ought to say he would have to stop piracy and stop it at once, and that
  without getting a cent for stopping.</p>
<p>Or supposing it had happened that Mr. Kidd had sold out his piratical business
    to Smith, Jones, or Robinson, we will all agree that society ought to say that
  their purchase of the business gave them no greater right than Mr. Kidd had.</p>
<p>We will all agree that that is what society ought to say. Observe, I do not
  ask what society would say.</p>
<p>For, ridiculous and preposterous as it may appear, I am satisfied that, under
    the circumstances I have supposed, society would not for a long time say what
    we have agreed it ought to say. Not only would all the Kidds loudly claim that
    to make them give up their business without full recompense would be a wicked
    interference with vested rights, but the justice of this claim would at first
    be assumed as a matter of course by all or nearly all the influential classes&#8211;the
    great lawyers, the able journalists, the writers for the magazines, the eloquent
    clergymen, and the principal professors in the principal universities. Nay,
    even the merchants and sailors, when they first began to complain, would be
    so tyrannized and browbeaten by this public opinion that they would hardly
    think of more than of buying out the Kidds, and, wherever here and there any
    one dared to raise his voice in favor of stopping piracy at once and without
    compensation, he would only do so under penalty of being stigmatized as a reckless
  disturber and wicked foe of social order.</p>
<p>If any one denies this, if any one says mankind are not such fools, then I
  appeal to universal history to bear me witness. I appeal to the facts of to-day.</p>
<p>Show me a wrong, no matter how monstrous, that ever yet, among any people,
    became ingrafted in the social system, and I will prove to you the truth of
  what I say. ...</p>
<p>What is the slave-trade but piracy of the worst kind? Yet it is not long since
    the slave-trade was looked upon as a perfectly respectable business, affording
    as legitimate an opening for the investment of capital and the display of enterprise
    as any other. The proposition to prohibit it was first looked upon as ridiculous,
    then as fanatical, then as wicked. It was only slowly and by hard fighting
    that the truth in regard to it gained ground. Does not our very Constitution
    bear witness to what I say? Does not the fundamental law of the nation, adopted
    twelve years after the enunciation of the Declaration of Independence, declare
    that for twenty years the slave-trade shall not be prohibited nor restricted?
    Such dominion had the idea of vested interests over the minds of those who
    had already proclaimed the inalienable right of man to life, liberty, and the
    pursuit of happiness! ... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/09_Distinguishing.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    Chapter 9. Alleged Difficulty of Distinguishing Land From Improvements</a> (in
    the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    VIII &#8212; Application of the Remedy: Chapter 4 &#8212;<font size="-1"> </font>Indorsements
    and objections </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The only objection to the tax on rent or land values which is to be met
    with in standard politico-economic works is one which concedes its advantages &#8212; for
    it is, that from the difficulty of separation, we might, in taxing the rent
    of land, tax something else. McCulloch, for instance, declares taxes on the
    rent of land to be impolitic and unjust because the return received for the
    natural and inherent powers of the soil cannot be clearly distinguished from
    the return received from improvements and meliorations, which might thus
    be discouraged. Macaulay somewhere says that if the admission of the attraction
    of gravitation were inimical to any considerable pecuniary interest, there
    would not be wanting arguments against gravitation &#8212; a truth of which
    this objection is an illustration. For admitting that it is impossible invariably
    to separate the value of land from the value of improvements, is this necessity
    of continuing to tax some improvements any reason why we should continue
    to tax all improvements? If it discourage production to tax values which
    labor and capital have intimately combined with that of land, how much greater
    discouragement is involved in taxing not only these, but all the clearly
    distinguishable values which labor and capital create?</p>
  <p>But, as a matter of fact, the value of land can always be readily distinguished
    from the value of improvements.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> In countries like the United States there is much valuable land that
      has never been improved; and in many of the States the value of the land
      and the value of improvements are habitually estimated separately by the
      assessors, though afterward reunited under the term real estate.</li>
    <li> Nor where ground has been occupied from immemorial times, is there any
      difficulty in getting at the value of the bare land, for frequently the
      land is owned by one person and the buildings by another, and when a fire
      occurs and improvements are destroyed, a clear and definite value remains
      in the land.</li>
    <li> In the oldest country in the world no difficulty whatever can attend
      the separation, if all that be attempted is to separate the value of the
      clearly distinguishable improvements, made within a moderate period, from
      the value of the land, should they be destroyed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This, manifestly, is all that justice or policy requires. Absolute accuracy
    is impossible in any system, and to attempt to separate all that the human
    race has done from what nature originally provided would be as absurd as
    impracticable. A swamp drained or a hill terraced by the Romans constitutes
    now as much a part of the natural advantages of the British Isles as though
    the work had been done by earthquake or glacier. The fact that after a certain
    lapse of time the value of such permanent improvements would be considered
    as having lapsed into that of the land, and would be taxed accordingly, could
    have no deterrent effect on such improvements, for such works are frequently
    undertaken upon leases for years. The fact is, that each generation builds
    and improves for itself, and not for the remote future. And the further fact
    is, that each generation is heir, not only to the natural powers of the earth,
    but to all that remains of the work of past generations. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/09_Distinguishing.htm">read
