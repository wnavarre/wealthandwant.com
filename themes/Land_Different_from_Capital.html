<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;"> 
    <p align="left">Most honors graduates in economics from our best colleges
      and universities would be hard-pressed to tell you that land is not a subset
      of capital. (Even
    the fellow who espouses ESOPs &#8212; employee stock ownership programs &#8212; expressly
    fails to make the distinction.) But Henry George pointed out how different
    land
    (which
    in its
    larger sense
    includes
    the entire natural creation) is from things which are manmade. And therein
    lies the root of some of our most serious social problems.</p>
    </div>
  <p>That sounds so simple that you may doubt its accuracy or the seriousness
    of its effects. I did, and looked for answers everywhere else. Finding none,
    I eventually found my way to these ideas. (<a href="quotable_notables.htm">Clarence

<blockquote>
  <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. <strong>The true
    distinction is between property which is, and property which is not, the
    result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.</strong>    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is such result
    of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. The one is the free gift of Nature, the other
    the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
    while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
    only be preserved by continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive
    possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
    in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
    of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
    are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
    distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
    what should and what should not be taxed. ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    As to the right of ownership, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>Being created individuals, with individual wants and powers, men are individually
    entitled (subject of course to the moral obligations that arise from such
    relations as that of the family) to the use of their own powers and the enjoyment
    of the results. There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its
    validity from the law of God, a right of private ownership in things produced
    by labor &#8212; a right that the possessor may transfer, but of which to
    deprive him without his will is theft.</p>
  <p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to himself,
    is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches to things produced
    by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</p>
  <p>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean he acquires a right of property
    in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or gift. But
    he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that he may
    sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he set up a windmill he acquires a right of property in the things
    such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim a right of property
    in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he cultivate grain he acquires a right of property in the grain his
    labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the
    sun which ripened it or the soil on which it grew. For these things are of
    the continuing gifts of God to all generations of men, which all may use,
    but none may claim as his alone.</p>
  <p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
    justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny the true
    rights of property. For a man who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
    to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
    which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of
    his rightful property and thus robbed. ....</p>
  <p>    God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say those socialists
    referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. ...</p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.)</p>
  <p><strong>2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.</strong>    (6-7.)</p>
  <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason and
    forethought may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the earth, but
    also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he may make provision
    for the future.</p>
  <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing attribute
    of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows, as the Scriptures
    declare, that he is created in the likeness of God. And this gift of reason
    does, as your Holiness points out, involve the need and right of private
    property in whatever is produced by the exertion of reason and its attendant
    forethought, as well as in what is produced by physical labor. In truth,
    these elements of man&#8217;s production are inseparable, and labor involves
    the use of reason. It is by his reason that man differs from the animals
    in being a producer, and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical
    powers are slight, forming as it were but the connection by which the mind
    takes hold of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and
    forces of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
    in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
  <p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach to things
    provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot attach to things
    provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
  <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert as
    the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought to
    provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right of property
    in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless desert those
    who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might ask water from
    the provident in charity, could not demand it in right. For while water itself
    is of the providence of God, the presence of this water in such vessels,
    at such place, results from the providence of the men who carried it. Thus
    they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
  <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
    the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink of the
    water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give any right?</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it is needed,
    but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to defend in defending
    the private ownership of land!</p>
  <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those who
    say that if private property in land be not just, then private property in
    the products of labor is not just, as the material of these products is taken
    from land. It will be seen on consideration that all of man&#8217;s production
    is analogous to such transportation of water as we have supposed. In growing
    grain, or smelting metals, or building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing
    any of the things that constitute producing, all that man does is to change
    in place or form preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer,
    not a creator; God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s
    production consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of
    private ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
    of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production is
    embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the common
    gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir and brought
    into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of the individual who
    by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
  <p>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary possession.
    For though man may take material from the storehouse of nature and change
    it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from the moment he takes it,
    it tends back to that storehouse again. Wood decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates
    and is displaced, while of more perishable products, some will last for only
    a few months, others for only a few days, and some disappear immediately
    on use. Though, so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever
    persists; though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that
    floats in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
    ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining constantly
    passes away. Thus the recognition of the ownership of what natural material
    is embodied in the products of man never constitutes more than temporary
    possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir provided for all.
    As taking water from one place and carrying it to another place by no means
    lessens the store of water, since whether it is drunk or spilled or left
    to evaporate, it must return again to the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is
    it with all things on which man in production can lay the impress of his
    labor.</p>
  <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right to
    have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish in the
    using, but also those that remain for use in the future, you are right in
    so far as you may include such things as buildings, which with repair will
    last for generations, with such things as food or fire-wood, which are destroyed
    in the use. But when you infer that man can have private ownership in those
    permanent things of nature that are the reservoirs from which all must draw,
    you are clearly wrong. Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits
    of the earth produced by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of
    that labor, and pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were
    taken, and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
    he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which must
    constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men can produce,
    but even their very bodies.</p>
  <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth itself
    as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it, is in the
    facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when you truly say:</p>
  <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they demand
    new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse that shall
    never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds only in
    the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
  <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the private
    property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
  <p>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore, owes
    to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you mean God.
    Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred an obligation
    to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail, is the same as is
    thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion by the Bishop of
    Meath:</p>
  <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having created
    us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means necessary for
    our subsistence. The land is the only source of this kind now known to us.
    The land, therefore, of every country is the common property of the people
    of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made it, has transferred
    it as a voluntary gift to them. &#8220;Terram autem dedit filiis hominum.&#8221; Now,
    as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God, and as
    all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land of a
    country that would exclude the humblest man in that country from his share
    of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice and a wrong to that
    man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS
    OF HIS CREATOR. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Believing that the social question is at bottom a religious question, we
    deem it of happy augury to the world that in your Encyclical the most influential
    of all religious teachers has directed attention to the condition of labor.</p>
  <p>But while we appreciate the many wholesome truths you utter, while we feel,
    as all must feel, that you are animated by a desire to help the suffering
    and oppressed, and to put an end to any idea that the church is divorced
    from the aspiration for liberty and progress, yet it is painfully obvious
    to us that <strong>one fatal assumption hides from you the cause of the evils
    you see, and makes it impossible for you to propose any adequate remedy.
    This
    assumption is, that private property in land is of the same nature and has
    the same sanctions as private property in things produced by labor.</strong> In spite
    of its undeniable truths and its benevolent spirit, your Encyclical shows
    you to be involved in such difficulties as a physician called to examine
    one suffering from disease of the stomach would meet should he begin with
    a refusal to consider the stomach.</p>
  <p>Prevented by this assumption from seeing the true cause, the only causes
    you find it possible to assign for the growth of misery and wretchedness
    are the destruction of working-men&#8217;s guilds in the last century, the
    repudiation in public institutions and laws of the ancient religion, rapacious
    usury, the custom of working by contract, and the concentration of trade.

        Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 4: Land
      Speculation Causes Reduced Wages</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whether we formulate it as an extension of the margin of production, or as
      a carrying of the rent line beyond the margin of production, the influence
      of speculation in land in increasing rent is a great fact which cannot be ignored
      in any complete theory of the distribution of wealth in progressive countries.
      It is the force, evolved by material progress, which tends constantly to increase
      rent in a greater ratio than progress increases production, and thus constantly
      tends, as material progress goes on and productive power increases, to reduce
      wages, not merely relatively, but absolutely.</p>
  <p>The cause which limits speculation in commodities, the tendency of increasing
      price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot limit the speculative advance
      in land values, as land is a fixed quantity, which human agency can neither
      increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless a limit to the price of land,
      in the minimum required by labor and capital as the condition of engaging in
      production. If it were possible continuously to reduce wages until zero were
      reached, it would be possible continuously to increase rent until it swallowed
      up the whole produce. But as wages cannot be permanently reduced below the
      point at which laborers will consent to work and reproduce, nor interest below
      the point at which capital will be devoted to production, there is a limit
      which restrains the speculative advance of rent. Hence speculation cannot have
      the same scope to advance rent in countries where wages and interest are already
      near the minimum, as in countries where they are considerably above it. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/04_Land_spec_wages.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

      <p>Poverty deepens as wealth increases, and wages are forced down while
        productive power grows, because land, which is the source of all wealth
        and the field of all labor, is monopolized. To extirpate poverty, to
        make wages what justice commands they should be, the full earnings of
        the laborer, we must therefore substitute for the individual ownership
        of land a common ownership. [footnote omitted]</p>
      <p>This right of ownership that springs from labor excludes the possibility
        of any other right of ownership. If a man be rightfully entitled to the
        produce of his labor, then no one can be rightfully entitled to the ownership
        of anything which is not the produce of his labor, or the labor of some
        one else from whom the right has passed to him. For the right to the
        produce of labor cannot be enjoyed without the right to the free use
        of the opportunities offered by nature, and to admit the right of property
        in these is to deny the right of property in the produce of labor. When
        nonproducers can claim as rent a portion of the wealth created by producers,
        the right of the producers to the fruits of their labor is to that extent
        denied.</p>
      <p>A house and the lot on which it stands are alike property, as being
        the subject of ownership, and are alike classed by the lawyers as real
        estate. Yet in nature and relations they differ widely.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The one is produced by human labor, and belongs to the class in
          political economy styled wealth.</li>
        <li> The other is a part of nature, and belongs to the class in political
          economy styled land.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The essential character of the one class of things is that they embody
        labor, are brought into being by human exertion, their existence or nonexistence,
        their increase or diminution, depending on man. The essential character
        of the other class of things is that they do not embody labor, and exist
        irrespective of human exertion and irrespective of man; they are the
        field or environment in which man finds himself; the storehouse from
        which his needs must be supplied, the raw material upon which and the
        forces with which alone his labor can act.</p>
      <p>The moment this distinction is realized, that moment is it seen that
        the sanction which natural justice gives to one species of property is
        denied to the other. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/06_The_Remedy.htm">read

    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    Chapter 9. Alleged Difficulty of Distinguishing Land From Improvements</a> (in
    the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    VIII &#8212; Application of the Remedy: Chapter 4 &#8212;<font size="-1"> </font>Indorsements
    and objections </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The only objection to the tax on rent or land values which is to be met
    with in standard politico-economic works is one which concedes its advantages &#8212; for
      it is, that from the difficulty of separation, we might, in taxing the rent
      of land, tax something else. McCulloch, for instance, declares taxes on the
      rent of land to be impolitic and unjust because the return received for the
      natural and inherent powers of the soil cannot be clearly distinguished from
      the return received from improvements and meliorations, which might thus be
      discouraged. Macaulay somewhere says that if the admission of the attraction
      of gravitation were inimical to any considerable pecuniary interest, there
      would not be wanting arguments against gravitation &#8212; a truth of which
      this objection is an illustration. For admitting that it is impossible
      invariably to separate the value of land from the value of improvements,
      is this necessity
      of continuing to tax some improvements any reason why we should continue
      to tax all improvements? If it discourage production to tax values which
      labor
      and capital have intimately combined with that of land, how much greater
      discouragement is involved in taxing not only these, but all the clearly
      distinguishable values
      which labor and capital create?</p>
  <p>But, as a matter of fact, the value of land can always be readily distinguished
      from the value of improvements.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> In countries like the United States there is much valuable land that
      has never been improved; and in many of the States the value of the land
      and
          the value of improvements are habitually estimated separately by the
      assessors, though afterward reunited under the term real estate.</li>
    <li> Nor where ground has been occupied from immemorial times, is there any
          difficulty in getting at the value of the bare land, for frequently
      the land is owned by one person and the buildings by another, and when
      a fire occurs
          and improvements are destroyed, a clear and definite value remains
      in the land.</li>
    <li> In the oldest country in the world no difficulty whatever can attend
      the separation, if all that be attempted is to separate the value of the
      clearly
          distinguishable improvements, made within a moderate period, from the
      value of the land, should they be destroyed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This, manifestly, is all that justice or policy requires. Absolute accuracy
      is impossible in any system, and to attempt to separate all that the human
      race has done from what nature originally provided would be as absurd as impracticable.
      A swamp drained or a hill terraced by the Romans constitutes now as much a
      part of the natural advantages of the British Isles as though the work had
      been done by earthquake or glacier. The fact that after a certain lapse of
      time the value of such permanent improvements would be considered as having
      lapsed into that of the land, and would be taxed accordingly, could have no
      deterrent effect on such improvements, for such works are frequently undertaken
      upon leases for years. The fact is, that each generation builds and improves
      for itself, and not for the remote future. And the further fact is, that each
      generation is heir, not only to the natural powers of the earth, but to all
      that remains of the work of past generations. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/09_Distinguishing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The galleys that carried Caesar to
Britain, the accoutrements of
his legionaries, the baggage that they carried, the arms that they
bore, the buildings that they erected; the scythed chariots of the
ancient Britons, the horses that drew them, their wicker boats and
wattled houses&#8211;where are they now? But the land for which Roman
and Briton fought, there it is still. That British soil is yet as
fresh and as new as it was in the days of the Romans. Generation
after generation has lived on it since, and generation after
generation will live on it yet. Now, here is a very great difference.
The right to possess and to pass on the ownership of things that in
their nature decay and soon cease to be is a very different thing
from the right to possess and to pass on the ownership of that which
does not decay, but from which each successive generation must
live.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To show how this difference
between land and such other species of
property as are properly styled wealth bears upon the argument for
the vested rights of landholders, let me illustrate again. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is the point I want to make
clearly and distinctly, for it
shows a distinction that in current thought is overlooked. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Property
in land, like property in slaves, is essentially different from
property in things that are the result of labor. </span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rob a
man or a
people of money, or goods, or cattle, and the robbery is finished
there and then. </span>The lapse of time does not, indeed, change
wrong into
right, but it obliterates the effects of the deed. That is done; it
is over; and, unless it be very soon righted, it glides away into the
past, with the men who were parties to it, so swiftly that nothing
save omniscience can trace its effects; and in attempting to right it
we would be in danger of doing fresh wrong. The past is forever
beyond us. We can neither punish nor recompense the dead. <br>
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">But rob
a
people of the land on which they must live, and the robbery is
continuous.</span> It is a fresh robbery of every succeeding
generation &#8211; a new robbery every year and every day; it is like
the robbery which condemns to slavery the children of the slave. To
apply to it the statute of limitations, to acknowledge for it the
title of prescription, is not to condone the past; it is to legalize
robbery in the present, to justify it in the future. The indictment
which really lies against the Irish landlords is not that their
ancestors, or the ancestors of their grantors, robbed the ancestors
of the Irish people. That makes no difference. "Let the dead bury
their dead." The indictment that truly lies is that here, now, in the
year 1881, they rob the Irish people. And shall we be told that there
can be a vested right to continue such robbery? <strong>...</strong></small></li>
  
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But, if it be denied that land
justly is, or can be, private
property, if the equal rights of the whole people to the use of the
elements gratuitously furnished by Nature be asserted without
drawback or compromise, then the essential difference between
property in land and property in things of human production is at
once brought out. Then will it clearly appear not only that the
denial of the right of individual property in land does not involve
any menace to legitimate property rights, but that the maintenance of
private property in land necessarily involves a denial of the right
to all other property, and that the recognition of the claims of the
landlords means a continuous robbery of capital as well as of
labor.

of all the people that His providence brings into the world. If this be

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Think about what the value of
land is. It has no reference to the
cost of production, as has the value of houses, horses, ships,
clothes, or other things produced by labor, for land is not produced
by man, it was created by God. The value of land does not come from
the exertion of labor on land, for the value thus produced is a value
of improvement. That value attaches to any piece of land means that
that piece of land is more desirable than the land which other
citizens may obtain, and that they are willing to pay a premium for
permission to use it. Justice therefore requires that this premium of
value shall be taken for the benefit of all in order to secure to all
their equal rights.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Consider the difference between
the value of a building and the
value of land</b>. The value of a building, like the value of goods,
or of anything properly styled wealth, is produced by individual
exertion, and therefore properly belongs to the individual; but the
value of land only arises with the growth and improvement of the
community, and therefore properly belongs to the community. It is not
because of what its owners have done, but because of the presence of
the whole great population, that land in New York is worth millions
an acre. This value therefore is the proper fund for defraying the
common expenses of the whole population; and it must be taken for
public use, under penalty of generating land speculation and monopoly
which will bring about artificial scarcity where the Creator has
provided in abundance for all whom His providence has called into
existence.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is thus a violation of justice
to tax labor, or the things
produced by labor, and it is also a violation of justice not to tax

  <p>CAPITAL, which is not in itself a distinguishable element, but which it
    must always be kept in mind consists of wealth applied to the aid of labor
    in further production, is not a primary factor. There can be production without
    it, and there must have been production without it, or it could not in the
    first place have appeared. It is a secondary and compound factor, coming
    after and resulting from the union of labor and land in the production of
    wealth. It is in essence labor raised by a second union with land to a third
    or higher power. But it is to civilized life so necessary and important as
    to be rightfully accorded in political economy the place of a third factor
    in production. &#8212; <em>The

<br>
IT is to be observed that capital of itself can do nothing. It is always a subsidiary,
never an initiatory, factor. The initiatory factor is always labor. That is to
say, in the production of wealth labor always uses capital, is never used by
capital. This is not merely literally true, when by the term capital we mean
the thing capital. It is also true when we personify the term and mean by it
not the thing capital, but the men who are possessed of capital. The capitalist
pure and simple, the man who merely controls capital, has in his hands the power
of assisting labor to produce. But purely as capitalist he cannot exercise that
power. It can be exercised only by labor. To utilize it he must himself exercise
at least some of the functions of labor, or he must put his capital, on some
terms, at the use of those who do. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe317.html">unabridged:

<br>
THUS we must exclude from the category of capital everything that may be included
either as land or labor. Doing so, there remain only things which are neither
land nor labor, but which have resulted from the union of these two original
factors of production. Nothing can be properly capital that does not consist
of these &#8212; that is to say, nothing can be capital that is not wealth. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp012.html"> &#8212; Book

<br>
THUS, a government bond is not capital, nor yet is it the representative of capital.
The capital that was once received for it by the government has been consumed
unproductively &#8212; blown away from the mouths of cannon, used up in war ships,
expended in keeping men marching and drilling, killing and destroying. The bond
cannot represent capital that has been destroyed. It does not represent capital
at all. It is simply a solemn declaration that the government will, some time
or other, take by taxation from the then existing stock of the people, so much
wealth, which it will turn over to the holder of the bond; and that, in the meanwhile,
it will, from time to time, take, in the same way, enough to make up to the holder
the increase which so much capital as it some day promises to give him would
yield him were it actually in his possession. The immense sums which are thus
taken from the produce of every modern country to pay interest on public debts
are not the earnings or increase of capital &#8212; are not really interest in
the strict sense of the term, but are taxes levied on the produce of labor and
capital, leaving so much less for wages and so much less for real interest. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp034.html">&#8212; Book
III, Chapter 4: The Laws of Distribution: Of Spurious Capital and of Profits
Often Mistaken For Interest</a></p>
  <p>CAPITAL, as we have seen, consists of wealth used for the procurement of
    more wealth, as distinguished from wealth used for the direct satisfaction
    of desire; or, as I think it may be defined, of wealth in the course of exchange. <br>
      <br>
  Capital, therefore, increases the power of labor to produce wealth: (1) By
  enabling labor to apply itself in more effective ways, as by digging up clams
  with a spade instead of the hand, or moving a vessel by shoveling coal into
  a furnace, instead of tugging at an oar. (2) By enabling labor to avail itself
  of the reproductive forces of nature, as to obtain corn by sowing it, or animals
  by breeding them. (3) By permitting the division of labor, and thus, on the
  one hand, increasing the efficiency of the human factor of wealth, by the utilization
  of special capabilities, the acquisition of skill, and the reduction of waste;
  and, on the other, calling in the powers of the natural factor at their highest,
  by taking advantage of the diversities of soil, climate and situation, so as
  to obtain each particular species of wealth where nature is most favorable
  to its production. <br>
    <br>
  Capital does not supply the materials which labor works up into wealth, as
  is erroneously taught; the materials of wealth are supplied by nature. But
  such materials partially worked up and in the course of exchange are capital. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html">Progress &amp; Poverty </a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp015.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p><em>Q48. Would you let money escape taxation, and so favor money lenders?</em><br>
A. It is a curious fact that this question is most popular among people who clamor
  for cheap money. How they expect to cheapen money by taxing its lenders on
  their loans is past finding out. To tax money lenders is to discourage money
  lending, and thereby to increase interest on loans. Yes, we should let money
  escape taxation. It escapes taxation now, which in itself is a politic reason
  for exempting it; but we should exempt it (by taxing nothing but land values)
  for the additional and better reason that a man's money is his own and the
  community has no right to it, while a man's land value is the community's and
  the man has no right to it. This would not favor money lenders in any invidious
  sense. It would favor both lenders and borrowers; borrowers by enabling them
  to borrow on easier terms, and lenders by making their loans more secure. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

  <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
    A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
      of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
      is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege.
      Privilege is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for
      and perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding generations.
      Capital is paid for and ephemeral. Privilege is unpaid for and eternal.
      A man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in
      land in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here
      is an instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
      that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</p>

          raft filled with shipwrecked sailors should be floating on the ocean,
    and a few of the strongest and most powerful would take all the raft they
    could
          get and leave the most of the people, especially the ones who did the
    work, hanging to the edges by their eyebrows. These men who have taken possession
          of this raft, this little planet in this endless space, are not even
    content
          with taking all there is and leaving the rest barely enough to hold
    onto, but they think so much of themselves and their brief day that while
    they
          live they must make rules and laws and regulations that parcel out
    the earth for thousands of years after they are dead and, gone, so that their
    descendants
          and others of their kind may do in the tenth generation exactly what
    they are doing today &#8212; keeping the earth and all the good things of
    the earth and compelling the great mass of mankind to toil for them.</p>
  <p>Now, the question is, how are you going to get it back? Everybody who thinks
      knows that private ownership of the land is wrong. If ten thousand men
    can own America, then one man can own it, and if one man may own it he may
    take
      all that the rest produce or he may kill them if he sees fit. It is inconsistent
      with the spirit of manhood. No person who thinks can doubt but that he
    was born upon this planet with the same birthright that came to every man
    born
      like him. And it is for him to defend that birthright. And the man who
    will not defend it, whatever the cost, is fitted only to be a slave. The
    earth belongs
      to the people &#8212; if they can get it &#8212; because if you cannot
      get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or not, and
      if you
      can get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or not,
      you just take it. The earth has been taken from the many by the few. It
      made no
      difference that they had no right to it; they took it.</p>
  <p>Now, there are some methods of getting access to the earth which are easier
      than others. The easiest, perhaps, that has been contrived is by means of taxation
      of the land values and land values alone; and I need only say a little upon
      that question. One trouble with it which makes it almost impossible to achieve,
      is that it is so simple and so easy. You cannot get people to do anything that
      is simple; they want it complex so they can be fooled.</p>
  <p>Now the theory of Henry George and of those who really believe in the common
      ownership of land is that the public should take not alone taxation from
    the land, but the public should take to itself the whole value of the land
    that
      has been created by the public &#8212; should take it all. It should be a part
      of the public wealth, should be used for public improvements, for pensions,
      and belong to the people who create the wealth &#8212; which is a strange doctrine
      in these strange times. It can be done simply and easily; it can be done by
      taxation. All the wealth created by the public could be taken back by the public
      and then poverty would disappear, most of it at least. The method is so simple,
      and so legal even &#8212; sometimes a thing is legal if it is simple &#8212; that
      it is the easiest substantial reform for men to accomplish, and when it
      is done this great problem of poverty, the problem of the ages, will be
      almost
      solved. We may need go farther. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_Land_Belongs.html">read

  <p>Henry George, the eminent social philosopher of a century ago, turned the
    attention of planners and economists, however briefly, to the indefeasible
    factor of land scarcity. Capital and labor can increase; land cannot.</p>
  <p>Accordingly, George was the apostle of the single tax. It aimed most directly
    at land speculators. His insights would focus now on the limitations on the
    use of land imposed by zoning. If John Jones wants an acre protecting his
    house, he is laying claim to something that cannot expand in size. Since
    land, in George's analysis, is forever limited, it must be thought of and
    treated as common property. And therefore the rental value of one acre should
    constitute a tax (the single tax) on the person who sequesters it for himself.</p>
  <p>A strong case can be made for the amenities of zoning laws. But they have
    an effect on the availability of housing, and on its cost. One result is
    that housing costs are increasing faster than inflation.</p>
  <p>But is the Henry George factor likely to be espoused in political platforms?
    It cannot happen soon because too many interests are vested in zoning laws.
    But sharp political eyes should be trained on the question, in search of
    a viable formulation designed to fight against homelessness for grandchildren
    who cannot be expected to pay the projected cost of housing. ... <a href="../docs/Buckley_HDH.htm">read

      Income taxation discourages work, sales and value-added taxes discourage

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is the place to further
examine the three economic factors of
production. An understanding of these economic concepts will not only
give a grounding in economic theory but will enable you to realise how
completely the so-called science of economics has been hijacked and
corrupted by neoclassical economics.</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
LAND</span>
We are putting aside, for the moment, the philosophical thoughts about
owning land to instead look at how land behaves in purely economic
terms. For economic purposes, land has a wider meaning than that which
is usually assigned to it by lay persons. It can be defined as the
available natural resources and forces of nature. Hence land here
includes flora &amp; fauna, rivers &amp; oceans, air, the
electromagnetic spectra and mineral wealth. But "ordinary" land -
loosely regarded as the surface of the earth - has distinctive
features, particularly urban land with its locational value (as opposed
to rural land with a largely agricultural value).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. LABOUR</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. CAPITAL</span> This can be a
confusing term. Capital is defined as the product of the application of
labour to land, or else can be simply understood to be stored-up wealth
or, in a sense, stored-up labour. Capital equipment refers to the
physical articles of material wealth which have been produced, not to
be immediately consumed, but to be used to physically aid in the
production of more material wealth. This excludes pseudo-wealth: those
things described as agreements or contractual securities and
obligations.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE NEOCLASSICAL DISAPPEARING
TRICK</span></small><br>
<small>These 3 factors of production are commonly cited in chapter 1 of
mainstream economic texts, although their definition of land is often
vague. And then - hey, presto! - in chapter 2, land has somehow
disappeared off the radar screen, and we have slipped into labour and
capital as being the only factors of production. The merging of land
into capital is the characteristic sleight of hand of neoclassical
economics. We'll return to this folly later in our critique of
capitalism and socialism.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There are three major differences between land and capital.
Again,
we're not talking about ethics, but about concrete, measurable economic
features. If you ever want a litmus test to determine whether an
economist really knows what he's talking about, just ask him, "What are
the differences in the economic behaviour of land and capital?" If he
seems to be bamboozling you with esoteric jargon, then you can take it
that the guy's a fake, for the differences are clear and quite
distinct, as you will here see.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">AS SIMPLE AS 1 - 2 - 3!</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Land is limited in supply.
Capital is not.</span>
Reread Will Rogers' quote above - they ain't making land any more. Very
important in economic terms, and there are few examples of other things
that are limited in supply. Great works of art by dead painters is one
illustration and, just as art collectors may bid up the price for a
Monet or a van Gogh to ridiculous extremes, so too may land prices
skyrocket. Why did central Tokyo land in the late 1980's hit US$4
billion per acre? Because those requiring it couldn't make their own.
Such behaviour can never occur with capital, because capital can be
created.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This unbreakable bargaining power of land-holders within our
current
economic system is one reason why Geonomists frequently attach the word
"monopolist" to land-holders. To be pedantic but also strictly correct,
we have said that land is "limited" rather than "fixed" in supply
because of the effect of the possibility of land reclamation and
multi-story buildings (not that those possibilities gave much relief in
central Tokyo or elsewhere).</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. There will always be an
irreplaceable human demand for land &#8230;.. while the Law of Gravity
exists, anyway.</span>
You're going to need at least enough land on which to stand, and a bit
more if you can't sleep on your feet. Capital is different because if
the seller of capital asks too high a price from me, then I'll settle
for a different supplier, or a substitute or - failing these options -
simply do without. But I can't do without land (until the dawn of The
Age of the Jetsons). I think I can handle living without an original
Monet or van Gogh in my lounge room.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Combine the limited supply of land with a never-ending human
demand,
and the monopolistic screws are turned tighter. Furthermore, take into
account that the limited supply of land is being demanded by an
ever-increasing number of planetary inhabitants, and you'll grasp why
ordinary folk are being squeezed into devoting more and more working
years to saving for their increasingly-expensive block of land. In
fact, you now know more about the factors of production - the very
basics of economics - than many of our esteemed professors of
neoclassical economics!</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. The value of land is built
up by the community whereas the value of capital is created by its
makers.</span></small><br>
<small>The type of land we are examining here is the all-important
(because so
expensive and necessary) urban land, and the value that is appreciating
is its locational (not agricultural) value. We say that the value of
land is not generally due to any effort of the owner for two main
reasons - population and infrastructure. The growing population will
make the limited supply of land relatively more scarce and will bid up
its price. Also, a growing population accessible to your site is
generally desirable - more skills and services available,
companionship, economies of scale etc. Infrastructure, by its very
nature, provides all sorts of land-value-enhancing amenities, such as
roads, schools, power, water, hospitals, libraries etc. To return to
our point, in no way is the value of capital enhanced by others. That
of land is.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<br>
<small>Land generally appreciates over time whereas capital nearly
always depreciates over its useful economic life.

<small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
Land Value Taxation </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synopsis</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Land value taxation
(LVT)
has often been omitted from the lists of natural resources for which
eco-taxes are being advocated. LVT provides strong financial
encouragement for land to be put to its optimal use and will eliminate
speculation on land, as occupants must pay the full LVT whether the
land is being fully utilised or not. This leads to better land
management, a reduction in urban sprawl, less urban smothering of
agricultural land, and less farmland being pushed into hinterland.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT makes the investment in
resource-efficient infrastructure affordable because the resulting
enhanced land values are "recycled" back into public coffers. One
particular application of LVT to agricultural land provides much-needed
financial incentives for organic farming. Unlike other ecotaxes which
"sow the seeds of their own revenue demise," LVT actuallyincreases over
time as our environment is enhanced and is thus a stable revenue base. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This paper argues
that the LVT assessment process shifts and refines our focus from
monitoring human activity onto our use and abuse of natural resources,
as any responsible form of stewardship should. It suggests that only if
land users are prepared to pay the full cost of utilising resources
should private resource holding be permitted.</small><br>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"The depletion of natural
resources and
the despoliation of nature is due to a single reason: the failure
properly to measure the rental value of all of nature's resources, and
to make the users pay the community for the benefits they receive." F.
Harrison, "The Corruption of Economics"</small><br>
</div>
<small><br>
</small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The confusion between
land and capital
is well exemplified by the description of property prices which
comprise, of course, buildings and land. Whereas the former depreciate,
the latter usually appreciate, yet their escalating values are
invariably referred to as "house prices increases". </span>Such
confusion demands an examination of <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the distinctive qualities of land
(whose value is largely locational) </span>on which the theory and
practice of LVT is based:</small>
<br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">1.
Unlike capital which is produced and reproduced, land is fixed in supply</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. There are all sorts of substitutes
for capital items and for many natural resources, but there's no
substitute for land - at least, not while the Law of Gravity holds!</span>
It is this twin combination of fixed supply and never-ending demand
which determines how land behaves like a monopoly good, and which led
Churchill to declare, "It is quite true that land monopoly is not the
only monopoly which exists, but it is by far the greatest of monopolies
- it is a perpetual monopoly, and <a
 href="../docs/Churchill_TPL.html">it is the mother of all other
forms of monopoly</a>."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[2]
</span></small><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 3. Unlike capital, the value of land
is not built up by the occupier but by the community (principally
through the increase in presence of population and through the further
provision of tax-funded infrastructure).</span> Herein lies the
rationale for LVT, being the charge by the community for
community-created amenities. As will be further detailed, it also
explains the reason why our present form of land tenure and taxation is
supported by predatory rent-seekers.&nbsp; <a
 style="font-weight: bold;"
 href="../docs/Williams_OE-T.html">read the entire article</a></small>
(except for minor exceptions like multistorey developments and land
reclamation). As the old saying goes, "Invest in land - they're not
making any more of it". Furthermore, one can't go out into the desert
and truck in prime real estate. And unlike natural resources like air
and water, land can be neatly parceled up and readily "owned" (with
title deeds which confer ownership in perpetuity).

unearned increment on land, why
don't you tax the unearned increment from a large block of stock? I
buy a piece of land; the value rises. I buy stocks; their value

speculation the unearned increment derived from land arises from a
wholly sterile process, from the mere withholding of a commodity
which is needed by the community. In the second case, the investor in
a block of shares does not withhold from the community what the
community needs. The one operation is in restraint of trade and in
conflict with the general interest, and the other is part of a
natural and healthy process, by which the economic plant of the world
is nourished and from year to year successfully and notably
increased.&nbsp; ... <a href="../docs/Churchill_LPCP.html"><span

detrimental to the general public. Land, which is a necessity of human

The market exchange of capital for land causes an elementary failure in
the minds of many.&nbsp; Land and capital each have their prices and
may
be bought and sold for money.&nbsp; Each alike is part of an
individual's
assets, colloquially called his "capital".&nbsp; Each is a
store of value to the individual.&nbsp; What is true of each individual
must be true for all together, is the thinking: it is the "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fallacy
of composition.</span>" We will see herein that society cannot turn
land
into capital, and land is not a store of value for society.<br>
<br>
The discipline has not totally eliminated land, but marginalized
it. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">The discipline has not
totally terminated land: it is too subtle for outright skullduggery,
preferring equivocation and confusion.&nbsp; Rather, it has
marginalized it.&nbsp; </span>There is a subdiscipline called "Land
Economics," and
a journal of that name.&nbsp; There are journals of Agricultural
Economics, Urban Economics, Regional Science, Environmental Economics,
Natural Resources, and more.&nbsp; There are also whole disciplines of
Geography, Economic Geography, Military Science, Biogeography, Geology,
Geometry, Surveying, Astronomy, Theology, Ecology, Oceanography,
Meteorology, Soils, Physiography, Topography, and Hydrology, all
dealing
with The Earth and Nature and Creation as definable topics distinct
from
man's works.<strong> ...</strong><br>

essay
gives 10 primary reasons why land is distinct from capital (and of
course
from mankind itself) as an economic input.&nbsp; Then it gives 18
important economic consequences thereof, and their policy
implications.&nbsp; Making land markets, land policy, and land taxation
work well for the general welfare is a major challenge for economists
and
statesmen.&nbsp; They have neglected it too long by crediting and
following the peculiar neo-classical sophisms that obscure or deny all
distinctions between land and capital. <strong>... </strong></small><br>

Gift, Creation, Gaia, The Promised Land, or nature.&nbsp; Mankind did

<br>
<small>"Land" in economics means all natural resources and agents,
with their sites (locations and extensions in space).&nbsp; Land is not
just the matter occupying space: it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
space. It includes many things not
colloquially called land, such as </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Economic land <span
 style="font-style: italic;">excludes</span> many
things, too, that are
colloquially called land.&nbsp; It excludes land-fill, for example, by
which many cities
are extended into shallow waters.&nbsp; The site and seabed are
properly
land; the land-fill is an improvement.&nbsp; There is no "made
land" in the economic sense: it is reallocated from other
uses.&nbsp; Expanding cities take farmland from producing food and
fiber,
much of it for the expanding city itself.&nbsp; Filled land in shallow
water near cities is taken away from anglers and sailors and viewers
and
ecologists, who now routinely&nbsp; organize to prevent it being "made"
away with.&nbsp; Drained and filled
wetlands are taken away from endangered species, as well as from their
primal role as
filters protecting coastal waters from river trash and
pollutants.&nbsp;
Thanks to the myopia and dereliction of economists, it has taken
militant
environmentalists to carry home this truth, developing in their
struggle
to be heard and understood a deep skepticism of economists and their
"way of thinking." Some economists and environmentalists are now coming
to terms with each other, after decades of mutual shunning.&nbsp; Too
many modern economists, however, still use their "way of thinking" to
seal out important new evidence that doesn't fit the model. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Capital (K) is that which has been produced but not yet used
up.&nbsp;
Capital is formed by human thrift, forbearance, investment and
production.&nbsp; Only after mankind forms and makes capital does it
bear
much likeness to land, in that they coexist.&nbsp; Ordinary
micro-economics obscures the differences because it deals mainly with
relations of coexistence, ignoring the continual formation and
destruction of capital, ignoring time and relations of sequence.&nbsp;
Thus it excludes from its purview one of the prime differences between
land and capital.&nbsp; The life of capital, like that of people, is
marked by major sacraments of birth, growth, aging and death - all
missing from micro theory. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Economic
life is a cavalcade in which the birth and death of capital are dated
events.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Micro deals mainly with how existing
resources are allocated at a moment in time, not how they originate,
grow, flourish, reproduce, age, die, and decompose.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Capital occupies space; land <i>is </i>space.&nbsp; In common
micro
theory, resources and markets come together at a point not just in time
but in space.&nbsp; Again, it excludes from its purview one of the
prime
qualities of land.<small><span

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>6.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>It
is ironic that
economists purport or affect to ape the methods of physics, when
they delete both space and time from their subject.&nbsp; If
they have borrowed from physics, they have taken the form without the
substance.
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>For the reasons given, alone, land and capital are mutually
exclusive. <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">There are, however,
nine more, which follow. ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>The opportunity cost
of capital is fleeting.&nbsp; Capital loses most
of
it the moment it is committed to a specific form, whose physical
alternative use is often only as scrap.&nbsp; Land's "opportunity
cost" is real and viable at all times.&nbsp; The scrap value of
capital is often zero or negative (radioactive waste supplying an
extreme
example). .<strong>..</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Land price guides investors and determines the character
of
capital, as capital substitutes for land</b></small><br>
<small><b></b></small><br>
<small><b></b>High land price guides investors to prefer kinds of
capital that
substitute for land.&nbsp; Although capital cannot be converted into
land, it can substitute for land, and does so when rents and land
prices
are high.&nbsp; John Stuart Mill long ago pointed out that the
structure
and character of capital is determined by the level of rents and
wages.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19&nbsp;</span></small>
Such substitution is an integral part of the
equilibrating function of markets; the human race could never have
attained its present numbers and density without it.&nbsp; High wages
evoke labor-saving capital; high rents evoke land-saving capital.&nbsp;
It is useful to carry this farther, and recognize five kinds of
substitutive capital evoked by high rents and land prices:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>a.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-saving
capital, like high buildings.<br>
b.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-enhancing
capital, meaning capital used to improve land for new, higher
use.<br>
c.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-linking
capital, like canals and rails and city streets.<br>
d.<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Land-capturing
(rent-seeking) capital, like squatters' improvements, and canal
and rail lines built to secure land grants,
and dams and canals built to secure water rights. <br>
e. Rent-leading capital. <strong>... </strong><br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To understand the forces shaping
capital investment, one must recognize
the difference of land and capital.&nbsp; High land prices evoke
substitution of capital for land, shaping the capital stock in
particular
ways.&nbsp; Viewed positively, this is a central part of economic
equilibration, tempering land scarcity.&nbsp; Viewed negatively, it has
led historically to boom and bust cycles. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The value of durable capital is based on expected future cash
flow, and
so is that of land, but there are three big differences at least.&nbsp;
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The future of most capital is short; that of land is
infinite.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>The future of most capital is limited to the specialized
use for which
it was built; that of land is varied and unpredictable.&nbsp;    </small></li>
  <li><small>The
future cash flow of capital is limited by potential competition from
new capital with a known cost of production; that from land is limited
only by future demand and is likely to rise.&nbsp; It is, as Richard
Hurd wrote in his classic <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Principles of City Land
Values</span>, "a state of
the public mind."</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to allocation of land it
gravitates not just to the financially
strong but to the psychologically susceptible, that is those most prone

Gains Debate</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> To
bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 --&nbsp; and that most
of the
direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.
... </small><br>
<br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>The
most frequently heard arguments for reducing capital gains
taxes are: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>(1) to reduce the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;lock-in&#8221; effect</span>, by which high tax
rates at
realization deter asset sales;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span> </small><br>
(2) to relieve a disproportionate burden on homeowners; <br>
(3) to compensate for the erosion of capital gains by inflation, as an
alternative to indexing;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span> </small><br>
(4) to end alleged double taxation of both capital stocks and income
flows; <br>
(5) to spur productive enterprise and investment; and <br>
(6) to generate more tax revenue from the consequent growth in asset
sales and productivity.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small><small>14 Some argue that
eliminating
step-up of basis at death would do more to reduce lock-in than a rate
cut. See Joint Committee on Taxation (1990), p. 2 1; Gaffney (1991).<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>This report calls attention to a neglected aspect of the capital
gains
issue --&nbsp; one which bears importantly on the fifth- and
sixth-named
consequences.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Much of the capital gains debate today focuses on the stock
market.
Business recipients of capital gains are characterized as small
innovative firms making <span style="font-weight: bold;">initial
public offerings (IPOs)</span>. In recent
years such firms have been responsible for a disproportionate share of
new hiring. It is hoped that corporations will be able to raise money
to employ more labor and invest in more plant and equipment if buyers
of their stocks can sell these securities with less of a tax bite.
Stock market gains thus are held to stimulate new direct investment,
employment, and output.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Typical of the campaign to reduce capital gains taxes is a Wall
Street
Journal editorial, &#8220;Capital Gains: Lift the Burden.&#8221; Author W. Kurt
Hauser argues that when the capital gains tax rate was increased from
20 percent to 28 percent in 1989, the effect was to deter asset sales,
causing a decline in the capital gains to be reaped and taxed. He
refers, however, only to stock market gains, and specifically, to
equity in small businesses. Citing the example of yacht producers, he
suggests that taxing capital gains on stocks issued by these businesses
&#8220;locks in&#8221; capital asset sales, thereby deterring new investment and
hiring, and reducing the supply of yachts.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>16 Hauser (1995).
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Others contend that new productive investment is relatively
insensitive
to capital gains tax rates, arguing, for example, that most of the
money placed in venture-capital funds come from tax-exempt pension
funds, endowments, and foundations.<small><span

 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>What
is missing from the discussion is a sense of
proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
the stock market -- much less in new offerings -- but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>The Federal
Reserve Board estimates land values at some $4.4
trillion for 1994. Residential structures add $5.9 trillion, and other
buildings another $3.1 trillion. This $13.4 trillion of real estate
value represents two thirds of the total $20 trillion in overall assets
for the United States economy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small> Real
estate accounts for three-fourths of the economy's capital consumption
allowances. It also is the major collateral for debt, and generates
some two-thirds of the interest paid by American businesses. Real
estate taxes are the economy's major wealth tax, although their yield
has declined as a proportion of all state and local revenues, from 70
percent in 1930 to about one-fourth today.</small><br>

</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Capital gains statistics are
much harder to come by. One cannot simply
measure the increased value of the capital stock, for part of the rise
represents investment--production of new capital -- rather than
appreciation of existing capital and land. The IRS conducts periodic
sampling of capital gains based on tax returns, and its Statistics on
Income presents various analyses of the shares of total capital gains
reported by the economy's income cohorts, from the richest five percent
down. The samples are admittedly asymmetrical, however, and some of the
categories overlap. Significantly, for instance, stock market gains
include a large component of land and other real estate gains. </small><br>
<br>
<small>This policy brief seeks to elucidate the role of real estate in
the
capital gains issue, indicating the quantitative orders of magnitude
involved.. We offer two main observations. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">generous </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">capital
consumption allowances (CCAs) </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">greatly
magnify the proportion of real estate income taken as taxable capital
gains.</span> Capital gains accrue not only on newly constructed
buildings, of course, but also on land and old buildings being sold and
resold. Our tax code allows for properties to be re-depreciated by
their new owners after a sale or swap, permitting real estate investors
to recapture principal again and again on the same structure. When CCAs
have been excessive relative to true economic depreciation, as they
were during the 1980s, capital gains have been commensurately larger
than the actual increase in property prices. As Charts la and lb
illustrate, capital consumption allowances in real estate dwarf those
in other industries.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold;">very little of
real
estate cash flow is taxable as ordinary income, so the capital gains
tax is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate
industry.</span> CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments
combine to exempt most of real estate cash flow from the income tax.
This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public
finance onto other taxpayers.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
central conclusion of our study is
that better statistics on asset
values and capital gains are needed -- or, more to the point, a better
accounting format. The economic effects of a capital gains tax depend
upon how the gains are made. </span>The present GNP/NIPA format fails
to
differentiate between wealth and overhead; between value from
production and value from obligation. In particular, theory and
measurement should distinguish real estate from other sources of
capital gains -- aid, within the category of real estate, distinguish
land from built improvements. Markets for immovable structures and for
land have distinctive inherent features<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small> and
are shaped by distinctive institutional constraints.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our second major
conclusion is
that, at least until
re-depreciation of second-hand buildings is disallowed, a capital gains
tax cut would be unlikely to stimulate much new investment and
employment from its largest beneficiary, the real estate industry.
</span>Depreciation allowances and mortgage interest absorb so much of
the
ongoing cash flow as to leave little taxable income. Mortgage interest
payments, which now consume the lion&#8217;s share of cash flow, are
tax-deductible, while CCAs offset much of what remains of rental
income. On an industry-wide basis, in fact, NIPA statistics reveal that
depreciation offsets <span style="font-style: italic;">more </span>than
the total reported income. As Charts 2a, 2b, and 2c illustrate, real
estate corporations and partnerships have recently reported net losses
year after year.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The result is that real estate corporations pay minimal income
taxes -- some $1.3 billion in 1988, just one percent of the $137
billion
paid by corporate America as a whole.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small>
Comparable figures are not available on non-corporate income tax
liability, but the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, and real estate)
reported negative income of $3.4 billion in 1988, out of a total $267
billion of non-farm proprietors&#8217; income.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small> These
three symbiotically linked sectors thus were left with only capital
gains
taxes to pay on their cash flow.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The central point for capital gains tax policy is that taxable
capital
gains in real estate consist of more than just the increase in land and
building prices. They represent the widening margin of sales price over
the property&#8217;s depreciated value. The tax accountant&#8217;s book-value gains
result from charging off capital
consumption allowances as a tax credit against cash flow. The more
generous are the capital consumption write-offs for real estate, the
more rapidly a property&#8217;s book value is written down. The fiction of
fast write-off is eventually &#8220;caught&#8221; as a capital gain when the real
estate is either sold or refinanced.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Excessive
depreciation allowances thus convert ordinary income into capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains. Moreover,
capital gains are the only point at which most real estate income is </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">taxed </span>To
abolish the capital gains tax would annul the entire accumulated income
tax liability which real estate owners have converted into a capital
gains obligation. The income written off over the years as
over-depreciation would not be caught at all. The economy's largest
industry would have its income rendered tax-free. </small><br>
<br>
<small>Capital gains already are being taxed much more lightly than
ordinary
income, especially when deferrals and exemptions are taken into
account. Even if exemptions were eliminated and the capital gains tax
rate were set as high as the ordinary income tax rate, the effective
burden (what economists call the <span style="font-style: italic;">present
value</span> of the tax) would be substantially lower to the extent
that the capital gains tax is paid only retroactively, upon realization
(sale) rather than as the gains actually accrue. ...</small><span

land value tax, stated that,</small></div>

is
no natural monopolization of capital, but, with state sanction, there
is monopolization of land. But von Mises would sooner obscure these
distinctions in socialist fashion than to embrace a proposal he
mistakenly thought to be socialist.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his first edition of Human
Action, von Mises attacked land
value tax as based on the socialist principle that legitimate
property flows only from labor. But that is also a libertarian
principle, a classical liberal principle, an Austrian principle, and
even the von Misean principle behind private property! So, by the
third edition, von Mises changed his text to read that land taxers
claim legitimate property flows only from manual labor.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is much more logically
consistent, but factually incorrect.
It is a correct assessment of what many socialists believe, but it is
not a correct assessment of what land taxers believe. Henry George,
the most prominent land taxer of all, wrote in his magnum opus,
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><i>Thus the term labor
includes all human exertion in the
production of wealth, and wages, being that part of the produce which
goes to labor, includes all reward for such exertion. There is,
therefore, in the political-economic sense of the term, no distinction
as to the kind of labor, or as to whether its reward is received
through an employer or not.... </i></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George also defended the ownership
of property that flows from the
employment of capital.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perhaps von Mises was biased by
his location in Europe, where
classical liberalism had not fared as well as in America. He might
also have first seen land value tax in the Communist Manifesto, and
not realized that it was there as a socialist ploy to co-opt support
from classical liberalism. (Marx expressed contempt for land value
tax as a reform in its own right, and openly stated that his support
of it was only to draw people to what he really wanted, which was to
control capital.) If this is where von Mises got his first exposure

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the reasons that the debate is so fierce between the advocates of rental
      and the advocates of private ownership of agricultural land is that each position
      has important strengths as well as important weaknesses. This paper argues
      that there is a third possibility between rental and private ownership that
      retains the strengths of both while avoiding the weaknesses of both. The third
      possibility is private possession of land.</p>
  <p><b>I. The Concept of Private Possession of Land</b></p>
  <p>Like private ownership, a system of private possession of land involves titles
      to land that have no termination date and are freely transferable. Therefore
      the possessor of land can be confident of receiving the full benefit of any
      improvements that are made to land. Like rental, a system of private possession
      of land involves an obligation to make regular payments to the government for
      the use of land. However, the payment is not for the full rental value of land,
      but only for the rental value that land would have in an unimproved condition.
      This collection by the government of the value that is provided by nature and
      location gives recognition to the idea that land is the common heritage of
      all generations, and should be available to all generations on the same terms.
      It insures that prices for titles of possession will correspond only to the
      cost of improvements, and will therefore not be excessive. It eliminates the

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The starting point of the
Georgist framework is rigorous definition of
the three factors of production &#8212; land, labor, and capital, as in
classical economics. It should be further pointed out that these
factors are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all things of
economic value. Something must necessarily be in one category or
another; there is nothing <span style="font-style: italic;">outside </span>this
total classification. Understanding of what constitutes labor differs
little from definitions given elsewhere, regardless of which theory is
used. But definitions of land and capital differ somewhat from common
practice as well as sometimes in theory. Therefore, it is helpful to
spend time explicating the definitions of each as they are used in
Georgism, and to point out where these definitions diverge from those
most often employed in neoclassical economics applications. Many
contemporary economics texts begin by taking note of the
land-labor-capital distinction, but then make little use of it later.
These distinctions will make apparent why Georgist economics leads to
very different explanations of economic phenomena as well as to
different policy solutions.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Critical to an understanding of Georgist economics is its
recognition
of land as a special and unique factor of production. &#8220;Land,&#8221; to
Georgists, as true for classical economists throughout the 19th
century, is taken to mean not just the surface of the earth and
locational space; it means also any and all those natural resources and
non-human works that today can exact a market price. It includes the
wealth of the earth in all its natural forms, the air and water as well
as material elements. It includes phenomena of value like the
electromagnetic spectrum used to transmit communications signals, and
landing time slots such as have value at airports. As the world
economies enter a new age of high technology, these radio spectrums and
time allotments have gained ever increasing value. So also with
geosychronous satellite
orbits and most recently the genetic codes of all the biota on earth.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Sites have value relative to their location, and this is largely
a
function of where people choose to congregate. The highest value lands,
in urban areas and in developed nations, have market worth many times
that of sites even short distances away. Remote land sites sometimes
have no market value whatsoever, and they are typically not &#8220;owned&#8221; by
private individuals or corporations because they are not attractive for
economic use. <strong>In New York City, for example, the ownership of one small
parcel of less than an acre in Times Square was transferred from
Prudential Life Insurance Company to the Disney Corporation in 1998 for
an estimated $240 million.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11</span></small> This
is more market value than all the land and buildings together in the
region north of the Mohawk River/Erie Canal in New York State. More
recently, a nine-acre parcel just south of the United Nations complex,
also available for development in New York City, was
estimated to have a site value of $750 million.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">12</span></small>
In both these cases, the cost of razing the existing obsolete buildings
was included in these prices, a factor which suggests that the market
value of the land would have been still higher were it not for this
condition.</strong><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">13</span></small>
In contrast there are land areas in Northern Canada and in the polar
regions for which there are no private bidders at all.</small><br>
<small><small></small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is equally important to
distinguish those factors that are not land
in the classical sense of its economic use. Natural resources such as
coal, oil, and minerals, once removed from their natural state are no
longer regarded as land. </span>A diamond lodged in the deep earth is
land; that same diamond discovered by a prospector and then cut and
polished by a jeweler, is no longer land but capital. Likewise, fish in
the ocean are land, but fish once caught and in a boat are capital.
This is why, in any courses taught on Georgist economics, considerable
time is devoted to basic definitions. To carry the distinction just one
step further, land in the Georgist lexicon, is not wealth, whereas in
neoclassical economics it is. In the course of later discussion of the
Georgist view relative to the ecological economics approach, this will
emerge as a critical distinction, as it helps to demarcate the
boundaries of what activities fall within the realm of economic
behavior and what activities remain marginal.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This separate and identifiable recognition of land has
significant
importance for the definition of <span style="font-weight: bold;">capital
</span>too, because capital, then,
cannot be land. Capital, rather, is the product of labor and land (and
perhaps other past capital) to add to the increased store of capital of
individuals or of the community. Capital can be of many types, ranging
from monetary wealth to technical knowledge. The store of capital
applied to land and labor results in the further production of capital
wealth. Capital allows labor to be employed with greater efficiency and
productivity, through the use of technology and instruments and with
increased human skill and knowledge.&nbsp; ... <a

  Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    In addition, George differentiated sharply between land itself and the
    products -- or wealth, as he termed them -- which labor made from the
    land. "In producing wealth, labor, with the aid of natural forces, but
    works up, into the forms desired, pre-existing matter, and, to produce
    wealth, must, therefore, have access to this matter and to these forces
    -- that is to say, to land. The land is the source of all wealth. It is
    the mine from which must be drawn the ore that labor fashions. It is
    the substance to which labor gives the form."<br>
    <br>
    George saw, as between land and products, certain elementary
    differences. "In every essential, land differs from those things
    which... [are] the product of human labor. ...It is the creation of
    God; they are produced by man. It is fixed in quantity; they may be
    increased illimitably. It exists, though generations come and go; they
    in a little while decay and pass again into the elements."<br>
    Having noted these differences, George proceeded to use them as the
    basis for his examination of related areas of economics, such as
    speculation. When asked how speculation worked, George responded that a
    distinction must be made between speculation in land and speculation in
    products.<br>
    <br>
    Writing of industrial depressions, he said, "When, with the desire to
    consume more, there coexist the ability and willingness to produce
    more, industrial and commercial paralysis cannot be charged either to
    overproduction or to overconsumption. Manifestly, the trouble is that
    production and consumption cannot meet and satisfy each other .<br>
    <br>
"How does this inability arise? It is evidently and by common consent
    the result of speculation. But of speculation in what?<br>
    <br>
"Certainly not of speculation in things which are the products of labor
    ...for the effect of speculation in such things, as is well shown in
    current treatises that spare me the necessity of illustration, is
    simply to equalize supply and demand, and to steady the interplay of
    production and consumption by an action analogous to that of a
    fly-wheel in a machine."&nbsp; In other words, the tendency of
    speculation in products is to increase the demand for products and
    therefore to increase the price of products. This increased price will
    induce more production, which, increasing the supply, will tend to
    lower the price. Throughout this cycle, there has been a stimulating
    effect on production in general.<br>
    <br>
    He continued, "Therefore, if speculation be the cause of these
    industrial depressions, it must be speculation in things not the
    production of labor, but yet necessary to the exertion of labor in the
    production of wealth -- of things of fixed quantity; that is to say, it
    must be speculation in land." <br>
    <br>
    How can this be? How can speculation in land cause industrial
    depression? George explains, "...that there is a connection between the
    rapid construction of railroads and industrial depression, anyone who
    understands what increased land values mean, and who has noticed the
    effect which the construction of railroads has upon land speculation,
    can easily see. Wherever a railroad was built or projected, lands
    sprang up in value under the influence of speculation, and thousands of
    millions of dollars were added to the nominal values which capital and
    labor were asked to pay outright, or to pay in installments, as the
    price of being allowed to go to work and produce wealth. The inevitable
    result was to check production. .." <br>
    <br>
    The tendency of speculation in land is similar to that of speculation
    in products; it increases the demand for land and thereby increases the
    price of land. However, here the similarity ends. The supply of land is
    fixed; as successive units of land become priced beyond the level at
    which labor and capital can profitably engage in production, an
    increasing (though artificial) scarcity of land develops. "The
    inevitable result was to check production." <br>
    <br>
    So, according to George, another difference between land and products
    is that speculation in products tends to stimulate production, whereas
    speculation in land tends to check production. ...<br>
    <br>
    <small><b>The Ethics of Property</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>Any discussion of Henry George should include a consideration of
  his ethical ideas, for throughout his works the question of right and
  wrong is dominant. In <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress and
  Poverty</span>, for instance, he struck
  this keynote: </small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>'. ..whatever dispute arouses the
passions of men, the conflict is
sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?' as to the
question 'Is it right?'. ..I bow to this arbitrament, and accept this
test."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George wrote as a social
philosopher. Therefore his preoccupation
in the field of ethics was with the relations of man to man, rather
than with man himself -- with stealing rather than with
thriftlessness. This necessarily involves the matter of property and
ownership. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once again, the student will find
George's analysis to be based on
the differences inherent in the two categories of land and products.
"The real and natural distinction is between things which are the
produce of labor and things which are the gratuitous offerings of
nature. ...These two classes of things are in essence and relations
widely different, and to class them together as property is to
confuse all thought when we come to consider the justice or the
injustice, the right or the wrong of property."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the moral basis of
property? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it not, primarily, the right of
a man to himself, to the use of
his own powers, to the enjoyment of the fruits of his own exertions?
... As a man belongs to himself, so his labor when put in concrete
form belongs to him. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And for this reason, that which a
man makes or produces is his
own, as against all the world -- to enjoy or to destroy, to use, to
exchange, or to give. No one else can rightfully claim it, and his
exclusive right to it involves no wrong to anyone else. Thus there is
to everything produced by human exertion a clear and indisputable
title to exclusive possession and enjoyment, which is perfectly
consistent with justice, as it descends from the original producer.
... </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is a justification for
private property in products. But what
of land, which is not produced by man? Is there any other basis from
which a justification for private property in land might be derived?
In addition, is there anything in the right of private property in
products which precludes the right of private property in land? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George explains, "Now this [the
right of the individual to the
use of his own faculties] is not only the original source from
which all ideas of exclusive ownership arise ... but it is
necessarily the only source. There can be to the ownership of
anything no rightful title which is not derived from the title of the
producer and does not rest upon the natural right of the man to
himself. There can be no other rightful title, because (lst) there is
no other natural right from which any other title can be derived, and
(2nd) because the recognition of any other title is inconsistent with
and destructive of this."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To substantiate the first reason
he further said, </small></p>
<blockquote>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-1">Nature acknowledges
no ownership or control
in man save as the result of exertion. In no other way can her
treasures be drawn forth, her powers directed, or her forces utilized
or controlled. ...All men to her stand upon an equal footing and have
equal rights. She recognizes no claim but that of labor, and recognizes
that without respect to the claimant. If a pirate spread his sails, the
wind will fill them as well as it will fill those of a peaceful
merchantman. ...The laws of nature are the decrees of the Creator.
There is written in them no recognition of any right save that of
labor; and in them is written broadly and clearly the equal right of
all men to the use and enjoyment of nature; to apply to her by their
exertions, and to receive and possess her reward. Hence, as nature
gives only to abor, the exertion of labor in production is the only
title to exclusive possession (1879, rpt. 1958, pp. 335-36).</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the second reason he said:</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><font size="-1">This right of
ownership that springs from
labor excludes the possibility of any other right of ownership. ...If
production give to the producer the right to exclusive possession and
enjoyment, there can rightfully be no exclusive possession and
enjoyment of anything not the production of labor, and the recognition
of private property in land is a wrong. For the right to the produce of
labor cannot be enjoyed without the right to the free use of the
opportunities offered by nature, and to admit the right of property in
these is to deny the right of property in the produce of labor. When
nonproducers can claim as rent a portion of the wealth created by
producers, the right of he producers to the fruits of their labor is
to that extent denied (1879, rpt. 1958, p. 336). </font></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Private property in land,
according to George, is unjust because
it lets owners of land refuse access to land, and thereby threatens
livelihood and life itself. Private property in land is also unjust
because it enables owners of land to levy toll on production for the
use of land; therefore it is robbery. So another difference between
products and land, in George's view, is that private property in
products is right, and private property in land is wrong.... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>Noticing rent, realizing its social nature, accepting that it's to be shared,
      and understanding that wages and interest should not be expropriated, for
    most people that's a new way of thinking. Thinking such thoughts leads to

  <p>One could argue that the failure to tax every bit of economic rent that
    accretes to land sites also has destructive consequences, although this is
    somewhat
      open to debate. Classical economists agree that rent collection ought to
    be at least the sum of inflation plus interest, otherwise the public is facilitating
      speculation in ways that distorts urban configurations even more than they

    will not last and will be especially destructive when it collapses.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[19]</em></strong></font> <strong>Land
      values are what create that bubble; buildings are subject to continuing depreciation
      just like cars, computers, refrigerators or any other manufactured (capital)
      item. Recovering the economic rent reduces and perhaps even eliminates the
      speculative bubbles and swings that (some argue) account for economic cycles,
      fostering stability and regularity in economic planning and development that
      make for improved financial health to all.</strong></p>
  <p>This reality brings into stark relief the choices which local political
          leaders have. They may suggest increasing taxes on economic rent (i.e.,
      on land value)
        or recognize that most property owners are counting on treating their
    homes and other property not as places to live and work so much as investments
      and then lament the poverty of their cities. Owners expect to reap a gain
    from
        their property when they sell, and they are often positioned to make
    any threat
        to that entitlement politically unpalatable. Farmers sometimes regard
    selling their farms as their retirement security. Homeowners sell with the
    expectation
        that this gain will provide them the means to enter long term end-of-life
      facilities if necessary. Heirs also oppose that recapture just as with
    a reverse mortgage.
        But for every long-term property owner that walks away with a lifetime's
      benefit of increased rent attached to a land title, there are just as many &#8212; if
        not more &#8212; young households or emerging businesses that are prohibited
        from acquiring a property because of the prohibitively expensive costs.
        In this sense, a title to a socially created stream of rental benefits
        constitutes
        a monopoly privilege to an unearned windfall gain for a lucky few. It
        is both unjust and is socially and economically destructive to the greater
        good.

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts of
    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who Pays New
    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of shifting,
    the distinction between land and improvements was opaque. This is a remarkable
    oversight, because improvements typically depreciate at the rate of 0.5 to
    1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate. And in view of the fact
    that assessments in New York localities have historically been very infrequent,
    one can understand how the land values are in reality a far higher proportion
    of parcel value than assessments would suggest. This means that in a period
    of seven years, for example, a property parcel could easily increase in price
    by 50 percent, far more if recent real estate market history is to be illustrative.
    Moreover real estate prices varied greatly in their rates of change during
    this time span; upstate New York was largely stable, but downstate localities
    experienced huge booms and busts.</p>
  <p>Recognition of this would tend to favor what is known as the &#8220;new
    view&#8221; of property tax incidence, an acceptance of the idea that &#8221;the
    burden of the tax on improvements remains with the owners of capital in the
    form of a lower net return instead of being shifted to users of property
    in the form of higher rents or prices.&#8221; Proponents point out that &#8220;the
    tax on improvements is essentially a nationwide tax on capital . . . [and
    therefore] its incidence will depend on the characteristics of supply and
    demand for capital nationally rather than on a single market.&#8221; The
    effect of this is to make the tax &#8221;highly progressive.&#8221; Nonetheless,
    in a small footnote, Messrs. Pomp and Phares elected to go with the &#8220;old
    view&#8221; in stating that, &#8220;it seems most appropriate to assume that
    the new view does not apply to the analysis of tax burdens within one specific
    state (underlining in original). Thus, the old or traditional view was adhered
    to in the analysis. . ; that is, the excise effect of the tax was considered
    dominant.&#8221; The ubiquity of New York's property tax, and that it has
    over 1,300 local assessment and tax districts, may well have escaped their
    notice. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The land that a city has is fixed (or if it changes, it does so at the expense
      of other administrative units). Therefore, with respect to land, socially productive
      urban growth means adopting policies that raise the productivity of land. Labor,
      on the other hand, is reasonably mobile, and capital is highly mobile. Entrepreneurship
      springs up and fades away with the rise and fall of opportunities. Therefore,
      in a market economy, the payments that must be made to attract these factors
      are substantially outside the control of a city. Thus the growth of a city
      with respect to labor, capital and entrepreneurship is achieved primarily by
      making the city a place that attracts more of these factors, taking the rates
      of wages, interest and profits that must be paid to attract them as given by
      market forces.</p>
  <p>Tax policy is critical for urban growth because taxes on the earnings of labor,
      capital and entrepreneurship drive these factors away. A city that desires
      to grow should refrain from taxing wages, interest or profits and concentrate
      its taxes on land, which does not have the option of moving away. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">read the whole article</a></p>

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 6: Trusteeship of Creation (pages 79-100)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Gifts of creation were produced only once and are irreplaceable. By contrast,
    products traded in markets tend to be mass-produced and highly disposable.
    It&#8217;s hard to imagine a deity who&#8217;d view such temporal goods as
    equivalent to his or her enduring handiwork. The question is whether creation&#8217;s
    irreplaceable gifts are different enough to merit different treatment by
    our economic operating system. A strong case can be made that they are.</p>
  <p>The case is moral as well as economic. The moral argument is that we have
    a duty to preserve irreplaceable gifts of creation, whereas we have no comparable
    duty toward transient commercial goods. The economic argument is that any
    society that depletes its natural capital is bound to become impoverished
    over time. I find both lines of argument convincing.</p>
  <p>But what&#8217;s the reality today? Here we encounter two disconcerting
    facts. The first is that there are very few property rights protecting nature&#8217;s
    gifts. With the exception of a few set-asides such as parks and wilderness
    areas, we subject creation&#8217;s gifts to the same rules as Wal-Mart&#8217;s
    merchandise. The second is that the right of corporations to profit dominates
    all other rights.</p>
  <p>It&#8217;s time to treat creation&#8217;s gifts differently, to put different &#8220;tags&#8221; on
    them so markets will recognize them and apply different rules to them. This
    chapter shows how we can do that. ...</p>
  <p>It seems to me that, if anything is divine, it should be gifts of creation.
    Morally, they&#8217;re gifts we inherit together and must pass on, undiminished,
    to future generations. Economically, they&#8217;re irreplaceable and invaluable
    capital. Protection of these shared assets should trump transient private
    gain. Broad benefit should trump narrow benefit. The commons should trump
    capital. This should be written into our economic operating system and enforced
    by the courts. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
