  Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
  10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
  IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
  production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered. ...</p>
  <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
      labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
      labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
    <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
          a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
    <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
          a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
    <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
          of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock.
        <p><font size="-1">*Many persons, and among them some professional economists,
                  have never succeeded in getting a thorough comprehension of this point.
                  Thus, the editor has heard the objection advanced that the greater
                  cheapness of land is no advantage to the poor man who is trying to
                  save enough from his earnings to buy a piece of land; for, it is said,
                  the higher taxes on the land after it is acquired, offset the lower
                  purchase price. What such objectors do not see is that even if the
                  lower price of land does no more than balance the higher tax on it,
                  (and this overlooks, for one thing, the discouragement to speculation
                  in land), the reduction or removal of other taxes is all clear gain.
                  It is easier to save in proportion as earnings and commodities are
                  relieved of taxation. It is easier to buy land, because its selling
                  price is lower, if the land is taxed. And although the land, after
                  its purchase, continues to be taxed, not only can this tax be fully
                  paid out of the annual interest on the saving in the purchase price,
                  but also there is to be reckoned the saving in taxes on buildings and
                  other improvements and in whatever other taxes are thus rendered unnecessary.
                  H.G.B.</font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
    would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing with
    each other
      for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point
    of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers,
    and
      wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market
    would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment of
    labor, a
      competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
      demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely to
      bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade
      and increased
      profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
      upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which prevented
      monopolization.</p>
  <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
      from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor
      into
          the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
    <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
    <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
    <li> demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>
    <li> trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every
      hand. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></li>

(1889 speech)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Mr Abner Thomas, of New York, a
strict orthodox Presbyterian
&#8212; and the son of Rev Dr Thomas, author of a commentary on the
bible &#8212;wrote a little while ago an allegory. Dozing off in his
chair, he dreamt that he was ferried over the River of Death, and,
taking the straight and narrow way, came at last within sight of the
Golden City. A fine-looking old gentleman angel opened the wicket,
inquired his name, and let him in; warning him, at the same time,
that it would be better if he chose his company in heaven, and did
not associate with disreputable angels. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What!&#8221; said the newcomer, in
astonishment: &#8220;Is
not this heaven?&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;But
there are a lot of
tramp angels here now." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; asked Mr
Thomas. &#8220;I thought
everybody had plenty in heaven.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;It used to be
that way some time ago,&#8221; said the
warden: &#8220;And if you wanted to get your harp polished or your
wings combed, you had to do it yourself. But matters have changed
since we adopted the same kind of property regulations in heaven as
you have in civilised countries on earth, and we find it a great
improvement, at least for the better class.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the warden told the newcomer
that he had better decide
where he was going to board.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to board anywhere,&#8221;
said Thomas:
&#8220;I would much rather go over to that beautiful green knoll and
lie down.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I would not advise you to do
so,&#8221; said the warden:
&#8220;The angel who owns that knoll does not like to encourage
trespassing. Some centuries ago, as I told you, we introduced the
system of private property into the soil of heaven. So we divided the
land up. It is all private property now.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I hope I was considered in that
division?&#8221; said
Thomas. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;No,&#8221; said the warden: &#8220;You were
not; but if you
go to work, and are saving, you can easily earn enough in a couple of
centuries to buy yourself a nice piece. You get a pair of wings free
as you come in, and you will have no difficulty in hypothecating them
for a few days board until you find work. But I should advise you to
be quick about it, as our population is constantly increasing, and
there is a great surplus of labour. Tramp angels are, in fact,
becoming quite a nuisance.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;What shall I go to work at?&#8221;
asked Thomas. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our principal industries are the
making of harps and
crowns and the growing of flowers,&#8221; responded the warden:
&#8220;But there any many opportunities for employment in personal
service.&#8221;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;I love flowers,&#8221; said Thomas. &#8220;I
will go to work
growing them, There is a beautiful piece of land over there that
nobody seems to be using. I will go to work on that.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said the
warden. &#8220;That
property belongs to one of our most far-sighted angels who has got
very rich by the advance of land values, and who is holding that
piece for a rise. You will have to buy it or rent it before you can
work on it, and you can&#8217;t do that yet.&#8221; </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The story goes on to describe how
the roads of heaven, the
streets of the New Jerusalem, were filled with disconsolate tramp
angels, who had pawned their wings, and were outcasts in Heaven
itself. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You laugh, and it is
ridiculous. But there is a moral in it that
is worth serious thought. Is it not ridiculous to imagine the
application to God&#8217;s heaven of the same rules of division that
we apply to God&#8217;s earth, even while we pray that His will may be
done on earth as it is done in Heaven?&nbsp; ... <a

</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the first quarter of this century an educated and thoughtful Englishman,
    Edward Gibbon Wakefield, visited this country. He saw its great resources,
    and noted the differences between the English-speaking society growing up
    here and that to which he had been used. Viewing everything from the standpoint
    of a class accustomed to look on the rest of mankind as created for their
    benefit,
    'what he deemed the great social and economic disadvantage of the United
    States was "the scarcity of labor." It was to this he traced the rudeness
    of even what he styled the upper class, its want of those refinements, enjoyments,
    and delicacies of life common to the aristocracy of England. How could an
    English
    gentleman emigrate to a country where labor was so dear that he might actually
    have to black his own boots; so dear that even the capitalist might have
    to work, and no one could count on a constant supply ready to accept as a
    boon
    any opportunity to perform the most menial, degrading, and repulsive services?
    Mr. Wakefield was not a man to note facts without
  seeking their connection. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He saw that
  this "scarcity of labor" came from the cheapness of land where the vast area
  of the public domain
  was open for settlement at nominal prices.</span> A man of his class and time,
  without the slightest question that land was made to be owned by landlords,
  and laborers were made to furnish a supply of labor for the upper classes,
  he was
  yet a man of imagination. He saw the future before the English-speaking race
  in building up new nations in what were yet the waste spaces of the earth.
  But he wished those new nations to be socially, politically, and economically
  newer
  Englands;
  not to be settled as the United States had been, from the "lower
  classes" alone, but to contain from the first a proper proportion of
  the "upper classes" as well. He saw that "scarcity of employment" would in time
  succeed "scarcity of labor" even in countries like the United States by the
  growth of speculation in land; but he did not want to wait for that in the
  newer Britains
  which his imagination
  pictured. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He proposed at once to produce
  such salutary "scarcity of
  employment " in new colonies as would give cheap and abundant labor, by a governmental
  refusal to sell public land, save at a price so high as to prevent the poorer
  from getting land, thus compelling them
  to offer their labor for hire.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This was the
      essential part of what was once well known as the Wakefield plan of colonization.</span> It
      is founded on a correct theory. In any country, however new and vast, it
      would be possible to change "scarcity of labor" into "scarcity of employment" by
      increasing the price put on the use of land. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If
      three families settled a virgin continent, one family could command the
      services of the others as laborers for hire just as fully as though they
      were its
      chattel slaves, if it was accorded the ownership of the land and could
      put its own price on its use.</span> Wakefield proposed only that land
      should be held at what he called "a sufficient price" -- that is, a price
      high enough to keep wages in new colonies only a little higher than wages
      in the mother-country,
      and to produce not actual inability to get employment on the part of laborers,
      but only such difficulty as would keep them tractable, and ready to accept
      what from his standpoint were reasonable wages. Yet it is evident that
      it would only require a somewhat greater increase in the price of land
      to go
      beyond this point and to bring about in the midst of abundant natural opportunities
      for the employment of labor, the phenomena of laborers vainly seeking employment.
      Now, in the United States we have not attempted to create "scarcity of
      employment" by
      Wakefield's plan. But we have made haste by sale and gift to put the public
      domain in the hands of private owners, and thus allowed speculation to
      bring about more quickly and effectually than he could have anticipated,
      more than
      Wakefield aimed at. The public domain is now practically gone; land is
      rising to European prices, and we are at last face to face with social
      difficulties
      which in the youth of men of my time we were wont to associate with "the
      effete monarchies of the Old World."<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Today, as the last census reports show, the majority
      of American farmers are rack-rented tenants, or hold under mortgage, the
      first form of tenancy; and the great majority of our people are landless
      men, without right to employ their own labor and without stake in the land
      they still foolishly speak of as their country. This is the reason why
      the army of the unemployed has appeared among us, why by pauperism has
      already
      become chronic, and why in the tramp we have in more dangerous type the
      proletarian of ancient Rome. </span>... <a href="../HG/how_to_help_the_unemployed.html">Read the whole article</a></p>

  <p>AND will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that
    lays the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth
    out the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
    reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural
    reward. The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No
    one can keep to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the
    bad. Every productive enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake
    it, yields collateral advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree,
    his gain is that he gathers the fruit in its time and season. But in addition
    to his gain, there is a gain to the whole community. Others than the owner
    are benefited by the increased supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters
    fly far and wide; the rain which it helps to attract falls not alone on his
    field; and, even to the eye which rests upon it from a distance, it brings
    a sense of beauty. And so with everything else. The building of a house,
    a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others besides those who get the
    direct profits. Nature laughs at a miser. He is like the squirrel who buries
    his nuts and refrains from digging them up again. Lo! they sprout and grow
    into trees. In fine linen, steeped in costly spices, the mummy is laid away.
    Thousands and thousands of years thereafter, the Bedouin cooks his food by

      makers of food-producing implements, food merchants, railroad men, sailors,
      draymen,
      coal miners, metal miners, builders, bankers who by exchanging commercial
      paper facilitate trade. together with clerks, bookkeepers, foremen, journeymen,
      common laborers, seeking for them instead of their seeking for work. To
      specify the labor that would be profitably affected by this demand would
      involve the cataloguing of all workmen, all business men, and all professional
      men who either directly or indirectly are connected with food industries,
      and the naming of every grade of such labor, from the newest apprentice
      to the largest supervising employer.</p>
  <p>Would not this be putting an end to &quot;hard times&quot;? For what is
    the most striking manifestation of &quot;hard times&quot;? Is it not &quot;scarcity
    of work&quot;? Is it not that there are more men seeking work than there
    are jobs to do? Certainly it is. And to say that, is not to limit &quot;hard
    times&quot; to hired men. The real trouble with the business man when he
    complains of &quot;hard times&quot; is that people do not employ him as much
    as he expects to be employed. Work is scarce with him, just as with those
    he employs, or as he would phrase it, &quot;business is slack.&quot;</p>
  <p>Let there be ten men and but nine jobs, and you have &quot;hard times.&quot; The
    tenth man will be out of work. He may be a good union man who abhors a &quot;scab&quot; and
    will not take work away from his brother workman. So he hunts for a job which
    does not exist, until all his savings are gone. Still he will not be a &quot;scab,&quot; and
    he suffers deprivation. But after a while hunger gets the better of him,
    and he takes one of the nine jobs away from another man by underbidding.
    He becomes a &quot;scab.&quot; And who can blame him? any one would rather
    be a &quot;scab&quot; than a corpse. Then the man who has lost his place
    becomes a &quot;scab&quot; too, and turns out some one else by underbidding.
    And so it goes again and again until wages fall so low that they but just
    support life. Then the poorhouse or a charitable institution takes care of
    the tenth man, who thereafter serves the purpose of preventing arise in wages.
    Meanwhile, diminished purchasing power, due to low wages, bears down upon
    business generally.</p>
  <p>But let there be ten jobs and but nine men. Conditions would instantly reverse,
    Instead of a man all the time seeking for a job, a job would be all the time
    seeking for a man; and wages would rise until they equaled the value of the
    work for which they were paid. And as wages rose purchasing power would rise,
    and business in general would flourish.</p>
  <p>If demand freely directed production, there would always be ten jobs for
    nine men, and no longer only nine jobs for ten men. It could not be otherwise
    while any wants were unsatisfied. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><em>Q25. What good would the single tax do to the poor? and how?</em><br>
A. By constantly keeping the demand for labor above the supply it would enable
  them to abolish their poverty.</p>
  <p><em>Q27. Would working people, whose savings are in savings banks or insurance
    companies which own land or have mortgages upon land, lose by the shrinkage
    in land values?</em><br>
    A. Not if the companies were managed intelligently. Well managed companies
    would shift their investments as they observed the persistent decline of
    land values. They would do it even as soon as conditions appeared which would
    naturally cause land values to shrink. But working people could well afford
    to give all their savings for the permanent employment and high wages that
    the single tax would bring about. It is not working people but idle people
    who would lose anything by the single tax.</p>

    <p><strong><em>wealthandwant editorial comment: Post may be confusing land prices and land
        value. Land </em>value<em> will continue to rise; </em>land price<em> will fall,
        as the land tax is capitalized into the price.</em></strong></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Q29. Under the single tax could employers cut wages to the starvation point?</em><br>
    A. No. Under the single tax employers would be constantly bidding for workmen,
      instead of workmen constantly bidding for employers as is the case now.
      It is the &quot;oversupply&quot; of labor that makes starvation wages possible,
      and the single tax would abolish that; not by reducing the supply of labor,
      the Malthusian device, but by allowing the effective demand for labor to
      freely increase.</p>
  <p><em>Q31. Will not the capitalist be able under the single tax to undersell
      the laborer &#8212; to sell goods for less than cost, at least temporarily &#8212; and
    thereby force him to accept the capitalist's terms?</em><br>
    A. With capitalists continually hunting for men to help them fill their orders,
    and bidding against each other to get men, as would be the case under the
    single tax, such a contingency would be in the highest degree improbable.
    It is practically impossible. Nothing short of a trust, an absolutely perfect
    trust, of all the owners of capital the world over could produce it. And
    even then, plenty of very useful land of all kinds being free and labor products
    being exempt from taxation, all people who were outside of the trust would
    resort co-operatively to the land, and the trust would be obliged to take
    them in as the alternative of falling to pieces under their competition.</p>
