  <p>One of the "small bandages" proposed
  from time to time is providing each child with an account of their own,
  funded by income taxes, perhaps added to each year while they are
  young, and made available to the child at adulthood in order to help
  give them a start in life, a stake in society.&nbsp; They could
  squander it, spend it on college, spend it on the downpayment on a house or keep
  it as a cushion.&nbsp;</p>
  <p> While I don't question the good intentions of
    those who propose such things, I regard them as a pale imposter of the
    reform that is needed &#8212; and as wholly inadequate to equalize
    conditions for those from poor families.<br>
    <br>
    Most of us would not have trouble with the idea that air and water are
    our birthright.&nbsp; The question is, what else falls into that
    category?&nbsp; How do we go about distinguishing that which is
    genuinely our <strong><em>common</em></strong> heritage from that which is <em><strong>legitimately
    private</strong></em> property?&nbsp; Georgists argue that as land-based
    creatures, we are
    just as dependent on land as we are on water and air, and that
    therefore we must all have equal access to the entire natural creation.&nbsp; None
    of us is more entitled than another, and therefore whatever rent is due for
    the use of land is due not to its current titleholder but to the commons &#8212; all
    of
    us, equally.&nbsp; Many of our most pressing social problems are the direct
    result of our current distorted way of approaching this. And they will be
    remedied only
    when we reform how we treat the commons, acknowledging them as such.</p>

  <p><small>The laws of this universe are
  the laws of God, the social laws
  as
  well as the physical laws, and He, the Creator of all, has given us
  room for all, work for all, plenty for all. </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>If today people are in
  places so crowded that it seems as though there were too many people
  in the world; </small><br>
  <small></small><br>
  <small>if today thousands of men who would gladly be at work
  do not find the opportunity to go to work; </small><br>
  <small></small><br>
  <small>if today the competition
  for employment crowds wages down to starvation rates; </small><br>
  <small></small><br>
  <small>if today,
  amidst abounding wealth, there are in the centers of our civilization
  human beings who are worse off than savages in any normal times, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it
  is not because the Creator has been niggardly; </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">it is simply
  because
  of our own injustice &#8212; simply because we have not carried the
  idea of doing to others as we would have them do unto us into the
  making of our statutes.</span></small></p>
  <p>      <small>The Anti-Poverty Society has no patent remedy for poverty. We
    propose
    no new thing. What we propose is simply to do justice. The principle
    that we propose to carry into our laws is neither more nor less than
    the golden rule. We propose to abolish poverty by the sovereign remedy
    of doing to others as we would have others do to us, by giving to all
    their just rights. <span style="font-weight: bold;">And we propose to
    begin by assuring to every child of God who, in our country, comes into
    this world, its full and equal share of the common heritage.</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Who can claim a title of absolute ownership in land? Until one
    who claims the exclusive ownership of a piece of this planet can show a
    title originating with the Maker of this planet; until that one can
    produce a decree from the Creator declaring that this city lot, or that
    great tract of agricultural or coal land, or that gas well, was made
    for that one person alone &#8212; until then we have a right to hold that the
    land was intended for all of us.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural religion and revealed
    religion alike tell us that God is no respecter of persons; that He did
    not make this planet for a few individuals; that He did not give it to
    one generation in preference to other generations, but that He made it
    for the use during their lives of all the people that His providence
    brings into the world. If this be true, the child that is born tonight
    in the humblest tenement in the most squalid quarter of New York, comes
    into life seized with as good a title to the land of this city as any
    Astor or Rhinelander.</span> ... </small><br>
    <br>
    <small>People do not have a natural right to demand employment of
    another, but they have a natural right, an inalienable right, a right
    given by their Creator, to demand opportunity to employ themselves. And
    whenever that right is acknowledged, whenever the people who want to go
    to work can find natural opportunities to work upon, then there will be
    as much competition among employers who are anxious to get people to
    work for them, as there will be among people who are anxious to get
    work.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Wages will rise in every vocation to the true rate of wages &#8212;
    the full, honest earnings of labor. That done, with this ever
    increasing social fund to draw upon, poverty will be abolished, and in
    a little while will come to be looked upon &#8212; as we are now beginning to
    look upon slavery &#8212; as the relic of a darker and more ignorant age.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>I remember &#8212; this man here remembers (turning to Mr. Redpath,
    who was on the platform) even better than I, for he was one of the men
    who brought the atrocities of human slavery home to the heart and
    conscience of the north &#8212; I well remember, as he well knows, and all
    the older men and women in this audience will remember, how property in
    human flesh and blood was defended just as private property in land is
    now defended; how the same charges were hurled upon the men and women
    who protested against human slavery as are now made against the men and
    women who are intending to abolish industrial slavery.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>We remember how some dignitaries and rich members of the
    churches branded as a disturber, almost as a reviler of religion, any
    priest or any minister who dared to get up and assert God&#8217;s truth &#8212; that
    there never was and there never could be rightful property in human flesh and
    blood.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">So, it is now said that people
    who protest against this system, which is simply another form of
    slavery, are people who propose robbery. Thus the commandment, "Thou
    shalt not steal," they have made "Thou shalt not object to stealing."
    When we propose to resume our own again, when we propose to secure its
    natural right to every child that comes into being, such people talk of
    us as advocating confiscation &#8212; charge us with being deniers of the
    rights of property. The real truth is that we wish to assert the just
    rights of property, that we wish to prevent theft.</span></small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Chattel slavery was incarnate theft of the worst kind. That
    system which made property of human beings, which allowed one person to
    sell another, which allowed one person to take away the proceeds of
    another&#8217;s toil, which permitted the tearing of the child from the
    mother, and which permitted the so-called owner to hunt with
    bloodhounds the person who escaped from the owner&#8217;s tyranny &#8212; that form
    of slavery is abolished. To that extent, the command, "Thou shalt not
    steal," has been vindicated; but there is another form of slavery.

  George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of Labor &#8212; An
  Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in
    general in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they
    please,&#8221; and regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by
    human laws. But such regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must
    secure to all equal participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general
    bounty. The principle is the same as where a human father leaves property
    equally to a number of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable
    of common use or of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned
    to some of the children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit
    among them all be preserved.</p>
  <p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing,
    and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of
    land is not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend
    their labor in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor
    is thus expended is needed to secure the right of property in the products
    of labor. For who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed
    to enable him to reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without
    such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
    different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
    The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
    self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
    exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
    ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
    so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
    of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others,
    he can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right to his share as against the other. <strong>But neither could rightfully
    continue such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into
    the world
    without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the
    use of God&#8217;s bounty. </strong>For them to refuse him any use of the
    earth which they had divided between them would therefore be for them to
    commit murder.
    And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them
    or by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
    would be for them to commit theft.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>  2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason</strong>.
    (6-7.)</p>
  <p>In the second place your Holiness argues that man possessing reason and
    forethought may not only acquire ownership of the fruits of the earth, but
    also of the earth itself, so that out of its products he may make provision
    for the future.</p>
  <p>Reason, with its attendant forethought, is indeed the distinguishing attribute
    of man; that which raises him above the brute, and shows, as the Scriptures
    declare, that he is created in the likeness of God. And this gift of reason
    does, as your Holiness points out, involve the need and right of private
    property in whatever is produced by the exertion of reason and its attendant
    forethought, as well as in what is produced by physical labor. In truth,
    these elements of man&#8217;s production are inseparable, and labor involves
    the use of reason. It is by his reason that man differs from the animals
    in being a producer, and in this sense a maker. Of themselves his physical
    powers are slight, forming as it were but the connection by which the mind
    takes hold of material things, so as to utilize to its will the matter and
    forces of nature. It is mind, the intelligent reason, that is the prime mover
    in labor, the essential agent in production.</p>
  <p>The right of private ownership does therefore indisputably attach to things
    provided by man&#8217;s reason and forethought. But it cannot attach to things
    provided by the reason and forethought of God!</p>
  <p>To illustrate: Let us suppose a company traveling through the desert as
    the Israelites traveled from Egypt. Such of them as had the forethought to
    provide themselves with vessels of water would acquire a just right of property
    in the water so carried, and in the thirst of the waterless desert those
    who had neglected to provide themselves, though they might ask water from
    the provident in charity, could not demand it in right. For while water itself
    is of the providence of God, the presence of this water in such vessels,
    at such place, results from the providence of the men who carried it. Thus
    they have to it an exclusive right.</p>
  <p>But suppose others use their forethought in pushing ahead and appropriating
    the springs, refusing when their fellows come up to let them drink of the
    water save as they buy it of them. Would such forethought give any right?</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, it is not the forethought of carrying water where it is needed,
    but the forethought of seizing springs, that you seek to defend in defending
    the private ownership of land!</p>
  <p>Let me show this more fully, since it may be worth while to meet those who
    say that if private property in land be not just, then private property in
    the products of labor is not just, as the material of these products is taken
    from land. It will be seen on consideration that all of man&#8217;s production
    is analogous to such transportation of water as we have supposed. In growing
    grain, or smelting metals, or building houses, or weaving cloth, or doing
    any of the things that constitute producing, all that man does is to change
    in place or form preexisting matter. As a producer man is merely a changer,
    not a creator; God alone creates. And since the changes in which man&#8217;s
    production consists inhere in matter so long as they persist, the right of
    private ownership attaches the accident to the essence, and gives the right
    of ownership in that natural material in which the labor of production is
    embodied. Thus water, which in its original form and place is the common
    gift of God to all men, when drawn from its natural reservoir and brought
    into the desert, passes rightfully into the ownership of the individual who
    by changing its place has produced it there.</p>
  <p>But such right of ownership is in reality a mere right of temporary possession.
    For though man may take material from the storehouse of nature and change
    it in place or form to suit his desires, yet from the moment he takes it,
    it tends back to that storehouse again. Wood decays, iron rusts, stone disintegrates
    and is displaced, while of more perishable products, some will last for only
    a few months, others for only a few days, and some disappear immediately
    on use. Though, so far as we can see, matter is eternal and force forever
    persists; though we can neither annihilate nor create the tiniest mote that
    floats in a sunbeam or the faintest impulse that stirs a leaf, yet in the
    ceaseless flux of nature, man&#8217;s work of moving and combining constantly
    passes away. Thus the recognition of the ownership of what natural material
    is embodied in the products of man never constitutes more than temporary
    possession &#8212; never interferes with the reservoir provided for all.
    As taking water from one place and carrying it to another place by no means
    lessens the store of water, since whether it is drunk or spilled or left
    to evaporate, it must return again to the natural reservoirs &#8212; so is
    it with all things on which man in production can lay the impress of his
    labor.</p>
  <p>Hence, when you say that man&#8217;s reason puts it within his right to
    have in stable and permanent possession not only things that perish in the
    using, but also those that remain for use in the future, you are right in
    so far as you may include such things as buildings, which with repair will
    last for generations, with such things as food or fire-wood, which are destroyed
    in the use. But when you infer that man can have private ownership in those
    permanent things of nature that are the reservoirs from which all must draw,
    you are clearly wrong. Man may indeed hold in private ownership the fruits
    of the earth produced by his labor, since they lose in time the impress of
    that labor, and pass again into the natural reservoirs from which they were
    taken, and thus the ownership of them by one works no injury to others. But
    he cannot so own the earth itself, for that is the reservoir from which must
    constantly be drawn not only the material with which alone men can produce,
    but even their very bodies.</p>
  <p>The conclusive reason why man cannot claim ownership in the earth itself
    as he can in the fruits that he by labor brings forth from it, is in the
    facts stated by you in the very next paragraph (7), when you truly say:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Man&#8217;s needs do not die out, but recur; satisfied today, they demand
        new supplies tomorrow. Nature, therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
      shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
      only in
        the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>By man you mean all men. Can what nature owes to all men be made the private
    property of some men, from which they may debar all other men?</p>
  <p>Let me dwell on the words of your Holiness, &#8220;Nature, therefore, owes
    to man a storehouse that shall never fail.&#8221; By Nature you mean God.
    Thus your thought, that in creating us, God himself has incurred an obligation
    to provide us with a storehouse that shall never fail, is the same as is
    thus expressed and carried to its irresistible conclusion by the Bishop of
    Meath:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>God was perfectly free in the act by which He created us; but having created
        us he bound himself by that act to provide us with the means necessary
      for our subsistence. The land is the only source of this kind now known
      to us.
        The land, therefore, of every country is the common property of the people
        of that country, because its real owner, the Creator who made it, has
      transferred it as a voluntary gift to them. &#8220;<em>Terram autem dedit
      filiis hominum</em>.&#8221; Now,
        as every individual in that country is a creature and child of God, and
      as all his creatures are equal in his sight, any settlement of the land
      of a
        country that would exclude the humblest man in that country from his
      share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice and a wrong
      to that
        man, but, moreover, be AN IMPIOUS RESISTANCE TO THE BENEVOLENT INTENTIONS
        OF HIS CREATOR. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>    And it is because that in what we propose &#8212;<strong> the securing to
    all men of equal natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers and
    the removal
    of all legal restriction on the legitimate exercise of those powers</strong> &#8212; we
    see the conformation of human law to the moral law, that we hold with confidence
    that this is not merely the sufficient remedy for all the evils you so strikingly
    portray, but that it is the only possible remedy.</p>
  <p>Nor is there any other. The organization of man is such, his relations to
    the world in which he is placed are such &#8212; that is to say, the immutable
    laws of God are such, that it is beyond the power of human ingenuity to devise
    any way by which the evils born of the injustice that robs men of their birthright
    can be removed otherwise than by doing justice, by opening to all the bounty
    that God has provided for all. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>But worse perhaps than all else is the way in which this substituting of
    vague injunctions to charity for the clear-cut demands of justice opens an
    easy means for the professed teachers of the Christian religion of all branches
    and communions to placate Mammon while persuading themselves that they are
    serving God. Had the English clergy not subordinated the teaching of justice
    to the teaching of charity &#8212; to go no further in illustrating a principle
    of which the whole history of Christendom from Constantine&#8217;s time to
    our own is witness &#8212; the Tudor tyranny would never have arisen, and
    the separation of the church been averted; had the clergy of France never
    substituted charity for justice, the monstrous iniquities of the ancient
    r&eacute;gime would never have brought the horrors of the Great Revolution;
    and in my own country had those who should have preached justice not satisfied
    themselves with preaching kindness, chattel slavery could never have demanded
    the holocaust of our civil war.</p>
  <p>No, your Holiness; as faith without works is dead, as men cannot give to
    God his due while denying to their fellows the rights be gave them, so charity
    unsupported by justice can do nothing to solve the problem of the existing
    condition of labor. Though the rich were to &#8220;bestow all their goods
    to feed the poor and give their bodies to be burned,&#8221; poverty would
    continue while property in land continues.</p>
  <p>Take the case of the rich man today who is honestly desirous of devoting
    his wealth to the improvement of the condition of labor. What can he do?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bestow his wealth on those who need it? He may help some who deserve
      it, but will not improve general conditions. And against the good he may
      do will be the danger of doing harm.</li>
    <li> Build churches? Under the shadow of churches poverty festers and the
      vice that is born of it breeds.</li>
    <li> Build schools and colleges? Save as it may lead men to see the iniquity
      of private property in land, increased education can effect nothing for
      mere laborers, for as education is diffused the wages of education sink.</li>
    <li> Establish hospitals? Why, already it seems to laborers that there are
      too many seeking work, and to save and prolong life is to add to the pressure.</li>
    <li> Build model tenements? Unless he cheapens house accommodations he but
      drives further the class he would benefit, and as he cheapens house accommodations
      he brings more to seek employment and cheapens wages.</li>
    <li> Institute laboratories, scientific schools, workshops for physical experiments?
      He but stimulates invention and discovery, the very forces that, acting
      on a society based on private property in land, are crushing labor as between
      the upper and the nether millstone.</li>
    <li> Promote emigration from places where wages are low to places where they
      are somewhat higher? If he does, even those whom he at first helps to emigrate
      will soon turn on him to demand that such emigration shall be stopped as
      reducing their wages.</li>
    <li> Give away what land he may have, or refuse to take rent for it, or let
      it at lower rents than the market price? He will simply make new landowners
      or partial landowners; he may make some individuals the richer, but he
      will do nothing to improve the general condition of labor.</li>
    <li> Or, bethinking himself of those public-spirited citizens of classic
      times who spent great sums in improving their native cities, shall he try
      to beautify the city of his birth or adoption? Let him widen and straighten
      narrow and crooked streets, let him build parks and erect fountains, let
      him open tramways and bring in railroads, or in any way make beautiful
      and attractive his chosen city, and what will be the result? Must it not
      be that those who appropriate God&#8217;s bounty will take his also? Will
      it not be that the value of land will go up, and that the net result of
      his benefactions will be an increase of rents and a bounty to landowners?
      Why, even the mere announcement that he is going to do such things will
      start speculation and send up the value of land by leaps and bounds.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What, then, can the rich man do to improve the condition of labor?</p>
  <p>He can do nothing at all except to use his strength for the abolition of
    the great primary wrong that robs men of their birthright. The justice of
    God laughs at the attempts of men to substitute anything else for it. </p>
  <p>If when in speaking of the practical measures your Holiness proposes, I
    did not note the moral injunctions that the Encyclical contains, it is not
    because we do not think morality practical. On the contrary it seems to us
    that in the teachings of morality is to be found the highest practicality,
    and that the question, What is wise? may always safely be subordinated to
    the question, What is right? But your Holiness in the Encyclical expressly
    deprives the moral truths you state of all real bearing on the condition
    of labor, just as the American people, by their legalization of chattel slavery,
    used to deprive of all practical meaning the declaration they deem their
    fundamental charter, and were accustomed to read solemnly on every national
    anniversary. That declaration asserts that &#8220;We hold these truths to
    be self-evident &#8212; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed
    by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
    liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; But what did this truth mean
    on the lips of men who asserted that one man was the rightful property of
    another man who had bought him; who asserted that the slave was robbing the
    master in running away, and that the man or the woman who helped the fugitive
    to escape, or even gave him a cup of cold water in Christ&#8217;s name, was
    an accessory to theft, on whose head the penalties of the state should be
    visited?</p>
  <p>Consider the moral teachings of the Encyclical:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You tell us that God owes to man an inexhaustible storehouse which he
      finds only in the land. Yet you support a system that denies to the great
      majority
            of men all right of recourse to this storehouse.</li>
    <li>You tell us that the necessity of labor is a consequence of original
      sin. Yet you support a system that exempts a privileged class from the
      necessity
            for labor and enables them to shift their share and much more than
      their share of labor on others.</li>
    <li>You tell us that God has not created us for the perishable and transitory
            things of earth, but has given us this world as a place of exile
      and not as our true country. Yet you tell us that some of the exiles have
      the
        exclusive
            right of ownership in this place of common exile, so that they may
      compel their fellow-exiles to pay them for sojourning here, and that this
      exclusive
            ownership they may transfer to other exiles yet to come, with the
      same right of excluding their fellows.</li>
    <li>You tell us that virtue is the common inheritance of all; that all men
        are children of God the common Father; that all have the same last end;
      that all are redeemed by Jesus Christ; that the blessings of nature and
      the
        gifts
            of grace belong in common to all, and that to all except the unworthy
        is promised the inheritance of the Kingdom of Heaven! <strong>Yet in
        all this and through
            all this you insist as a moral duty on the maintenance of a system
      that makes the reservoir of all God&#8217;s material bounties and blessings to man the
            exclusive property of a few of their number &#8212; you give us equal
            rights in heaven, but deny us equal rights on earth!</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It was said of a famous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States
          made just before the civil war, in a fugitive-slave case, that &#8220;it
          gave the law to the North and the nigger to the South.&#8221; It is thus
          that your Encyclical gives the gospel to laborers and the earth to the landlords.
          Is it really to be wondered at that there are those who sneeringly say, &#8220;The
          priests are ready enough to give the poor an equal share in all that is out
          of sight, but they take precious good care that the rich shall keep a tight
        grip on all that is within sight&#8221;? ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html"></a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
little Island or a little World</span></small><br>
<small>IMAGINE an island girt with ocean; imagine a little world
swimming
in space. Put on it, in imagination, human beings. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Let them divide
the land, share and share alike, as individual property. </span>At
first,
while population is sparse and industrial processes rude and
primitive, this will work well enough.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turn away the eyes of the mind for
a moment, let time pass, and
look again. Some families will have died out, some have greatly
multiplied; on the whole, population will have largely increased, and
even supposing there have been no important inventions or
improvements in the productive arts, the increase in population, by
causing the division of labor, will have made industry more complex.
During this time some of these people will have been careless,
generous, improvident; some will have been thrifty and grasping. Some
of them will have devoted much of their powers to thinking of how
they themselves and the things they see around them came to be, to
inquiries and speculations as to what there is in the universe beyond
their little island or their little world, to making poems, painting
pictures, or writing books; to noting the differences in rocks and
trees and shrubs and grasses; to classifying beasts and birds and
fishes and insects &#8211; to the doing, in short, of all the many
things which add so largely to the sum of human knowledge and human
happiness, without much or any gain of wealth to the doer. Others
again will have devoted all their energies to the extending of their
possessions. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What, then, shall we
see, land having been all this time
treated as private property? Clearly, we shall see that the primitive
equality has given way to inequality. Some will have very much more
than one of the original shares into which the land was divided; very
many will have no land at all.</span> Suppose that, in all things save
this,
our little island or our little world is Utopia &#8211; that there are
no wars or robberies; that the government is absolutely pure and
taxes nominal; suppose, if you want to, any sort of a currency;
imagine, if you can imagine such a world or island, that interest is
utterly abolished; yet <span style="font-weight: bold;">inequality in
the ownership of land will have
produced poverty and virtual slavery.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For the people we have supposed
are human beings &#8211; that is to
say, in their physical natures at least, they are animals who can
live only on land and by the aid of the products of land. They may
make machines which will enable them to float on the sea, or perhaps
to fly in the air, but to build and equip these machines they must
have land and the products of land, and must constantly come back to
land. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Therefore those who own the
land must be the masters of the
rest. Thus, if one man has come to own all the land, he is their
absolute master even to life or death. If they can live on the land
only on his terms, then they can live only on his terms, for without
land they cannot live. They are his absolute slaves, and so long as
his ownership is acknowledged, if they want to live, they must do in
everything as he wills.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If, however, the concentration of
landownership has not gone so
far as to make one or a very few men the owners of all the
land &#8211; if there are still so many landowners that there is
competition between them as well as between those who have only their
labor &#8211; then the terms on which these non-landholders can live
will <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">seem </span>more
like free contract. But it will not be free contract.
Land can yield no wealth without the application of labor; labor can
produce no wealth without land. These are the two equally necessary
factors of production. Yet, to say that they are equally necessary
factors of production is not to say that, in the making of contracts
as to how the results of production are divided, the possessors of
these two meet on equal terms. For the nature of these two factors is
very different. Land is a natural element; the human being must have
his stomach filled every few hours. Land can exist without labor, but
labor cannot exist without land. If I own a piece of land, I can let
it lie idle for a year or for years, and it will eat nothing. But the
laborer must eat every day, and his family must eat. And so, in the
making of terms between them, the landowner has an immense advantage
over the laborer. It is on the side of the laborer that the intense
pressure of competition comes, for in his case it is competition
urged by hunger. And, further than this: As population increases, as
the competition for the use of land becomes more and more intense, so
are the owners of land enabled to get for the use of their land a
larger and larger part of the wealth which labor exerted upon it
produces. That is to say, the value of land steadily rises. Now, this
steady rise in the value of land brings about a confident expectation
of future increase of value, which produces among landowners all the
effects of a combination to hold for higher prices. Thus there is a
constant tendency to force mere laborers to take less and less or to
give more and more (put it which way you please, it amounts to the
same thing) of the products of their work for the opportunity to
work. And thus, in the very nature of things, we should see on our
little island or our little world that, after a time had passed, some
of the people would be able to take and enjoy a superabundance of all
the fruits of labor without doing any labor at all, while others
would be forced to work the livelong day for a pitiful living.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But let us introduce another
element into the supposition. Let us
suppose great discoveries and inventions &#8211; such as the
steam-engine, the power-loom, the Bessemer process, the
reaping-machine, and the thousand and one labor-saving devices that
are such a marked feature of our era. What would be the result?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Manifestly, the effect of all such
discoveries and inventions is
to increase the power of labor in producing wealth &#8211; to enable the
same amount of wealth to be produced by less labor, or a greater
amount with the same labor. But none of them lessen, or can lessen
the necessity for land. Until we can discover some way of making
something out of nothing &#8211; and that is so far beyond our powers as
to be absolutely unthinkable &#8211; there is no possible discovery or
invention which can lessen the dependence of labor upon land. And,
this being the case, the effect of these labor-saving devices, land
being the private property of some, would simply be to increase the
proportion of the wealth produced that landowners could demand for
the use of their land. The ultimate effect of these discoveries and
inventions would be not to benefit the laborer, but to make him more
dependent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And, since we are imagining
conditions, imagine laborsaving
inventions to go to the farthest imaginable point, that is to say, to
perfection. What then? Why then, the necessity for labor being done
away with, all the wealth that the land could produce would go entire
to the landowners. None of it whatever could be claimed by any one
else. For the laborers there would be no use at all. If they
continued to exist, it would be merely as paupers on the bounty of
the landowners! <strong>...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Civilization that is
Possible.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IN the effects upon the
distribution of wealth, of making land
private property, we may thus see an explanation of that paradox
presented by modern progress. The perplexing phenomena of deepening
want with increasing wealth, of labor rendered more dependent and
helpless by the very introduction of labor-saving machinery, are the
inevitable result of natural laws as fixed and certain as the law of
gravitation. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Private property in land
is the primary cause of the
monstrous inequalities which are developing in modern society.</span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small> </small><li><small>It is
this, and not any miscalculation of Nature in bringing into the world
more mouths than she can feed, that gives rise to that tendency of
wages to a minimum &#8211; that "iron law of wages," as the Germans call
it -- that, in spite of all advances in productive power, compels the
laboring-classes to the least return on which they will consent to
live. 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>It is this that produces all those
phenomena that are so often
attributed to the conflict of labor and capital. 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>It is this that
condemns Irish peasants to rags and hunger, that produces the
pauperism of England and the tramps of America. 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>It is this that makes
the almshouse and the penitentiary the marks of what we call high
civilization; 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>that in the midst of schools and churches
degrades and
brutalizes men, crushes the sweetness out of womanhood and the joy
out of childhood. 
    </small></li>
  <small> </small><li><small>It is this that makes lives that might be
a
blessing a pain and a curse, and every year drives more and more to
seek unbidden refuge in the gates of death. 
    </small></li>
  <small></small>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For, a permanent tendency
to inequality once set up, all the forces of progress tend to greater
and greater inequality.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">All
this is contrary to Nature. The
poverty and misery, the vice
and degradation, that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth,
are not the results of natural law; they spring from our defiance of
natural law. They are the fruits of our refusal to obey the supreme
law of justice. It is because we rob the child of his birthright;
because we make the bounty which the Creator intended for all the
exclusive property of some, that these things come upon us, and,
though advancing and advancing, we chase but the mirage</span>. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I doubt not that whichever way a
man may turn to inquire of
Nature, he will come upon adjustments which will arouse not merely
his wonder, but his gratitude. Yet what has most impressed me with
the feeling that the laws of Nature are the laws of beneficent
intelligence is what I see of the social possibilities involved in
the law of rent. Rent <font size="-2"><small><b><i>(4)</i></b></small></font>
springs from natural causes. It arises, as society develops, from the
differences in natural opportunities and the differences in the
distribution of population. It increases with the division of labor,
with the advance of the arts, with the progress of invention. And
thus, by virtue of a law impressed upon the very nature of things,
has the Creator provided that the natural advance of mankind shall be
an advance toward equality, an advance toward cooperation, an advance
toward a social state in which not even the weakest need be crowded
to the wall, in which even for the unfortunate and the cripple there
may be ample provision. For this revenue, which arises from the
common property, which represents not the creation of value by the
individual, but the creation by the community as a whole, which
increases just as society develops, affords a common fund, which,
properly used, tends constantly to equalize conditions, to open the
largest opportunities for all, and utterly to banish want or the fear
of want.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> </small>
  <blockquote><small><font size="-1"><small>(4) I, of course, use the
word in its
economic, not in its common sense, meaning by it what is commonly
called ground-rent.</small></font></small></blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The squalid poverty that festers
in the heart of our civilization,
the vice and crime and degradation and ravening greed that flow from
it, are the results of a treatment of land that ignores the simple
law of justice, a law so clear and plain that it is universally
recognized by the veriest savages. <span style="font-weight: bold;">What
is by nature the common
birthright of all, we have made the exclusive property of
individuals; what is by natural law the common fund, from which
common wants should be met, we give to a few that they may lord it
over their fellows. And so some are gorged while some go hungry, and
more is wasted than would suffice to keep all in luxury. </span></small><small>...

    at the door of a theater and passes in, acquire by his priority the right
    to shut the doors and have the performance go on for him alone? Does the
    first passenger who enters a railroad car obtain the right to scatter his
    baggage over all the seats and compel the passengers who come in after him
    to stand up? <br>
              <br>
  The cases are perfectly analogous. We arrive and we depart, guests at a banquet
  continually spread, spectators and participants in an entertainment where there
  is room for all who come; passengers from station to station, on an orb that
  whirls through space &#8212; our rights to take and possess cannot be exclusive;
  they must be bounded everywhere by the equal rights of others. Just as the
  passenger in a railroad car may spread himself and his baggage over as many
  seats as he pleases, until other passengers come in, so may a settler take
  and use as much land as he chooses, until it is needed by others &#8212; a
  fact which is shown by the land acquiring a value &#8212; when his right must
  be curtailed by the equal rights of the others, and no priority of appropriation
  can give a right which will bar these equal rights of others. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p>THE general subjection of the many to the few, which we meet with wherever
    society has reached a certain development, has resulted from the appropriation
    of land as individual property. It is the ownership of the soil that everywhere
    gives the ownership of the men that live upon it. It is slavery of this kind
    to which the enduring pyramids and the colossal monuments of Egypt yet bear
    witness, and of the institution of which we have, perhaps, a vague tradition
    in the biblical story of the famine during which the Pharaoh purchased up
    the lands of the people. It was slavery of this kind to which, in the twilight
    of history, the conquerors of Greece reduced the original inhabitants of
    that peninsula, transforming them into helots by making them pay rent for
    their lands. It was the growth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">latifundia</span>,
    or great landed estates, which transmuted the population of ancient Italy
    from a race of hardy husbandmen, whose robust virtues conquered the world,
    into a race of cringing bondsmen; it was the appropriation of the land as
    the absolute property of their chieftains which gradually turned the descendants
    of free and equal Gallic, Teutonic and Hunnish warriors into colonii and
    villains, and which changed the independent burghers of Sclavonic village
    communities into the boors of Russia and the serfs of Poland; which instituted
    the feudalism of China and Japan, as well as that of Europe, and which made
    the High Chiefs of Polynesia the all but absolute masters of their fellows.
    How it came to pass that the Aryan shepherds and warriors who, as comparative
    philology tells us, descended from the common birth-place of the Indo-Germanic
    race into the lowlands of India, were turned into the suppliant and cringing
    Hindoo, the Sanscrit verse which I have before quoted gives us a hint. The
    white parasols and the elephants mad with pride of the Indian Rajah are the
    flowers of grants of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

TRACE to their root the causes that are thus producing want in the midst of plenty,
ignorance in the midst of intelligence, aristocracy in democracy, weakness in
strength &#8212; that are giving to our civilization a one-sided and unstable
development, and you will find it something which this Hebrew statesman three
thousand years ago perceived and guarded against. Moses saw that the real cause
of the enslavement of the masses of Egypt was, what has everywhere produced enslavement,
the possession by a class of the land upon which, and from which, the whole people
must live. He saw that to permit in land the same unqualified private ownership
that by natural right attaches to the things produced by labor, would be inevitably
to separate the people into the very rich and the very poor, inevitably to enslave
labor &#8212; to make the few the masters of. the many, no matter what the political
forms, to bring vice and degradation, no matter what the religion.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
And with the foresight of the philosophic statesman who legislates not for the
need of a day, but for all the future, he sought, in ways suited to his times
and conditions, to guard against this error. &#8212; <a href="Moses.html">Moses</a><br>

    Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
    Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had the pleasure of making her acquaintance,
      because she lives in a lunatic asylum, which does not happen to be on my
    visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent from birth. She is
    well taken
      care of, because her father left her when he died the income of a large
    farm on the outskirts of a city. The city has since grown and the land is
    now worth,
      at conservative estimate, about twenty million dollars. It is covered with
      office buildings, and the greater part of the income, which cannot be spent
      by the woman, is piling up at compound interest. The woman enjoys good
    health, so she may be worth a hundred million dollars before she dies.</p>
  <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
      this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million dollars.
      And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation, which would
      he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society which compels
      thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order to pay her the income
      of twenty million dollars?</p>
  <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it easy to see that she is not
    entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But how about all
      the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation the most
      desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because of anything these
      owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they render to the community &#8212; but
      purely because the community as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood
      and must have use of the land.</p>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.</p>
  <p>This condition wrecked every empire in the history of mankind, and it is
    wrecking modern civilization. One of the first to perceive this was Henry
    George, and
      he worked out the program known as the Single Tax. Let society as a whole
    take the full rental value of land, so that no one would any longer be able
    to hold
      land out of use. So the value of land would decrease, and everyone could
    have land, and the community would have a great income to be spent for social
    ends. ...</p>
  <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy families,
      living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here and there among
      these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned what he is consuming,
      and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing still less to his
      children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest their money without
      breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn about
      this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its
      people are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
      land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read the whole article </a></p>

  <p>    This earth is a little raft moving in the endless sea of space, and the

    It is as if some raft filled with shipwrecked sailors should be floating
    on the
                ocean, and a few of the strongest and most powerful would take
    all the
                raft they could get and leave the most of the people, especially
      the
          ones who did the work, hanging to the edges by their eyebrows. These
    men who
                have taken possession of this raft, this little planet in this
    endless space, are not even content with taking all there is and leaving
      the rest barely enough to hold onto, but they think so much of themselves
    and their
                brief day that while they live they must make rules and laws
    and regulations
                that parcel out the earth for thousands of years after they are
    dead and, gone, so that their descendants and others of their kind may do

      the great mass
                of mankind to toil for them.</p>
  <p>Now, the question is, how are you going to get it back? Everybody who thinks
          knows that private ownership of the land is wrong. If ten thousand
    men can own America, then one man can own it, and if one man may own it he
    may take
          all that the rest produce or he may kill them if he sees fit. It is
    inconsistent
          with the spirit of manhood. <strong>No person who thinks can doubt
          but that he was born upon this planet with the same birthright that
          came to every

        born
          like him. And it is for him to defend that birthright. And the man

        the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
        expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community

  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly

with the Land Question. He has given us a true base line -- man&#8217;s equal
right to the raw material of the earth, to the air, to the water, to
the rays of the sun, and all natural products -- from which we can work
out any problem, and by which we can test the &#8220;title and measure&#8221; of

have the question in a nutshell. Take away the base line, and you have
no right to labour, and no produce or reward, except what may be meted
out by the usurper of your natural rights. You have to beg for leave to
toil! We thus see clearly how the robbery of labour may be prevented,

their right to an equal share in the earth, and all its natural

else required for its subsistence. The monster that would deprive a

<p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and
    the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
    argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity, and
    are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained them
    from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and natural
    resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every one of the
    N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal beds, 1/Nth of
    the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile soil. God wills
    a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own vine and his own
    fig tree.</p>
  <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
    land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
    of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
    Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
    use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
    years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
    owner.</p>
  <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
    of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
    expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
    owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
    a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here I
    am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
    in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
  <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
    of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on it,
    practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the original
    sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold his &quot;fair
    share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal to
    his dividend check, and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land is meant
    land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the country.</p>
  <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
    as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
    more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
    to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
    the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
  <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
    at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to
    feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth
    of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family
    of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will
    enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that
    land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course, they
    may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the situation
    from which we start is one in which everyone has his own plot of ground from
    which to wrest a living by the strength of his own back, and any deviation
    from this is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly
    involved, who judge themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
  <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
    conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
    land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
    or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
    uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
    (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
    of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
    means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the people.
    Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
    term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that the
    landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
    for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to property
    other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings on
    the land that is being seized.</p>
  <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
    support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
    Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
    Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
    F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by
    Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the
    Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight of the
    Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the proposals
    of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>,
    1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani, 1985;
    James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
    S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
  <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
    cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
    tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about
    to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land
    and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real estate
    assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make the two assessments
    separately, and a parcel of land in the business district of a large city

    moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements, and most
    have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are more likely

    -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they improve their land

  <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
    proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental and
    reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results of
    a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the difference
    in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other proposals of
    the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me absolute dictator
    of the world so that I can supervise the distribution, and if it doesn't
    work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that absolute dictators seldom

Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics 
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The heart of George&#8217;s economics
was, in a way, Biblical. As the son of
a religious book publisher born in Philadelphia, he had adequate
opportunity to witness the early growth of the American republic in a
unique way. On his own in San Francisco and responsible for a wife and
child at a young age, his first effort at resolving the puzzles of
injustice were a manuscript printed in 1871. But only after additional
exposure to Ricardian rent theory was he able to refine his ideas such
that they could form the basis of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span> eight years
later. His Christian roots led him to a deep commitment to the basic
moral equality of all people; his challenge was to find a way to ensure
that this equality was manifest in economic fairness.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As noted earlier, the starting point of Georgist philosophy is
that
nature belongs to owners only in usufruct and not in freehold. Because
any monetary wealth that accrued to that nature stemmed directly from
the physical presence of people and was therefore social in character,
the resulting added increment of value that constituted rent belonged
in turn to the community that created it. Nature would have no economic
price without people. Hence rent was the community&#8217;s entitlement and
not that of individuals, and the land rent that accrued to parcels as a
result of social investment should be returned to &#8212; recaptured by &#8212; the
community. It was obvious to George
that the wealthiest people in the nation usually owed their fortune not
to the sweat of their brow or the inventiveness of their minds. Rather
their position was due to their success as land speculators, to an
increase in rent on land they had captured title to, land rightfully
belonging to all.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The earth and all
its product, he argued, was
the common heritage of humanity, a birthright of all people.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Any failure to pay back that
increment to society, or of government to
recapture it in the form of taxes, constituted not only an injustice to
the poor but a distortion of economic equilibrium. </span>He witnessed
first
hand the perverted configurations of land use that today we know as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sprawl </span>development&#8212; even in his
time it was apparent that urban, high value land parcels were being
held off the market for speculative gain by meretricious interests. He
witnessed also the boom and bust cycles of the land markets on account
of such speculation, effects which spread far wider than just land
prices. These inevitable cycles would dislocate labor and capital
supply, giving impetus to the impoverishment and suffering which he
himself had experienced. He understood that holding the most
strategically valuable landsites out of circulation constituted a
burden on the economy. He understood that financial resources spent to
pay exorbitant land prices had a depressing effect on capital and
labor. And because government was taxing labor and capital instead of
recovering land rent, it was further restricting the job market and the
growth of capital. He realized that people who captured monopoly
control of strategically valuable landsites could do so because they
were privy to information prior to its public release. It was not by
any means his insight alone; it was captured also by George Washington
Plunkett writing at the same time:</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All society needed to do was to
collect the economic rent from
landholders as its rightful due, a solution that became part of the
subtitle of his book, &#8220;the remedy.&#8221; Taxing the land (or, alternatively,
collecting the economic rent) was something common citizens could
understand....</small><br>

consequences of its treatment. Airport landing slots, &#8220;prime time&#8221;
broadcasting, and many other time-sensitive dimensions have all been
handed over to the private sector with nominal benefit to the public.
London Mayor Ken Livingstone has been a strong supporter of renting the

the failure to collect it and to use it to pay for the general costs of
government services is a moral as well as a public policy lapse.
Georgists regard the private confiscation of public wealth as mistaken
policy if not actually an immoral transgression &#8212; in a word, theft! He
himself was an advocate of the public owning and protecting &#8220;the
commons&#8221; and what is today often called &#8220;natural capital.&#8221; Studies have
shown that if economic rent were collected in full as well as other
appropriate revenues such as user fees and green taxes, the total
income would likely be enough to pay not only the costs of all
government services but provide a citizens&#8217; dividend of significant
amounts as well.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">48 </span></small>Statistical
data is difficult to compile, but what studies have been attempted to
date indicate that economic rent in all its forms and from all its
sources
comprises approximately a third of the economy as it is currently
calculated.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">49</span></small>
Arrangements such as these are to the followers of Henry
George a far more efficient and moral system of public finance. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">POINTS
OF SYNTHESIS OF GEORGIST AND
ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS</span></small><br>
<small>The commonalities of Georgist economics and ecological economics
appear
to be organizable into six general points: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1) preservation of the commons, <br>
2) sustainable development, <br>
3) appropriate valuation of natural capital, <br>
4) ensuring social and biological community, <br>
5) fostering individual self-realization, and <br>
6) securing economic justice. <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Implicit in all these points is
the view that market activity needs to
be circumscribed and juxtaposed to the non-human, biological realm. It
appears that there is lots to be gained by some synthesis of the two
fields of discourse.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Ecological economists worry about the encroachment, and even the
elimination, of those elements of nature to which private property
title has not been granted. In their concern about the need to protect
the &#8220;commons,&#8221; they are torn between the view that only through
privatization can all the world&#8217;s assets be preserved and the
alternative view that any private appropriation of the commons
constitutes a moral compromise. They fear a repeat of Garrett Hardin&#8217;s
&#8220;tragedy of the commons.&#8221; Their argument often proposed is rather
complex to explicate: it assumes that private property titles may
perhaps provide the best incentive not to exploit the fruits of the
earth and the earth itself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">126</span></small> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To
Georgists, on the other hand, the earth and all its resources are
already in fact the birthright of all humanity; individuals are
entitled to its use in return for the payment of rents. Further
privatization is anathema.</span> The key rather is in distinguishing
the
various components of ownership and getting prices right &#8212; mainly in
the
collection of economic rents.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The grant of land sites and
other natural resources to individuals and corporations in leasehold
rather than freehold has an additional advantage beyond the revenue
collected in rent to support the general purposes of government. This
is the restoration of ownership of the earth to all people: what in
Georgist terms and in classical philosophy is their birthright.
Acknowledgment that the earth belongs to us all, and is both our
entitlement and our responsibility, has the effect of enfranchising the
people of the earth everywhere, perhaps ennobling them as well. At a
time in human history when the incomes of the world&#8217;s people are
increasingly disparate, and where wealth is even more unequally
distributed, it must be recognized that titles to the resources of the
earth are the most unequally, and unjustly, distributed of all.&nbsp;
Recognition of this truth may come as a revelation; indeed it may well
be revolutionary in some circles. But restoration of birthrights to
which all people have a just and proper claim may be the single most
important and effective means by which to facilitate and ensure
sustainable economic policies worldwide. </small>...... <small><a

bias) have as much right to emit as victims (he says receptors) have
to breathe clean air. It doesn&#8217;t matter, says Coase, how we
assign property rights originally: as long as property is firm, the
market will sort it all out. However, since emitters have invested in
costly facilities, and property is sacred... you see whither this
unbiased science is tending.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Was he laughed to scorn? <span

they already pay those who supply them with land to live on. Only
welfare bums would expect property owners to dip into their
hard-earned savings and supply them with free air, when the market
has a solution at hand. All they need do is buy offset rights from
Ancient and Honorable Emitters. When they want to breathe, they just
retire the rights upwind of them. This is a marvel of efficiency,
too. They retire only what it takes to clean the air they need: no
waste.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If they can&#8217;t afford to buy
outright, they could rent --
markets have ingenious solutions for all problems, like any good

      3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s tempting to believe that private owners, by pursuing their own
    self-interest, can preserve shared inheritances. No one likes being told
    what to do, and words like statism conjure fears of bureaucracy at best and
    tyranny at worst. By contrast, privatism connotes freedom.</p>
  <p>In this chapter, we look at Garrett Hardin&#8217;s second alternative for
    saving the commons: privatism, or privatization. I argue that private corporations,
    operating in unconstrained markets, can allocate resources efficiently but
    can&#8217;t preserve them. The latter task requires setting aside some supplies
    for future generations &#8212; something neither markets nor corporations,
    when left to their own devices, will do. The reason lies in the algorithms
    and starting conditions of our current operating system. ...</p>
  <p>Free Market Environmentalism<br>
    One other version of privatism is worth considering. Its premise is that
      nature can be preserved, and pollution reduced, by expanding private property
      rights. This line of thought is called free market environmentalism, and
      it&#8217;s favored by libertarian think tanks such as the Cato Institute.</p>
  <p>The origins of free market environmentalism go back to an influential paper
    by University of Chicago economist Ronald Coase. Writing in 1960, Coase challenged
    the then-prevailing orthodoxy that government regulation is the only way
    to protect nature. In fact, he argued, nature can be protected through property
    rights, provided they&#8217;re clearly defined and the cost of enforcing
    them is low.</p>
  <p>In Coase&#8217;s model, pollution is a two-sided problem involving a polluter
    and a pollutee. If one side has clear property rights (for instance, if the
    polluter has a right to emit, or the pollutee has a right not to be emitted
    upon), and transaction costs are low, the two sides will come to a deal that
    reduces pollution.</p>
  <p>How will this happen? Let&#8217;s say the pollutee has a right to clean
    air. He could, under common law, sue the polluter for damages. To avoid such
    potential losses, the polluter is willing to pay the pollutee a sum of money
    up front. The pollutee is willing to accept compensation for the inconvenience
    and discomfort caused by the pollution. They agree on a level of pollution
    and a payment that&#8217;s satisfactory to both.</p>
  <p>It works the other way, too. If the polluter has the right to pollute, the
    pollutee offers him money to pollute less, and the same deal is reached.
    This pollution level &#8212; which is greater than zero but less than the
    polluter would emit if pollution were free &#8212; is, in the language of
    economists, optimal. (Whether it&#8217;s best for nature is another matter.)
    It&#8217;s arrived at because the polluter&#8217;s externalities have been
    internalized.</p>
  <p>For fans of privatism, Coase&#8217;s theorem was an intellectual breakthrough.
    It gave theoretical credence to the idea that the marketplace, not government,
    is the place to tackle pollution. Instead of burdening business with page
    after page of regulations, all government has to do is assign property rights
    and let markets handle the rest.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s much that&#8217;s attractive in free market environmentalism.
    Anything that makes the lives of business managers simpler is, to my mind,
    a good thing &#8212; not just for business, but for nature and society as
    a whole. It&#8217;s good because things that are simple for managers to do
    will get done, and often quickly, while things that are complicated may never
    get done. Right now, we need to get our economic activity in harmony with
    nature. We need to do that quickly, and at the lowest possible cost. If it&#8217;s
    easiest for managers to act when they have prices, then let&#8217;s give
    them prices, not regulations and exhortations.</p>
  <p>At the same time, there are critical pieces missing in free market environmentalism.
    First and foremost, it lacks a solid rationale for how property rights to
    nature should be assigned. Coase argued that pollution levels will be the
    same no matter how those rights are apportioned. Although this may be true
    in the world of theory, it makes a big difference to people&#8217;s pocketbooks
    whether pollutees pay polluters, or vice versa.</p>
  <p><strong>Most free marketers seem to think pollution rights should be given
      free to polluters. In their view, the citizen&#8217;s right to be free
      of pollution is trumped by the polluter&#8217;s right to pollute. Taking
      the opposite tack, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the Natural Resources
      Defense Council, argues that polluters have long been trespassing on common
      property and that this trespass is a form of subsidy that ought to end.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The question for me is, what&#8217;s the best way to assign property
      rights when our goal is to protect a birthright shared by everyone?</strong> It
      turns out this is a complicated matter, but one we need to explore. There&#8217;s
      no textbook way to &#8220;propertize&#8221; nature. (When I say to propertize,
      I mean to treat an aspect of nature as property, thus making it ownable.
      Privatization goes further and assigns that property to corporate owners.)
      In fact, there are different ways to propertize nature, with dramatically
      different consequences. And since we&#8217;ll be living with these new
      property rights &#8212; and paying rent to their owners &#8212; for a long
      time, it behooves us to get them right. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    and a payment that&#8217;s satisfactory to both.</p>
  <p>It works the other way, too. If the polluter has the right to pollute, the
    pollutee offers him money to pollute less, and the same deal is reached.
    This pollution level &#8212; which is greater than zero but less than the
    polluter would emit if pollution were free &#8212; is, in the language of
    economists, optimal. (Whether it&#8217;s best for nature is another matter.)
    It&#8217;s arrived at because the polluter&#8217;s externalities have been
    internalized.</p>
  <p>For fans of privatism, Coase&#8217;s theorem was an intellectual breakthrough.
    It gave theoretical credence to the idea that the marketplace, not government,
    is the place to tackle pollution. Instead of burdening business with page
    after page of regulations, all government has to do is assign property rights
    and let markets handle the rest.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s much that&#8217;s attractive in free market environmentalism.
    Anything that makes the lives of business managers simpler is, to my mind,
    a good thing &#8212; not just for business, but for nature and society as
    a whole. It&#8217;s good because things that are simple for managers to do
    will get done, and often quickly, while things that are complicated may never
    get done. Right now, we need to get our economic activity in harmony with
    nature. We need to do that quickly, and at the lowest possible cost. If it&#8217;s
    easiest for managers to act when they have prices, then let&#8217;s give
    them prices, not regulations and exhortations.</p>
  <p>At the same time, there are critical pieces missing in free market environmentalism.
    First and foremost, it lacks a solid rationale for how property rights to
    nature should be assigned. Coase argued that pollution levels will be the
    same no matter how those rights are apportioned. Although this may be true
    in the world of theory, it makes a big difference to people&#8217;s pocketbooks
    whether pollutees pay polluters, or vice versa.</p>
  <p>Most free marketers seem to think pollution rights should be given free
    to polluters. In their view, the citizen&#8217;s right to be free of pollution
    is trumped by the polluter&#8217;s right to pollute. Taking the opposite
    tack, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
    Council, argues that polluters have long been trespassing on common property
    and that this trespass is a form of subsidy that ought to end.</p>
  <p>The question for me is, what&#8217;s the best way to assign property rights
    when our goal is to protect a <strong>birthright</strong> shared by everyone?
    It turns out this is a complicated matter, but one we need to explore. There&#8217;s
    no textbook way to &#8220;propertize&#8221; nature. (When I say to propertize,
    I mean to treat an aspect of nature as property, thus making it ownable.
    Privatization goes further and assigns that property to corporate owners.)
    In fact, there are different ways to propertize nature, with dramatically
    different consequences. And since we&#8217;ll be living with these new property
    rights &#8212; and paying rent to their owners &#8212; for a long time, it
    behooves us to get them right. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">ONE PERSON, ONE SHARE</font></strong></p>
  <p>Modern democratic government is grounded on the principle of one person,
        one vote. In the same way, the modern commons sector would be grounded
        on the principle of one person, one share. In the case of scarce natural
        assets, it will be necessary to distinguish between usage rights and
    income rights. It&#8217;s impossible for everyone to use a limited commons
    equally, but everyone should receive equal shares of the income derived from
    selling
        limited usage rights.</p>
  <p><strong><font size="-1">INCLUDE SOME LIQUIDITY</font></strong><br>
      Currently, private property owners enjoy a near-monopoly on the privilege
        of receiving property income. But as the Alaska Permanent Fund shows,
        it&#8217;s
        possible for common property co-owners to receive income too.</p>
  <p>Income sharing would end private property&#8217;s monopoly not only on
        liquidity, but also on attention. People would notice common property if
        they got income from it. They&#8217;d care about it, think about it,
        and talk about it. Concern for invisible commons would soar.</p>
  <p>Common property liquidity has to be designed carefully, though. Since
        common property rights are birthrights, they shouldn&#8217;t be tradeable
        the way corporate shares are. This means commons owners wouldn&#8217;t
        reap capital gains. Instead, they&#8217;d retain their shared income
        stakes throughout their lives, and through such stakes, share in rent,
        royalties,
        interest, and dividends. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 7: Universal Birthrights (pages 101-116)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
      equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
      Rights,
      that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</em>    &#8212;
    U.S. Declaration of Independence, 1776</p>
  <p>The Idea of Birthrights</p>
  <p>John Locke&#8217;s response to royalty&#8217;s claim of divine right was
    the idea of everyone&#8217;s inherent right to life, liberty, and property.
    Thomas Jefferson, in drafting America&#8217;s Declaration of Independence,
    changed Locke&#8217;s trinity to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
    These, Jefferson and his collaborators agreed, are gifts from the creator
    that can&#8217;t be taken away. Put slightly differently, they&#8217;re universal
    birthrights.</p>
  <p>The Constitution and its amendments added meat to these elegant bones. They
    guaranteed such birthrights as free speech, due process, habeas corpus, speedy
    public trials, and secure homes and property. Wisely, the Ninth Amendment
    affirmed that &#8220;the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
    shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&#8221; In
    that spirit, others have since been added.</p>
  <p>If we were to analyze the expansion of American birthrights, we&#8217;d
    see a series of waves. The first wave consisted of rights against the state.
    The second included rights against unequal treatment based on race, nationality,
    gender, or sexual orientation. The third wave &#8212; which, historically
    speaking, is just beginning &#8212; consists of rights not against things,
    but for things &#8212; free public education, collective bargaining for wages,
    security in old age. They can be thought of as rights necessary for the pursuit
    of happiness.</p>
  <p>What makes this latest wave of birthrights strengthen community is their
    universality. If some Americans could enjoy free public education while others
    couldn&#8217;t, the resulting inequities would divide rather than unite us
    as a nation. The universality of these rights puts everyone in the same boat.
    It spreads risk, responsibility, opportunity, and reward across race, gender,
    economic classes, and generations. It makes us a nation rather than a collection
    of isolated individuals.</p>
  <p>Universality is also what distinguishes the commons sector from the corporate
    sector. The starting condition for the corporate sector, as we&#8217;ve seen,
    is that the top 5 percent owns more shares than everyone else. The starting
    condition for the commons sector, by contrast, is one person, one share.</p>
  <p>The standard argument against third wave universal birthrights is that,
    while they might be nice in theory, in practice they are too expensive. They
    impose an unbearable burden on &#8220;the economy&#8221; &#8212; that is,
    on the winners in unfettered markets. Much better, therefore, to let everyone &#8212; including
    poor children and the sick &#8212; fend for themselves. In fact, the opposite
    is often true: universal birthrights, as we&#8217;ll see, can be cheaper
    and more efficient than individual acquisition. Moreover, they are always
    fairer.</p>
  <p>How far we might go down the path of extending universal birthrights is
    anyone&#8217;s guess, but we&#8217;re now at the point where, economically
    speaking, we can afford to go farther. Without great difficulty, we could
    add three birthrights to our economic operating system: one would pay everyone
    a regular dividend, the second would give every child a start-up stake, and
    the third would reduce and share medical costs. Whether we add these birthrights
    or not isn&#8217;t a matter of economic ability, but of attitude and politics.</p>
  <p>Why attitude? Americans suffer from a number of confusions. We think it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221; to
    give people &#8220;something for nothing,&#8221; despite the fact that corporations
    take common wealth for nothing all the time. We believe the poor are poor
    and the rich are rich because they deserve to be, but don&#8217;t consider
    that millions of Americans work two or three jobs and still can&#8217;t make
    ends meet. Plus, we think tinkering with the &#8220;natural&#8221; distribution
    of income is &#8220;socialism,&#8221; or &#8220;big government,&#8221; or
    some other manifestation of evil, despite the fact that our current distribution
    of income isn&#8217;t &#8220;natural&#8221; at all, but rigged from the get-go
    by maldistributed property.</p>
  <p>The late John Rawls, one of America&#8217;s leading philosophers, distinguished
    between pre distribution of property and re distribution of income. Under
    income re distribution, money is taken from &#8220;winners&#8221; and transferred
    to &#8220;losers.&#8221; Understandably, this isn&#8217;t popular with winners,
    who tend to control government and the media. Under property pre distribution,
    by contrast, the playing field is leveled by spreading property ownership
    before income is generated. After that, there&#8217;s no need for income
    redistribution; property itself distributes income to all. According to Rawls,
    while income re distribution creates dependency, property predistribution
    empowers.</p>
  <p>But how can we spread property ownership without taking property from some
    and giving it to others? The answer lies in the commons &#8212; wealth that
    already belongs to everyone. By propertizing (without privatizing) some of
    that wealth, we can make everyone a property owner.</p>
  <p>What&#8217;s interesting is that, for purely ecological reasons, we need
    to propertize (without privatizing) some natural wealth now. This twenty-first
    century necessity means we have a chance to save the planet, and as a bonus,
    add a universal birthright. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction to
        Henry George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
is the law of human progress?&nbsp;</span></small><br>
<small>George saw ours alone among the civilizations of the world as
still progressing; all others had either petrified or had vanished.
And in our civilization he had already detected alarming evidences of
corruption and decay. So he sought out the forces that create
civilization and the forces that destroy it. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He found the incentives to
progress to be the desires inherent in
human nature, and the motor of progress to be what he called mental
power. But the mental power that is available for progress is only
what remains after nonprogressive demands have been met. These
demands George listed as maintenance and conflict. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his isolated state, primitive
man's powers are required simply
to maintain existence; only as he begins to associate in communities
and to enjoy the resultant economies is mental power set free for
higher uses. Hence, association is the first essential of progress:
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And as the wasteful expenditure of
mental power in conflict
becomes greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an
equality of rights is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice)
is the second essential of progress. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus association in equality is
the law of progress. Association
frees mental power for expenditure in improvement, and equality, or
justice, or freedom -- for the terms here signify the same thing, the
recognition of the moral law -- prevents the dissipation of this
power in fruitless struggles. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>He concluded this phase of his
analysis of civilization in these
words: "The law of human progress, what is it but the moral law? Just
as social adjustments promote justice, just as they acknowledge the
equality of right between man and man, just as they insure to each
the perfect liberty which is bounded only by the equal liberty of
every other, must civilization advance. Just as they fail in this,
must advancing civilization come to a halt and recede..."&nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, as the primary relation
of man is to the earth, so must
the primary social adjustment concern the relation of man to the
earth. Only that social adjustment which affords all mankind equal
access to nature and which insures labor its full earnings will
promote justice, acknowledge equality of right between man and man,
and insure perfect liberty to each. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This, according to George, was
what the single tax would do. It
was why he saw the single tax as not merely a fiscal reform but as
the basic reform without which no other reform could, in the long
run, avail. This is why he said, "What is inexplicable, if we lose
sight of man's absolute and constant dependence upon land, is clear
when we recognize it."... <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html"><span

<p>W. E. B. DuBois quoted Henry George extensively
  in a piece called <em>Jacob and Esau</em>, from The Talladegan, Vol.
  LXII, November 1944, pp. 1-6, available at <a href="http://www.webdubois.org/dbJacobEsau.html">http://www.webdubois.org/dbJacobEsau.html</a> :</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">... This was the promise of Jacob's life. This
  would establish the birthright which Esau despised. But, says George, &quot;Now,
  however, we are coming into collision with facts which there can be no mistaking.
  From all parts of the civilized world,&quot; he says speaking fifty years ago, &quot;come
  complaints of industrial depression; of labor condemned to involuntary idleness;
  of capital massed and wasting; of pecuniary distress among business; of want
  and suffering and anxiety among the working class. All the dull, deadening
  pain, all the keen, maddening anguish, that to great masses of men are involved
  into the words 'hard times' which afflict the world today.&quot; <em><strong>What
  would Henry George have said in 1933 after airplane and radio and mass production,
  turbine and electricity had come? </strong></em>[Parts of this quotation come
  from Henry George's <a href="../HG/PP/01_introductory_the_problem.htm">Progress
  and Poverty: Ch. 1, para. 8.</a>]</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">    Science and art grew and expanded despite all
  this, but it was warped by the poverty of the artist and the continuous attempt
  to make Science subservient
    to industry. The latter effort finally succeeded so widely that modern civilization
    became typified as industrial technique. Education became learning a trade.
    Men thought of civilization as primarily mechanical and the mechanical means
    by which they reduced wool and cotton to their purposes, also reduced and
      bent human kind to their will. Individual initiative remained but it was
      cramped
    and distorted and there spread the idea of patriotism to one's country as
      the highest virtue, by which it became established, that just as in the
      case of
    Jacob, a man not only could lie, steal, cheat and murder for his native land,
    but by doing so, he became a hero whether his cause was just or unjust. ... <a href="http://www.webdubois.org/dbJacobEsau.html">read
