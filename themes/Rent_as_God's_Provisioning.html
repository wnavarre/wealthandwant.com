      the idea that we're all created equal, and none of us should be able to
      privatize that which <strong><em>all </em></strong>of us create. We consider the privatization of
      the commons a serious form of theft that needs to be recognized and corrected.</p>

  <p>Might one of the <strong>temptations</strong> which we pray not to be led into be the temptation

    funded? Georgists will argue the latter: that God created the land for <em>all </em>of
    us, that <em>none</em> of us is  entitled to privatize it, and that the
    way to equalize our positions is to collect from those who own
    choice
    sites
    the lion's share of the annual economic value of those sites. This doesn't
    disturb title or property rights; it only socializes that which is inherently
    common: the value of the natural creation.</p>

        many decades had been shipping five Africans across the Atlantic for
        every European immigrant to the Americas. An imaginary &quot;hemispheric

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The true distinction
    is between property which is, and property which is not, the result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is such result
    of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. The one is the free gift of Nature, the other
    the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
    while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
    only be preserved by continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive
    possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
    in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
    of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
    are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
    distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
    what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
  <p> For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human exertion,
    it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the general prosperity,<strong> it
    is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of revenue while there
    remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to land. We may
    tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree lessening
    the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement to use
    land. </strong>But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to the production
    of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. <strong>We might take the
    whole value of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land worth
    nothing, and
    the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. </strong>The effect would
    be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its capabilities,
    which are brought out by increased population. But impose anything like such
    taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth would
    be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable wealth
    would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon be
    the silence of desolation.</p>
  <p> And the reason of this difference is clear. The possession of wealth is
    the inducement to the exertion necessary to the production and maintenance
    of wealth. Men do not work for the pleasure of working, but to get the things
    their work will give them. And to tax the things that are produced by exertion
    is to lessen the inducement to exertion. But over and above the benefit to
    the possessor, which is the stimulating motive to the production of wealth,
    there is a benefit to the community, for no matter how selfish he may be,
    it is utterly impossible for any one to entirely keep to himself the benefit
    of any desirable thing he may possess. These diffused benefits when localized
    give value to land, and this may be taxed without in any wise diminishing
    the incentive to production.</p>
  <p> To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory in a poorly improved
    neighborhood. To tax this building and its adjuncts is to make him pay for
    his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to take from him part of his natural
    reward. But the improvement thus made has given new beauty or life to the
    neighborhood, making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given to land all about.
    Now to tax improvements is not only to deprive of his proper reward the man
    who has made the improvement, but it is to deter others from making similar
    improvements. But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement in full force,
    and at the same time to keep down an obstacle to further improvement, which,
    under the present system, improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance
    of land values which follows improvement, and even the expectation of improvement,
    makes further improvement more costly.</p>
  <p> See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. <strong>Before he can put this land
    to the use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general
    good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away.</strong> In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p> Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p> So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. <strong>We should tax
    what we want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that
    which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. </strong>It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    <strong>Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</strong></p>
  <p> Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion.
    The tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It
    does not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost
    ease and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    <em><strong>For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value
    which results from the growth of the community, and to free industry and
    enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</strong></em></p>
  <p> Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth.</p>
  <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work in which
    he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere recognized
    a most vital distinction between property in land and property which results
    from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one system which is the
    best; it is not that system which always exists, otherwise why should we
    desire to change it; but it is that system which should exist for the greatest
    good of humanity. God knows it, and wills it; man's duty it is to discover
    and establish it.&quot; ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the

    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered. ...</p>
  <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
  <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
      of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
      an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
      would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
      felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
      exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
          them around the world.</li>
    <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
      fine upon those qualities.</li>
    <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
      been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to
      make
          me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than
      you.</li>
    <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
    <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
      had done an injury to the state;</li>
    <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
          it were a public nuisance;</li>
    <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would
          go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
    <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among
          us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
    <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
      grain,</li>
    <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
      to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
      before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
      prices.</p>
  <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
      from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
      the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
    the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would
    be
      free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed
    by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
      more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state
      would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising
      as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined
      for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not
      be taxed
      for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
  <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
      the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
      the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
      reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
      The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
      to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
      enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
      advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
      the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
      to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
      supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
      it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
      rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
      else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
      besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
  <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
      to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    IX Effects of the Remedy &#8212; Chapter 2: Of the Effect Upon Distribution
    and Thence Upon Production</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But great as they thus appear, the advantages of a transference of all public
      burdens to a tax upon the value of land cannot be fully appreciated until we
      consider the effect upon the distribution of wealth. </p>
  <p>Tracing out the cause of the unequal distribution of wealth which appears
      in all civilized countries, with a constant tendency to greater and greater
      inequality as material progress goes on, we have found it in the fact that,
      as civilization advances, the ownership of land, now in private hands, gives
      a greater and greater power of appropriating the wealth produced by labor and
      capital.</p>
  <p>Thus, to relieve labor and capital from all taxation, direct and indirect,
      and to throw the burden upon rent, would be, as far as it went, to counteract
      this tendency to inequality, and, if it went so far as to take in taxation
      the whole of rent, the cause of inequality would be totally destroyed. Rent,
      instead of causing inequality, as now, would then promote equality. Labor and
      capital would then receive the whole produce, minus that portion taken by the
      state in the taxation of land values, which, being applied to public purposes,
      would be equally distributed in public benefits.</p>
  <p>That is to say, the wealth produced in every community would be divided into
      two portions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> One part would be distributed in wages and interest between individual
          producers, according to the part each had taken in the work of production;</li>
    <li> the other part would go to the community as a whole, to be distributed
          in public benefits to all its members.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this all would share equally &#8212; the weak with the strong, young children
      and decrepit old men, the maimed, the halt, and the blind, as well as the vigorous.
      And justly so &#8212; for while one part represents the result of individual
      effort in production, the other represents the increased power with which
      the community as a whole aids the individual.</p>
  <p>Thus, as material progress tends to increase rent, were rent taken by the
      community for common purposes the very cause which now tends to produce inequality
      as material progress goes on would then tend to produce greater and greater
      equality. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/11_Effects_upon_Sharing.htm">read the whole chapter</a></p>

    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    <strong>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal
      right to the bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products
      of labor
      is the way intended by God for raising public revenues. </strong>For we are not
      atheists, who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern
      in politics and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order.<strong> For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</strong></p>
  <p>Now, <strong>He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained
      civilization as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become
      more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</strong></p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  <p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
  <p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
  <p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
  <p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</p>
  <p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; the monstrous customs
    duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states; the taxes
    on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. But out of
    the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
    the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
          are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or what
        in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot be
        shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given in
        the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the will of
        the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore as to
        things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point determined
        by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase the cost of
        bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer increasing price
        by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such cost decreasing price
        by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco or cloth add to the
        price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening in the cost of
        producing steel which improved processes have made in recent years has greatly
        reduced the price of steel. But land has no cost of production, since it
        is created by God, not produced by man. Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly, by what the owners
            can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation and consequently
            of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor can earn on it beyond
            what is necessary to life;<br>
            2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what the
            particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may be had
            by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage and
            for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
            3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
            in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from social
            growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to withhold
            land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never be shifted by
        the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase the demand
        for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding land from use.
        Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention because rent
        may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before economic or natural
        rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners were able to extort
        from labor could not enable them to extort any more, since laborers, if not
        left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case of economic rent proper,
        to take from the landowners the premiums they receive, would in no way increase
        the superiority of their land and the demand for it. While, so far as price
        is affected by speculative rent, to compel the landowners to pay taxes on
        the value of land whether they were getting any income from it or not, would
        make it more difficult for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the
        full value would not merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
    the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
    necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
    The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs?</p>
  <p>That it does mean this and nothing else is confirmed if we look deeper still,
    and inquire not merely as to the intent, but as to the purpose of the intent.
    If we do so we may see in this natural law by which land values increase
    with the growth of society not only such a perfectly adapted provision for
    the needs of society as gratifies our intellectual perceptions by showing
    us the wisdom of the Creator, but a purpose with regard to the individual
    that gratifies our moral perceptions by opening to us a glimpse of his beneficence.</p>
  <p>Consider: <strong>Here is a natural law by which as society advances the
      one thing that increases in value is land &#8212; a natural law by virtue
      of which all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general
      improvements
    of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of justice and the
    dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common uses of society.
    Now, since increase in the fund available for the common uses of society
    is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of society, is it
    not clear that the law by which land values increase with social advance
    while the value of the products of labor does not increase, tends with the
    advance of civilization to make the share that goes equally to each member
    of society more and more important as compared with what goes to him from
    his individual earnings, and thus to make the advance of civilization lessen
    relatively the differences that in a ruder social state must exist between
    the strong and the weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? Does it not show
    the purpose of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilization
    should be an advance not merely to larger powers but to a greater and greater
    equality, instead of what we, by our ignoring of his intent, are making it,
    an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality? ...</strong></p>
  <p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for social
    needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God in the sense
    that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort of men to do things
    other than in the way he has intended; in the sense that where the blessings
    he proffers to men are refused or misused they turn to evils that scourge
    us. And just as for the mother to withhold the provision that fills her breast
    with the birth of the child is to endanger physical health, so for society
    to refuse to take for social uses the provision intended for them is to breed
    social disease.</p>
  <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
    to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
    by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
    It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
    only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to combine
    the security of possession that is necessary to improvement with the equality
    of natural opportunity that is the most important of all natural rights.
    It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality
    between man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
    for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for the gifts
    of their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses
    of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.
    For the value that with the increase of population and social advance attaches
    to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured ownership of
    the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever
    there is any prospect of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus
    producing an artificial scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor,
    and a strangulation of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of
    industrial depression as disastrous to the world as destructive wars. It
    is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
    only to bring there the same curses. It is this that causes our material
    advance not merely to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker, but
    to make the condition of large classes positively worse. It is this that
    in our richest Christian countries is giving us a large population whose
    lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than those of the veriest
    savages. It is this that leads so many men to think that God is a bungler
    and is constantly bringing more people into his world than he has made provision
    for; or that there is no God, and that belief in him is a superstition which
    the facts of life and the advance of science are dispelling.</p>
  <p>The darkness in light, the weakness in strength, the poverty amid wealth,
    the seething discontent foreboding civil strife, that characterize our civilization
    of today, are the natural, the inevitable results of our rejection of God&#8217;s
    beneficence, of our ignoring of his intent. Were we on the other hand to
    follow his clear, simple rule of right, leaving scrupulously to the individual
    all that individual labor produces, and taking for the community the value
    that attaches to land by the growth of the community itself, not merely could
    evil modes of raising public revenues be dispensed with, but all men would
    be placed on an equal level of opportunity with regard to the bounty of their
    Creator, on an equal level of opportunity to exert their labor and to enjoy
    its fruits. And then, without drastic or restrictive measures the forestalling
    of land would cease. For then the possession of land would mean only security
    for the permanence of its use, and there would be no object for any one to
    get land or to keep land except for use; nor would his possession of better
    land than others had confer any unjust advantage on him, or unjust deprivation
    on them, since the equivalent of the advantage would be taken by the state
    for the benefit of all.</p>
  <p><a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">The Right Reverend Dr. Thomas Nulty</a>, Bishop of Meath, who sees all this
    as clearly as we do, in pointing out to the clergy and laity of his diocese*
    the design of Divine Providence that the rent of land should be taken for
    the community, says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I think, therefore, that I may fairly infer, on the strength of authority
        as well as of reason, that the people are and always must be the real owners
        of the land of their country. This great social fact appears to me to be
        of incalculable importance, and it is fortunate, indeed, that on the strictest
        principles of justice it is not clouded even by a shadow of uncertainty or
        doubt. There is, moreover, a charm and a peculiar beauty in the clearness
        with which it reveals the wisdom and the benevolence of the designs of Providence
        in the admirable provision he has made for the wants and the necessities
        of that state of social existence of which he is author, and in which the
        very instincts of nature tell us we are to spend our lives. A vast public
        property, a great national fund, has been placed under the dominion and at
        the disposal of the nation to supply itself abundantly with resources necessary
        to liquidate the expenses of its government, the administration of its laws
        and the education of its youth, and to enable it to provide for the suitable
        sustentation and support of its criminal and pauper population. One of the
        most interesting peculiarities of this property is that its value is never
        stationary; it is constantly progressive and increasing in a direct ratio
        to the growth of the population, and the very causes thatincrease and multiply
        the demands made on it increase proportionately its ability to meet them.<br>

        April 2, 1881.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There is, indeed, as Bishop Nulty says, a peculiar beauty in the clearness
    with which the wisdom and benevolence of Providence are revealed in this
    great social fact, the provision made for the common needs of society in
    what economists call the law of rent. Of all the evidence that natural religion
    gives, it is this that most clearly shows the existence of a beneficent God,
    and most conclusively silences the doubts that in our days lead so many to
    materialism.</p>
  <p>For in this beautiful provision made by natural law for the social needs
    of civilization we see that God has intended civilization; that all our discoveries
    and inventions do not and cannot outrun his forethought, and that steam,
    electricity and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer
    and more important. In the growth of this great fund, increasing with social
    advance &#8212; a fund that accrues from the growth of the community and
    belongs therefore to the community &#8212; we see not only that there is
    no need for the taxes that lessen wealth, that engender corruption, that
    promote inequality and teach men to deny the gospel; but that to take this
    fund for the purpose for which it was evidently intended would in the highest
    civilization secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s bounty, the
    abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants, and would provide amply for
    every legitimate need of the state. We see that God in his dealings with
    men has not been a bungler or a niggard; that he has not brought too many
    men into the world; that he has not neglected abundantly to supply them;
    that he has not intended that bitter competition of the masses for a mere
    animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterize
    our civilization; but that these evils which lead so many to say there is
    no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s ordering,
    are due to our denial of his moral law. We see that the law of justice, the
    law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed the
    law of social life. We see that if we were only to observe it there would
    be work for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization
    would tend to give to the poorest not only necessities, but all comforts
    and reasonable luxuries as well. We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer
    when he told men that if they would seek the kingdom of God and its right-doing
    they might no more worry about material things than do the lilies of the
    field about their raiment; but that he was only declaring what political
    economy in the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness, even to see this is deep and lasting joy. For it is to see
    for one&#8217;s self that there is a God who lives and reigns, and that be
    is a God of justice and love &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven. It is
    to open a rift of sunlight through the clouds of our darker questionings,
    and to make the faith that trusts where it cannot see a living thing.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>

    Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
      property in land is necessary to enable them to do so.</strong> (14-17.)</p>
  <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
    we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father to the child
    can justify private property in land we cannot see. You reason that private
    property in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father,
    and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
  <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and all
    necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature dictates
    that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his own
    personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to enable
    them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father effect this except
    by the ownership of profitable property, which he can transmit to his children
    by inheritance. (14.)</p>
  <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
    that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
    our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father
    to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural
    order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the
    parent. This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork
    of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
    has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
  <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
    But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
    constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
    being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver
    of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh,
    that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; And
    how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist!
    Let the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount
    as nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
    would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the
    leaves fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth
    refuse her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
  <p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property that
    will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. And how is it
    possible for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not considered how mankind
    really lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little
    one generation does or can leave another. It is doubtful if the wealth of
    the civilized world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s
    labor, while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely
    on existing accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest
    countries pestilence and famine would stalk.</p>
  <p>      The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private property in
        land. Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is land superior
        to the
      land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income
      to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
      the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the individual
      involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore possible only
      for some fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore
      your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers
      to struggle to leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong,
      lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something that involves the
      robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the material gifts of God.</p>
  <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
    world. What are its results?</p>
  <p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not,
    so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
    that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and
    misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? Under
    the r&eacute;gime of private property in land and in the richest countries
    not five per cent of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial
    to their children, and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury
    them! Some few children are left by their fathers richer than it is good
    for them to be, but the vast majority not only are left nothing by their
    fathers, but by the system that makes land private property are deprived
    of the bounty of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
    to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that often
    does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</p>
  <p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging,
    is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father.
    It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
    all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want
    and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
    than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
    generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. And, to recall your own
    words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now
    assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their
    children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s
    children of the unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers!
    Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall
    come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue,
    piety and industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all
    others free access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
  <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from
    want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
    much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
    of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law
    that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor.
    Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave their children
    wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want and misery in the
    uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed? Does experience
    show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above his fellows and enable
    him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for him? Is not such wealth
    oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its expectation often destroy
    filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings into families? And how
    far and how long are even the richest and strongest able to exempt their
    children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain than that the blood
    of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and that the descendants
    of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
  <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
    of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would
    go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than
    a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled
    or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners,
    the most ample provision could be made out of that great and increasing fund
    with which God in his law of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter
    of niggardly and degrading alms, but as a matter of right, as the assurance
    which in a Christian state society owes to all its members.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
    of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
    us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
    way of the single tax.</p>
  <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to
    those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who
    have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
  <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
    to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his
    Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone
    about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure
    such a little one?</p>
  <p>And what today is the result of private property in land in the richest
    of so-called Christian countries? Is it not that young people fear to marry;
    that married people fear to have children; that children are driven out of
    life from sheer want of proper nourishment and care, or compelled to toil
    when they ought to be at school or at play; that great numbers of those who
    attain maturity enter it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves,
    undeveloped minds &#8212; under conditions that foredoom them, not merely
    to suffering, but to crime; that fit them in advance for the prison and the
    brothel?</p>
  <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
    of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!
    <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>Nor do we seek any &#8220;futile and ridiculous equality.&#8221; We recognize,
    with you, that there must always be differences and inequalities. In so far
    as these are in conformity with the moral law, in so far as they do not violate
    the command, &#8220;Thou shalt not steal,&#8221; we are content. We do not
    seek to better God&#8217;s work; we seek only to do his will. The equality
    we would bring about is not the equality of fortune, but the equality of
    natural opportunity; the equality that reason and religion alike proclaim &#8212; the
    equality in usufruct of all his children to the bounty of Our Father who
    art in Heaven.</p>
  <p><strong>And in taking for the uses of society what we clearly see is the
      great fund intended for society in the divine order, we would not levy
      the slightest
    tax on the possessors of wealth, no matter how rich they might be. Not only
    do we deem such taxes a violation of the right of property, but we see that
    by virtue of beautiful adaptations in the economic laws of the Creator, it
    is impossible for any one honestly to acquire wealth, without at the same
    time adding to the wealth of the world. </strong>... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

<p>      Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TKC.html">Thy Kingdom Come</a> (1889
      speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; We have
been praying for it and
praying for it, yet it has not come. So long has it tarried that many
think it will never come. Here is the vital point in which what we
are accustomed to call the Christianity of the present day differs so
much from that Christianity which overran the ancient world &#8212;
that Christianity which, beneath a rotten old civilisation, planted
the seeds of a newer and a higher. </small><br>
<br>
<small> We have become accustomed to think that God&#8217;s kingdom, is
not intended for this world; that, virtually, this is the
devil&#8217;s world, and that God&#8217;s kingdom is in some other
sphere, to which He is to take good people when they die &#8212; as
good Americans are said when they die to go to Paris. If that be so,
what is the use of praying for the coming of the kingdom? Is God the
loving Father of whom Christ told &#8212; is He a God of that kind; a
God who looks on this world, sees its sufferings and its miseries,
sees high faculties aborted, lives stunted, innocence turned to vice
and crime, and heartstrings strained and broken, yet, having it in
His power, will not bring that kingdom of peace, and love, and plenty
and happiness? Is God indeed a self-willed despot, whom we must coax
to do the good He might?<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Thy kingdom come!&#8221; When Christ
taught that prayer He
did not mean that humans should idly phrase these words, but that for
the coming of that kingdom humanity must work as well as pray!<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> When we consider the achievements
of humanity and then look upon
the misery that exists today in the very centres of wealth; upon the
ignorance, the weakness, the injustice, that characterise our highest
civilisation, we may know of a surety that it is not the fault of
God; it is the fault of humanity. May we not know that in that very
power that God has given to His children here, in that power of
rising higher, there is involved &#8212; and necessarily involved
&#8212; the power of falling lower. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> &#8220;Our Father!&#8221; &#8220;Our Father!&#8221;
Whose? Not <span style="font-style: italic;">my
</span>Father &#8212; that is not the prayer. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Our </span>Father&#8221; &#8212;
not the father of any sect, or any class, but the Father of all
humanity. The All- Father, the equal Father, the loving Father. He it
is we ask to bring the kingdom. Aye, we ask it with our lips! We call
Him &#8220;Our Father&#8221;, the All, the Universal Father, when we
kneel down to pray to Him. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that He is the All-Father &#8212;
that He is all
people&#8217;s Father &#8212; we deny by our institutions. The
All-Father who made the world, the All-Father who created us in His
image, and put us upon the earth to draw subsistence from its bosom;
to find in the earth all the materials that satisfy our wants,
waiting only to be worked up by our labour! If He is the All-Father,
then are not all human beings, all children of the Creator, equally
entitled to the use of His bounty? And, yet, our laws say that this
God&#8217;s earth is not here for the use of all His children, but
only for the use of a privileged few! </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>There
was a little dialogue published in the United States, in
the west, some time ago. Possibly you may have seen it. It is between
a boy and his father when visiting a brickyard. The boy looks at the
men making bricks, and he asks who those dirty men are, why they are
making up the clay, and what they are doing it for. He learns, and
then he asks about the owner of the brickyard. &#8220;He does not make
any bricks; he gets his income from letting the other men make
bricks.&#8221; </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Then the boy wants to know how
the man who owns the brickyard
gets his title to the brickyard &#8212; whether he made it. &#8220;No,
he did not make it,&#8221; the father replies: &#8220;God made
it.&#8221; The boy asks, &#8220;Did God make it for him?&#8221; Whereat
his father tells him that he must not ask questions such as that, but
that anyhow it is all right, and it is all in accordance with
God&#8217;s law. The boy, who of course was a Sunday school boy, and
had been to church, goes off mumbling to himself &#8220;that God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son to die for all
men&#8221;; but that He so loved the owner of this brickyard that He
gave him the brickyard too.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This has a blasphemous sound. But
I do not refer to it lightly.
I do not like to speak lightly of sacred subjects. Yet it is well
sometimes that we should be fairly shocked into thinking. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> One cannot look, it seems to me,
through nature &#8212; whether
one looks at the stars through a telescope, or have the microscope
reveal to one those worlds that we find in drops of water. Whether
one considers the human frame, the adjustments of the animal kingdom,
or any department of physical nature, one must see that there has
been a contriver and adjuster, that there has been an intent. So
strong is that feeling, so natural is it to our minds, that even
people who deny the Creative Intelligence are forced, in spite of
themselves, to talk of intent; the claws on one animal were intended,
we say, to climb with, the fins of another to propel it through the
water. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Yet, while in looking through the
laws of <span style="font-style: italic;">physical </span>nature, we
find intelligence we do not so clearly find beneficence. But in the
great <span style="font-style: italic;">social </span>fact that as
population increases, and improvements are
made, and men progress in civilisation, the one thing that rises
everywhere in value is land, and in this we may see a proof of the
beneficence of the Creator. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider what it means! <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It means that the social laws are
adapted to progressive humanity! In a rude state of society where
there is no need for common expenditure, there is no value attaching
to land. The only value which attaches there is to things produced by
labour. But as civilisation goes on, as a division of labour takes
place, as people come into centres, so do the common wants increase,
and so does the necessity for public revenue arise. And so in that
value which attaches to land, not by reason of anything the
individual does, but by reason of the growth of the community, is a
provision intended &#8212; we may safely say intended &#8212; to meet
that social want.</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Just as society grows, so do the common needs grow, and so grows
this value attaching to land &#8212; the provided fund from which they
can be supplied. Here is a value that may be taken, without impairing
the right of property, without taking anything from the producer,
without lessening the natural rewards of industry and thrift. Nay,
here is a value that must be taken if we would prevent the most
monstrous of all monopolies. What does all this mean? It means that
in the creative plan, the natural advance in civilisation is an
advance to a greater and greater equality instead of to a more and
more monstrous inequality. </span>... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp;
(1887 speech)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is no need for poverty in
this world, and in our
civilization. There is a provision made by the laws of the Creator
which would secure to the helpless all that they require, which would
give enough and more than enough for all social purposes. These
little children that are dying in our crowded districts for want of
room and fresh air, they are the disinherited heirs of a great
estate.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Did you ever consider the full
meaning of the significant fact
that as progress goes on, as population increases and civilization
develops, the one thing that ever increases in value is land?
</b>Speculators all over the country appreciate that fact. Wherever
there is a chance for population coming; wherever railroads meet or a
great city seems destined to grow; wherever some new evidence of the
bounty of the Creator is discovered, in a rich coal or iron mine, or
an oil well, or a gas deposit, there the speculator jumps in, land
rises in value, and a great boom takes place, and people find
themselves enormously rich without ever having done a single thing to
produce wealth.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, it is by virtue of a
natural law that land steadily increases
in value; that population adds to it; that invention adds to it; that
the discovery of every fresh evidence of the Creator&#8217;s goodness
in the stores that He has implanted in the earth for our use adds to
the value of land, not to the value of anything else. This natural
fact is by virtue of a natural law, a law that is as much a law of
the Creator as is the law of gravitation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What is the intent of this natural
law of increasing land values?
Is there not in it a provision for social needs? That land values
grow greater and greater as the community grows and common needs
increase: is there not built into this law a manifest provision for
social needs &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a fund belonging to
society as a whole, with
which we may take care of those who fall by the wayside &#8212; with
which we may meet public expenses, and do all the things that an
advancing civilization makes more and more necessary for society to
do on behalf of its members? ... 
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today the value of land in New
York city is over a hundred million annually. Who has created that
value? Is it because a few landowners are here that that land is worth
a hundred million a year? Is it not because the whole population of New
York is here? Is it not because this great city is the center of
exchanges for a large portion of the continent? Does not every child
that is born, every one that comes to settle in New York, does it not
add to the value of this land? Ought it not, therefore, get some
portion of the benefit? And is it not wronged when, instead of being
used for that purpose, certain favored individuals are allowed to
appropriate the fund of land values?</small><br>
<br>
<small>We might take this vast fund for common needs; we might with it
make a city here such as the world has never seen before &#8212; a city
spacious, clean, wholesome, beautiful &#8212; a city that should be full of
parks; a city without tenement houses; and we could do this, not merely
without imposing any tax upon production, without interfering with the
just rights of property, but while at the same time securing far better
than they are now the rights of property, and abolishing the taxes that
now weigh on production.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We have but to throw off our taxes upon things of human
production; to cease to fine a person who puts up a house or makes
anything that adds to the wealth of the community; to cease collecting
taxes from people who bring goods from abroad or make goods at home;
and &#8212; in substitution for all these taxes &#8212; to collect that enormous
revenue due to the growth of the community for the benefit of the
community that produced it.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Dr Nulty, Bishop of Meath, has said in a letter addressed to the
clergy and laity of his diocese that it is this provision of the
Creator, the provision by which the value of land increases as the
community grows, that seems to him the most beautiful of all the social
adjustments; and it is to me that which most clearly shows the
beneficence as well as the intelligence of the Creative Mind; for here
is a provision by which the advance of civilization would, under the
law of equal justice, be an advance towards equality, instead of being,
as it now is, an advance toward a more and more monstrous inequality.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The same good Catholic Bishop in that same letter says: "Now,
therefore, the land of every country is the common property of the
people of that country, because its real owner, the Creator, who made
it, hath given it as a voluntary gift unto them. &#8216;The earth has He
given to the children of men and women.&#8217; And as every human being is a
creature and a child of God, and as all His creatures are equal in His
sight,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> any settlement of the
land of this or any other country that would exclude the humblest from
an equal share in the common heritage is not only an injury and a wrong
done to that person, but an impious violation of the benevolent
intention of the Creator."</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>And then Bishop Nulty goes on to show that the way to secure
equal rights to land is not by cutting land up into equal pieces, but
by taking for public use the values attaching to land. That is the
method this Society proposes. I wish we could get that through the
heads of the editors of this city. We do not propose to divide up land.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> What we propose to do is to divide up the
rent that comes from land; and that is a very easy thing. ... </span></small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Go into Pennsylvania, and there
you will see great stretches of
land, containing enormous deposits of the finest coal, held by
corporations and individuals who are working but little part of it.
On these great estates the common American citizens who mine the coal
are not allowed even to rent a piece of land, let alone buy it. They
can only live in company houses; and they are permitted to stay in
them only on condition (and they have to sign a paper to that effect)
that they can be evicted at any time on five days&#8217; notice. The
companies combine and make coal artificially dear here, and make
employment artificially scarce in Pennsylvania.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, why should not those miners,
who work on it half the time,
why shouldn&#8217;t they dig down in the earth and get up coal for
themselves? Who made that coal? There is only one answer &#8212; God
made that coal. Whom did He make it for? Surely you would say that
God made it for the people that would be one day called into being on
this earth. But the laws of Pennsylvania, like the laws of New York,
say God made it for this corporation and that individual; and thus a
few people are permitted to deprive miners of work and make coal
artificially dear. ...&nbsp;<a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/George_TSNS.html"> <span

Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The
Single Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge It</a> (1890)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Think about what the value of
land is. It has no reference to the
cost of production, as has the value of houses, horses, ships,
clothes, or other things produced by labor, for land is not produced
by man, it was created by God. The value of land does not come from
the exertion of labor on land, for the value thus produced is a value
of improvement. That value attaches to any piece of land means that
that piece of land is more desirable than the land which other
citizens may obtain, and that they are willing to pay a premium for
permission to use it. Justice therefore requires that this premium of
value shall be taken for the benefit of all in order to secure to all
their equal rights.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b style="font-weight: bold;">Consider
the difference between the value of a building and the
value of land</b><span style="font-weight: bold;">. </span>The value
of a building, like the value of goods,
or of anything properly styled wealth, is produced by individual
exertion, and therefore properly belongs to the individual; but the
value of land only arises with the growth and improvement of the
community, and therefore properly belongs to the community. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">It is not
because of what its owners have done, but because of the presence of
the whole great population, that land in New York is worth millions
an acre. This value therefore is the proper fund for defraying the
common expenses of the whole population; and it must be taken for
public use, under penalty of generating land speculation and monopoly
which will bring about artificial scarcity where the Creator has
provided in abundance for all whom His providence has called into
existence.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is thus a violation of justice
to tax labor, or the things
produced by labor, and it is also a violation of justice not to tax
land values.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Henry George:<a href="../HG/WoL.htm"> The Wages of
Labor</a><a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/George/Wages_of_Labor.html"></a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is truly said &#8211; a salutary
truth too often forgotten &#8211; &#8220;Man is older than the State, and holds the
right of providing for the life of his body prior to the formation of
any State.&#8221; It is also true that the State is in the divinely appointed
order. For He Who foresaw all things, and provided far all things,
foresaw and provided that, with the increase of population and the
development of industry, the organisation of human society into States
or Governments would become both expedient and necessary.</small><br>
<br>
<small>No sooner does the State arise than it needs revenue. This need
for revenue is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
rude, and the functions of the State few and simple. But with growth of
population and advance of civilisation the functions of the State
increase, and larger and larger revenues are needed.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Now, the raising of Public Revenue must accord with the moral
law. Hence:</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs
to individuals.</small></li>
  <li><small>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by,
increasing prices of what some have to sell and others must buy.</small></li>
  <li><small>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial
oaths, by making it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to
take bribes.</small></li>
  <li><small>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong,
and weaken the sanctions of Religion and the State, by creating crimes
and punishing men for doing what morally they have an undoubted right
to do.</small></li>
  <li><small>It must not repress industry nor check commerce. It must
not punish thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest
production and the fairest division of wealth.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the taxes on the
processes and products of industry
by which public revenue is collected:
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The monstrous customs duties
that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian States; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the taxes
on occupations, on earnings, on investments; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>on the building of houses; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>on the cultivation of fields; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>on industry and thrift in all forms.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Can these be the ways that God
has intended that Governments
should raise the means they need? Have any of them the characteristics
indispensable in any plan we can deem a right one? All these
taxes
violate the moral law. They take by force what
belongs to the individual; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage
over the scrupulous; their effect is, nay they are largely intended, to
increase the price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they
corrupt governments ; they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce;
they fine industry and thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might
enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing others. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>That God has intended the value of the land to serve for
public revenue is shown by the order and degree in which land values
increase with the growth of the State.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In that primitive condition ere
the need for the State arises
there are no land values. The products of labor have value, but in the
sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself. But as
increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
necessitate the organisation of the State, with its need for revenue,
value begins to attach to land. As population still increases and
industry grows more elaborate, so the need for public revenue
increases; and at the same time, and from the same causes, land values
increase. The connection is invariable.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The value of things produced by
labor tends to decline
with social development, since the larger scale of production and the
improvement of process tend steadily to reduce their cost.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>But the value of land on which
population centres goes up
and up. ... 
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider: Here is a natural law by
which as society advances
the one thing that increases in value is land &#8211; a natural law by virtue
of which all growth of population, all advance of the arts, all general
improvements of whatever kind, add to a fund that both the commands of
justice and the dictates of expediency prompt us to take for the common
uses of society.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, since increase in
the
fund available for the common uses
of society is increase in the gain that goes equally to each member of
society, is it not clear that this law by which land values increase
with social advance while the values of the products of labor do not
increase &#8211; tends, with the advance of civilisation, to make the share
that goes equally to each member of society more and more important as
compared with what goes to him from his individual earnings, and thus
to make the advance of civilisation lessen relatively the differences
that in a ruder social state must exist between the strong and the
weak, the fortunate and the unfortunate? <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Does it not show the purpose
of the Creator to be that the advance of man in civilisation should be
an advance, not merely to larger powers, but to a greater and greater
equality, instead of what we by our ignoring of His intent are making
it &#8211; an advance towards a more and more monstrous inequality?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The Right Reverend Dr. Thomas Nulty, Bishop of Meath,
Ireland,
who sees all this very clearly, has made striking testimony to the
design of Divine Providence that the rent of land should be taken for
the community. In a <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">pastoral letter
addressed to the clergy and laity
of his diocese</a>, April 2, 1881, he says :</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>&#8220;This great social fact
is of
incalculable importance; and, on the strictest principles of justice,
it is not clouded even by a shadow of uncertainty or doubt. There is,
moreover, a charm and a peculiar beauty in the clearness with which it
reveals the wisdom and the benevolence of the designs of Providence in
the admirable provision He has made for the wants and the necessities
of that state of social existence in which the very instincts of nature
tell us we are to spend our lives. A vast public property, a great
national fund, has been placed under the dominion and at the disposal
of the nation to supply itself abundantly with resources necessary to
liquidate the expenses of its government and the administration of its
laws.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"One of the most
interesting
peculiarities of this property is that its value is constantly
progressive and increasing in a direct ratio to the growth of the
population, and the very causes that increase and multiply the demands
made on it increase proportionately its ability to meet them.&#8221;</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>He says further:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>&nbsp;&#8220;Any settlement of
the
land of a country that would exclude the humblest man in that country
from his share of the common inheritance would be not only an injustice
and a wrong to that man, but, moreover, would be an impious resistance
to the benevolent intentions of his Creator.&#8221;<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is, indeed, as Bishop
Nulty says, a peculiar
beauty
in
the clearness with which the wisdom and benevolence of Providence are
revealed in the provision made for the common needs of society in what
economists call the law of rent. Of all the evidence that natural
religion gives, it is this that most clearly shows the existence of a
beneficent God!</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In this beautiful provision for
social needs we see that God
has intended civilisation; that all our discoveries and inventions do
not, and cannot, outrun His forethought; and that steam, electricity,
and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer and
more important.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the growth of this great
fund, increasing with social
advance &#8211; a fund that accrues from the growth of the community, and
belongs, therefore; to the community &#8211; we see, not only that there is
no need for the taxes that lessen wealth; that engender corruption, and
promote inequality, but, that to take this fund for the purpose for
which it was intended would secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s
bounty &#8211; the abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants and provide
amply for every legitimate need of the State.</small><br>
<br>
<small>We see that God in His dealings with men has not been a bungler
or a niggard; that He has not brought too many men into the world, that
He has not neglected abundantly to supply them; that He has not
intended that bitter competition of the masses for a mere animal
existence and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterise
our civilisation; but, that these evils, which lead so many to say
there is no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s
ordering, are due to our denial of His moral law. </small><small>...&nbsp;<a

<p><small></small>Clarence Darrow: <a href="../docs/Darrow_Land_Belongs.html">The
    Land Belongs To The People</a> (1916)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    This earth is a little raft moving in the endless sea of space, and the mass
          of its human inhabitants are hanging on as best they can. It is as
    if some raft filled with shipwrecked sailors should be floating on the ocean,
    and
          a few of the strongest and most powerful would take all the raft they
    could get and leave the most of the people, especially the ones who did the
    work,
          hanging to the edges by their eyebrows. These men who have taken possession
          of this raft, this little planet in this endless space, are not even
    content with taking all there is and leaving the rest barely enough to hold
    onto,
          but they think so much of themselves and their brief day that while
    they live they must make rules and laws and regulations that parcel out the
      earth for thousands of years after they are dead and, gone, so that their
    descendants
          and others of their kind may do in the tenth generation exactly what
    they are doing today &#8212; keeping the earth and all the good things of
    the earth and compelling the great mass of mankind to toil for them.</p>
  <p>Now, the question is, how are you going to get it back? Everybody who thinks
      knows that private ownership of the land is wrong. If ten thousand men
    can own America, then one man can own it, and if one man may own it he may
    take
      all that the rest produce or he may kill them if he sees fit. It is inconsistent
      with the spirit of manhood. No person who thinks can doubt but that he
    was born upon this planet with the same birthright that came to every man
    born
      like him. And it is for him to defend that birthright. And the man who
    will not defend it, whatever the cost, is fitted only to be a slave. The
    earth belongs
      to the people &#8212; if they can get it &#8212; because if you cannot
      get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or not, and
      if you
      can get it, it makes no difference whether you have a right to it or not,
      you just take it. The earth has been taken from the many by the few. It
      made no
      difference that they had no right to it; they took it.</p>
  <p>Now, there are some methods of getting access to the earth which are easier
      than others. The easiest, perhaps, that has been contrived is by means of taxation
      of the land values and land values alone; and I need only say a little upon
      that question. One trouble with it which makes it almost impossible to achieve,
      is that it is so simple and so easy. You cannot get people to do anything that
      is simple; they want it complex so they can be fooled.</p>
  <p>Now the theory of Henry George and of those who really believe in the common
      ownership of land is that the public should take not alone taxation from
    the land, but the public should take to itself the whole value of the land
    that
      has been created by the public &#8212; should take it all. It should be a part
      of the public wealth, should be used for public improvements, for pensions,
      and belong to the people who create the wealth &#8212; which is a strange doctrine
      in these strange times. It can be done simply and easily; it can be done by
      taxation. All the wealth created by the public could be taken back by the public
      and then poverty would disappear, most of it at least. The method is so simple,
      and so legal even &#8212; sometimes a thing is legal if it is simple &#8212; that
      it is the easiest substantial reform for men to accomplish, and when it
      is done this great problem of poverty, the problem of the ages, will be
      almost
      solved. We may need go farther. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_Land_Belongs.html">read the whole article </a></p>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Lastly, one must appreciate that
the market value of &#8220;land&#8221; of every
sort is entirely rent, as there is no human factor of labor that
accounts for its origination. Services of nature have no prior cost to
bring them into production existence &#8212; the electromagnetic spectrum,
for example, exists regardless of human presence on earth and so
presumably does time. Ocean fish, fossil fuels, and heavy metals are
all found in nature, not the result of human creation. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">They are, in
19th century classical economics, the fruits not of man&#8217;s labor but of
God&#8217;s. And it is to God, or at least to God&#8217;s representative on earth &#8212;
the lords and kings &#8212; that rent was owed, just as much as it was their
role to provide reciprocal services to the tenants of the land. </span>That
bargain, so well refined in feudal economic arrangements, was an
equilibrium balance, disrupted, one might say, by the annulment of rent
collection and the exploitation of land without
recognition of its price. The practice effectively ended with what in
Britain is known as the &#8220;enclosure movement&#8221; of the early Tudor reign,
driving the peasants off the land into cities to provide cheap labor
for the early English industrialists.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">28</span></small> But
the theory continued long afterwards. Georgists today argue that land
rent should be collected from titleholders so that it is not left to
render economic distortions. This in turn affects the price of labor
and the price of money. Government&#8217;s role, whatever else it does, is at
the very least responsible for defending the commons, to ascertain
titles and to collect rent. Although there are many differences about
the proper role, scope and domain of government among Georgist
adherents, the collection of rent and the supervision of open markets
is central to its tenets. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The heart of George&#8217;s economics was, in a way, Biblical. As the
son of
a religious book publisher born in Philadelphia, he had adequate
opportunity to witness the early growth of the American republic in a
unique way. On his own in San Francisco and responsible for a wife and
child at a young age, his first effort at resolving the puzzles of
injustice were a manuscript printed in 1871. But only after additional
exposure to Ricardian rent theory was he able to refine his ideas such
that they could form the basis of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Progress
and Poverty</span> eight years
later. His Christian roots led him to a deep commitment to the basic
moral equality of all people; his challenge was to find a way to ensure
that this equality was manifest in economic fairness.</small><br>
<br>
<small>As noted earlier, the starting point of Georgist philosophy is
that
nature belongs to owners only in usufruct and not in freehold. Because
any monetary wealth that accrued to that nature stemmed directly from
the physical presence of people and was therefore social in character,
the resulting added increment of value that constituted rent belonged
in turn to the community that created it. Nature would have no economic
price without people. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hence rent was
the community&#8217;s entitlement and
not that of individuals, and the land rent that accrued to parcels as a
result of social investment should be returned to &#8212; recaptured by &#8212; the
community.</span> It was obvious to George
that the wealthiest people in the nation usually owed their fortune not
to the sweat of their brow or the inventiveness of their minds. Rather
their position was due to their success as land speculators, to an
increase in rent on land they had captured title to, land rightfully
belonging to all. The earth and all its product, he argued, was
the common heritage of humanity, a birthright of all people.&nbsp; ... <a

Joseph Fels: &nbsp; <a href="../docs/Fels.html">True Christianity and
My Own Religious Beliefs</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
I believe that the Creator freely gave the earth to all of His
children, that all may have equal rights to its use. Do you agree to
that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that the injunction, "In the sweat of thy brow shalt
thou eat
bread," necessarily implies, "Thou shalt not eat bread in the sweat of
thy brother's brow." Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that all are violating the divine law who live in
idleness on
wealth produced by others, since they eat bread in the sweat of their
brothers' brows. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that no man should have power to take wealth he has
not
produced or earned unless freely given to him by the producer. Do you
agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that brotherhood requires giving an equivalent for
every
service received from a brother. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe it is blasphemous to assert or insinuate that God has
condemned some of His children to hopeless poverty, and to the Crimea,
want, and misery resulting therefrom, and has, at the same time,
awarded to others lives of ease and luxury, without labor. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that involuntary poverty and involuntary idleness are
unnatural, and are due to the denial by some of the right of others to
use freely the gift of God to all. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Since labor products are needed to sustain life, and since labor
must
be applied to land in order to produce, I believe that every child
comes into life with divine permission to use land without the consent
of any other child of God. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where men congregate in organized society, land has a value
apart from
the value of things produced by labor; as population and industry
increase, the value of land increases, but the value of labor products
does not. That increase in land value is community-made value. Inasmuch
as your power to labor is a gift of God, all the wealth produced by
your labor is yours, and no man nor collection of men has a right to
take any of it from you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe the community-made value of land belongs to the
community,
just as the wealth produced by you belongs to you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Therefore, I believe that the fundamental evil, the great
God-denying
crime of society, is the iniquitous system under which men are
permitted to put into their pocket, confiscate, in fact, the
community-made values of land, while organized society confiscates for
public purposes a part of the wealth created by individuals. Do you
agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Using a concrete illustration: I own in the city of Philadelphia
11-1/2
acres of land, for which I paid 32,500 dollars a few years ago. On
account of increase of population and industry in Philadelphia, that
land is now worth about 125,000 dollars. I have expended no labor or
money upon it. So I have done nothing to cause that increase of 92,500
dollars in a few years. My fellow-citizens in Philadelphia created it,
and I believe it therefore belongs to them, not to me. I believe that
the man-made law which gives to me and other landlords values we have
not created is a violation of the divine law. I believe that Justice
demands that these community-made values be taken by the community for
common purposes instead of taxing enterprise and industry. Do you
agree? ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Do you question the relationship between taxation and
righteousness?
Let us see. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If government is a
natural growth, then surely God's
natural law provides food and sustenance for government as that food is
needed; for where in Nature do we find a creature coming into the world
without timely provision of natural food for it?</span> It is in our
system of
taxation that we find the most emphatic denial of the Fatherhood of God
and the Brotherhood of Man, because, first, in order to meet our common
needs, we take from individuals what does not belong to us in common;
second, we permit individuals to take for themselves what does belong
to us in common; thus, third, under the pretext of taxation for public
purposes, we have established a system that permits some men to tax
other men for private profit.&nbsp; ... <a href="../docs/Fels.html"><span

<blockquote>
  <p>... I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
    do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
    must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
    society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask
    the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
    when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the
    economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that
    question,
    you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that
    more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society.
    We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's market place.
    But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs
    restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my friends,
  when you deal with this,</p>

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts of
    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who Pays New
    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
    The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. <strong>These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</strong></p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. <strong>The increase in the value of land, arising
    as it does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the
    community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.</strong>&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p><strong>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the
      rent that derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is
      not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.</strong>38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
