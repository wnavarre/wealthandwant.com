appropriated and there is enough for everyone. Thus there is no

for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>
<small>III.&nbsp; The simple efficiency argument for taxing land</small><br>
<small>IV.&nbsp; Taxing Land is Better Than Neutral</small><br>
<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing Land is Better Than
Neutral</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>The analysis above explained how a tax on land can be &#8216;neutral&#8217;,
that
is, how such a tax can have no excess burden.&nbsp; In fact, taxing
land is better than neutral; it improves economic efficiency compared
to the no-tax situation.&nbsp; This section explains how.</small><br>
<br>
<small>First, a land tax can be used to take account of positive and
negative
externalities associated with land use.&nbsp; The typical example
of a negative externality is pollution.&nbsp; If labor and capital were
perfectly mobile, then the effect of pollution on near-by locations
would be reflected entirely in land values.&nbsp; Thus one might say
that a polluter &#8216;uses&#8217; surrounding land and should pay for that use in
the form of a &#8216;land tax&#8217; equal to the reduction in the rental value of
land that results from his activities.&nbsp; Such a land tax would not
only raise govern&shy;ment revenue, but would also improve efficiency
by ensuring that people would engage in activities that pro&shy;duced
pollution only when the benefits of those activities exceeded the costs.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Because labor and capital are not perfectly mobile, pollution
affects
not only land values, but also the value of structures and the net
well-being that people experience from the opportunity to continue to
live in accustomed places.&nbsp; Efficient management of pollution
would charge polluters for these costs as well.</small><br>
<br>
<small>When there is traffic congestion on city streets or on highways,
bridges, or tunnels, one might say that there is a problem caused by
people not being charged adequately for the use of particu&shy;larly
valuable space.&nbsp; If there is a congestion charge (land tax) that
reflects the extent to which any one user of streets and highways
imposes costs on others users in the form of increased travel times,
then that congestion charge improves efficiency while also raising
government revenue.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

the Whole Rent, and Nothing but the Rent</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The use of rent for public
revenues therefore has no excess burden, no
burden on society or the economy. Taxes on income, goods, and
transactions do have an excess burden, since by raising the price and
reducing the quantity of goods, resources do not get allocated to where
the people most want them. Taxes on labor and goods raise prices, while
rent-based payments do not affect the rent, and they lower the price of
land rather than raise it.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent is therefore the ideal
source of
general public and community revenue. </span>Tax reform should
therefore shift to rent as the primary source of general funds.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
Pollution charges can supplement the rent, and indeed can be considered
a rental charge for using and abusing the atmosphere, land, soil, and
other forms of land. </span>There could also be user fees for services
specific to users, fines for violating traffic rules, and profits from
enterprises.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The economic rent from
minerals,
water, and oil would be natural resource royalties that could be paid
by bidding for the rights to extract, from payments based on the amount
of mining, and the profits from the operations, depending on the
circumstances.</span>...</small>

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications
of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The first problem of
environmental protection is management of
the harm that is caused to nearby areas by the discharge of
pollutants into air and water.</b> In the U.S. this problem is often
managed by quantitative controls. Historic polluters are allowed to
continue to pollute at reduced levels, and potential new polluters
are restricted even further or prevented from polluting entirely.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A system of quantitative controls
can be efficient if the overall
level of control is appropriate and permission to pollute is
completely transferable. But these conditions are rarely met. It is
particularly difficult to know the optimal level of pollution control
when the costs of pollution are continuous, upward sloping and not
catastrophic. And systems of quantitative controls almost always lack
fairness. They grant permanent privileges to those who have a history
of having caused harm. If a system of quantitative controls provided
that pollution rights would be auctioned, and all the proceeds would
be collected publicly, then it would be in accord with a principle
that all persons have equal rights to natural opportunities. But
there would still be the difficulty of determining the right number
of permits to sell.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A system of managing the harm from
pollution is most likely to be
both efficient and fair if it is conceived in terms of taking account
of effects of pollution on land values. Pollution can also affect the
value of structures, but these effects are harder to quantify,
because they operate somewhat differently on each structure.
Furthermore, pollution can raise as well as lower the value of
structures. An old structure that would be ready to be demolished in
a clean environment can have continuing economic value in a polluted
environment. Pollution can also have effects on the utility of
individuals apart from its effects on the value of land and
structures. If person A is harmed by pollution more than person B,
who would move in if person A moved out, but person A does not move
because of the costs of moving, then the difference between the costs
of pollution to persons A and B is a pollution cost that is not
reflected in the value of land and structures. Nevertheless,
measuring the cost of pollution by its effects on land values is a
good first approximation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To manage pollution efficiently
and fairly, one would estimate the
effects on land values of various levels of pollution and derive a
"supply schedule" of pollution based on the marginal cost of
pollution at different levels of pollution. One would then ask
polluters how much polluting they would want to do at different
prices of pollution. As long as there were more than a handful of
polluters, their incentives to report anything other than their true
marginal valuations of pollution rights would be inconsequentially
small. Thus one could aggregate the responses into an aggregate
demand schedule for pollution rights and use the intersection of the
supply and demand schedules to determine simultaneously the efficient
quantity of pollution and the price that would achieve the efficient
quantity. The payments that individuals made could be construed as
payments for appropriating for themselves land rent that was
everyone's common heritage.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Pollution sometimes crosses
international borders, as when sulfur
dioxide from coal-fired electricity generating plants in the U.S.
Midwest crosses into Canada. While there are unresolved scientific
issues regarding the amount of harm that such international pollution
causes, the economic question of what should be done when the
magnitude of damage is know is straightforward. When one country
sends pollution to another, the resulting decrease in the value of
land in the second country represents an increase in the proportion
of natural opportunities that the first country is appropriating. The
polluting nation owes corresponding compensation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Without a theory of equal
rights to natural opportunities, one
could argue that international pollution could be controlled just as
well by identifying the optimal quantity and limiting emissions to
that level. A theory of equal rights to natural opportunities does
not permit such privilege for polluters. </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the area affected by a
pollutant is very large, as with the
gasses that exacerbate the ozone hole, measuring damage by changes in
land values becomes less attractive. Changes in land value are a
suitable measure of damages when the choices that people make between
land that is affected and unaffected permit the market to reflect the
damages. But if all of Australia is affected by the ozone hole, then
the damage that the ozone hole does to Australia would be measured by
land values only if it affected migration between Australia and the
rest of the world. Such effects happen slowly, and their consequences
for land values are difficult if not impossible to measure. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Nevertheless, one can apply the
principle that natural
opportunities are everyone's common heritage. No one has a right to a
disproportionate share of the opportunity to emit the gasses that
increase the ozone hole. We should seek to identify the marginal cost
schedule of emissions of these gasses, and charge a fee that equate
the marginal cost and marginal benefit of emissions. All persons in
the world should share equally in the proceeds of such fees, after
nations such as Australia that bear a disproportionate burden have
been compensated for their costs.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>With CO2 and other greenhouse
gasses, the issue is yet different.
Particularly cold areas may benefit from the global warming caused by
greenhouse gasses, and no area of planet is immune from the effects
of global warming. Still, the principle of equal rights to natural
opportunities can be applied. All people have equal rights to emit
greenhouse gasses. People have different ideas about what the right
level is. The appropriate way to give expression to the idea that we
all have equal rights to the environment is to use a structured
democratic and market process.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider CO2. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Start by having every nation propose a
quantity of
permitted emissions of CO2 per capita. Weight each nation's proposal
by its population, and take the weighted median of the proposals.</span>
That is an initial entitlement that represents a majority rule
equilibrium, a reasonable expression of equal rights for all. Unlike
the current global climate negotiations, in this entitlement no
preference is given to nations of the basis of their having a history
of high emissions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Next,
ask each nation how much money it would be willing to pay
for reductions in global emissions below the entitlement levels, and
how much money it would regard as adequate compensation for emissions
above the initial entitlement level.</span> (These question presume
that
nations want lower emissions. If a nation desires extra global
warming, the questions would be reversed.) </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To motivate nations to respond
honestly to these questions, the
"demand-revealing" process would be used to charge nations for their
answers. That is, each nation would pay for the cost that it imposed
on other nations (or receive the benefit that it provided to other
nations) by having the preferences that it had instead of the average
of the preferences of other nations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
next step is to ask each nation for an offer schedule of how
much it is willing to pay for the right to emit CO2 in excess of its
allocation, or how much it would regard as adequate compensation for
emitting less than its allocation.</span> The (vertical) sum of the
answers
to the questions about the costs that nations would experience from
emissions provides a "<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">supply </span>schedule"
of emission rights. The
(horizontal) sum of the answers to the question of how much nations
would pay to emit more (or accept as compensation for emitting less)
provides a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">demand
</span>schedule for emission rights. The intersection of
the two schedules specifies the efficient level of emissions and the
price that will induce nations to emit the efficient amount of CO2.
This is the price to be paid by nations that want to emit more than
their entitlements, and received by nations that want to emit less
than their entitlements. In addition, all nations pay or receive
something for the net cost to other nations for their having
preferences that deviate from the average of the preferences of
others. These payments ensure that nations are motivated to report
their costs of emissions truthfully. </small><small><b>... </b><span

corresponding reductions in the reported totals of the natural

the use of resources that are incorporated into goods, and any form
of pollution with international consequences. The axiom that all
persons have equal rights to natural opportunities implies that each
nation has a right to a share of the total of all such appropriations
equal to its share in world population. Any nation that appropriates
more than its share has an obligation to compensate those who have
less than average per capita shares.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a

Value Rating</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. </span>An economy will be more efficient if
revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Site value rating embodies the
principle that people are allowed
to keep what they produce and must pay annually for the value of the
naturally occurring and socially created resources they use. This
principle can be extended to take account of individual actions that
have noticeable effects on the rental value of land surrounding that
which individuals use themselves. When land is used in such a way as
to raise the rental value of surrounding land, as by providing
parking near a commercial center or by providing improvements that
are beautiful to see, the person who creates that value should
receive it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Correspondingly, when
people use land in such a way as to
lower the value of surrounding land, by generating noise, noxious
smells, air pollution, or unsightly views, they should be charged
according to the reduction in the rental value of the surrounding
land that results from their activity. </span>The opportunity to be
paid for
adding to the value of surrounding land will generally make land more
valuable. And the requirement to pay for harmful consequences of land
use will tend to inhibit such uses of land.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">SOURCES
OF NONPOINT POLLUTION &nbsp;</span></small><br>
<small>All pollution is originally "nonpoint."&nbsp; It
only becomes "point" pollution when someone has taken the trouble of
gathering it at a small orifice in order to control it, often for the
benefit of others.&nbsp; If we then tax point polluters while exempting
nonpoint we will impair the incentive to control.&nbsp; That of course
is why we are conferring now, and why we are looking at taxing
surrogates.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxing and banning surrogates
has a place, perhaps a
big place in any control program.&nbsp; But it may not touch many
sources of nonpoint pollution.&nbsp; Let's list them here; see what
damage they do (next section); and then see what remains unsolved by
taxing and banning surrogates.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Major sources of nonpoint pollution are:
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>agriculture, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>forestry,</small></li>
  <li><small>mining, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>recreation, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>paving and rooftops, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>roads, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>lawns and gardens, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>onsite industrial waste dumps, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>military, for a
start.&nbsp;    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To these I would add </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the class of moving point sources,
like autos and vessels and aircraft, which have part of the elusive
character of nonpoint sources.&nbsp; I would add 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>septic tanks; and</small></li>
  <li><small>moonlight dumpers; and 
  </small></li>
  <li><small>everything served by a storm sewer, or no sewer
at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Construction"
is usually added, but construction
per se is innocent and should not bear the onus.</span>&nbsp; It is
rather
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">grading</span>,
the destruction that precedes construction on new lands, that
denudes land and allows runoff and blowing.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Filling </span>can
be
noxious, too, when it takes wetlands that otherwise help filter runoff
before it hits shellfish beds and beaches.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">So
nice a distinction may seem picky, but it is
heavy with policy meaning.&nbsp;</span> The Sears Tower and the Empire
State
Building probably caused less runoff than any modern cookie-cutter
subdivision.&nbsp; We can have needed construction without grading and
filling by renewing and infilling our cities instead of promoting more
urban sprawl.&nbsp; Milwaukee in the last 20 years has lost 20% of its
population.&nbsp; Buildings are boarded up and land lies vacant while
dozers and scrapers tear up new land upstream of it.&nbsp; At least
one-third of Milwaukee, perhaps more, could and should be renewed
forthwith, obviating much of the random lateral expansion onto new land
whose runoff now causes so much grief down here.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Within agriculture it is common
to hear that tillage
is the problem; the solution, evidently, is grazing.&nbsp; On some
lands that is true, but the generalization is not.&nbsp;</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">On other more
fragile lands, grazing causes runoff.</span>&nbsp; Not for nothing are
sheep
called "woolly maggots," and the Arab called the father, rather than
the son of the desert.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exploitive
high&#8209;grading grazing, leaving
weeds to take over the range, is another form of pollution</span> &#8209;&#8209;
biological pollution, depleting the gene pool.&nbsp; As with all land
problems, "where" and "when" are as important as "what."&nbsp; "A place
for everything, and everything in its place," the slogan of land
economics, is the proper watchword.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">We sometimes hear that good
organic manure is the
answer.&nbsp; But on feedlots, too much of a good thing becomes a
nonpoint pollutant.&nbsp;</span> Cities in the upper Santa Ana River
basin
must provide tertiary sewage treatment, but the largest concentration
of dairy cattle in the world, in the Chino basin, drains into the same
waters.&nbsp; Next time you visit Disneyland if the water reminds you
of Wisconsin, there may be a reason.&nbsp; (Chino, ironically, is in an
agricultural preserve, to enhance the environment.)&nbsp; These
feedlots also overlie what might be one of our most usable aquifers, in
a region in sorest need of water storage.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Cities like Milwaukee are painted as victims of
nonpoint pollution, but within cities the great anomaly is that the
output of sanitary sewers is monitored and treated while that of storm
sewers is not.&nbsp; A few blocks from this meeting in downtown
Milwaukee you can see coal and salt stored in the open, draining
directly into the Harbor with each rain.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>In Riverside, the local scatological whimsy is
"Flush your toilets, Orange County needs the water."&nbsp; It relieves
the local inferiority complex, but actually that water gets tertiary
treatment.&nbsp; It is our storm runoff that's dirty.&nbsp; Some cities
of course have only one set of sewers, but that creates problems of its
own which Milwaukee knows well.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>In Riverside we have also poisoned many of our own
water wells with toxic percolation from farm and industry wastes which,
since they are inside our expansive city limits, we cannot blame on
others; but which our prudent city fathers prefer not to identify too
closely.&nbsp;</small> &nbsp;<small><big> </big></small><a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land is reusable.&nbsp; All the
land we have is second-hand, most of it
previously-owned.&nbsp; Our descendants, in turn, will have nothing but
our hand-me-downs.&nbsp; As there is never any new supply, the old is
recycled periodically, and will be in perpetuity, without changing form
or location.&nbsp; Melded briefly with fixed buildings, land survives
them to go one more round of use.&nbsp; Even while melded with capital,
land is fit for another use at any time, unlike the capital on
it.&nbsp;
Land retains a practicable, measurable, meaningful opportunity
cost.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land value in cities may
be defined as "what is left
after a good fire"; arsonists take that quite literally.</span>&nbsp;
In
Beverly Hills, California, "tear-downs" are routine as
taste-obsolescence races through fashionable neighborhoods where the
land outvalues even the elegant buildings.&nbsp; These are dated after
thirty years.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The opportunity cost of capital is fleeting.&nbsp; Capital loses
most
of
it the moment it is committed to a specific form, whose physical
alternative use is often only as scrap.&nbsp; Land's "opportunity
cost" is real and viable at all times.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The scrap value
of
capital is often zero or negative (radioactive waste supplying an
extreme
example).</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Land
may be afflicted with such "negative capital," the harmful
waste from prior usage.&nbsp;</span> An example is the spent carcass of
an old
building needing costly demolition.&nbsp; Some would class that spent
carcass as a
subtraction from the site value, but "negative capital" makes
more sense, as may be inferred by considering the relations between a
landlord and a tenant in a perfect market.&nbsp; The lease holds the
tenant liable for damages he does and wastes he leaves; the prudent
landlord requires of the tenant a deposit, or in larger cases a bond,
to
assure performance.&nbsp; Both acknowledge that damage done by use is
imputed to the user, not to the land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11</span></small></small><br>
<small><small></small></small></div>
<div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>11. An
example on a social scale is the bonding
imposed on nuclear generators by
the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).&nbsp; FERC
requires utility firms to set aside a percentage of their fuel budget
in
a sinking fund to pay for "decommissioning" plants at the end
of their economic lives.
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Too
often, from institutional or market or human failure, the land is
left damaged, with no recourse against those responsible.&nbsp; Then,
indeed, the damage becomes part of the land, just as some of the good
relics of history may as well be considered part of the land.&nbsp;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">
Toxic
wastes, and endemic parasites imported with previous crops or trees,
become mixed into the dirt.&nbsp; We do not trivialize nor quibble over
what to call such damage: it happens, and it impairs the reuse value of
land.&nbsp;</span> In such cases the site is less valuable, but still
permanent
and recyclable.&nbsp; Such cases are, fortunately, still more the
exception than the rule.&nbsp; They are at most a minor qualification
to
the major points made here.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Physical abuse of land is less a problem, actually, than the
fall of
value that results from social decay.&nbsp; Much of land value is a
social product.&nbsp; When a society sickens, declines, and
self-destructs, as we know may happen, it lowers ground rents, which
mirror social progress and decay.&nbsp; We cannot surely forecast that
our own society will not self-destruct, as parts of cities already
have.&nbsp; However, until it does, land will outlast capital
economically.&nbsp; Even when it does, landownership may remain the
last
bastion, as happened in the feudal system.&nbsp; Even if barbarians
overrun us, it is the land they will take: little else will
remain. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html">Read the whole article</a></small>

Relieving Poverty While Healing The Earth</a><br>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> Green economics.</b>
George&#8217;s paeans to compact settlement, both rural and urban, are
highly compatible with the modern need to discourage invasion of
wilderness areas, wetlands, etc. George would satisfy the demand for
land on the lands best suited for human use, leaving most of the
earth undisturbed by man. (Gaffney, 1976). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If anything, he
understated the high capacity of good lands to meet all human needs</span>
(Gaffney, 1999). As a son of the frontier, he overstated its virtues
in some oratorical passages, anticipating Frederick J. Turner. His
pioneering work on the marginal productivity theory of wage
determination puts too much emphasis on the frontierish &#8220;margin
of cultivation,&#8221; borrowing from Ricardo. In practise, however,
George was a devoted urbanist (like Ricardo himself). </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In other respects, to &#8220;green up&#8221;
Georgism we need to
free it from its exclusive focus on the virtues of a land tax levied
in the form of a property tax (Gaffney, 1998). George himself stated
his central thesis in another form: &#8220;We must make land common
property.&#8221; To him, the property tax was simply the most
convenient and practical tool to that end, one directly at hand.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, we need at least two
modifications. </small></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">One is to recognize the
occasional virtues of taxes on the
extraction or withdrawal of natural resources from the earth</span>.
(Gaffney,
1967, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1998). This has become the common meaning
of &#8220;green taxes.&#8221; An obvious modern case is the withdrawal of water
from rivers and wells (Gaffney, 1992). Another obvious case is levying
effluent charges on polluters, where that is feasible (Gaffney, 1965).
This proposal harks back at least to A.C. Pigou (1928), and often bears
his name. </small>
      <p><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Obvious as may
be the virtues of such green taxes, polluters
have successfully rallied behind an alternative, the tradable pollution
permit. </span>This idea entered academia through J.H. Dales and
Ronald Coase,
who challenged the &#8220;polluter pays&#8221; principle. It entails a massive
validation of pollution, making it a kind of property right, based on
&#8220;ancient and honorable histories&#8221; of pollution. This is not the place
to skewer it as it deserves, but obviously Georgists should help put it
down. </small></p>
      <small> </small></li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> A less obvious, but more challenging case
is dealing with
&#8220;non-point&#8221; pollution.</span> Here, simple market-oriented policies are
hard
if not impossible to apply. I have to agree with a Marxist like Burkett
that some problems call for systemic changes that make us think outside
the box of the market and its logic. I have offered up a package of
such changes elsewhere (Gaffney, 1987). <a style="font-weight: bold;"

</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b><small>I. The issue</small></b></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question before us is "how can
we prevent the dissipation of
resource rents?"</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This cuts to the heart of ancient
and modern issues of land
tenure, growth management, fiscal Federalism, tax methods, and
spending priorities.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>II. Sources of rent</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I premise we understand "rent" to
mean the income imputable to
natural resources, and natural resources means gifts of nature, fixed
and limited in quantity. We understand there are marginal resources
yielding little or no rent, grading up to superior ones yielding
much. We understand there is a dynamic secular tendency for rents to
rise with rising population and moreso with rising disposable income
per capita. There is a tendency for marginal exhaustible resources to
rise in value with the depletion of superior ones that are normally
used up first.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because land is not produced,
rents may be zero or less, and rise
without limit. There is no competition from new production.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I premise resource rents are the
joint product of three
distinguishable factors:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>nature;</small></li>
  <li><small>complementary private activity; and</small></li>
  <li><small>public works and services, publicly financed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I premise rent is the most basic
and general source of taxable
surplus, especially in an open economy in which other input costs and
product prices are set at world levels in world markets.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Triffin's epigram says <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">"Surpluses are either competed away or
imputed away." Rent is what we call it when they are imputed away. He
might have added, they may also be frittered away: that is what we
seek to avoid. ... </span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>B. How rent is
dissipated.</b></small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Open access, tragedy of
commons. Arthur Young, Scott Gordon, Garrett Hardin, et al. Simple
cases like open range, fisheries, public parks and beaches, freeways: a
principle easily perceived (although not usually by undergraduates).</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>C. Open access
followed by tenure: rent-seeking institutions.</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Rent is dissipated through
prematurity of investments. Squatters' Rights (<b>Preemption Act of 1841</b>),
and residence requirement of <b>Homestead Act (1862)</b>, traditional
examples. Prior appropriation doctrine of water rights, simple example.
Air routes; broadcast licenses; extending utility franchises; zoning;
offset rights to pollute; other modern examples. </small></div>

traditional property tax on real estate ex buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
explore in this work the revenue
potential of variable charges on road crowding, water withdrawals from
surface and underground sources, minerals extraction, air and water
pollution, spectrum use, fish catches, billboards, and so on. Some of
these are major additions to land revenues. California, a major
oil-producing state, does not even have a severance tax. In the fiscal
crisis of 2003, with 136 or so candidates running for Governor, only
one (Arianna Huffington) even mentioned it, so total is the mental
blackout.</small><br>

</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Common Property in Land is
Compatible with the Market
Economy.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The very people who gave us the term laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Since their time we have
learned to measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.</span>&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; </small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small> Another natural resource (hence part of "land"), whose
nature and value the mass
of people are only slowly realizing, is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">radio
spectrum</span>. In this age of
communication its value is vaulting skywards even faster
than the rockets
launching the satellites that direct and relay signals
through the spectrum. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each
satellite requires a spectrum assignment, or it is nothing
but space junk.</span> One
minor American entrepreneur, Craig McCaw, collected a
bundle of spectrum rights
for cell phones, and a few years ago sold them to AT&amp;T
for $12 billions. Then Mr.
McCaw went partners with Bill Gates, perhaps the richest
American, in a firm
called Teledesic, to launch hundreds of satellites and
amass radio spectrum
rights around the entire world, including your part of the
world, in the hope of
dominating worldwide communications. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio
spectrum is a
natural resource, and
it belongs to the government, even in the capitalistic
U.S.A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Teledesic
comes calling, </span>under the auspices of our Vice President Al
Gore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't sell
anything cheap! In fact, don't sell anything at all, but
lease it for a limited time, so
you may gain from future rises in value.</span> And don't stint
on the professional help
you should hire to protect your interests: these lease
contracts are complex, and
are worth Billions if you play your cards right.
</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Hydrocarbons are a third set
of valuable resources.</span> The
values involved are
gigantic. The recent merger of the Exxon and Mobil oil
firms was valued at $260
billions, several times greater than the Russian annual
budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should private
parties make off with all this natural value?</span> Several
nations, including some of your
neighbors, support themselves entirely from these
revenues. Norway pays for a
lush welfare state from its oil revenues. Its reserves are
so valuable that the mere
change in their appraised value in several recent years
has exceeded the entire
GDP of Norway. And your oil reserves? If they match your
production, they may
be the largest in the world.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>World oil prices are down this year, as you know, but
there is another side to this.
The devaluation of the ruble has raised the value of your
oil in Russian terms,
because the oil earns "hard" currency abroad. Your
government has recognized
this by imposing a special tax on the resulting
"windfall," but we will see below
(Sections 2,C and 2,D) that there is a much more effective
way to tax resource
rents.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The American state of Alaska
holds down its other taxes by
socializing part of its
oil revenues, which otherwise would inure to a handful of
the major stockholders of
two corporations (ARCO and BP). Alaska not only holds down
other taxes, it pays
each resident - man, woman, and child - a social dividend
of over $1,000 per year.</span>
Go thou and do likewise. Your expert, Dmitri Lvov from the
Russian Academy of
Sciences, a speaker at this meeting, has written that you
could cover most of
your national budget from your enormous production of oil
and gas.
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Many third-world nations like
Venezuela or Nigeria have
fabulous mineral oil that
they fail to exploit for their own people, letting
sophisticated or ruthless foreign
corporations, in tandem with weak or corrupt insiders,
reap the gains.</span> The
question for Russia is whether to follow their bad example
and become a poor
resource-colony of the west, or whether to assert your own
sovereignty over your
own resources for the benefit of your own people. You need
look no further than
Norway for a model.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Other subsoil resources have
great value, too.</span> Many
nations, even backward
ones, gain large parts of their national revenue from
"hardrock" minerals. Bolivia,
Gabon, Jamaica, Liberia, New Caledonia, Papua-New Guinea,
Zaire, and Zambia
have raised over 25% of their budgets this way in recent
years; Chile, Thailand
and Malaysia have taken lesser, but substantial amounts.
Saskatchewan, a
Canadian Province, raises large revenues from potash and
uranium; Minnesota, an
American state, from iron ore; and so on. Some other
nations fail to raise much
revenue from fabulous minerals from which others profit,
like S. Africa with its gold
and diamonds, West Virginia with its coal, or Missouri
with its lead mines and
reserves. Russia is a treasure-house of untapped mineral
wealth that you can and
should tax to alleviate the condition of the Russian
people.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life,
and the most valuable
natural resource is water. </span>For
example, in southern California we need water so much we
import it from the
Feather River 600 miles north of us, pump it uphill
through the long San Joaquin
Valley, then over the high Tehachapi Mountain range, and
tunnel it through the
San Bernardino Mountain Range, all at great cost. When it
gets here, it
supplements and competes with local water that nature
provides freely in the
Santa Ana, San Jacinto, and other rivers. That local water
then has a value equal
to the high cost of importing the remote northern water.
That value in the local
waters is a taxable surplus. However, we have not learned
to take that surplus
value into the local treasuries; we give the water away,
and worse, we actually
subsidize people to withdraw water by helping them pay for
dams, canals, and
pipelines so they can waste water without paying for it.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus we turn a public
asset into a public liability - an extreme form of folly
that is called "dissipating
rent."</span> In this age of growing water scarcities it is past
time we learned to husband
and nurture rent, in order to socialize it by taxing the
surplus. So should you, in
comparable circumstances.
&nbsp;</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Another value from water is to
generate power.</span> Again,
California witlessly fails to
socialize this value, but Canada, our northern neighbor,
has shown the way.
British Columbia, Newfoundland (the Labrador part),
Quebec, and other provinces
raise large revenues from charges on the use of falling
water. Russia, with some of
the world's largest hydro-electric projects, can do the
same, or better.
</small><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of
value.</span> In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell
these licenses, but simply
gave them away to owners
of existing boats, and others with political influence.
Each license now sells for
something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
instant millionaires and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway
from the many,
created an instant class society where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%. Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.
</small>...<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid "perverse subsidies." </span>These
are subsidies
that encourage
harmful things like </small><small></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>polluting air and water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>wasting
water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>cutting timber
whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>populating remote regions
whose costs exceed the benefits derived.</small> </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
contains the most
polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
to sustain its
uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
that employ just a few
people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
North America. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> We have mentioned how we actually subsidize people to
withdraw scarce
water from our overdrawn rivers in the arid U.S.A.
The so-called water
"shortage" in the lower Colorado River is entirely an
artifact of such
misguided policies: every major agency drawing on the
Colorado is actually
subsidized to do so, when they should be paying for
the privilege. If they
paid, they would stop wasting water, and would enrich
the Treasury, which
could then abate taxes on work, trade, and
saving.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> The U.S. Forest Service has turned a great national
asset, our national
forestlands, into a drain on the Treasury by
subsidizing forest roads in
subeconomic areas. It makes money selling good timber
in good areas,
but then spends $10 on roads into subeconomic areas
to get $1 in
revenues from sale of timber to private parties,
destroying scenic values
and watershed protection.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small> Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.&nbsp; </small><small><span

</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Rather than requiring a highly centralised body overseeing the
collection of LVT and resource revenue, Geonomics proposes to devolve
power to a range of relevant authorities at different levels of
government.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">LOCAL </span>Local
governments
are ideally positioned to collect LVT on sites for homes, businesses
and farmland surface land values. In Australia and many other places
council already levy rates. However the rates collected today are
minimal, are usually based on land and improvements, and have all sorts
of flaws such as fixed charges, maximum or minimum thresholds, and
exemptions. In immediate financial terms alone, the vast majority of
ratepayers would benefit from LVT, the exceptions being speculators and
businesses which waste valuable expanses of land (such as sprawling car
yards and derelict factories on prime real estate).</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">REGIONAL </span>State
governments are best constituted to collect user fees for forestry and
water resources.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">NATIONAL </span>The
federal
government is in the best position to collect user fees for fish caught
in national waters, oil and mineral resources.</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">GLOBAL </span>We
mentioned a
possible role of a Global Resource Agency in equalising natural
advantages between nations, but there's a much more achievable role
this body could take in collecting user fees from our transnational
commons. This includes site fees for satellites placed in geostationary
orbits, royalties on minerals mined in international waters or the
Antarctic, royalties on fish caught in international waters, and for
use of the electromagnetic spectrum.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many taxes or fees based on the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">polluter-pays</span>
principle would clearly fall within the province of the Global Resource
Agency. Here significant global revenue sources could, for example, be
levied on aviation fuel, international shipping, and dumping at sea
(where that would still be allowed). These could all be construed as
site and resource rents in the broad sense of those terms. If a
polluter is dumping into a river for example, and thereby rendering x
million cubic metres of water nonpotable, he would be charged a rental
value for that resource usually equivalent to the cost of returning the
water to a potable state. Such a charge will soon force polluters to
look for cleaner production processes or be forced out of business by
such punitive site and resource rents.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This agency would also be best placed to administer the proposed
Tobin
tax on currency speculation. And, if international arms' trading is not
to be entirely abolished, the agency could be given the authority to
impose a heavy "misery tax" on it.</small><br>
<br>
<small>There's a valuable monitoring role that the Global Resource
Agency
could take in being responsible for safeguarding the global commons
(e.g. air quality, ozone shield, ocean fish, worldwide biodiversity
etc.). The agency could determine access rules, issue permits, collect
resource revenue and levy fines.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Not only would the access fees to the Global Commons ensure
careful use
of our common heritage resources, but also this revenue could go a long
way towards solving some important problems. Where should the money be
spent? Global Geonomics has no spending doctrine or dogma, but here are
a few suggested uses:</small></div>

Constitutional Conflict Between Protecting
Expectations and Moral Evolution</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Power,
Population and Process</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two other difficulties
that are more serious. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, the existing distribution of recognized exclusive
rights to natural opportunities (land, mineral resources, fishing
rights, water rights, etc.) is the outcome of a game of power, and
those who have won at this game have great power are loathe to part
with their winnings.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, Malthusian analysis has led people to expect that
if the value of exclusive use of natural opportunities were distributed
equally, population would expand until everyone was at a subsistence
level.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a solution to the second
problem, contained in the idea
that all persons have equal rights to the use of natural
opportunities. If the crowding effects of additional persons outweigh
the beneficial effects of greater economies of scale, then any region
that has an above-average population growth rate is appropriating
more than its share of the scarce natural opportunity to be a parent.
The costs that this region thereby imposes on other regions can
justly be subtracted from what would otherwise be its claim on the
value of using natural opportunities. Each region could then decide
for itself whether to pass those costs on to individual couples who
decide to conceive children.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Similarly,
when a region imposes costs on others through
interregional pollution, the costs so imposed should be subtracted
from the region's claim to the value of exclusive use of natural
opportunities.</span> The great challenge is to overcome the entrenched
power that benefits from continued blindness to moral necessity. The
mechanism must not be force of arms, for that entails too great a
risk of installing a new power elite who would be as unprincipled as
the first. Nor should the mechanism be the power of majorities,
through legislation and referenda, for these processes can also be
used for the selfish aggrandizement of those who control them. It is
good that constitutions prohibit the taking of property without just
compensation. It is to be hoped that courts will interpret such
restricitons as prohibiting taxes that take all of the value of
things currently regarded as property. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When respect for a newly
understood moral truth requires the
dissappointment of previously protected expectations, those who would
push their fellow citizens to incorporate that truth into the
governmental process should be obliged to have their ideas reviewed
in a constitutional amnedment process that will ensure that they will
be adopted only if a broad consensus on them is achieved. When people
are ready to see a new moral truth, that truth can overcome such a
hurdle.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Moral_Evolution.html"><span

for pollution externalities of motor vehicle travel invites
more complex issues.</span> One approach widely explored involves
reliance
upon what are known as Pigou taxes, after noted British economist
Arthur Pigou.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(31)</span></small>
It attempts to recover the costs of externalities in the natural
environment and even involving health damages. Yet Pigou taxes are more
often talked about than actually implemented. Related to such designs
are those growing out of the theories of Ronald Coase, designed not
necessarily to recover the full social costs of negative externalities
but rather to foster the most efficient economic choice among options,
even if some parties are disadvantaged.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(32)</span></small>
Taxes recovering such costs are most easily collected at the production
stage -- at the wellhead or the refinery for oil, and from the
manufacturer for tires and other materials.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(33)</span></small>
Still a third approach is that represented by the Georgist tradition,
which would recover the costs of specified pollution externalities by
accepting them to the extent that the environment is capable of
absorbing them, and charging polluters for the use of the environment
as a sink for such wastes. This approach is particularly attractive as
a way to charge for the release of noxious gases in motor vehicle
exhaust.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(34)</span></small>...

the premise of economic sustainability. Although this term has to some
extent become a mantra and widely abused, its most popular definition
remains that first enunciated by the 1987 Brundtland Commission Report:<span

present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs."</span><small><span

fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs
of present and future generations."</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">93</span></small> At
various times scholars have sought to improve upon this definition; one
offered by adherents of the ecological economics school reads as
follows:</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>1. For renewable resources
(fish,
trees, etc.), the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of
regeneration.
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>2. The rate at which we allow
economic
activity to generate wastes that must be passed into the environment
should not be allowed to exceed the environment&#8217;s ability to absorb
them.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Underlying the whole agenda is a
commitment beyond simple description
to sustainable development economics and to Daly&#8217;s &#8220;steady state&#8221;
economics. This entails the institution of environmental safeguards,
protection of cultural and biological diversity, minimal resource use,
and recycling. It further means protection of small countries and
localities &#8212; of both ecosystems and populations &#8212; against
all-encompassing economic units that preclude the possibility of their
being able to survive independently. It presumes also that not just
humans alive today have entitlements, especially privileged elements of
wealthy countries; it recognizes rather the justice and moral claims of
people and natural ecosystems yet to live to survive as intact and
integral units. It recognizes that governments must take a hand in the
preservation of such ecosystems, as&nbsp;markets forces
left to themselves will wreak destruction on the most vulnerable parts
of the earth and ultimately upon the earth itself. It accepts the fact
that the carrying capacity of the earth is&nbsp; limited, and that we
appear to have already exceeded that carrying capacity in our ignorance.<span

is created and maintained by retired Cornell Professor Jay Hanson, at

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The distinction between CAC approaches to environmental
challenges as
compared with pricing approaches is central to all this analysis.
Daly&#8217;s shows a strong preference for the latter. In what he calls
&#8220;graded ecozoning,&#8221; for example, potential atmospheric impacts are
divided into three areas. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, for emissions that do not cause significant damage
and do
not accumulate in significant concentrations, taxpayers would be
charged a general fee. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, in instances where incentives require altered
behavior to
address problems such as high ozone or carbon monoxide emissions in
certain local areas, more targeted taxes would apply. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Finally for those pollutants that have profoundly damaging
impacts, regulation and perhaps criminal liability would be called for
in cases of their release. These classes are labeled the &#8220;property
rights zone,&#8221; the &#8220;incentive zone,&#8221; and the &#8220;regulatory zone&#8221;
respectively. The model follows the growing interest and preference for
pricing approaches over more heavy-handed and administratively
inefficient CAC approaches.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Green taxes, sometimes also
called corrective taxes or Pigouvian taxes,
are their first candidates for consideration. This is because they can,
if priced right, recover the costs of externalities in ways that allow
individuals to use their own discretion about employing environmentally
damaging practices. But the authors extend their thinking to cover
goods and materials that may have negative ecological impacts although
not yet conclusively demonstrated by science. The answer there is to
rely upon a &#8220;precautionary polluter pays principle&#8221; based on the
present value of the forecast impact should the worst case scenarios be
borne out. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
annual cost of using a car in the early 1990s, for example, was $51,656
according to their calculations.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">120</span></small> This
would obviously entail an enormous imposition of taxes, far above the
less than $7,000 direct annual costs typically shouldered by drivers
now,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">121</span></small>
the rest of which are now passed on to society generally. Grave doubt
exists about the potential impact of various externalities of driving,
along with concern about the extent of damage which might possibly
occur to
the ecosystem; this warrants employment of the precautionary principle
and calls for policy solutions to curtail this travel mode. Complete
prohibition of certain materials and chemicals may be warranted in some
cases....<a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html"> <span

    3.0 &#8212; Chapter 4: The Limits of Privatization (pages 49-63)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Free Market Environmentalism<br>
    One other version of privatism is worth considering. Its premise is that
      nature can be preserved, and pollution reduced, by expanding private property
      rights. This line of thought is called free market environmentalism, and
      it&#8217;s favored by libertarian think tanks such as the Cato Institute.</p>
  <p>The origins of free market environmentalism go back to an influential paper
    by University of Chicago economist Ronald Coase. Writing in 1960, Coase challenged
    the then-prevailing orthodoxy that government regulation is the only way
    to protect nature. In fact, he argued, nature can be protected through property
    rights, provided they&#8217;re clearly defined and the cost of enforcing
    them is low.</p>
  <p>In Coase&#8217;s model, pollution is a two-sided problem involving a polluter
    and a pollutee. If one side has clear property rights (for instance, if the
    polluter has a right to emit, or the pollutee has a right not to be emitted
    upon), and transaction costs are low, the two sides will come to a deal that
    reduces pollution.</p>
  <p>How will this happen? Let&#8217;s say the pollutee has a right to clean
    air. He could, under common law, sue the polluter for damages. To avoid such
    potential losses, the polluter is willing to pay the pollutee a sum of money
    up front. The pollutee is willing to accept compensation for the inconvenience
    and discomfort caused by the pollution. They agree on a level of pollution
    and a payment that&#8217;s satisfactory to both.</p>
  <p>It works the other way, too. If the polluter has the right to pollute, the
    pollutee offers him money to pollute less, and the same deal is reached.
    This pollution level &#8212; which is greater than zero but less than the
    polluter would emit if pollution were free &#8212; is, in the language of
    economists, optimal. (Whether it&#8217;s best for nature is another matter.)
    It&#8217;s arrived at because the polluter&#8217;s externalities have been
    internalized.</p>
  <p>For fans of privatism, Coase&#8217;s theorem was an intellectual breakthrough.
    It gave theoretical credence to the idea that the marketplace, not government,
    is the place to tackle pollution. Instead of burdening business with page
    after page of regulations, all government has to do is assign property rights
    and let markets handle the rest.</p>
  <p>There&#8217;s much that&#8217;s attractive in free market environmentalism.
    Anything that makes the lives of business managers simpler is, to my mind,
    a good thing &#8212; not just for business, but for nature and society as
    a whole. It&#8217;s good because things that are simple for managers to do
    will get done, and often quickly, while things that are complicated may never
    get done. Right now, we need to get our economic activity in harmony with
    nature. We need to do that quickly, and at the lowest possible cost. If it&#8217;s
    easiest for managers to act when they have prices, then let&#8217;s give
    them prices, not regulations and exhortations.</p>
  <p>At the same time, there are critical pieces missing in free market environmentalism.
    First and foremost, it lacks a solid rationale for how property rights to
    nature should be assigned. Coase argued that pollution levels will be the
    same no matter how those rights are apportioned. Although this may be true
    in the world of theory, it makes a big difference to people&#8217;s pocketbooks
    whether pollutees pay polluters, or vice versa.</p>
  <p>Most free marketers seem to think pollution rights should be given free
    to polluters. In their view, the citizen&#8217;s right to be free of pollution
    is trumped by the polluter&#8217;s right to pollute. Taking the opposite
    tack, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
    Council, argues that polluters have long been trespassing on common property
    and that this trespass is a form of subsidy that ought to end.</p>
  <p>The question for me is, what&#8217;s the best way to assign property rights
    when our goal is to protect a birthright shared by everyone? It turns out
    this is a complicated matter, but one we need to explore. There&#8217;s no
    textbook way to &#8220;propertize&#8221; nature. (When I say to propertize,
    I mean to treat an aspect of nature as property, thus making it ownable.
    Privatization goes further and assigns that property to corporate owners.)
    In fact, there are different ways to propertize nature, with dramatically
    different consequences. And since we&#8217;ll be living with these new property
    rights &#8212; and paying rent to their owners &#8212; for a long time, it
    behooves us to get them right. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p>    Valves and Their Keepers</p>
  <p>One job of common property trusts is to preserve habitat and landscapes,
    but such trusts can also play another role &#8212; controlling the flow of
    pollution into ecosystems. In this case, what they&#8217;d be managing isn&#8217;t
    the ecosystems themselves, but human economic activity around the ecosystems.
    In that sense, they&#8217;d be more like the Federal Reserve than the Nature
    Conservancy. ...</p>
  <p>Think, for example, about carbon. At present, our economic engine is emitting
    far too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; this is destabilizing the
    climate. We desperately need a valve that can crank the carbon flow down.
    Let&#8217;s assume we can design and install such a valve. (I explained how
    this can be done in my previous book, Who Owns the Sky? It involves selling
    a limited quantity of &#8220;upstream&#8221; permits to companies that bring
    fossil fuels into the economy.) The question then is, who should control
    the valve?</p>
  <p>Unfettered markets can&#8217;t be given that responsibility; as we&#8217;ve
    seen, they have no ability to limit polluting. So we&#8217;re left with two
    options: government or trusts. Government is a political creature; its time
    horizon is short, and future generations have no clout in it. Common property
    trusts, by contrast, are fiduciary institutions. They have long time horizons
    and a legal responsibility to future generations. Given the choice, I&#8217;d
    designate a common property trust to be keeper of the carbon valve, based
    on peer-reviewed advice from scientists. Its trustees could make hard decisions
    without committing political suicide. They might be appointed by the president,
    like governors of the Fed, but they wouldn&#8217;t be obedient to him the
    way cabinet members are. Once appointed, they&#8217;d be legally accountable
    to future generations.</p>
  <p>Now imagine a goodly number of valves at the local, regional, and national
    levels, not just for carbon (which requires only one national valve) but
    for a variety of pollutants. Imagine also that the valve keepers are trusts
    accountable to future generations. They&#8217;d have the power to reduce
    some of the negative externalities &#8212; the illth &#8212; that corporations
    shift to the commons. They&#8217;d also have the power to auction limited
    pollution rights to the highest bidders, and to divide the resulting income
    among commons owners. That&#8217;s something neither the Fed nor the EPA
    can do.</p>
  <p>These trusts would fundamentally change our economic operating system. What
    are now unpriced externalities would become property rights under accountable
    management. If a corporation wanted to pollute, it couldn&#8217;t just do
    so; it would have to buy the rights from a commons trust. The price of pollution
    would go up; corporate illth creation would go down. Ecosystems would be
    protected for future generations. More income would flow to ordinary citizens.
    Nonhuman species would flourish; human inequality would diminish. And government
    wouldn&#8217;t be enlarged &#8212; our economic engine would do these things
    on its own.</p>
  <p>One final point about valves. It&#8217;s not too critical where we set them
    initially. It&#8217;s far more important to install them in the right places,
    and to put the right people in charge. Then they can adjust the settings.
    ...</p>
  <p>A Second Set of Books</p>
  <p>Mental models begin with assumptions. Most economists today assume there
    are only two kinds of property, private (that is, corporate or individual)
    and state. There are no shared assets, no inter- or intragenerational obligations,
    and no nonhumans other than those we eat.</p>
  <p>Yet as we&#8217;ve seen, many things are missing here. The most obvious
    omission is the great economy of nature within which the human enterprise
    operates. We&#8217;re borrowing prodigiously from that economy, but not recording
    the loans. Equally absent are future generations, from whom we&#8217;re borrowing
    just as wantonly and surreptitiously. In a proper bookkeeping system, every
    loan shows up on two balance sheets, the borrower&#8217;s and the lender&#8217;s.
    One entity&#8217;s liability is another entity&#8217;s asset. But this isn&#8217;t
    true in contemporary economics. When the human economy grows, assets on corporate
    and individual balance sheets go up, but nowhere is there a debit. In fact,
    there aren&#8217;t any accounts that could be debited. There&#8217;s only
    good growth on one side of the ledger, and on the other, a void in which
    illth and debt accumulate, uncounted and unnoticed.</p>
  <p>In recent years, economists have added a few bits to this stripped-down
    model. For example, they now recognize public goods and ecosystem services
    as contributors of economic value. Public goods are services like national
    defense, education, and flood control, which benefit everyone but can&#8217;t
    easily be sold at a profit. Because markets don&#8217;t adequately supply
    them, governments step in and do so. Economists sometimes debate whether
    the value of these public goods exceeds the &#8220;burden&#8221; they impose
    on taxpayers, but they don&#8217;t see the expenditures as adding value to
    any account, or to any asset owned by anyone.</p>
  <p>Similarly, many economists now recognize ecosystem services as valuable
    inputs to the economy. However, the ecosystems that produce these services
    have no owners or balance sheets. They&#8217;re just there, floating in space,
    with no connection to humans. What I&#8217;m suggesting is that economists
    treat them as if they were common property held in trust. This simple supposition
    would not only put ecosystems on the books, enabling us to track them better;
    it would also pave the way to real-world property rights that actually protect
    those ecosystems. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

  <p>      <font size="-1">LAWYERS</font></p>
  <p>You are the architects and defenders of property rights. You&#8217;re well
    compensated by private property owners for your labors. Now is the time to
    lend more of your talents to the commons.</p>
  <p>Your job is to design and defend inclusive forms of property that spread
    benefits to as many, rather than as few, as possible. To do this, you must
    play both defense and offense. On defense, be on high alert for &#8220;takings&#8221; from
    the commons &#8212; they happen all the time. I&#8217;m not talking about
    takings by government, but about takings by corporations, which occur far
    more frequently yet are much less noticed.</p>
  <p>Pollution is a taking, noise is a taking, capturing nature&#8217;s scarcity
    rent is a taking. Your first job is to defend the commons against such enclosures.</p>
  <p>Your second job &#8212; the offensive part &#8212; is to forge new property
    rights for the commons. These can be blends, like conservation easements.
    Be creative. Private and common property can often mesh together to the benefit
    of both. Making that happen is your gift. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
