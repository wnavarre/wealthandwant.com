      Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
    Capacity of Land</a><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp; The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable capacity of land without buildings is
up to the job of financing cities, counties, and schools. Will the
revenue be enough? The answer is "yes."</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;The universal state and local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;The unique, remarkable quality of a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land. However high the tax rate, not
one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of town. The
only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is that it
stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people think that is
bad, maybe this attitude is the problem. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;There is the answer to Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope
here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Most California land, on
the other hand, is now taxed at
well below the allowable max of 1%</b>. <b>Speculators may sit on it
at little tax cost, however many highways and water and sewer lines
run to and past it, however many policemen are guarding it from
trespass.</b> Little wonder that California enterprise, once so
dynamic, flexible, and vital, is giving way to stasis and decay. We
used to lead the nation in making jobs; now in losing them. We used
to lead in school quality; now in jail population. 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you tax land,
the market moves each owner to join it with labor and capital as a
vehicle for enterprise or shelter.</span>    </small></li>
  <li><small>When you untax it, the market
moves each owner to hold it more passively and obstructively as a
"store of value," like a dog burying a bone. The market not only
moves the sitting owners, it moves ownership itself to new owners
whose needs are compatible with the tax system you impose. ... 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Making the property tax more
progressive is not just
equitable, it raises its revenue capacity. That is because visible
damage to the poor and marginal puts a cap on any tax. You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip, and if you try you'll look like the
Sheriff of Nottingham. <b>A land tax won't drive the poor from their
humble huts, because it exempts the huts, and the sites have low tax
valuations. It may tax a few off valuable land, if their poor huts
are there and they own the land. However, if they own such land, are
they really poor?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;They may be "land-poor:" a
few folks always are. They have
non-cash assets, but are illiquid. "Illiquid" may be just a euphemism
for "holding out for more" -- there is always a market at a price.
Even so their plight, genuine or affected, traditionally evokes
sympathy and support. We must address it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;California, although
backward in many ways, has addressed it
effectively. In our <b>special improvement districts (SIDs)</b>,
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">State law allows the SID to
contract with the landowner as follows.</span><small
 style="text-decoration: underline;">
<small><small>You don't have to pay your annual charge
in cash. If
you choose not to, we take an equity in your property, charging a
modest rate of interest. Our equity accumulates over time. When you
die, we sell the property and take our share; your estate gets the
rest. Should our equity reach 100% during your lifetime, you stay
there for the duration, tax free.</small></small></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Objectively, it looks like a
good deal for the taxpayer.
They can't come out behind, even if they die soon; if they live long,
they come out ahead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The instructive
result is that very few people
take this apparently advantageous option.</span> UCLA's Donald Shoup
has
published several works on the program. One way or another, they
manage to pay on time. Perhaps it attracts the attention of potential
heirs, in a compelling way, but somehow the cash comes forth. While
intending only to relieve distress, the program seems to have called
a great bluff. The lachrymose plea of the cash-poor widow is
unanswerable in debate, without appearing callous, doctrinaire, and
jackbooted. Meantime wealthy interests, thoroughly undistressed, hide
behind the widow's skirt and get their way. <a
