  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Some very bright people carry in their heads the idea that land represents
            roughly 20% to 25% of the value of a typical home. And while there is one
            situation in which that assumption may be pretty accurate, it is a fleeting
            moment in life of a structure!</p>
      </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">There seems to be a rule of thumb which says that however much a builder
          pays for a piece of land, he will maximize his profits on the building project
          if he places on that site a house that will sell for about 4 times what he
          paid for the land. So far, so good.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>But what happens next? Buildings, like cars, trucks, machinery, and most
              things manmade, depreciate over time. The Federal Reserve Board pegs the
              annual rate on single family homes at 1.5%. Land, however, tends to appreciate
              as a function of at least three factors: </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">population increase (general and
                local); </div>

      <div style="text-align: center;">

                on infrastructure and services.</div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">As we do things right now, we permit the landholder to pocket that
              appreciation as his private treasure, and we finance public spending
              mostly through taxes on taxbases other than land value! </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Is this any way to run a rational and just society? Hardly. Land Value
        Taxation is the remedy for this.</p>

              F. Post's Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a> &#8212; Appendix:
            FAQ</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> <em>Q6. If a land-owner builds, does not that increase the value
                of his land and consequently the amount of the tax he would have
                to pay? If so, would not he be taxed for his improvement?</em><br>
    A. No. Upon the value of the building he would never pay any tax. It is true
    that his improvement might attract others to the locality in such numbers
    as to make land there scarcer and consequently dearer. His own lot would
    in that case rise in value with the other land and be taxed more, just as
    the rest would be. But that would not take any of his labor in taxes; he
    would still have his building free of taxation. Thus: If on a lot worth $1000
    a building worth $1000 were erected, making the whole worth $2000, the tax
    would fall only upon the $1000 which represents the value of the lot. If
    land then became so scarce that the lot rose in value to $1500 the tax would
    be raised. But the owner's improvement would be still exempt. When his property
    was worth $2000 he was taxed on $1000, the value of the lot, leaving $1000,
    the value of the building, free; and now, though he is taxed on $1500, the
    value of the lot, $1000, the value of the building, is still free. </p>
            <p><em>Q21. Do not the benefits of good government increase the value
                of houses as well as of land?</em><br>
A. No. <strong>Houses are never worth any more than it costs to reproduce them.
Good government tends to diminish the cost of house building; how, then, can
good
government increase the value of houses?</strong> You are confused by the fact
that houses, being attached to land, seem to increase in value, when it is the
land and not the house that really increases. It is the same mistake that a somewhat
noted economic teacher, who advocates protection as his specialty, made when
he tried
to show that there is an &quot;unearned increment&quot; to houses as well as
to lands. He did so by instancing a lot of vacant land which had risen in value
from $5000 to $10,000, and comparing it with a house on a neighboring lot which,
as he said, had also increased in value from $5000 to $10,000. At the moment
when he wrote, the house to which he referred could have been reproduced for
$5000; and had he been capable of thinking out a proposition he must have discovered
that it was the lot on which the house stood, and not the house itself, which
had increased in value.... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

                where the unimproved land values are very small?</em><br>
A. However poor the town or heavy the taxes, it would at least tend the equalize
their present tax burden. The assessed value of land in the three smallest towns
of Massachusetts, Alford, Holland, and Peru, is $282,335, or more than three
times that of the buildings. Allowing one half of the assessed valuation of land
to be improvement value, the unimproved basis for taxation would be $141,168,
or 60 percent more than the buildings. Thus an apportionment according to unimproved
land values, increasing ever so slowly, would seem to be fairer than one according
to improvements, which require constant renewal. ... <a href="../docs/Fillebrown_Catechism.htm">read

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil
            wins at the point where he
            convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
            Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
            kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
            invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
            mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well,
            breathlessly focused on their own
            particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
            land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
            are
            out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
            than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
            on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
          the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
            that no free lunch exists. But
            when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
            statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
            one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
            lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span

            the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the

            called
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
            characteristically in the form of land rent.
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
            appraising that undervalues the real
          income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two
            appraisal
          methods</b></small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
            Both start by estimating its
          market value.</small></p>
          <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
          buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
          value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their
          replacement cost (which usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
          little land value) or their depreciated value (which gives an
          unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
          repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
          Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
          The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
          intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</small></li>
            <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
          the land,
          and treats the difference as representing the building's value. The
          first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map for the
          district or city. This displays fairly smooth contours for land values.
          Overlays would show zoning variations. Most of the variations in
          property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
          along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
          rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
          parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
          parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
          in neighbourhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
          be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
          maximise the site's current economic value.</small></li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
            appraisal methods do not
            acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
            price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
            driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
            as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
            around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
            rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
            built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
            acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
            up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
            ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
          changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve
            multiplies the building's original cost by the
            rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
            implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
            usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
            value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
          lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
            explanation of land/building relations
            should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
            same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
            property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
            <b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
            that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
            price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
          accordingly.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
            accepted, then I believe that economists
            would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
          opposite usually is done.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small></small></p>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A curious asymmetry</b></small>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>IF THE APPRAISAL controversy is
            framed in terms of business cycle
            analysis, then the statistician finds no reasonable alternative to
            seeing that when the cycle rises and falls, the difference must be in
            the land, not buildings. <b>What people are buying are not
            reproduction costs, whose fluctuations over the course of the credit
            cycle are relatively minor. They are buying site value, which is in
            limited supply, akin to a natural monopoly.</b> Most of all, real
            estate investors and homeowners are buying the right to resell their
            property as prices are bid up by what they expect to become an
            increasingly affluent economy fuelled by an abundant supply of
          mortgage credit.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The land-residual approach
            appears to work as long as a fairly
            constant proportion of land to buildings is maintained.</span>
            Statistically, this can occur only when property prices are rising at
            about the same rate as commodity prices and wages. But business
            cycles snake around the economy's basic trends, rising steadily and
            then plunging sharply. This fluctuation is what causes the most
          serious problems for statisticians.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
            a thriving real estate market
            appraisers typically use a rule
            of thumb in allocating resale prices as between land and buildings to
            reflect their pre-existing proportions. Buildings typically are
            assumed to account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of the
            property's value. As a result, building values are estimated to grow
            along with a property's overall sales value. </span>This appraisal
            practice
            is made to appear plausible as the pace of asset-price inflation
            tends to go hand in hand with rising construction costs, and hence in
          the theoretical replacement cost of buildings.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As noted, the anomaly occurs when
            real estate prices fall. Real
            estate prices are volatile, while construction costs rarely dip more
            than slightly, if at all. When real estate prices turn down, they
            often plunge below the reproduction cost of buildings. Hence, the
            residual ("land") rises and falls much more sharply than do building
            replacement costs (which are estimated as rising at a fairly steady
          pace) and overall property values.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result is a curious asymmetry.
            Building prices seem to be
            responsible for the rise in real estate prices, while land prices are
            held responsible for their decline. When the fall in property values
            intersects the rising reproduction-cost trend, the land residual
          turns negative.</small></p>
          <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because this land value often
            represents the owner's equity, this
            decline may prompt heavily indebted owners to default on their loans
            or even to walk away from their property, which reverts to the bank
            or other mortgage holder. In this sense the financial system itself
            is based largely on real estate, as the economy learned in the
            savings and loan (S&amp;L) deposit insurance crisis of the late
            1980s. Real estate prices reflect the supply of property (including a
            fixed supply of land) as compared with the fluctuating supply of
            mortgage credit, which tends to be a function of the economy's
            overall liquidity. ... <a

                  than resident owners.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The
                  land fraction in real estate is generally highest in the CBD of any city,
                  so that is a favorite place for absentees to buy and hold. They like
                  the steady income, and the "trophy" quality. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
                  surplus in real estate is what attracts outside buyers, and land is what
                  yields the surplus.</span></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><b>About 2/3 of downtown Los Angeles is owned
                  by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more workaday city, Milwaukee,
                  the absentee owners consist of former residents, or their heirs, who
            grew too rich to abide the harsh winters.</b></small></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Consider the effect on your balance
                of payments. When you get more tax money from absentees, money that used
                to flow to Tehran, Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your local treasury
                to pay your local teachers and city workers, and relieve your builders
                and building managers. In this way taxing land actually acts to undergird
            the value of its own base.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small> <font

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Reassess Land Frequently
</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is important to assess land for
tax purposes often, especially
on a rising market. (Landowners will see to it you do so on a falling
market.) Land appreciates most years, while buildings depreciate
physically every year. Lagging assessments therefore automatically
overtax buildings relative to land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>New Hampshire Assemblyman Richard
Noyes has circulated data on the
effect of reassessment in NH. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The land
fraction of assessed value
rises each time there is a reassessment.</span> Keene, NH leads with
frequent reassessments, a high fraction of land in the mix, and a
strong track record attracting enterprise and jobs.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In California, where we used to
have good assessment, we now have
bad assessment legally mandated by Prop. 13. So long as land is
unsold, and/or not newly improved, its assessment rise is capped at 2
percent a year, while market prices soar. Here is one example of the
results. This year the Metro Water District of Southern California
(MWD) condemned 410 acres for its new Domenigoni Reservoir to expand
the system (to accommodate land speculators in the desert boonies).
The jury hit them for $43 million, which works out to about $1.95 a
square foot.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question occurred to me, how
does that square with the
assessed value for property taxation? I asked Ted Gwartney, a
professional appraiser with the Bank of America, to check the
assessed value. It is about seven cents a square foot; The
condemnation price, supposedly based on market value, is about 28
times the assessed value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is not the result of
fractional assessment. In California we
assess property at 100 percent when land changes ownership or there
is a new building. Rather, this is the result of Prop. 13 and its
prohibition of market reassessment until land sells.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I thought that was startling, but
Mr. Gwartney's reaction was,
"What else is new?" He, who works with such data every day, has a
rule of thumb that market land value in California today is about
eight times assessed value. That is important enough to repeat: our
assessed land values are routinely at 1/8 of true land value. I
wouldn't dare say that on my own authority, but Mr. Gwartney is here
to confirm it. He is a veteran appraiser; for many years he was
Director of Assessments for the entire Province of British
Columbia.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Does this help you understand why
California landowners are now so
slow to adapt to new demands? In 1945 the assessors were building
fires under landowners, so they sought new strategies to meet new
circumstances. Today there remains a weak incentive to improve to
improve property: tax collectors generally cost them money when they
make improvements. Sit still, lie low, hire no one, hang on, produce
nothing, and your holding costs are negligible.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A little of the old magic lingers.
In October, 1995, a 225-acre
parcel in Corona, the Chase Ranch, was sold to a builder, Coscan
Davidson Homes, for building 967 units. The previous owners, "GGS,"
including a Japanese insurance firm, were "seeking a way out. They
were behind in tax payments and GGS was losing its staying power,..."
quoth Stephen Doyle, spokesman for the buyer. It is that "staying
power" that stifles land use and production. Coscan wants to build
immediately. Even so, though, they plan to take five years to build
out the project - if everything goes well. This is the new,
post-Prop. 13 meaning of "immediately."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In spite of extreme
underassessment, the assessed value of taxable
land in California is 40 percent of the total real estate value.
Imagine what it would be if assessed values were real values,
"marked-to-market,'' as the law used to stipulate. It would be over
70 percent, as in 1917. "Staying power" would go down; land use, jobs
and production would rise.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Use the
Building-Residual Method of Allocating Value</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is equally important to use the
"Building-Residual Method" of
allocating value between land and buildings. This means you value the
land first, as though it were vacant, based on highest and best use.
You subtract this land value from the total value of
land-&amp;-building as currently improved: the residual, if any, is
building value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Valuing one lot or parcel this
way, you have information needed
for valuing neighboring and other comparable parcels. Using a map
with value contours, you can value a whole city this way with
surprising ease and speed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using this method, I valued
Milwaukee land in 1963 and 1967. The
building-residual method nearly tripled the land values reported by
the City Assessor, who was using the assessor's usual inconsistent
mix of various other methods. How's that again? Did I say tripled?
Yes, I really said "tripled." By his methods, buildings on the eve of
demolition were carrying values higher than their sites; by the
building-residual method these old buildings had no value at all,
which of course is why they were being torn down. Besides
depreciation and technological obsolescence, many buildings suffered
severe "locational obsolescence," owing to shifting demand patterns.
The land was re-usable, and had as much or more value without the
extant buildings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Using the building-residual method
requires no change in present
laws. It is within the latitude of assessing officials, who, in turn,
respond to public opinion. The conscientious citizens' move is to
educate and bring pressure, just as the old single-tax campaigners
like Jackson Ralston did. In the process of "losing" they won over
half of what they sought, just by taking a stand and making the
effort.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Federal Income Taxes
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One of assessors' greatest
problems today is the strong pressures
from owners who want to allocate as much value as possible to
buildings that they may depreciate for federal income tax purposes.
Here is where we must study how the parts form the big picture. Here
is where federal and local tax policies intersect. Some Georgists
have neglected or misunderstood the income-tax treatment of land
income. Let us see how this works.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Congress and the IRS let one
depreciate buildings, but not land,
for income tax. This important distinction harks back to when the
income tax was new, and Georgist Congressmen like Warren Worth
Bailey, from Johnstown, PA and Henry George Jr., from Brooklyn were
instrumental in shaping it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a building is new, the
depreciable value is limited to the
cost of construction. The non-depreciable land is the bare land value
before construction. So far, so good. Over time, however, building
owners have converted this into a tax shelter scheme. Owner A, the
builder, writes off the building in a few years, much less than its
economic life, and sells it to B. "A" pays a tax on the excess of
sales price over "basis." The basis is reduced by all depreciation
taken, so any excess depreciation is "recaptured" upon sale. It is
defined by Congress as a "capital gain," and given the corresponding
package of tax preferences:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>deferral of tax,</small></li>
  <li><small>lower rate,</small></li>
  <li><small>step-up of basis at time of death,</small></li>
  <li><small>tax-free exchanges, etc.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus far, any tax preference goes
to A, the builder, and may be
seen as a wellconsidered building incentive. Watch, however, what
happens next. "A" sells to B and B depreciates the building all over
again, from his purchase price. To do so, B must allocate the new
"basis" - i.e., his purchase price - between depreciable building and
non-depreciable land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How shall B allocate the new
basis? Enter the local tax assessor.
Here is where local assessment intersects with Federal income tax
policy. The IRS does not try to assess land and buildings. Instead,
IRS instructions tell taxpayers they may use locally assessed values
to allocate basis between depreciable buildings and non-depreciable
land. The IRS accepts this allocation as conclusive. As a result,
local owners of income property press their assessors to allocate as
much value as possible to buildings, and as little as possible to
land. This does not affect their local taxes, but lowers their
federal taxes. It lets them depreciate land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Local revenues are not immediately
affected. Local assessors have
little reason not to accommodate their constituents, local
landowners, to help them depreciate land for federal and state income
tax purposes. They have little reason to use the correct
"building-residual'' method of allocating value, and a compelling
reason to use the wrong method that understates land value. Thus they
convert non-depreciable land value into depreciable building value.
It is the modern version of "competitive underassessment." In the
process, they also convert the local property tax from a land tax
into a building tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>After a while B sells to C, who in
turn sells to D, so each
building is depreciated many times. So is a large part of the land
under it, tame after time, although it should not be depreciated at
all. This is carried so far that real estate pays no federal or state
income taxes at all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The solution to this lies with the
U.S. Congress. The need is to
limit depreciation to one cycle only. It is a most urgent problem for
both federal and local treasuries. We all have Congressmen. Write to
them and raise their consciousness. They are brokers who respond to
public opinion. It is we who are derelict.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You might also think that Tulare,
being rural, has a lot higher
fraction of land value in its mix, but again, not so. The<b><i> Land
Share of Real Estate Value (LSREV)</i></b> in Tulare County is 28
percent, compared to a statewide mean of 40 percent, and 47 percent
in Orange County. (This datum, and others of like kind, refute the
conventional belief that farm counties are heavy on land in the mix.
On this last point, I must respectfully take issue with my good old
friend Gene Wunderlich, whose paper at this conference suggests that
farm counties have higher land fractions. I wonder if he has perhaps
conflated building values with pure land values? My data, from
California State Board of Equalization, show lower land fractions in
real estate in the purely rural counties of the San Joaquin Valley.)
Grazing and mining counties like Inyo have high values of LSREV, but
they are a small share of the farm economy. (lnyo County, lightly
peopled but heavily cattled, has $136,000 per capita, with very few
human capita (and its cattle are exempt from the California property
tax). Major farm counties with intensive farms, like those of San
Joaquin Valley, have low values of LSREV.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Within counties, disparities among
cities and school districts are
much greater. In Tulare County, one pathetic little povertyville, the
City of Parlier, has just $10,000 of assessed value per capita. Here
are some assessed values per capita from different California cities
in the County of Los Angeles: Lynwood, $21,500; Beverly Hills,
$294,000 (14 times Lynwood); City of Industry, $5,533,000 (257 times
Lynwood).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
is why some critics call the property tax "regressive." It
has given some plausibility to the otherwise bizarre claim that
switching to a sales tax is less regressive than sticking with the
property tax. </span>Within each city a property tax is progressive,
but
<span style="font-weight: bold;">when your data meld cities like poor
little Parlier and Lynwood with
Beverly Hills, you sometimes find poor people paying more of their
income in property taxes than rich people, and getting less for it.
</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Switching just the
local property tax to land ex buildings will do
little or nothing to correct such disparities, and therefore make
little progress toward overall social justice, and the wide support
that will evoke. </span>There is, in fact, a natural cap on local
property
tax rates imposed by local particularism: the City Council of Beverly
Hills will not raise taxes in Beverly Hills for the benefit of voters
in Parlier.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">To
avoid such regressivity we must work out some formula for power

Concentration of Farm Land Ownership</small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So, for those two reasons,
concentration of land ownership is not
only high but it has risen at a very rapid rate.&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small>To sum up, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>rising acreages mean there are fewer farms overall. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Rising labor prices per farm mean aspiring farmers who
lack prior
wealth can no longer buy in.&nbsp;</small></li>
  <li><small>Rising Gini Ratios mean acreage is less equally shared
among a
given number of farms. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Higher quality land is moving into bigger
farms. "Gamma" is the top bracket acre value divided by the mean acre
value, and it is
rising. The Gamma data are confirmed by rising shares of cropland and
irrigated land in vast farms. Rising price to cash flow (P/C) ratios
reflect a higher land share
of real estate value (LSREV), and they mean it is harder for a
newcomer to acquire any farm acres. The combination means the
agricultural ladder has been
pulled up. Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside
finance; exit and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes
accompanied and followed a 40 percent
drop in farm property taxes.&nbsp; </small></li>

studies have greatly
understated the share of land in real
estate value.</span> Some overlook it altogether. The good ones assign
it
a value, and allow for nonshifting, but the value is much too low. They
are all pre-Douglas Commission Report, and rendered obsolete by
Manvel's study of how high a share land values are.<small><span

Manvel's study
plus my Milwaukee study plus Gustafson's California data support a
land share of 40% and up, much higher than the 15% or so used by

40-50% of the total in Washington, D.C., California, and some other
jurisdictions that have updated assessments.
</small> </div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is true that in most
jurisdictions land is underassessed, and
Musgrave's numbers were reasonable in their day as a statement of
what assessors were doing. As noted, however, maladministration
should be blamed on administrators, not on the property tax per se. And
Musgrave omitted three important points.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b style="text-decoration: underline;">One, the share of
land in real estate tends to rise with value

So
nonshiftability of the property tax rises with wealth.</small></li>
  <li><small><b>Two, the share of land in real estate is lowest in

on progressivity. </b>71c Land share is highest, normally over half,
in commerce, where the assumption is critical. In Milwaukee, 40% of all
retail land space is in gas stations! The property tax on downtown and
other retail landowners with wide parking lots in good locations is one
of the most progressive imaginable, but Musgravian assumptions convert
it into a regressive sales tax.</small></li>

earlier and more intensive use of land. To assume non-shifting
understates their impact on landowners. They weaken his market position
vis-a-vis non-owners, making them doubly progressive. This is a
fortiori true of mineral bearing lands. Here, property tax critics
often forecast panic liquidation if rates rise. They overdraw the
point, but there is a point there, and it is in the reverse of forward

CONCLUSION
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is a common belief that
property tax relief is "good for
farmers." It certainly raises the private share of economic rent.
That in turn raises the investment grade of farmland and encourages
its purchase as a store of value, a place to park slack money. This
may be at odds, however, with using it as a vehicle for enterprise
and an outlet for workmanship. Lower farm property taxes are
associated with lower ratios of capital to land, and labor to land,
both over time and among states. They are also associated with bigger
mean farm size and less equal distribution of farm sizes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the sections that follow, I
first document the rise of
inequality in the distribution of farmland that followed a sharp drop
in farm property tax rates after 1930. Then I show, by
cross-sectional analysis, a positive relationship between higher
property tax rates and more intensive use of farmland, which in turn
is associated with more equal distribution of farmland. Conversely, I
find property tax relief associated with underuse and
underimprovement of land.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A priori</i>, a tax on
buildings works to suppress building and
to penalize smaller farmers, whose building to land ratio is higher
than that of bigger farmers. The findings seem to show, therefore, a
stronger countereffect, proincentive and pro-subdivision, of the
other part of the property tax, the part based on land value.<br>
... <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Now, however, 34 percent
of all irrigated land is in the top bracket, farms of 2,000 acres and
over. </span><font size="-1"><small><b><i>(10) </i></b></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Control of irrigated
land means control over water. Control of water gives control over
arid lands roundabout. Ownership and control based on water have
become highly concentrated. For farms with irrigated land, GR = .82,
</span><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="-1"><small><i>(11)</i></small></font><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> substantially higher than
the GR of .76 for all farms. ...</span><br>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The combination means the

Entry is nearly impossible for farmers lacking outside finance; exit
and latifundiazation proceed apace. These changes accompanied and
followed a 40 percent drop in farm property tax rates.&nbsp;<strong> ...
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>THE LESSER
IMPROVEMENT OF BIGGER FARMS</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A result of rising concentration
is the separation of land from
capital. With some exaggeration, American latifundia are now lands
without buildings, but buildings cluster on smaller farms, many
without enough land. This implies at least three points.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, building wealth is more equally distributed than
land wealth.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, the property tax would be more progressive if
changed to a pure land tax, exempting buildings.</small></li>
  <li><small>Third, many latifundia are not being used to their
potential, while capital on some small farms is undercomplemented with
land. I support the case first using national data, and then by
comparing states.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is awkward that the 1987
Census of Agriculture defines "farm
size," and ranks farms, only by acres rather than value.&nbsp; ...<br>
<br>
<b>Concentration of
irrigated land</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The yield per acre of most crops
stays level or rises with
harvested acres per farm. At the same time, sales per dollar of real
estate fall somewhat. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>(21)</i></b></small></font>
The
most likely reason is that the quality of harvested land rises with
quantity. There is, to be sure, a trade-off between quality and
quantity, but there is also a bond. Whoever can afford more can
afford better. Which effect is stronger? The question must be
resolved by data.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><i>Comparing different crops,
high values of GR go with crops
that are mostly irrigated.</i></b> For example, 85 percent of tomato
acres and 14 percent of silage corn are irrigated. For tomatoes, GR =
.91; for silage corn, GR = .52.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font size="-2">(26) Those who find GR
index numbers too abstract will find more meaning in these raw data.
For tomatoes, the top acreage bracket contains 1.1 percent of the
farms, 45 percent of the harvested acres, and 52 percent of the
irrigated acres in tomatoes. For silage corn, the top bracket contains
1.0 percent of the farms, 11.3 percent of the harvested acres, and 26

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>CONCLUSION</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One may at least firmly conclude
that large farm units are less
improved and less peopled than small and medium-sized farms. There
are two possible interpretations. One is that big farms are more
efficient, getting more from less, but that is refuted by their
getting less output per $L. The other is that Veblen was right, many
of them are oversized stores of value, held first to park slack money
and only secondly to produce food and fiber, and complement the
owner's workmanship.&nbsp;The
Florida 9 [the high LSREV states] may represent a home grown rural
"third world" of large,
underutilized landholdings that preempt the best land and force
median farmers onto small farms on low-grade land.</small><font
 size="-2"></font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The issue cannot be settled in a
few words, but the implications
for tax policy are the same either way. If large units are more
efficient, they can bear heavier taxes. If they are less efficient,
heavier PTRs will induce them to release surplus land for others,
which will tend at the margins to equalize factor proportions, moving
more states from the Florida toward the Wisconsin model. </small><small><a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">e. Relying on the National Bureau of
Economic Research (NBER)</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp; Many
economists treat numbers from the NBER as iconic. The press routinely
cites their datings of U.S. recessions and recoveries as &#8220;official.&#8221;
Many writers cite <span style="font-weight: bold;">Raymond Goldsmith</span>'s
estimates of United States land
values, dating from 1955 and 1962, as &#8220;authoritative,&#8221; because they
carry the NBER imprimatur. Yet they do not bear examination, even for
their times. They were generated as incidents to other work in an
offhand and indefensible way.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; It
is not easy to retrace Goldsmith's steps; one must track interlocking
footnotes from several sources. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">At the end of the trail, however,
he
simply takes residential land value as 15 percent of building value
(which comes to 13 percent of land and building value).</span> The
basis of
this allocation is the share of land in the cost of one to four family
houses insured by the Federal Housing Authority, which was about 20
percent. He does not even explain why he cut this down to 13 percent.
Goldsmith then applies this basis to nonresidential real estate as
well. As for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">corporate held
lands</span>, he enters them at book value -- an
attitude that opened the door to an epidemic of corporate raiding.
Goldsmith also seems to omit vacant lots and unsubdivided land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
These methods are not worthy of the faith with which several economists
cite the results. <span style="font-weight: bold;">FHA insured houses
are not typical. They tend to be
new and on cheap land. </span>Those not new are not very old -- in
1967 the
median age of insured existing homes was thirteen years. To apply such
data to a typical American city, most of whose dwelling units in 1965
antedated 1920, was outlandish. It is more outlandish today in 2004.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">FHA
clientele is lower middle class, which means the land share is low,
land being both a consumer luxury and a rich man's hedge, the land
share rising sharply with value.</span> The high land share in Beverly
Hills,
Greenwich, Belvedere, Santa Fe Springs, Palm Beach, Kenilworth, and
other enclaves of wealth is missing from FHA data.</small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp; The FHA is most
active at
the expanding fringe of cities. A basic fact of urban land economics is
that the land share rises toward the center. In Manhattan, for example,
the share of assessed land value has always been higher than in the
other boroughs.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Applying a land
fraction derived from
residential data to commerce and industry is not believable. The land
share is highest in retailing, the more so now that retailing entails
vast parking areas.</span> Filling stations and and drive-ins of all
kinds entail vast aprons for small buildings with short lives. Some
retailers store their inventories outdoors: auto dealerships, lumber
yards, junk yards are examples. Many wholesalers and industries do the
same: tank farms, railroad yards, utility easements, industrial
reserves, dumps, drive ins, salt beds, terminals, heaps of coal and
salt and sulfur, and so on and on. In downtown Milwaukee, half the
assessed value is land. In Manhattan, it is instructive to consider the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Empire State Building</span>. If ever
a structure overdeveloped a site, the world's tallest building on a
fringe site should be it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet in two
transactions since 1950 the site was valued at one third the total. One
may infer what this implies of the whole island.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
Anyone active in real estate would have caught Goldsmith&#8217;s error. Yet
it passed muster with the NBER, his publisher the Princeton University
Press, and several learned academic reviewers. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This is not a measure of
their general incompetence, but of the extent to which academicians
have walled themselves off from anything bearing on the realities of
land values and rents. Goldsmith treated land carelessly, as a trivial
side-issue, and his finding was ignored by everyone except those who
needed to invoke an authority to trivialize land value.</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;
Several published case studies document the higher ratio of land value
to building value in non-residential uses, and central cities. Here I
will merely list them.</small></div>

Goldsmith's transfer of the land share in a few new FHA residences to

and destroys any value they might have.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another Goldsmith error is to
exclude subsoil assets.</span> In cities

difference. In most cities that may not matter, but is symptomatic of
how insouciantly Goldsmith handled this whole matter of land values.

<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Land Fraction of

<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On most assessment rolls the
value of
old &#8220;junker&#8221; buildings, on the eve of demolition, is listed as higher
than the land under them. This betrays the erroneous use of the
&#8220;land-residual&#8221; method of separating land from building values. It
should be obvious that the old junker has no residual value: that is
why it is being junked. Junking is continuous in enclaves of high value
like Kenilworth, Illinois, or Beverly Hills, California. &#8220;<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Locational obsolescence</span>&#8221; is the key
concept. The high and growing value of the underlying site cannibalizes

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. He keeps repeating we must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Hold on again," I have
heard, "how much revenue can land
yield by itself?" It is my job to address that. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I assure you it
can
yield more than local governments need.</span> I have already pointed
out
you can raise the rate to any level without fear of driving away
jobs, capital, people, or building. That is a remarkable quality in a
tax, especially one as progressive as the land tax. I will also
support the point in several other ways.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;The taxable capacity of
land is camouflaged in our times
by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a consistent modern
tendency to underassess it, relative to
buildings.</span> There are several studies in point. The most general
one
is the quinquennial Report of the U.S. Census of Governments. It
actually understates the tendency a lot, by omitting the class of
land most underassessed, that is, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">raw acreage in and near
cities.</span></b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is great latitude in
the assessment process. This
latitude is now used to lower the fraction of the property tax base
that is listed as land value, and raise the fraction that is listed
as building value. It could just as well be used the other way, and
used to be in many cities, whenever assessors were getting that
message through the election returns. This would have roughly the
same effect as going to a two-rate system on a more formal basis --
except, obviously, that the formal basis is more permanent, reliable,
and generally respectable. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have here data ... I worked
up in Milwaukee from 1969 data indicating that, if land were assessed
correctly, the land fraction of the real estate tax base would be
over twice what the City Assessor reported. His fraction was 31%; it
should have been 70%. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>How does one come to so startling
a finding? Wisconsin is not a
backward state. It prides itself on the high quality of its public
administration. <b>What I did was study sites on the eve of
demolition.</b> When you buy an old junker to tear down and replace
with a new building, you (the market) are obviously recognizing that
the building has no residual value. All the value is then in the
land. However, in Milwaukee in 1969 the Assessor was saying the
building was worth about three times as much as the land, just before
tear-down. That is a good way to measure to what extent land is
underassessed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Try that in Manhattan. When
the visitor first gapes at its
skyline from afar, it looks like one big modern high-rise. If you
poke around on foot much, though, you soon realize those are the
exception. Most of the lots are covered with obsolete junk, some of
it tumbledown, commanding rents mainly for their location value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Check the Empire State
Building. Old as it is, it is
still nearly the tallest building in the world. As to its site, it is
in a so-so reach of 5th Avenue (34th Street), many blocks from the 100%
location (57th Street, I would
guess). Even so, when the site and the building sold in separate
transactions a few years ago, the site represented 1/3 of the total
value. What does that say about the land fraction on neighboring
parcels, covered only with the remains of ordinary old structures?
What does that say about the land fraction nearer the 100% location?<b>
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... retailing has a higher
land fraction than any other major land use (except vacant, golf
courses, cemeteries, parking lots, etc.). <b>That is because location
is more critical to retailers than other businesses. You can tell
this by their high rate of tear-downs and remodeling. ...
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;"Hold on once more," I
hear, "not so fast, <b>how about the
mansions of rich people?</b>" Another fair question: how, indeed, can
you justify exempting them from taxation? The answer may astonish
you. Here are some data from British Columbia that speak to the
point. They are from the area around Vancouver (The "Lower Mainland")
and the southern part of Vancouver Island, around Victoria, where
over half the people in the province live. B.C. practices high
quality professional assessment; data from its rolls are quite
reliable, as such things go.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Cities and districts around
Vancouver and Victoria are
ranked, in<a
 href="../../by%20author/Gaffney/the_taxable_capacity_of_la.htm#TABLE%201:%20%20Land%20Values%20%28LV%29%20per">
</a>Table 1,
according to the land value per property (single-family residences).
These range from nearly $700,000 each in the "University Endowment
Lands" district (very posh), to around $40,000 each in the "Victoria
Rural" district (more modest). The last column, LSREV (Land Share of
Real Estate Value), shows the land value (L) as a share of the total
value (B+L). 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These shares range from a high
of 80% on the<b> University
Endowment Lands (UEL)</b> down to 38% in Colwood (the lowest), and
39% in Victoria Rural (next to lowest). In between, the numbers
follow the trend closely. The dearer the land parcels, the higher is
the "land fraction" (the fraction of total real estate value that is
land value). From such data, one might formulate a rule along the
lines that "the lot value increases with the square of the house
value." It is hard to be so precise, and not necessary. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The relevant
rule we need here is just that people's house values are more alike
than their lot values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
lot value, more than house value, that
divides the rich from the poor.</span></span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;The average house (ex
land) in the posh UEL jurisdiction
is worth 2.8 times the average in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($173.1/$61.9). The average land parcel (ex building) in the UEL is
worth 17.5 times the average in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($692.5/$39.6).</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Now do us both a favor,
please. Pause and savor that
comparison. Let it linger, as though you were testing a slow sip of
wine from Fredonia's famous grapes. Roll it on your tongue, mull
sensually over its aroma and bouquet, and, getting back to business,
mull cerebrally over its full import<b>. The house that shelters the
very rich family is worth 2.8 times the house of the modest family;
but the land under the house of the very rich is worth 17.5 times the
land of the modest.</b> Seventeen and one half times as much! Again,
it is lot value, more than building value, that divides the rich from
the poor. Seldom will you find an economic rule more strongly
supported by data. It's just a matter of presenting the data so as to
test and bring out the rule.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An American counterpart of
Vancouver's "University Endowment
Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
something like a million dollars. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Beverly Hills, with its great
wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." </span>Every year
many a
grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;What do those data tell us?
The rich as a rule do not live
next to the poor. Rather, they cluster in neighborhoods with much
higher lot values. <b>The poor seek shelter first, and go where it is
affordable.</b> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The rich put
a high premium on location,
neighborhood, views, and grounds, resulting in higher land fractions
in their real estate.</span> Mansions are visible evidences of wealth,
impressing viewers powerfully; land values are invisible. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The
perceptual bias is to underrate the invisible, if you are not
regularly in the real estate market.</span> In the numbers, however,
land
and buildings are equally visible, and their message is clear. <b>It
is land value more than house value that divides the rich from the
poor. Ergo, a tax shift from buildings to land is a shift from the
poor to the rich, even though the houses of the rich are exempted. It
makes the property tax more progressive. ... 
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another attractive feature of
land taxation is its interesting positive effect on the economic base
of a city. It strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners
harder than resident owners. The land fraction in real estate is
generally highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place
for absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. About 2/3 of downtown Los
Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh winters.<br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Differences among city tax bases
are actually, however, extreme. One
desperate little farm town in Fresno County, Parlier, has just
$10,000 of assessed value per head. Here are some assessed values
per head from different California cities in The County of Los
Angeles:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Lynwood, $21,500; </small></li>
  <li><small>Beverly Hills, $294,000 (13 times Lynwood); </small></li>
  <li><small>City of Industry, $5,533,000 (257 times Lynwood, and 553
times
Parlier) . </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Destitute Slab City (Unincorp.) in
Riverside County has no land
values at all. (It is an abandoned military base between a bombing
range and the fragrant southern end of the Salton Sea, with rotting
algae and dying fish.) One would not expect much support in The
City of Industry for a proposal to share land as common property with
the transients who park in Slab City, which has no public services
except a species of public schooling, nor would we expect the
transients to stay in or return to Slab City if they could park on
the streets of Beverly Hills, camp in its parks, attend its schools,
and beg or "work for food" on Rodeo Drive.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is why some critics have
called the property tax
"regressive." Balkanization of the property tax gives some
plausibility to the otherwise bizarre claim that switching to a sales
tax is less regressive than sticking with a property tax. Within
each city the property tax is progressive, but when your data meld
cities like poor little Parlier and Lynwood with Beverly Hills you
sometimes find poor people paying more of their income in property
taxes than rich people, and getting less for it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then there are resource tax
enclaves. Hydrocarbons and hardrock
minerals are unevenly distributed, geographically. McLure tells us
that the Siberian oblast of Tyumen, with 2% of Russia's people,
yields 65% of Russia's oil. There are similar regional disparities
worldwide.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rich
farm counties are not,
generally, resource tax-enclaves
(except by comparison with poor farm counties).</span> The "rural"
counties
today with high values per head are resort counties, like Vilas and
Walworth in Wisconsin, with their prized lake frontages; or "exurban"
counties like Napa in California; or Berkshire in Massachusetts. In
California, you might think that fruitful farming counties like
Tulare have a lot more taxable real estate value per head than urban
ones. Such is a durable belief, but it is wrong. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Tulare County reports assessed values per head of $38,100.
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The whole state averages $60,000 per head. </small></li>
  <li><small>Suburban Marin County weighs in with $95,400; </small></li>
  <li><small>urban Los Angeles County has $59,000; </small></li>
  <li><small>Orange County has $74,000. </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You might also think that Tulare,
being rural, has a lot higher
fraction of land value in its mix, but again, not so. The <b>Land
Share of Real Estate Value (LSREV)</b> in Tulare County is 28%,
compared to a statewide mean of 40%, and 47% in Orange County. Grazing
and mining counties like Inyo have high values of LSREV, but
they are a small share of the farm economy. Counties with intensive
working farms, like those of the San Joaquin Valley, have low values
of LSREV.... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Cannan.html"><span

<p>Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">Comment on Parts of
    the NYS Legislative Tax Study Commission's 1985 study &#8220;Who Pays New
    York Taxes?&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    Except in the implicit recognition involved in their analysis of shifting,
      the distinction between land and improvements was opaque. This is a remarkable
      oversight, because improvements typically depreciate at the rate of 0.5
      to 1.5 percent annually; only land values appreciate.9 And in view of the
      fact that assessments in New York localities have historically been very
      infrequent, one can understand how the land values are in reality a far
      higher proportion of parcel value than assessments would suggest.10 This
      means that in a period of seven years, for example, a property parcel could
      easily increase in price by 50 percent, far more if recent real estate
      market history is to be illustrative. Moreover real estate prices varied
      greatly in their rates of change during this time span; upstate New York
      was largely stable, but downstate localities experienced huge booms and
      busts. ... </p>
  <p><br>
    Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
      sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained
      largely as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or
      two have buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to
      the rise of major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in
      land. <strong>American cities today typically record aggregate assessed
      land values &#8211; at
      least when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of
      total taxable value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.</strong>31 Skyscrapers
      reflect enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted
      because of the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market
      price from the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive
      market presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a
      penalty on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their
      maintenance. Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden
      would otherwise be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for
      their highest and best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative
      challenges of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting,
      particularly since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes,
      evaluated for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated
      with administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve
      disputes over the valuation of structures, not land values.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
    The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>
