  <p>The Self Sufficiency Standard studies, now in existence in about 30 states,

   configurations: </p>

    <li>a single adult;</li>
    <li>a single adult with an infant;</li>
    <li>a single adult
          with a preschooler

    <li>two adults with a preschooler and a schoolage child. &nbsp; 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Component
      by component, they calculate the cost of living: rented housing,
    food, childcare, transportation, health care, miscellaneous.&nbsp; To that
    they add the taxes a renter would pay on such an income and from it they
    subtract
      any tax credits for which they would be eligible. One of the observations
      one
      might make is that while the barebones budget is by no means a middle class
      lifestyle,
     taxes and housing represent a significant chunk of the costs.&nbsp; (One
     would also note that in most counties in America, the amount one needs to
     meet those
     most simply defined needs is at least 200% of  the Federal
     Poverty Line for a family of each configuration, and in places more like
     400% or more.)</p>

  <p>Worse, one's sales and income taxes are used to provide the very amenities
      that support &quot;property values&quot; which allow the landlord to charge
      his tenant so much in the first place!&nbsp; That's paying twice. Where does
      the money go?&nbsp; The rent on the land goes into the landlord's pocket
      month by month, or in a lump sum into the portfolio of the fellow who is
      retiring to Florida.&nbsp; It
      represents a windfall for him, and increases the cost of living for our young
    people.</p>
  <p>What's wrong with this picture? It works <em>wonderfully</em> for the landlord and
    the seller of land, but it certainly doesn't work at all for the tenant,
    or for our
    young
    people, or for those whose wages are insufficient to pay the costs of
    housing, which
    are largely land costs, driven up by land monopoly. (Look at California,
    post-Proposition 13.)</p>

  <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
  <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He
      needs a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this new
      building on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what he wants,
      and the real
      estate agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The man
      asks the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this land?" The agent
      says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth $50,000?" And the
      real estate agent points out that "The school is good, the roads are good,
      the police department is good, the rescue crew is good and very fast, and
      business is good here."
  </p>
  <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price. I'll
      take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the road people,
      and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And the real estate

      who owned the land before."</p>
  <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the police,
      and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you

  <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me for

  <p><strong><font size="-1">II. THE SINGLE TAX AS A FISCAL REFORM</font></strong></p>
  <p><font size="-1"><strong>1. DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAXATION</strong></font></p>
  <p>Taxes are either direct or indirect; or, as they have been aptly described, &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;crooked.&quot; Indirect
    taxes are those that may be shifted by the first payer from himself to others;
    direct taxes are those that cannot be shifted.5</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">5. &quot;Taxes are either direct or indirect. A direct tax is one which
        is demanded from the very persons who, it is intended or desired, should
        pay it. Indirect taxes are those which are demanded from one person in the
        expectation and intention that he shall indemnify himself at the expense
        of another.&quot; &#8212; John Stuart Mill's Prin. of Pol. Ec., book
        v, ch. iii, sec. I.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Direct taxes are those which are levied on the very persons who it
        is intended or desired should pay them, and which they cannot put off upon
        others by raising the prices of the taxed article.. . . Indirect taxes on
        the other hand are those which are levied on persons who expect to get back
        the amount of the tax by raising the price of the taxed article.&quot; &#8212; Laughlin's
        Elements, par. 249.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes are direct &quot;when the payment is made by the person who is intended
        to bear the sacrifice.&quot; Indirect taxes are recovered from final purchasers. &#8212; Jevons's
        Primer, sec. 96.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Indirect taxes are so called because they are not paid into the treasury
        by the person who really bears the burden. The payer adds the amount of the
        tax to the price of the commodity taxed, and thus the taxation is concealed
        under the increased price of some article of luxury or convenience.&quot; &#8212; Thompson's
        Pol. Ec., sec. 175.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The shifting of indirect taxes is accomplished by means of their tendency
    to increase the prices of commodities on which they fall. Their magnitude
    and incidence 6 are thereby disguised. It was for this reason that a great
    French economist of the last century denounced them as &quot;a scheme for
    so plucking geese as to get the most feathers with the least squawking.&quot;7</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">6. Jevons defines the incidence of a tax as &quot;the manner in which it
        falls upon different classes of the population.&quot; &#8212; Jevons's
        Primer, sec. 96.<br>
        Sometimes called &quot;repercussion,&quot; and refers &quot;to the real as
        opposed to the nominal payment of taxes.&quot; &#8212; Ely's Taxation,
        p. 64.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">7. Though his language was blunt, the sentiment does not
        essentially differ from that of &quot;statesmen&quot; of our day who
        meet all the moral and economic objections to indirect taxation with
        the one reply that
        the people
        would not consent to pay enough or the support of government if public
        revenues were collected from them directly. This means nothing but that
        the people
        are actually hoodwinked by indirect taxation into sustaining a government
        that they would not support if they knew it was maintained at their expense;
        and instead of being a reason for continuing indirect taxation, would,
        if true, be one of the strongest of reasons for abolishing it. It is
        consistent
        neither with the plainest principles of democracy nor the simplest conceptions
        of morality.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
    receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed commodities
    pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8 and partly on account
    of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9 it favors corruption in
    government by concealing from the people the fact that they contribute to
    the support of government; and it tends, by obstructing production, to crush
    legitimate industry and establish monopolies.10 The questions it raises are
    of vastly more concern than is indicated by the sum total of public expenditures.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">8. A tax upon shoes, paid in the first instance by shoe manufacturers, enters
        into manufacturers' prices, and, together with the usual rate of profit upon
        that amount of investment, is recovered from wholesalers. The tax and the
        manufacturers' profit upon it then constitute part of the wholesale price
        and are collected from retailers. The retailers in turn collect the tax with
        all intermediate profits upon it, together with their :usual rate of profit
        upon the whole, from final purchasers -- the consumers of shoes. Thus what
        appears on the surface to be a tax upon shoe manufacturers proves upon examination
        to be an indirect tax upon shoe consumers, who pay in an accumulation of
        profits upon the tax considerably more than the government receives.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The effect would be the same if a tax upon their leather output were imposed
        upon tanners. Tanners would add to the price of leather the amount of the
        tax, plus their usual rate of profit upon a like investment, and collect
        the whole, together with the cost of hides, of transportation, of tanning
        and of selling, from shoe manufacturers, who would collect with their profit
        from retailers, who would collect with their profit from shoe consumers.
        The principle applies also when taxes are levied upon the stock or the sales
        of merchants, or the money or credits of bankers; merchants add the tax with
        the usual profit to the prices of their goods, and bankers add it to their
        interest and discounts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">For example; a tax of $100,000 upon the output of manufacturers
        or importers would, at 10 per cent as the manufacturing profit, cost
        wholesalers $110,000;
        at a profit of 10 per cent to wholesalers it would cost retailers $121,000,
        and at 20 percent profit to retailers it would finally impose a tax burden
        of $145,200 &#8212; being 45 per cent more than the government would
        get. Upon most commodities the number of profits exceeds three, so that
        indirect
        taxes may frequently cost as much as 100 per cent, even when imposed
        only upon what are commercially known as finished goods; when imposed
        upon materials
        also, the cost of collection might well run far above 200 percent in
        addition to the first cost of maintaining the machinery of taxation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It must not be supposed, however, that the recovery of indirect taxes from
        the ultimate consumers of taxed goods is arbitrary. When shoe manufacturers,
        or tanners, or merchants add taxes to prices, or bankers add them to interest,
        it is not because they might do otherwise but choose to do this; it is because
        the exigencies of trade compel them. Manufacturers, merchants, and other
        tradesmen who carry on competitive businesses must on the average sell their
        goods at cost plus the ordinary rate of profit, or go out of business. It
        follows that any increase in cost of production tends to increase the price
        of products. Now, a tax upon the output of business men, which they must
        pay as a condition of doing their business, is as truly part of the cost
        of their output as is the price of the materials they buy or the wages of
        the men they hire. Therefore, such a tax upon business men tends to increase
        the price of their products. And this tendency is more or less marked as
        the tax is more or less great and competition more or less keen.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">It is true that a moderate tax upon monopolized products,
        such as trade-mark goods, proprietary medicines, patented articles and
        copyright publications
        is not necessarily shifted to consumers. The monopoly manufacturer whose
        prices are not checked by cost of production, and are therefore as a
      rule higher than competitive prices would be, may find it more profitable
      to bear
        the burden of a tax that leaves him some profit, by preserving his entire
        custom, than to drive off part of his custom by adding the tax to his
      usual prices. This is true also of a moderate import tax to the extent
      it falls
        upon goods that are more cheaply transported from the place of production
        to a foreign market where the import tax is imposed than to a home market
        where the goods would be free of such a tax &#8212; products, for instance,
        of a farm in Canada near to a New York town, but far away from any Canadian
        town. If the tax be less than the difference in the cost of transportation
        the producer will bear the burden of it; otherwise he will not. The ultimate
        effect would be a reduction in the value of the Canadian land. Examples which
        may be cited in opposition to the principle that import taxes are indirect,
        will upon examination prove to be of the character here described. Business
        cannot be carried on at a loss &#8212; not for long.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">9. &quot;To collect taxes, to prevent and punish evasions, to check and
        countercheck revenue drawn from so many distinct sources, now make up probably
        three-fourths, perhaps seven-eighths, of the business of government outside
        of the preservation of order, the maintenance of the military arm, and the
        administration of justice.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book iv,
        ch: v</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">10. For a brief and thorough exposition of indirect taxation
        read George's &quot;Protection
        or Free Trade,&quot; ch. viii, on &quot; Tariffs for Revenue.&quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Whoever calmly reflects and candidly decides upon the merits of indirect
    taxation must reject it in all its forms. But to do that is to make a great
    stride toward accepting the single tax. For the single tax is a form of direct
    taxation; it cannot be shifted.11</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">11. This is usually a stumbling block to those who, without much experience
        in economic thought, consider the single tax for the first time. As soon
        as they grasp the idea that taxes upon commodities shift to consumers they
        jump to the conclusion that similarly taxes upon land values would shift
        to the users. But this is a mistake, and the explanation is simple. Taxes
        upon what men produce make production more difficult and so tend toward scarcity
        in the supply, which stimulates prices; but taxes upon land, provided the
        taxes be levied in proportion to value, tend toward plenty in supply (meaning
        market supply of course), because they make it more difficult to hold valuable
        land idle, and so depress prices.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A tax on rent falls wholly on the landlord. There are no means by
        which he can shift the burden upon anyone else. . . A tax on rent, therefore,
        has no effect other than its obvious one. It merely takes so much from the
        landlord and transfers it to the state.&quot; &#8212; John Stuart Mill's
        Prin. of Pol. Ec., book v, ch. iii, sec. 1.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A tax laid upon rent is borne solely by the owner of land.&quot; &#8212; Bascom's
        Tr., p.159.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Taxes which are levied on land . . . really fall on the owner of the
        land.&quot; &#8212; Mrs. Fawcett's Pol. Ec. for Beginners, pp.209, 210.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land tax levied in proportion to the rent of land, and varying with
        every variation of rents, . . . will fall wholly on the landlords.&quot; &#8212; Walker's
        Pol. Ec., ed. of 1887, p. 413, quoting Ricardo.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The power of transferring a tax from the person who actually pays
        it to some other person varies with the object taxed. A tax on rents cannot
        be transferred. A tax on commodities is always transferred to the consumer.&quot; &#8212; Thorold
        Rogers's Pol. Ec., ch. xxi, 2d ed., p. 285.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Though the landlord is in all cases the real contributor, the tax
        is commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged to allow
        it in payment of the rent.&quot; &#8212; Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations,
        book v, ch. ii, part ii, art. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production
        and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes
        upon rent cannot check supply. Therefore, though a tax upon rent compels
        land-owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the use
        of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. On the
        contrary, by compelling those who hold land on speculation to sell or let
        for what they can get, a tax on land values tends to increase the competition
        between owners, and thus to reduce the price of land.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Sometimes this point is raised as a question of shifting the tax in higher
        rent to the tenant, and at others as a question of shifting it to the consumers
        of goods in higher prices. The principle is the same. Merchants cannot charge
        higher prices for goods than their competitors do, merely because they pay
        higher ground rents. A country storekeeper whose business lot is worth but
        few dollars charges as much for sugar, probably more, than a city grocer
        whose lot is worth thousands. Quality for quality and quantity for quantity,
        goods sell for about the same price everywhere. Differences in price are
        altogether in favor of places where land has a high value. This is due to
        the fact that the cost of getting goods to places of low land value, distant
        villages for example, is greater than to centers, which are places of high
        land value. Sometimes it is true that prices for some things are higher where
        land values are high. Tiffany's goods, for instance, may be more expensive
        than goods of the same quality at a store on a less expensive site. But that
        is not due to the higher land value; it is because the dealer has a reputation
        for technical knowledge and honesty (or has become a fad among rich people),
        for which his customers are willing to pay whether his store is on a high
        priced-lot or a low-priced one.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Though land value has no effect upon the price of good,
          it is easier to sell goods in some locations than in others. Therefore,
          though the price
        and the profit of each sale be the same, or even less, in good locations
        than in poorer ones, aggregate receipts and aggregate profits are much greater
        at the good location. And it is out of his aggregate, and not out of each
        profit, that rent is paid, For example: A cigar store on a thoroughfare supplies
        a certain quality of cigar for fifteen cents. On a side street the same quality
        of cigar can be bought no cheaper. Indeed, the cigars there are likely to
        be poorer, and therefore really dearer. Yet ground rent on the thoroughfare
        is very high compared with ground rent on the sidestreet. How, then, can
        the first dealer, he who pays the high ground rent, afford to sell as good
        or better cigars for fifteen cents than his competitor of the low priced
        location? Simply because he is able to make so many more sales with a given
        outlay of labor and capital in a given time that his aggregate profit is
        greater. This is due to the advantage of his location, and for that advantage
        he pays a premium in higher ground rent. But that premium is not charged
        to smokers; the competing dealer of the side street protects them. It represents
        the greater ease, the lower cost, of doing a given volume of business upon
        the site for which it is paid; add if the state should take any of it, even
        the whole of it, in taxation, the loss would be finally borne by the owner
        of the advantage which attaches to that site &#8212; by the landlord. Any
        attempt to shift it to tenant or buyer would be promptly checked by the competition
        of neighboring but cheaper land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land-tax, levied in proportion to the rent of land, and varying

        will not apply to that land which yields no rent, nor to the produce of that
        capital which is employed on the land with a view to profit merely, and which
        never pays rent; it will not in any way affect the price of raw produce,
        but will fall wholly on the landlords.&quot; &#8212; McCulloch's Ricardo

  <p><strong><font size="-1">2. THE TWO KINDS OF DIRECT TAXATION</font></strong></p>
  <p>Direct taxes fall into two general classes: (1) Taxes that are levied upon
    men in proportion to their ability to pay, and (2) taxes that are levied
    in proportion to the benefits received by the tax-payer from the public.
    Income taxes are the principal ones of the first class, though probate and
    inheritance taxes would rank high. The single tax is the only important one
    of the second class.</p>
  <p>There should be no difficulty in choosing between the two. To tax in proportion
    to ability to pay, regardless of benefits received, is in accord with no
    principle of just government; it is a device of piracy. The single tax, therefore,
    as the only important tax in proportion to benefits, is the ideal tax.</p>
  <p>But here we encounter two plausible objections. One arises from the mistaken
    but common notion that men are not taxed in proportion to benefits unless
    they pay taxes upon every kind of property they own that comes under the
    protection of government; the other is founded in the assumption that it
    is impossible to measure the value of the public benefits that each individual
    enjoys. Though the first of these objections ostensibly accepts the doctrine
    of taxation according to benefits,12 yet, as it leads to attempts at taxation
    in proportion to wealth, it, like the other, is really a plea for the piratical
    doctrine of taxation according to ability to pay. The two objections stand
    or fall together.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">12. It is often said, for instance, by its advocates, that house owners
        should in justice contribute to the support of the fire departments that
        protect them and it is even gravely argued that houses are more appropriate
        subjects of taxation than land; because they need protection, whereas land
        needs none. Read note 8.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Let it once be perceived that the value of the service which government
    renders to each individual would be justly measured by the single tax, and
    neither objection would any longer have weight. We should then no more think
    of taxing people in proportion to their wealth or ability to pay, regardless
    of the benefits they receive from government than an honest merchant would
    think of charging his customers in proportion to their wealth or ability
    to pay, regardless of the value of the goods they bought of him.&quot; 13</p>

            by the city itself, by religious societies and corporations, and by
            charitable, literary, and scientific institutions. The total amount

            good reason to believe also that lands in the city of Boston are assessed
            to quite an appreciable extent below their fair market value. As an
            indication of this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> for

  <p><strong><font size="-1">3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</font></strong><br />
    <br />
To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and now,
in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service in proportion
to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a government must use
land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from where government is poor
to where it is good; neither can he carry it from where the benefits of good
government are few or enjoyed with difficulty to where they are many and fully
enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where the benefits of government are available,
or forego them. And unless he buys or rents where they are greatest and most
available he must forego them in degree. Consequently, if he would work or live
where the benefits of government are available, and does not already own land
there, he will be compelled to rent or buy at a valuation which, other things
being equal, will depend upon the value of the government service that the site
he selects enables him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service of government
in proportion to its value to him. But he does not pay the public which provides
the service; he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">14. Land values are lower in all countries of poor government
        than in any country of better government, other things being equal. They
        are lower in cities of poor government, other things being equal, than
        in cities of better government. Land values are lower, for example, in
        Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, where government is bad,
        than in El Paso, the neighboring city on the American side, where government
        is better. They are lower in the same city under bad government than
        under improved government. When Seth Low, after a reform campaign, was
        elected mayor of Brooklyn, N.Y., rents advanced before he took the oath
        of office, upon the bare expectation that he would eradicate municipal
        abuses. Let the city authorities anywhere pave a street, put water through
        it and sewer it, or do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood
        rise in value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation of
        wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent land
        has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public improvements
        might be collected in abundance. Every man must be able to recall some
        within his own experience.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should be so.
        Land and not other property must rise in value with desired improvements
        in government, because, while any tendency on the part of other kinds
        of property to rise in value is checked by greater production, land can
        not be reproduced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and property
        are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be either a very bold
        man or a very avaricious one who will build a store in such a community
        and stock it with goods; but suppose such a man should appear. His store
        costs him more than the same building would cost in a civilized community;
        mechanics are not plentiful in such a place, and materials are hard to
        get. The building is finally erected, however, and stocked. And now what
        about this merchant's prices for goods? Competition is weak, because
        there are few men who will take the chances he has taken, and he charges
        all that his customers will pay. A hundred per cent, five hundred per
        cent, perhaps one or two thousand per cent profit rewards him for his
        pains and risk. His goods are dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough
        to satisfy the most contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should
        wish to buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
        the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This is the
        type of community in which may be found that land, so often mentioned
        and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually can't give away,
        you know!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient administration
        of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and life and property are safe.
        What about prices then? It would no longer require a bold or desperately
        avaricious man to engage in selling goods in that community, and competition
        would set in. High profits would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as
        cheap as anywhere in the world, the cost of transportation considered.
        Builders and building materials could be had without difficulty, and
        stores would be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement
        in government increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus able
    to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their common government
    points to the true method of taxation. With the exception of such other monopoly
    property as is analogous to land titles, and which in the purview of the
    single tax is included with land for purposes of taxation, 15 land is the
    only kind of property that is increased in value by government; and the increase
    of value is in proportion, other influences aside, to the public service
    which its possession secures to the occupant. Therefore, by taxing land in
    proportion to its value, and exempting all other property, kindred monopolies
    excepted &#8212; that is to say, by adopting the single tax &#8212; we should
    be levying taxes according to benefits.16</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not usually
        thought of as land titles, but that is what they are. By an act of sovereign
        authority they confer rights of control for transportation purposes over
        narrow strips of land between terminals and along trading points. The
        value of this right of way is a land value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the value
        of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools, courts, police
        and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled him to enjoy. The landlord
        would pay a tax proportioned to the pecuniary benefits conferred upon
        him by the public in raising and maintaining the value of his holding.
        And if occupant and owner were the same, he would pay directly according
        to the value of his land for all the public benefits he enjoyed, both
        intangible and pecuniary.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of class
    taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land to raise against
    the single tax, when it is considered that under existing systems of taxation
    they are exempt. 17 Even the poorest and the most degraded classes in the
    community, besides paying land-owners for such public benefits as come their
    way, are compelled by indirect taxation to contribute to the support of government.
    But landowners as a class go free. They enjoy the protection of the courts,
    and of police and fire departments, and they have the use of schools and
    the benefit of highways and other public improvements, all in common with
    the most favored, and upon the same specific terms; yet, though they go through
    the form of paying taxes, and if their holdings are of considerable value
    pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on all important occasions, they,
    in effect and considered as a class, pay no taxes, because government, by
    increasing the value of their land, enables them to recover back in higher
    rents and higher prices more than their taxes amount to. Enjoying the same
    tangible benefits of government that others do, many of them as individuals
    and all of them as a class receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit
    which government confers upon no other property-owners. The value of their
    property is enhanced in proportion to the benefits of government which its
    occupants enjoy. To tax them alone, therefore, is not to discriminate against
    them; it is to charge them for what they get.18</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington were
        paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes, a Congressional
        Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee to Investigate Tax Assessments
        in the District of Columbia, composed of Messrs. Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman,
        Wadsworth, of New York, and Washington, of Tennessee. Made to the House
        of Representatives, May 24, 1892. Report No. 1469</em>), brought out
        the fact that the value of their land had been increasing at a minimum
        rate of ten per cent per annum. The Washington land-owners as a class
        thus appear to have received back in higher land values, actually and
        potentially, about ten dollars for every two dollars that as land-owners
        they paid in taxes. If any one supposes that this condition is peculiar
        to Washington let him make similar estimates for any progressive locality,
        and see if the land-owners there are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase in the capitalized
        value of land. If the land yields or will yield to its owner an income
        in the nature of actual or potential ground rent, then to the extent
        that this actual or possible income is dependent upon government the
        landlord is in effect exempt from taxation. No matter what tax he pays
        on account of his ownership of land, the public gives it back to him
        to that extent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
        government and the other of inefficient government, but in all other
        respects alike. Suppose you are hunting for a place of residence and
        find a suitable site in the town of good government. For simplicity of
        illustration let us suppose that the land there is not sold outright
        but is let upon ground rent. You meet the owner of the lot you have selected
        and ask him his terms. He replies:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year!&quot; you

    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But
        if you build a house there and it catches fire it will burn down; they

        and robbed; they have no police force. If you ride out in the spring,
        your carriage will stick in the mud up to the hubs, and if you walk you
        may break your legs and will be lucky if you don t break your neck; they
        have no street pavements and their sidewalks are dangerously out of repair.
        When the moon doesn't shine the streets are in darkness, for they have
        no street lights. The water you need for your house you must get from
        a well; there is no water supply there. Now in our town it is different.
        We have a splendid fire department, and the best police force in the
        world. Our streets are macadamized, and lighted with electricity; our
        sidewalks are always in first class repair; we have a water system that
        equals that of New York; and in every way the public benefits in this
        town are unsurpassed. It is the best governed town in all this region.

        Are not you protected from robbery by the best police force in the world?
        Do not you have the use of macadamized pavements, and good sidewalks,

  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>

    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an

  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two
        blades of grass to grow where but one grew before, must not be surprised
        when ordered to 'keep off the grass.' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.</p>
  <p><em>Q22. What difference would it make to tenants whether they paid land rent

    A. When they pay it to the community they are paying it in part to themselves,
    and what others pay they share in; for they are part of the community. They
    are also exempt from taxes. And since there would be no inducement to speculate
    in land if rent went to the community, land would be more plentiful and rents
    would consequently be lower. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>      Every community, whatever its political name and extent -- village, city, state
        or province or nation -- has its own normal, unfailing income, growing with
        the growth of the community and always adequate to meet necessary governmental
        expenditure.</p>
  <p>To explain: Every community has an indefeasible original right to the land
      on which it exists, and to all the natural, unmodified properties and advantages
      of that particular area of the earth's surface. To this land in its natural
      state, undrained, unfenced, unfertilized, unplanted and unoccupied, including
      its waters, its contents and its location, every individual in the community
      (which may consist of any political unit selected) has an equal right, while
      all the individuals together have a joint right to the value for use which
      society has conferred upon these natural advantages.</p>
  <p>This value for use is known as &quot;Land Value,&quot; or by the not particularly
      descriptive but generally adopted name of &quot;Economic Rent.&quot;</p>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. <strong>Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. </strong>The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied
      by any political unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually
      more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.<font size="+1"><strong>  ... </strong></font></p>
  <p>Let us roughly restate the proposition: All members of the community having
      a joint right to the income which the social advantages of the land will command,
      they are all partners in this income.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when one of their number wishes to take for his private use a parcel
      of this land, he should buy out his partners, i.e., the rest of the community,
      by paying regularly into the common treasury the economic rent of that parcel,
      instead of paying, as at present, the purchase price, i.e., the right to collect
      the economic rent, in a lump, to some other individual who has no more original
      right to it than himself. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>
