<p>Rev. A. C. Auchmuty: <a href="../HG/Gems_from_HG.html">Gems from George, a
    themed collection of excerpts from the writings of Henry George</a> (with
    links to sources)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>MENTAL power is the motor of progress, and men tend to advance in proportion
    to the mental power expended in progression &#8212; the mental power which
    is devoted to the extension of knowledge, the improvement of methods, and
    the betterment of social conditions. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book
    X, Chapter 3, The Law of Human Progress</a><br>
            <br>
To compare society to a boat.&nbsp; Her progress through the water will not depend
upon the exertion of her crew, but upon the exertion devoted to propelling her.
This will be lessened by any expenditure of force required for baling, or any
expenditure of force in fighting among themselves or in pulling in different
directions. <br>
            <br>
Now, as in a separated state the whole powers of man are required to maintain
existence, and mental power is only set free for higher uses by the association
of men in communities, which permits the division of labor and all the economies
which come with the co-operation of increased numbers, association is the first
essential of progress. Improvement becomes possible as men come together in peaceful
association, and the wider and closer the association, the greater the possibilities
of improvement. And as the wasteful expenditure of mental power in conflict becomes
greater or less as the moral law which accords to each an equality of rights
is ignored or is recognized, equality (or justice) is the second essential of
progress. <br>
            <br>
Thus association in equality is the law of progress. Association frees mental
power for expenditure in improvement, and equality (or justice, or freedom &#8212; for
the terms here signify the same thing, the recognition of the moral law) prevents
the dissipation of this power in fruitless struggles. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp103.html"> &#8212; Book

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace, Justice
and Economic Reform</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a bumper sticker that
says, "If you want peace, then work
for justice." At a superficial level, this simple slogan contains an
important half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound
half-truth. To understand these half-truths and why they are only
half true, we need to know what peace is, what justice is, and we
need to understand the relationship between the two. So in this talk
I want to explore the meanings of peace and justice, their
relationship, and the role of economic reform in attaining both.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>"If you want peace, then work for
justice." The more obvious and
superficial meaning of this slogan is that people who are treated
unjustly will prevent the attainment of peace until the wrongs to
which they are subject are righted. Demonstrators shout: "No justice.
No peace." The apparent meaning of peace in this case is tranquility,
the absence of strife. And if this meaning of peace is accepted, the
slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as long as people
have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only half
true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really
is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is more than armistice, more
than the cessation of violence.
Peace is unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all
pleased to cooperate with one another. When we have attained true
peace, there will be no person who has any purpose that any other
person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world, everyone will feel the
truth of John Donne's meditation,</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>No man is an Island
entire of itself; every man is a
piece of the Continent; a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by
the sea, Europe is the less, and well as if a promontory were, as well
as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man's death
diminishes me because I am involved in Mankind; therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee</i>.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[1]</span></small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it imaginable that we might
ever attain a world where everyone
felt so? And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that
world? What is justice? 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are so many conflicting,
strident claims for different
conceptions of justice that a person might reasonably despair of ever
finding a meaning of justice that people would agree upon. Any
conception of justice may seem to be no more than one person's
opinion. And yet there are things that we all know about justice. If
I tell you that I stand before you as justice, you know that across
my face you will find -- a blindfold. In my left hand I hold aloft -- a
pair of scales. You know that in my right hand I have -- a sword that I
will use if necessary. And my gender is female.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The blindfold, the scales, the
sword, and the feminine gender.
These features of the traditional symbol tell us much about justice.
The blindfold might seem out of place, since it prevents justice from
either seeing what the scales say or wielding the sword effectively.
But we know that the blindfold has a distinct and essential meaning.
The blindfold ensures that justice will not be swayed by any visible
characteristics of those who plead before her. Justice is not
concerned with whether you are black or white, short or tall,
beautiful or ugly. Every person receives the same treatment from
justice. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The scales have at least two
possible interpretations. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And then the sword. The sword
represents the fact that justice is
prepared to use the threat of force, and force itself, to see that
her decrees are carried out.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus if we know that justice is
the blindfolded woman with the
scales and the sword, then we know that justice is the principles of
equality and evenhandedness that command and prohibit the use of
force in resolving conflicts.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider what this tells us. It
tells us first that if we wish to
claim that justice authorizes the force we wish to use, or that
justice forbids the force that others wish to use against us, then we
must be able to show that our claim is consistent with equality and
evenhandedness. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Second, the blindfold tells us
that we are not in the realm of
justice if the principles we offer to explain why our use of force is
justified are of the form, "Because I am better than you," or
Hitler's, "Because Aryans are better than Jews." Justice compels us
to acknowledge the equality of all persons. Claims of individual or
group supremacy cannot be accepted by justice.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Third, not only are all persons
equal in the blindfolded eyes of
justice, but their different goals in life all deserve equal respect.
    <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Even the utilitarian proposal that conflicting claims should be
settled in the way that yields the greatest possible utility must be
rejected as an elitist imposition of a particular goal on people who
may have other plans. If I choose to pursue a life that can be
guaranteed to lead to depression and despair, I have as much claim to
the protection of justice in that pursuit as if I choose the path
that leads to bliss. Justice must be neutral in its evaluation of
people and their goals. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we commit ourselves to
neutrality, does that provide a unique
definition of justice? No, it doesn't. There are a number of
definitions of justice that might claim to satisfy neutrality,
although the claims of some definitions are dubious, and other
definitions can be rejected on other grounds.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider first the conservative
claim that justice is defined by
traditional rules.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Next, consider the claim that justice is defined by what the
majority wants. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarian </span>says,
"If you want to know who
should prevail in a conflict, take a vote." As appealing as
majoritarianism may be on the surface, it cannot provide a coherent
theory of justice. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>If voting cannot be used to define justice, one might entertain
the possibility of using a contractarian formulation: What is just is
the rules to which people would have agreed if they did not know
their personal circumstances.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a reasonable recipe for
implementing the Golden Rule and a
fine idea for seeking agreement about the principles by which
complaints shall be judged. If people were to follow this suggestion
and achieve the agreement that is described, they would achieve
fairness.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However, this does not make
Rawls's suggestion a good way to
identify justice.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, consider <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>. The egalitarian says
that justice
is equality. There is a conceptual difficulty in specifying how
beings as different from each other as humans are could ever be
equal, unless we create a society where all humans are female clones
of one another. (This should be technologically feasible within a few
decades, if it is not already.) But I do not think that egalitarians
want a society of clones.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>John Rawls has proposed
that the talents that individuals possess
be regarded as a common pool, so that anyone who has more than his
share has an obligation to compensate those who have less then their
shares.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></small></small><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All of these suggestions should be
rejected. Talents are not a
common pool from which some persons have taken more then their
shares. If we are all fishing in the same pond, the quantity of fish
that you take will diminish the quantity that is available to me. But
the quantity of talent that you have in no way diminishes the
quantity that is available to me. Your talent is not acquired at my
expense.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the perspective of peace, no
man is an island; each of us is
a part of mankind. And any of us who has been graced with an extra
measure of talent should recognize that, often, the best use of our
talent is to provide for others. Nevertheless, from the perspective
of justice, each of us must be allowed to act like an island if he
wishes.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose that a bone-marrow
transplant from me would save your
life--or at least prolong it. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>If you do not mind requiring a bone-marrow transplant of me,
then
what about a kidney? <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small>If you do not mind requiring me to donate a kidney, then what
about my heart?&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>A good egalitarian should require me to part with the one
available
heart after I have had my share of years.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I don't think you would. I
don't think anyone would. We are
not egalitarians. We recognize the sanctity of the boundaries of the
human body. In a peaceful world I will gladly give a spare kidney to
anyone who needs it. But in a just world, no one will forcefully
extract a kidney from me, even to save someone else's life. Justice
is not egalitarianism.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just as I own my kidneys, so do
I own my talents. In a peaceful
world I will use them for the benefit of all mankind. But the sword
of justice should not be used to force me to compensate those with
less talent. Nor should it be used to force me to abide by the
insurance contract that you believe I would have signed, if I had had
the chance, before I knew what talents I would have.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A proper definition of justice
begins with the principles of
classical liberalism. In a just world each person is permitted to
determine the purposes to which his or her body is put--the hands and
the brain no less than the kidneys. We each have rights of
self-determination. This includes the right of ownership of what we
produce, at least, as John Locke said, when we leave as much in
natural opportunities for others as we appropriate for our own
productive activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have the right to co-operate
with whom we choose for whatever
mutually agreed purposes we choose. Thus we have the right to trade
with others, without any artificial hindrances, and we have the right
to keep any wages or interest that we receive from such trading.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the classical
liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">how
are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>John Locke qualified his
statement that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.
One tradition in classical liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>"&nbsp;
...</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>," as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any excess
in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are two fundamental
problems with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Justice -- the balancing of the
scales -- is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position,
"I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you."&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Justice is thus a regime in which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform--the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities. <strong>...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Getting back to where we started,
is it true that, "If you want
peace-- real peace--you should work for justice?" and if so why?
Well, it's half true. To see why, consider what peace is, and how one
might create it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is unity and harmony. Peace
is people recognizing that we
are all parts of one another, that it is always for ourselves that
the bell tolls.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What keeps us from attaining
peace? One of the greatest hindrances
to the attainment of peace -- real peace -- is that resistance that so
many of us feel to tolerating oppression and injustice. When we know
that we, or others we care for, have been treated unjustly, it is
ever so difficult to attain a state of unity and harmony with others.
The leap to peace is so much easier from a position of justice. So,
even though peace and justice are very disparate things, and peace is
much the more attractive one, still it make sense, if you want to
help people reach peace, to work for justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the reason that this is only
half true is that, in fact,
justice is not actually necessary to your attainment of peace. If you
want peace for yourself, you can have it, at any time, in any
circumstances in which you find yourself. Whether you are treated
justly or not, you are a part of the being that is all humanity. Each
person's joy is your joy. Each person's grief is your grief. You
don't have to wait until you are treated justly to see this.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So if you want a peace for others,
then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But if you want peace for
yourself, simply have it.&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<small>VIII. Conclusion</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Humanity is emerging from eons of
development during which
survival has been promoted both by the ability to grab resources from
others and by the ability of groups to cooperate and share natural
resources within communities that occupied territorial homelands. In
recent centuries we have been developing a consensus that taking from
the weak is wrong, and that we ought to have a social order that
prevents all such behavior. But we have not yet worked out how to do
it.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some people
think of preventing grabbing in terms of preserving
the status quo. There are two difficulties with this.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, the status quo incorporates extensive holdings that
were acquired by indefensible means. A decision to preserve the status
quo commits us to defending the indefensible.</small></li>
  <li><small>Second, there is no magic to any particular date, before
which unjust appropriations are incorporated into the status quo and
after which they are reversed.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A practice of allowing an
appropriation to be treated as just if
it has survived long enough gives aggressors an incentive to see if
they can grab and hold on long enough. The result is actions like
Indonesia's seizure of East Timor and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Only
if we have a standard of justice that is independent of history can
we expect to end such actions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George's theory of economic
justice--that every person has a
right to his or her productive powers, and that all persons have
equal rights to all natural opportunities--provides <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">a simple formula
around which opinion about the shape of a peaceful world can
coalesce.</span></small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>This may seem
hopelessly optimistic. But no other theory that I
have seen has anything like the clarity, coherence and power of this
theory.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_GEJaCGEJ.html"><span

  <small><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></small><br
 style="font-weight: normal;">
  <small><span style="font-weight: normal;">The ethical case for taxing
  land ends with a discussion of the reasons
  why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
  world peace. <strong>... </strong></span></small>  <small><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></small></p>
  <p><small><span
 style="font-weight: normal;">An additional ethical reason for
    recognizing equal rights to natural
    opportunities is that it may be necessary to secure world peace.&nbsp;
    Nations have arisen through violence.&nbsp; While the world condemns
    violence among nations, it has persistently acquiesced to regimes
    established by violence.&nbsp; The greater the natural resources of a
    nation, the greater is the attraction to potential tyrants of the
    possibility of taking over the nation.&nbsp; If the world is able to
    establish an understanding, backed up by the threat of economic
    boycotts, that nations have an obligation to share the value of natural
    opportunities in proportion to population, and that people are free to
    leave nations that they find unacceptable, then the return to violent
    appropriation of power will be removed.&nbsp; As long as we accept the
    continued exercise of disproportionate power over natural opportunities
    by those who acquired that power through violence, we will have
    difficulty persuading potential usurpers of power that we will not
    accept their conquests.&nbsp; </span><a style="font-weight: bold;"

embodied in the ethical principles) and community (or peace or
harmony)?</big></big><br>
<big><big>

<big><big>
C. How should natural opportunities be shared?</big></big><br>
<big><big>
D. Who should be included in the group among whom rent should be
shared equally?</big></big><br>
<big><big>
E. Is there an obligation to compensate those whose presently
recognized titles to land and other exclusive natural opportunities
will lose value when rent is shared equally?</big></big><br>
<big><big>
F. Can a person who is occupying a per capita share of land
reasonably ask to be left undisturbed indefinitely on that land?</big></big><br>
<big><big> G. What is the moral status of "intellectual property?"</big></big><br>
<big><big>
H. What standards of environmental respect can people reasonably
require of others?</big></big><br>

<big>
B. How much revenue could public collection of rent raise?</big><br>

<big>
D. How much growth can a community expect if it shifts taxes from
improvements to land?</big><br>
<big>
E. To what extent does the benefit that one community receives from
shifting taxes from buildings to land come at the expense of other
communities?</big><br>
<big>
F. What is the impact of land taxes on land speculation?</big><br>
<big>
G. How, if at all, does the impact of shifting the source of public
revenue to land change if it is a whole nation rather than just a
community that makes the shift?</big><br>

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SEP.html"><small><small>How Sharing Earth Brought Peace</small></small></a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since forever, humans have
claimed and counter-claimed every
square inch of this planet. Occasionally, these disputes have ended
peacefully. What has worked in other times and places might work
again in the Mideast. Delivering a double dividend, what settled land
disputes also developed moribund economies and revived developed
ones. Among others, New York, now aiming to rebuild, has used this
policy before. Because it's growing popular among environmentalists,
greens could lead the US to geonomics.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...&nbsp; </span>These cases
involved different classes, not different cultures.
Yet with a new twist the rent rebate that worked within society may
work between societies. The Koran urges landlords to not gouge
tenants but to consider land a trust. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">In Israel, admonished to not
own land forever, since the land is Mine (Leviticus), the National
Trust leases all the land to the occupants. These strictures could
lead to geonomics.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Israel
and Palestine would establish a steward to collect land
dues and disburse rent dividends a la Alaska's oil dividend. </span>Since
land is more valuable in Israel than in Palestine, Jews would pay in
more than Arabs, yet everyone would get back the same. And since
Israelis prosper, they drive up land values; having Jews as co-owners
developing land, raising its value, fattening everyone's Citizens
Dividend Arabs might accept that. Profit does make for strange
bedfellows. Two archrivals, China and Taiwan, recently agreed to
explore for oil together. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">While sharing rent may soothe hurt
feelings, collecting it
stimulates development.</span>&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Using geonomics,
people have turned some of the poorest lands into
the richest economies. Hong Kong is a barren rock owned by the
public. The city collects enough site-rent to keep taxes on effort
way down.</span> <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Where to draw a line in the sand
becomes a lot less contentious
when land and oil are no longer spoils of war and when neighbors do
not endure drastically different standards of living. Growing up, we
learn to not fight over toys but to take turns. Societies need to
learn this, too. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Early last century, Gifford
Pinchot, first head of the US Forest
Service, said: "The earth belongs of right to all its people and not
to a minority, insignificant in numbers but tremendous in wealth and
power. The people shall get their fair share of the benefit which
comes from the development of the country which belongs to us all
with equal opportunity for all and special privileges for none." A
man in a Republican administration could say that then. We need to
hear it again now. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a
