<blockquote>
  <p>"Make no small plans: they have no magic to stir men's blood," quoth Daniel
    Burnham. As a successful architect and planner, he knew how to stir his clients'
    blood. However, his ringing phrase is negative and preemptive, hence overstated.
    Leo Tolstoy noted in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">War
  and Peace</span> that wars are won and lost by the sum of individual confrontations
  on chaotic battlefields, where generals lose control.
  Folk wisdom says "The Devil is in the details." We do need small plans, lots
  of them, to implement big visions. My hat is off to the trench warriors who
  are advancing the two-rate property tax reform plans in Pennsylvania and New
  York,
  one small city at a time.</p>
  <p>Let's rephrase Burnham in the affirmative: "<b><i>Make big plans: they have
          magic to stir people's blood</i></b>." Big Plans imply Grand Visions.
          Henry George had few peers at stirring his hearers' blood, and agreed.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"If you would move men, to what shall you appeal? Not their pockets,
        but their patriotism; not selfishness, but sympathy. Self-interest is
      a mechanical force, but in loyalty to higher impulses men will give even
      life."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Big Plans and Grand Visions inspire small ones. They also help orient and
    coordinate them. They help us divide the major from the minor, to direct our
    work most efficiently. This is what I will attempt here.</p>
  <p>Big Plans can also scare people, it is true. We see this right now when drastic
    changes and new philosophies are moving in Congress. That does not mean they
    won't prevail, however. They scare some because they move many others. Abstract
    philosophies, living only in intellectual undergrounds, build up slowly until
    suddenly they take command. <b><i>This is how change occurs</i></b>.</p>
  <p>Superficially it seems "sudden," but intellectually the way has been paved
    by years of Grand Visions and Big Plans.</p>
  <p>The upshot is, we need Big Plans with Details Ready. I speak here of Big
    Plans with magic to stir the blood of those who<b><i> see the benefits of
    supporting government from land and resource rents.</i></b> I'll sketch the
    big picture, where details fit in, and how they all fit together. ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTBaR.html">read

  Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a
 href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving Life to the
  Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a> </p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any one thing
    and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on the property
    tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss, political favoritism,
    and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood tenure. Echoing Thoreau,
    the more familiar reforms have failed to address this many-headed hydra at
    its root. To think that the root could be chopped by a mere shift in the
    property tax base -- from buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome
    of unfounded faith. Yet the evidence shows that state and local tax activists
    do have a powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
    efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the site's
    full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land is a lower
    or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
  <br>
  <font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn needs
  a matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that we
  share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax earnings --
  does just that. </small></font><a

<p>Martin Luther King, Jr: <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">Where
Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
    do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
    must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
    society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask
    the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
    when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the
    economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that
    question,
    you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that
    more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society.
    We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's market place.
    But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs
    restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my friends,
  when you deal with this,</p>
  <ul>
    <li> you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot;</li>
    <li> You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot;</li>
    <li> You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay
        water bills in a world that is two thirds water?&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are questions that must be asked. </p>
  <p>Now, don't think that you have me in a &quot;bind&quot; today. I'm not talking
    about Communism.</p>
  <p>What I'm saying to you this morning is that Communism forgets that life is
    individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood
    is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of capitalism
    but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines
    the truths of both. Now, when I say question the whole society, it means ultimately
    coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation,
    and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that
    are interrelated.</p>
  <p>If you will let me be a preacher just a little bit - One night, a juror came
    to Jesus and he wanted to know what he could do to be saved. Jesus didn't get
    bogged down in the kind of isolated approach of what he shouldn't do.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Jesus didn't say, &quot;Now Nicodemus, you must stop lying.&quot;</li>
    <li> He didn't say, &quot;Nicodemus, you must stop cheating if you are doing
        that.&quot;</li>
    <li> He didn't say, &quot;Nicodemus, you must not commit adultery.&quot;</li>
    <li> He didn't say, &quot;Nicodemus, now you must stop drinking liquor if
        you are doing that excessively.&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>He said something altogether different, because Jesus realized something
    basic - that if a man will lie, he will steal. And if a man will steal, he
    will kill.
    So instead of just getting bogged down in one thing, Jesus looked at him
    and said, &quot;Nicodemus, you must be born again.&quot;</p>
  <p>He said, in other words, &quot;Your whole structure must be changed.&quot; A
    nation that will keep people in slavery for 244 years will &quot;thingify&quot; them
    - make them things. Therefore they will exploit them, and poor people generally,
    economically. And a nation that will exploit economically will have to have
    foreign investments and everything else, and will have to use its military
    might to protect them. All of these problems are tied together. What I am saying
    today is that we must go from this convention and say, &quot;America, you must
    be born again!&quot; ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">read the book excerpt
