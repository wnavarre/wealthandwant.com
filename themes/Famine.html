<blockquote>
  <p><b>Distress and Famine</b></p>
  <p>BUT it will be asked: If the land system which prevails in Ireland
    is essentially the same as that which prevails elsewhere, how is it
    that it does not produce the same results elsewhere?</p>
  <p>I answer that it does everywhere produce the same kind of results.
    As there is nothing essentially peculiar in the Irish land system, so
    is there nothing essentially peculiar in Irish distress. Between the
    distress in Ireland and the distress in other countries there may be
    differences in degree and differences in manifestation; but that is
    all.</p>
  <p>The truth is, that as there is nothing peculiar in the Irish land
    system, so is there nothing peculiar in the distress which that land
    system causes. We hear a great deal of Irish emigration, of the
    millions of sons and daughters of Erin who have been compelled to
    leave their native soil. But have not the Scottish Highlands been all
    but depopulated? Do not the English emigrate in the same way, and for
    the same reasons? Do not the Germans and Italians and Scandinavians
    also emigrate? Is there not a constant emigration from the Eastern
    States of the Union to the Western&#8211;an emigration impelled by the
    same motives as that which sets across the Atlantic? Nor am I sure
    that this is not in some respects a more demoralizing emigration than
    the Irish, for I do not think there is any such monstrous
    disproportion of the sexes in Ireland as in Massachusetts. If French
    and Belgian peasants do not emigrate as do the Irish, is it not
    simply because they do not have such "long families"?</p>
  <p>There has recently been deep and wide-spread distress in Ireland,
    and but for the contributions of charity many would have perished for
    want of food. But, to say nothing of such countries as India, China,
    Persia, and Syria, is it not true that within the last few years
    there have been similar spasms of distress in the most highly
    civilized countries &#8211; not merely in Russia and in Poland, but in
    Germany and England? Yes, even in the United States.</p>
  <p>Have there not been, are there not constantly occurring, in all
    these countries, times when the poorest classes are reduced to the
    direct straits, and large numbers are saved from starvation only by
    charity?</p>
  <p>When there is famine among savages it is because food enough is
    not to be had. But this was not the case in Ireland. In any part of
    Ireland, during the height of what was called the famine, there was
    food enough for whoever had means to pay for it. The trouble was not
    in the scarcity of food. There was, as a matter of fact, no real
    scarcity of food, and the proof of it is that food did not command
    scarcity prices. During all the so-called famine, food was constantly
    exported from Ireland to England, which would not have been the case
    had there been true famine in one country any more than in the other.
    During all the so-called famine a practically unlimited supply of
    American meat and grain could have been poured into Ireland, through
    the existing mechanism of exchange, so quickly that the relief would
    have been felt instantaneously. Our sending of supplies in a national
    war-ship was a piece of vulgar ostentation, fitly paralleled by their
    ostentatious distribution in British gunboats under the nominal
    superintendence of a royal prince. Had we been bent on relief, not
    display, we might have saved our government the expense of fitting up
    its antiquated warship, the British gunboats their coal, the Lord
    Mayor his dinner, and the Royal Prince his valuable time. A cable
    draft, turned in Dublin into postal orders, would have afforded the
    relief, not merely much more easily and cheaply, but in less time
    than it took our war-ship to get ready to receive her cargo; for the
    reason that so many of the Irish people were starving was, not that
    the food was not to be had, but that they had not the means to buy
    it. Had the Irish people had money or its equivalent, the bad seasons
    might have come and gone without stinting any one of a full meal.
    Their effect would merely have been to determine toward Ireland the
    flow of more abundant harvests.</p>
  <p>I wish clearly to bring to view this point. The Irish famine was
    not a true famine arising from scarcity of food. It was what an
    English writer styled the Indian famine&#8211;a "financial famine," arising
    not from scarcity of food but from the poverty of the people. The effect
    of the short crops in producing distress was not so much
    in raising the price of food as in cutting off the accustomed incomes
    of the people. The masses of the Irish people get so little in
    ordinary times that they are barely able to live, and when anything
    occurs to interrupt their accustomed incomes they have nothing to
    fall back on.</p>
  <p>Yet is this not true of large classes in all countries? And are
    not all countries subject to just such famines as this Irish famine?
    Good seasons and bad seasons are in the order of nature, just as the
    day of sunshine and the day of rain, the summer's warmth and the
    winter's snow. But agriculture is, on the whole, as certain as any
    other pursuit, for even those industries which may be carried en
    regardless of weather are subject to alternations as marked as those
    to which agriculture is liable. There are good seasons and bad
    seasons even in fishing and hunting, while the alternations are very
    marked in mining and in manufacturing. In fact, the more highly
    differentiated branches of industry which advancing civilization
    tends to develop, though less directly dependent upon rain and
    sunshine, heat and cold, seem increasingly subject to alternations
    more frequent and intense. Though in a country of more diversified
    industry the failure of a crop or two could not have such wide-spread
    effects as in Ireland, yet the countries of more complex industries
    are liable to a greater variety of disasters. A war on another
    continent produces famine in Lancashire; Parisian milliners decree a
    change of fashion, and Coventry operatives are saved from starvation
    only by public alms; a railroad combination decides to raise the
    price of coal, and Pennsylvania miners find their earnings diminished
    by half or totally cut off; a bank breaks in New York, and in all the
    large American cities soup-houses must be opened!</p>
  <p>In this Irish famine which provoked the land agitation, there is
    nothing that is peculiar. Such famines on a smaller or a larger scale
    are constantly occurring. Nay, more! the fact is, that famine, just
    such famine as this Irish famine, constantly exists in the richest
    and most highly civilized lands. It persists even in "good times"
    'when trade is "booming;" it spreads and rages whenever from any
    cause industrial depression comes. It is kept under, or at least kept
    from showing its worst phases, by poor-rates and almshouses, by
    private benevolence and by vast organized charities, but it still
    exists, gnawing in secret when it does not openly rage. In the very
    centers of civilization, where the machinery of production and
    exchange is at the highest point of efficiency, where bankvaults hold
    millions, and show-windows flash with more than a prince's ransom,
    where elevators and warehouses are gorged with grain, and markets are
    piled with all things succulent and toothsome, where the dinners of
    Lucullus are eaten every day, and, if it be but cool, the very
    greyhounds wear dainty blankets&#8211;in these centers in wealth and
    power and refinement, there are always hungry men and women and
    little children. Never the sun goes down but on human beings prowling
    like wolves far food, or huddling together like vermin for shelter
    and warmth. "Always with You" is the significant heading under which
    a New York paper, in these most prosperous times, publishes daily the
    tales of chronic famine; and in the greatest and richest city in the
    world&#8211;in that very London where the plenty of meat in the
    butchers' shops seemed to some savages the most wondrous of all its
    wonderful sights&#8211;in that very London, the mortuary reports have
    a standing column for deaths by starvation.</p>
  <p>But no more in its chronic than in its spasmodic forms is famine
    to be measured by the deaths from starvation. Perfect, indeed, in all
    its parts must be the human machine if it can run till the last bit
    of available tissue be drawn to feed its fires. It is under the guise
    of disease to which physicians can give less shocking names, that
    famine&#8211;especially the chronic famine of civilization&#8211;kills.
    And the statistics of mortality, especially of infant mortality, show
    that in the richest communities famine is constantly at its work.
    Insufficient nourishment, inadequate warmth and clothing, and
    unwholesome surroundings, constantly, in the very centers of plenty,
    swell the death-rates. What is this but famine &#8211; just such famine
    as the Irish famine? It is not that the needed things are really
    scarce; but that those whose need is direst have not the means to get
    them, and, when not relieved by charity, want kills them in its
    various ways. When, in the hot midsummer, little children die like
    flies in the New York tenement wards, what is that but famine? And
    those barges crowded with such children that a noble and tender
    charity sends down New York Harbor to catch the fresh salt breath of
    the Antlantic &#8211; are they not fighting famine as truly as were our
    food-laden war-ship and the Royal Prince's gunboats? Alas! to find
    famine one has not to cross the sea.</p>
  <p>There was bitter satire in the cartoon that one of our illustrated
    papers published when subscriptions to the Irish famine fund were
    being made &#8211; a cartoon that represented James Gordon Bennett
    sailing away for Ireland in a boat loaded down with provisions, while
    a sad-eyed, hungry-looking, tattered group gazed wistfully on them
    from the pier. The bite and the bitterness of it, the humiliating
    sting and satire of it, were in its truth.</p>
  <p>This is "the home of freedom," and "the asylum of the oppressed;"
    our population is yet sparse, our public domain yet wide; we are the
    greatest of food producers, yet even here there are beggars, tramps,
    paupers, men torn by anxiety for the support of their families, women
    who know not which way to turn, little children growing up in such
    poverty and squalor that only a miracle can keep them pure. "Always
    with you," even here. What is the week or the day of the week that
    our papers do not tell of man or woman who, to escape the tortures of
    want, has stepped out of life unbidden? What is this but famine?

    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your use, in so many passages of your Encyclical, of the inclusive term &#8220;property&#8221; or &#8220;private&#8221; property,
    of which in morals nothing can be either affirmed or denied, makes your meaning,
    if we take isolated sentences, in many places ambiguous. But reading it as
    a whole, there can be no doubt of your intention that private property in
    land shall be understood when you speak merely of private property. With
    this interpretation, I find that the reasons you urge for private property
    in land are eight. Let us consider them in order of presentation. You urge:</p>
  <p>1. That what is bought with rightful property is rightful property. (RN,
    paragraph 5) ...<br>
    2. That private property in land proceeds from man&#8217;s gift of reason.
    (RN, paragraphs 6-7.) ...<br>
    3. That private property in land deprives no one of the use of land. (RN,
    paragraph 8.) ...<br>
    4. That Industry expended on land gives ownership in the land itself. (RN,
    paragraphs 9-10.) ...<br>
    5. That private property in land has the support of the common opinion of
    mankind, and has conduced to peace and tranquillity, and that it is sanctioned
    by Divine Law. (RN, paragraph 11.) ...<br>
    6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private property
    in land is necessary to enable them to do so. (RN, paragraphs 14-17.) ...<br>
    7. That the private ownership of land stimulates industry, increases wealth,
    and attaches men to the soil and to their country. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...<br>
    8. That the right to possess private property in land is from nature, not
    from man; that the state has no right to abolish it, and that to take the
    value of landownership in taxation would be unjust and cruel to the private
    owner. (RN, paragraph 51.) ...</p>
  <p><strong>6. That fathers should provide for their children and that private
      property in land is necessary to enable them to do so.</strong> (14-17.)</p>
  <p>With all that your Holiness has to say of the sacredness of the family relation
    we are in full accord. But how the obligation of the father to the child
    can justify private property in land we cannot see. You reason that private
    property in land is necessary to the discharge of the duty of the father,
    and is therefore requisite and just, because &#8212;</p>
  <p>It is a most sacred law of nature that a father must provide food and all
    necessaries for those whom he has begotten; and, similarly, nature dictates
    that a man&#8217;s children, who carry on, as it were, and continue his own
    personality, should be provided by him with all that is needful to enable
    them honorably to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life. Now, in no other way can a father effect this except
    by the ownership of profitable property, which he can transmit to his children
    by inheritance. (14.)</p>
  <p>Thanks to Him who has bound the generations of men together by a provision
    that brings the tenderest love to greet our entrance into the world and soothes
    our exit with filial piety, it is both the duty and the joy of the father
    to care for the child till its powers mature, and afterwards in the natural
    order it becomes the duty and privilege of the child to be the stay of the
    parent. This is the natural reason for that relation of marriage, the groundwork
    of the sweetest, tenderest and purest of human joys, which the Catholic Church
    has guarded with such unremitting vigilance.</p>
  <p>We do, for a few years, need the providence of our fathers after the flesh.
    But how small, how transient, how narrow is this need, as compared with our
    constant need for the providence of Him in whom we live, move and have our
    being &#8212; Our Father who art in Heaven! It is to him, &#8220;the giver
    of every good and perfect gift,&#8221; and not to our fathers after the flesh,
    that Christ taught us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread.&#8221; And
    how true it is that it is through him that the generations of men exist!
    Let the mean temperature of the earth rise or fall a few degrees, an amount
    as nothing compared with differences produced in our laboratories, and mankind
    would disappear as ice disappears under a tropical sun, would fall as the
    leaves fall at the touch of frost. Or, let for two or three seasons the earth
    refuse her increase, and how many of our millions would remain alive?</p>
  <p>The duty of fathers to transmit to their children profitable property that
    will enable them to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life! What is not possible cannot be a duty. And how is it
    possible for fathers to do that? Your Holiness has not considered how mankind
    really lives from hand to mouth, getting each day its daily bread; how little
    one generation does or can leave another. <strong>It is doubtful if the wealth
    of the civilized world all told amounts to anything like as much as one year&#8217;s
    labor, while it is certain that if labor were to stop and men had to rely
    on existing accumulation, it would be only a few days ere in the richest
    countries pestilence and famine would stalk.</strong></p>
  <p> The profitable property your Holiness refers to, is private property in
          land. Now profitable land, as all economists will agree, is land superior
          to the
        land that the ordinary man can get. It is land that will yield an income
        to the owner as owner, and therefore that will permit the owner to appropriate
        the products of labor without doing labor, its profitableness to the
    individual involving the robbery of other individuals. It is therefore possible
    only
        for some fathers to leave their children profitable land. What therefore
        your Holiness practically declares is, that it is the duty of all fathers
        to struggle to leave their children what only the few peculiarly strong,
        lucky or unscrupulous can leave; and that, a something that involves
    the robbery of others &#8212; their deprivation of the material gifts of God.</p>
  <p>This anti-Christian doctrine has been long in practice throughout the Christian
    world. What are its results?</p>
  <p>Are they not the very evils set forth in your Encyclical? Are they not,
    so far from enabling men to keep themselves from want and misery in the uncertainties
    of this mortal life, to condemn the great masses of men to want and misery
    that the natural conditions of our mortal life do not entail; to want and
    misery deeper and more wide-spread than exist among heathen savages? Under
    the r&eacute;gime of private property in land and in the richest countries
    not five per cent of fathers are able at their death to leave anything substantial
    to their children, and probably a large majority do not leave enough to bury
    them! Some few children are left by their fathers richer than it is good
    for them to be, but the vast majority not only are left nothing by their
    fathers, but by the system that makes land private property are deprived
    of the bounty of their Heavenly Father; are compelled to sue others for permission
    to live and to work, and to toil all their lives for a pittance that often
    does not enable them to escape starvation and pauperism.</p>
  <p>What your Holiness is actually, though of course inadvertently, urging,
    is that earthly fathers should assume the functions of the Heavenly Father.
    It is not the business of one generation to provide the succeeding generation &#8220;with
    all that is needful to enable them honorably to keep themselves from want
    and misery.&#8221; That is God&#8217;s business. We no more create our children
    than we create our fathers. It is God who is the Creator of each succeeding
    generation as fully as of the one that preceded it. And, to recall your own
    words (7), &#8220;Nature [God], therefore, owes to man a storehouse that
    shall never fail, the daily supply of his daily wants. And this he finds
    only in the inexhaustible fertility of the earth.&#8221; What you are now
    assuming is, that it is the duty of men to provide for the wants of their
    children by appropriating this storehouse and depriving other men&#8217;s
    children of the unfailing supply that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p>The duty of the father to the child &#8212; the duty possible to all fathers!
    Is it not so to conduct himself, so to nurture and teach it, that it shall
    come to manhood with a sound body, well-developed mind, habits of virtue,
    piety and industry, and in a state of society that shall give it and all
    others free access to the bounty of God, the providence of the All-Father?</p>
  <p>In doing this the father would be doing more to secure his children from
    want and misery than is possible now to the richest of fathers &#8212; as
    much more as the providence of God surpasses that of man. For the justice
    of God laughs at the efforts of men to circumvent it, and the subtle law
    that binds humanity together poisons the rich in the sufferings of the poor.
    Even the few who are able in the general struggle to leave their children
    wealth that they fondly think will keep them from want and misery in the
    uncertainties of this mortal life &#8212; do they succeed? Does experience
    show that it is a benefit to a child to place him above his fellows and enable
    him to think God&#8217;s law of labor is not for him? Is not such wealth
    oftener a curse than a blessing, and does not its expectation often destroy
    filial love and bring dissensions and heartburnings into families? And how
    far and how long are even the richest and strongest able to exempt their
    children from the common lot? Nothing is more certain than that the blood
    of the masters of the world flows today in lazzaroni and that the descendants
    of kings and princes tenant slums and workhouses.</p>
  <p>But in the state of society we strive for, where the monopoly and waste
    of God&#8217;s bounty would be done away with and the fruits of labor would
    go to the laborer, it would be within the ability of all to make more than
    a comfortable living with reasonable labor. And for those who might be crippled
    or incapacitated, or deprived of their natural protectors and breadwinners,
    the most ample provision could be made out of that great and increasing fund
    with which God in his law of rent has provided society &#8212; not as a matter
    of niggardly and degrading alms, but as a matter of right, as the assurance
    which in a Christian state society owes to all its members.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the duty of the father, the obligation to the child, instead
    of giving any support to private property in land, utterly condemns it, urging
    us by the most powerful considerations to abolish it in the simple and efficacious
    way of the single tax.</p>
  <p>This duty of the father, this obligation to children, is not confined to
    those who have actually children of their own, but rests on all of us who
    have come to the powers and responsibilities of manhood.</p>
  <p>For did not Christ set a little child in the midst of the disciples, saying
    to them that the angels of such little ones always behold the face of his
    Father; saying to them that it were better for a man to hang a millstone
    about his neck and plunge into the uttermost depths of the sea than to injure
    such a little one?</p>
  <p>And what today is the result of private property in land in the richest
    of so-called Christian countries? Is it not that young people fear to marry;
    that married people fear to have children; that children are driven out of
    life from sheer want of proper nourishment and care, or compelled to toil
    when they ought to be at school or at play; that great numbers of those who
    attain maturity enter it with under-nourished bodies, overstrained nerves,
    undeveloped minds &#8212; under conditions that foredoom them, not merely
    to suffering, but to crime; that fit them in advance for the prison and the
    brothel?</p>
  <p>If your Holiness will consider these things we are confident that instead
    of defending private property in land you will condemn it with anathema!</p>
