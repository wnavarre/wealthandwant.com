  <p>In a society with increasing wealth, is it just or logical that we have structured
      ourselves in such a way that wealth is increasingly concentrated in a small
      segment of the population, and a growing percentage of us lack sufficient income

    (1887 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><b>There are not charitable
  institutions enough to supply the
  demand for charity; that demand seems incapable of being
  supplied.</b> But there are enough, at least, to show every thinking
  woman and every thinking man that it is utterly impossible to
  eradicate poverty by charity; to show everyone who will trace to its
  root the cause of the disease that <span style="font-weight: bold;">what
  is needed is not charity, but
  justice &#8212; the conforming of human institutions to the eternal
  laws of right.</span></small></p>
  <p>    <small>But when we propose this, when we say that poverty exists
    because of the violation of God&#8217;s laws, we are taunted with pretending
    to know more than humans ought to know about the designs of
    Omnipotence. They have set up for themselves a god who rather likes
    poverty, since it affords the rich a chance to show their goodness and
    benevolence; and they point to the existence of poverty as a proof that
    God wills it. Our reply is that poverty exists not because of God&#8217;s
    will, but because of humanity&#8217;s disobedience. We say that we do know
    that it is God&#8217;s will that there should be no poverty on earth, and
    that we know it as we may know any other natural fact. ...&nbsp;<a

 style="font-weight: bold;">THE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS</span>:
OPPORTUNITY LOST?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Publisher's pamphlet, circa
1970: </small><br>
<small>Apart from Free Trade, the great economic and social issues were
taxation and the alleviation of poverty. The Liberals were concerned to
remove the basic cause of the problem -- not just to mitigate its
undesirable effects.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the American economist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George</span> who, towards the end of
the 19th century, had examined the paradox of the age in his <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>.
His principles had a major impact, first upon the radicals of Scotland
and Ireland, including Campbell Bannerman himself; and later upon the
policy of the Liberal Party.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry
George
propounded that whilst people have the right to possess what they
produce, or receive in exchange for their work, there is no such right
to private ownership of the elements upon which all depend -- air,
water, sunshine and land. Indeed, George held the right of access to
these basic elements as strong and equal as the right to life itself,
and that if private ownership of basic elements is permitted,
suppression and exploitation of one class by another is inevitable. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The consequent injustice must
become more acute as the community develops.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it became a major point of Liberal
policy to
shift taxation from production, and to raise taxation upon the value of
land, on the basis that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this value, as
witnessed by the tremendously high prices even then demanded for
commercial land, is created not by any individual but by the existence
and work of the whole community.</span> A natural source thus arises
from which the community may meet its growing needs without
discouraging production or inhibiting the growth of earnings.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The justice
and
practicality of this proposition can rarely if ever have enjoyed a more
brilliant advocate than Winston Churchill, and today's reader is left
to wonder how different might be the present state of Britain had the
forces of social change pursued these principles to their enactment.
... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
People's Rights tells a very different story and comes
now not as a document of historic interest but as a challenge to
politicians, indeed to the entire electorate, to consider again the
causes of poverty and the basic issues of social and economic justice.
Perhaps current disillusionment with politics springs from a sense that
if justice in the community can only be achieved at the expense of
individual liberty, the price -- especially in terms of ever-increasing
taxation and bureaucracy -- is too high to pay.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a proposition that justice in the
community and the freedom of
the individual are complementary and that taxes may be raised without
undermining either, The People's Rights comes as a major contribution
to current political and economic thought. Indeed it deserves a place
in the annals of Man's struggle for freedom and yearning for a society
in which the genius of every person would be nurtured and the liberty
of every person respected. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>...

<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>Martin Luther King, Jr: <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">Where
    Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>... I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most
    effective -- the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely
    discussed
  measure: the guaranteed income. ...</p>
  <p>Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably
    will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual
    will flourish when the decisions concerning his life and in his own hands,
    when he has the assurance that his income is stable and certain, and when he
    know that he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts between
    husband, wife and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human
  worth on a scale of dollars is eliminated.</p>
  <p>Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income
    operates as a consistently progressive measure.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest
          levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply
      perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions.</li>
    <li> Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically
              increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to
      remain static under
            growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline.
      If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen,
      then the guaranteed
            income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without
              these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying
      the gains of security
            and stability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This proposal is not a &quot;civil rights&quot; program, in the sense that
    that term is currently used. The program would benefit all the poor, including
    the two-thirds of them who are white. I hope that both Negro and white will
    act in coalition to effect this change, because their combined strength will
    be necessary to overcome the fierce opposition we must realistically anticipate.</p>
  <p>Our nation's adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated if we
    realize that for nearly forty years two groups in our society have already
    been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom of our confused
    social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest and the poorest.
    The wealthy who own securities have always had an assured income; and their
    polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed an income, however miniscule,
    through welfare benefits. ... </p>
  <p>Work of this sort could be enormously increased, and we are likely
    to find that the problems of housing and education, instead of preceding the
    elimination of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty is first abolished.
    The poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter
    housing decay. Negroes who have a double disability will have a greater effect
    on discrimination when they have the additional weapon of cash to use in their
  struggle.</p>
  <p>Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably
    will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual
    will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands,
    when he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts among husbands,
    wives and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth
    on the scale of dollars is eliminated .</p>
  <p>Now our country can do this. John Kenneth Galbraith said that a guaranteed
      annual income could be done for about twenty billion dollars a year. And
    I say to you today, that if our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars
      a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars
      to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's
    children
      on their own two feet right here on earth. ...</p>
  <p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
    do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
    must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
    society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask
    the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
    when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the
    economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that
    question,
    you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that
    more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society.
    We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's market place.
    But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs
    restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my friends,
  when you deal with this,</p>
  <p> * you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot;<br>
    * You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot;<br>
    * You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay
    water bills in a world that is two thirds water?&quot;</p>
  <p>These are questions that must be asked. ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">read the book excerpt
