      <p>Georgists and the &quot;starve government&quot; folks do agree on <em>one</em> thing:

      <p>Georgists, however,
          are not opposed to <em>all</em> taxes. In fact Georgists believe that
          society and the economy will actually improve if we apply the <em>right</em> taxes,
          just as
        it will improve if we remove the <em>perverse</em> taxes. </p>

      <p>Certain things are inherently private property: wages and interest.
        Certain things are rightly common property: land and natural resources
        and the social surplus. We ought to tax the privatization of common property &#8212; fully &#8212; before
        we turn to taxes on that which is rightly in the private realm! Therein

<blockquote>
  <p>While the major argument for raising public revenue from land rent
    and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
    the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
    public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
    its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes on labor and capital cause
    people to consider alternative
    options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
    goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
    and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
    hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
    take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour.</span> Economists claim
    that
    present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
    States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
    public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
    same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
    building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
    tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
    and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
    30% in recent years. .... <a

Fallacy of the "Three-Legged Stool" Metaphor</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Contemporary economists and conventional tax theorists well recognize
that taxing Labor and Capital is detrimental to economic vitality &#8212; politicians
thrive on repeating this <span style="font-style: italic;">ad
nauseam</span>.&nbsp; Currently the Republican party candidates seem
best able to exploit resentment about the negative impact of
taxes.&nbsp; But they are not alone in failing to appreciate the nature
of tax shifting.&nbsp; What all fail to realize is that there are
notable exceptions to the rule that taxes are oppressive: any tax
imposed on an inelastic base &#8212;  that is, any form of Land  &#8212; constitutes
no distortion or excess burden whatsoever.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Far from
spreading the burden of distribution over a wide array of&nbsp; tax
bases, the ideal tax, then, should be imposed solely on those factors
of production that form an inelastic base, i.e., that constitute forms
of Land -- whether they be locational sites, natural resources, the
spectrum, time slots, or others as they may arise in the future.&nbsp;</span>
Land, in any of its forms, is totally inelastic.&nbsp; Will Rogers in
his pithy way said it well, "Buy land.&nbsp; They ain't making any more
of the stuff."&nbsp; Mark Twain said it too. <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">By
loading the Federal tax burden on
labor, while sparing capital, Congress creates a universal bias for
cities and counties to see purely proletarian labor as a &#8220;fiscal
deficit generator,&#8221; a parasite to repel, while capital and
housing for the rich generate local fiscal surpluses. </span>The
resulting
local biases toward selective growth policies are well known, but
most advocates of housing for the poor are merely hacking at the
branches of evil, ignoring the roots in Federal tax policies. <a

Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
or Rights-Deprived?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled
"underprivileged" and richer folk are called "privileged." For example,
there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One Nation,
Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>."
But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are confused and misleading
expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then you
don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A
privilege is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit
given only to some people only because they have power or are favored
by those with power. If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom
of expression, or if everyone may obtain an item such as a passport
with the same rules applying to all, then it is not a privilege but a
right.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Whether a rich person is "privileged" depends on how he got the
money.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking in special
protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually poor
because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources,
keeping some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived
of their earnings from labor.</small><br>
<br>
<small style="font-weight: bold;">
Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less
employment. Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of
goods has the same effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability
taxes, and payroll taxes that increase the tax wedge. On top of that,
there are minimum-wage laws that prevent the least productive workers
from getting hired. There are permits, zoning, and other rules and
costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>
Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have
little or no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance.
To call them "underprivileged" is a lie. The rights-deprived poor do
not need privileges. They just need government to stop interfering with
their right to work and save! <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay
extra to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed.
These people lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is
not to expand privileges, but to eliminate all governmental privileges.
That is why libertarians and geoists alike have the motto: "Equal
rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small><small><a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Read the whole

The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have already shown that the
land of every country is the public
property of the people of that country, and consequently, that its
exclusive appropriation by a class is a substantial injustice and
wrong done to every man in that country", whom it robs of his fair
share of the common inheritance. The injustice of this appropriation
is enormously enhanced by the fact that it further enables the
landlords, without any risk or trouble, and in fact makes it a matter
of course for them, to appropriate a vast share of the earnings of
the nation besides. They plundered the people first of God's gifts in
the land, and that act of spoliation puts them under a sort of
necessity of plundering them again of an enormous amount of their
direct earnings and wages. The line of argument that leads directly
to this conclusion seems abundantly clear. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now a system of Land Tenure which
thus despoils the people of a
nation of a vast amount of their earnings, which transfers a valuable
property which they have created by patient, painful and selfdenying
efforts of their labour, to a class who do not labour at all, and
make no sacrifices whatever, can, I think, be fairly characterised as
a system of national spoliation. The hardworking, industrious masses
of the nation are taxed twice, and for an enormous amount each time.
They are taxed first for the benefit of the owners of the soil, to
supply them with all the comforts, enjoyments and luxuries which they
desire, and are taxed again to the amount of eighty millions annually
for the government and defence of the country.&nbsp; <a
