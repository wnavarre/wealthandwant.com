  THE way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production, and checking
  supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes upon rent cannot
  check supply. Therefore though a tax on rent compels the landowners to pay
  more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the use of their land, as it
  in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling
  those who hold land on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a
  tax on land values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus
  to reduce the price of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q11. How can mines be taxed without increasing the price of the out-put?</em><br />
    A. By taxing the royalty, or, what is essentially the same, by taxing their
      capitalized value as mining opportunities. This would tend to lower rather
      than increase the price of the product. Read note 11.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Note 11: This is usually a stumbling block to those who,
        without much experience in economic thought, consider the single tax
        for the first time. As soon as they grasp the idea that taxes upon commodities
        shift to consumers they jump to the conclusion that similarly taxes upon
        land values would shift to the users. But this is a mistake, and the
        explanation is simple. Taxes upon what men produce make production more
        difficult and so tend toward scarcity in the supply, which stimulates
        prices; but taxes upon land, provided the taxes be levied in proportion
        to value, tend toward plenty in supply (meaning market supply of course),
        because they make it more difficult to hold valuable land idle, and so
        depress prices.</font></p>

    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land tax levied in proportion to the rent of land,
        and varying with every variation of rents, . . . will fall wholly on
        the landlords.&quot; &#8212; <em>Walker's Pol. Ec., ed. of 1887, p. 413,
        quoting Ricardo</em>.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The power of transferring a tax from the person
        who actually pays it to some other person varies with the object taxed.
        A tax on rents cannot be transferred. A tax on commodities is always
        transferred to the consumer.&quot; &#8212; <em>Thorold Rogers's Pol.
        Ec., ch. xxi, 2d ed., p. 285.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Though the landlord is in all cases the real contributor,
        the tax is commonly advanced by the tenant, to whom the landlord is obliged
        to allow it in payment of the rent.&quot; &#8212; <em>Adam Smith's Wealth
        of Nations, book v, ch. ii, part ii, art. i.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The way taxes raise prices is by increasing the
        cost of production and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
        production, and taxes upon rent cannot check supply. Therefore, though
        a tax upon rent compels land-owners to pay more, it gives them no power
        to obtain more for the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce
        the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land
        on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land values
        tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to reduce
        the price of land.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty, book viii,
        ch. iii, subd. i.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Sometimes this point is raised as a question of shifting
        the tax in higher rent to the tenant, and at others as a question of
        shifting it to the consumers of goods in higher prices. The principle
        is the same. Merchants cannot charge higher prices for goods than their
        competitors do, merely because they pay higher ground rents. A country
        storekeeper whose business lot is worth but few dollars charges as much
        for sugar, probably more, than a city grocer whose lot is worth thousands.
        Quality for quality and quantity for quantity, goods sell for about the
        same price everywhere. Differences in price are altogether in favor of
        places where land has a high value. This is due to the fact that the
        cost of getting goods to places of low land value, distant villages for
        example, is greater than to centers, which are places of high land value.
        Sometimes it is true that prices for some things are higher where land
        values are high. Tiffany's goods, for instance, may be more expensive
        than goods of the same quality at a store on a less expensive site. But
        that is not due to the higher land value; it is because the dealer has
        a reputation for technical knowledge and honesty (or has become a fad
        among rich people), for which his customers are willing to pay whether
        his store is on a high priced-lot or a low-priced one.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Though land value has no effect upon the price of good,
        it is easier to sell goods in some locations than in others. Therefore,
        though the price and the profit of each sale be the same, or even less,
        in good locations than in poorer ones, aggregate receipts and aggregate
        profits are much greater at the good location. And it is out of his aggregate,
        and not out of each profit, that rent is paid, For example: A cigar store
        on a thoroughfare supplies a certain quality of cigar for fifteen cents.
        On a side street the same quality of cigar can be bought no cheaper.
        Indeed, the cigars there are likely to be poorer, and therefore really
        dearer. Yet ground rent on the thoroughfare is very high compared with
        ground rent on the sidestreet. How, then, can the first dealer, he who
        pays the high ground rent, afford to sell as good or better cigars for
        fifteen cents than his competitor of the low priced location? Simply
        because he is able to make so many more sales with a given outlay of
        labor and capital in a given time that his aggregate profit is greater.
        This is due to the advantage of his location, and for that advantage
        he pays a premium in higher ground rent. But that premium is not charged
        to smokers; the competing dealer of the side street protects them. It
        represents the greater ease, the lower cost, of doing a given volume
        of business upon the site for which it is paid; add if the state should
        take any of it, even the whole of it, in taxation, the loss would be
        finally borne by the owner of the advantage which attaches to that site &#8212; by
        the landlord. Any attempt to shift it to tenant or buyer would be promptly
        checked by the competition of neighboring but cheaper land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;A land-tax, levied in proportion to the rent of
        land, and varying with every variation of rent, is in effect a tax on
        rent; and as such a tax will not apply to that land which yields no rent,
        nor to the produce of that capital which is employed on the land with
        a view to profit merely, and which never pays rent; it will not in any
        way affect the price of raw produce, but will fall wholly on the landlords.&quot; <em> &#8212; McCulloch's

    <p><em>Q31. Will not the capitalist be able under the single tax to undersell
        the laborer &#8212; to sell goods for less than cost, at least temporarily &#8212; and
        thereby force him to accept the capitalist's terms?</em><br>
A. With capitalists continually hunting for men to help them fill their orders,
and bidding against each other to get men, as would be the case under the single
tax, such a contingency would be in the highest degree improbable. It is practically
impossible. Nothing short of a trust, an absolutely perfect trust, of all the
owners of capital the world over could produce it. And even then, plenty of very
useful land of all kinds being free and labor products being exempt from taxation,
all people who were outside of the trust would resort co-operatively to the land,
and the trust would be obliged to take them in as the alternative of falling
to pieces under their competition. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read

    of Natural Taxation</a>, from <em>Principles of
Natural Taxation</em> (1917)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Q19. Why should buildings and all other improvements and personal property
      and capital be exempt from taxes?</em><br>
A. Because a tax on them falls upon industry, and so increases the cost of living,
while continuing the invidious exemption of the present net land value.</p>
  <p><em>Q22. What is privilege?</em><br>
A. Strictly defined, privilege is, according to the Century Dictionary, &quot;a
special and exclusive power conferred by law on particular persons or classes
of persons and ordinarily in derogation of the common right.&quot;</p>
  <p><em>Q23. What is today the popular conception of privilege?</em><br>
  A. That it is the law-given power of one man to profit at another man's expense.</p>
  <p><em>Q24. What are the principal forms of privilege?</em><br>
  A. The appropriation by individuals, or by public service corporations, of
    the net rent of land created by the growth and activity of the community
    without payment for the same. Also, the less important privileges connected
    with patents, tariff, and the currency.</p>
  <p><em>Q25. Where in does privilege differ from capital?</em><br>
  A. Capital is a material thing, a product of labor, stored-up wages; an instrument
    of production paid for in human labor, and destined to wear out. Capital
    is the natural ally of labor, and is harmless except as allied to privilege. <strong>Privilege
    is none of these, but is an intangible statutory power, an unpaid-for and
    perpetual lien upon the future labor of this and succeeding generations. </strong> Capital
    is paid for and ephemeral. <strong>Privilege is unpaid for and eternal.</strong> A
    man accumulated in his profession $5,000 capital, which he invested in land
    in Canada. Ten years later he sold the same land for $200,000. Here is an
    instance of $5,000 capital allied with $195,000 privilege. This illustrates
    that privilege and not capital is the real enemy of labor.</p>
  <p><em>Q26. How may franchises be treated?</em><br>
  A. Franchise privileges may be abated, or gradually abolished by lower rates,
    or by taxation, or by both, in the interest of the community.</p>
  <p><em>Q27. Why should privilege be especially taxed?</em><br>
  A. <strong>Because such payment is fairly due from grantee to the grantor of privilege
    and also because a tax upon privilege can never be a burden upon industry
    or commerce, nor can it ever operate to reduce the wages of labor or increase
    prices to the consumer.</strong></p>
  <p><em>Q28. How are landlords privileged?</em><br>
  A. Because, in so far as their land tax is an &quot;old&quot; tax, it is a
  burdenless tax, and because their buildings' tax is shifted upon their tenants;
  most landlords who let land and also the tenement houses and business blocks
  thereon avoid all share in the tax burden.</p>
  <p><em>Q29. How does privilege affect the distribution of wealth?</em><br>
  A. Wealth as produced is now distributed substantially in but two channels,
    privilege and wages. The abolition of privilege would leave but the one proper
    channel, viz., wages of capital, hand, and brain.</p>
  <p><em>Q30. How would the single tax increase wages?</em><br>
A. By gradually transferring to wages that portion of the current wealth that
  now flows to privilege. In other words, it would widen and deepen the channel
  of wages by enlarging opportunities for labor, and by increasing the purchasing
  power of nominal wages through reduction of prices. On the other hand it would
  narrow the channel of privilege by making the man who has a privilege pay for
  it.</p>
  <p><em>Q31. How can this transfer be effected?</em><br>
  A. By the taxation of privilege.</p>
  <p><em>Q32. How much ultimately may wages be thus increased?</em><br>
  A. Fifty percent would be a low estimate.</p>
  <p><em>Q33. What are fair prices and fair wages?</em><br>
  A. Prices unenhanced by privilege, and wages undiminished by taxation.</p>
  <p><em>Q34. Why does not an increase in ground rent tend to cause an increase in
    prices?</em><br>
    A. Usually sales increase faster proportionately than rent, thus reducing
    the ratio of rent to sales. The larger the product, the lower the individual
    costs. The larger the gross sales, the lower the competitive prices.</p>
