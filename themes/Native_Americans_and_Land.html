Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Hence it becomes important,
critically important, to understand the
meaning of &#8220;ownership&#8221; and &#8220;property&#8221; in the Georgist lexicon. But it
is not difficult, for they continue to have their classical meanings,
just as for John Locke, Adam Smith, and all the major forerunners and
thinkers of classical economics until the advent of neoclassical
economics. What was the meaning of ownership and property in their
classical sense? Property was the product of human labor and capital,
and that alone. Items of property were household goods, personal
attire, armaments, and similar such goods. Property belonged in the
category of capital. Land was not part of property, but rather was its
own category. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Land, broadly defined,
belonged to everyone and was the common heritage of all humanity.</span><small
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">15</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> One could no more &#8220;own&#8221; land than one
could own water, air, or other parts of nature, at least in the sense
of ownership that people often use today.</span> Much like the
native-American concept of ownership, it was part of what was
classically called &#8220; the commons.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small> &#8220;What
is this you call property?&#8221; Massasoit, a leader of the Wampanoag, asked
the Plymouth colonists whom he had befriended in the 1620s. &#8220;It cannot
be the earth, for the land is our mother, nourishing all her children,
beasts, birds, fish, and all men. The woods, the streams, everything on
it belongs to everybody and is for the use of all. How can one man say
it belongs to him?&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17</span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Not only are human beings co-equal with other living beings of
the
earth, so also are beings yet born entitled to an existence. The
Iroquois Indians of New York State are often quoted to the effect that
&#8220;In our every deliberation, we should consider the impact of our
decisions on the next seven generations.&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">101</span></small>
Several contemporary environmental organizations have adopted the
Iroquois &#8220;Great Law of Peace&#8221; so that it has become the vernacular
equivalent of the Brundtland Report&#8217;s definition of sustainability.
Sustainable economics, or 7th generation planning, also requires Daly&#8217;s
&#8220;steady state&#8221; economy, <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">102</span></small>
where (as if natural resources constitute &#8220;capital&#8221;) one lives only on
interest and not principle. Daly contrasts two notions of economic
practice: growth and development. The former may momentarily increase
economic productivity and wealth, but is in the long term a fatal
course of policy. It increases quantity but not quality. Development,
rather, is what should be aspired to, an increase in quality,
efficiency, and fulfillment through minimal uses of energy and material
resources. For development, the value-added dimension comes from
treading lightly on the earth, from the use of mental capital rather
than physical capital.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">103</span></small> Daly
in still another article talks about three parameters of
sustainability: &#8220;allocation, distribution, and scale,&#8221; which will lead
to an economy which is &#8220;efficient, just and sustainable.&#8221; <small><span

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_18F.html">18 Fallacies</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>7. "Economics is
hostile to environmentalism"</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Partly wrong, although some
economists are guilty as charged.
Economics, properly pursued, deals with how best to meet human wants.
<b>Recreation, fishing, wildlife, amenities, clean air, pure water,
sustained resource supply, watershed protection, good health, and
conservation are legitimate human wants.&nbsp; </b><strong>...&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here are four reasons why
environmentalists and economists are
natural allies. </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>(a)
Economizing is conserving.</b> <br>
Rationalizing water use, the proper aim of economics, is
inherently conserving. For example, if we put the Santa Ana River to
its highest and best use, it would obviate megatons of water imports,
and with them the associated environmental damage. </small>
  <p><small>I myself possess a share of this river, which rises
naturally in
an area of intense water shortage, yet I waste it. Why? There is hardly
any variable charge imposed on me for using more. There is a yearly
fixed cost, at about $20 per acre-foot for a 'standard' amount. The
'standard' hasn't changed in a century, and is much more than I
properly need. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Incidentally, the small charge covers expenses of the Gage
Canal
Co., which delivers to me in the cheapest old-fashioned way, by
gravity, in rotation with other users. There is no charge at all for
water as such. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Meantime, the State is importing water here at a true
social cost
of about $2,000 per acre foot, 100 times what I pay). If there were a
market where I could sell my 'right' for a tenth of that price I would
surely do so, but there isn't, so I am waiting. If there were a price
charged to me at a tenth of that cost, I would not buy, but there
isn't, so I am taking. Thus I, and thousands like me, just stand pat
and waste water. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Abuse of local waters in arid areas of high demand, like
Southern
California, results in 'hydro-imperialism.' The prevailing ethic is
mixed-up macho. Conservation is for sissies: Real Men don't conserve
water; Real Men prove they possess predatory genes by preying on
peaceful people's waters. The predators can build more golf courses in
the Sonoran desert of the Coachella Valley. </small></p>
  <small> <b>(b) Subsidy
wastes both dollars and ecologies. </b> <br>
Hydro-imperialism is the common enemy of Sierra Clubbers and
economists. That is lucky for economists, because Sierra Clubbers have
more clout. For example, twenty years ago some pork-barrellers proposed
pumping water from the lower Mississippi River up to West Texas, to
overcome drought in Lubbock. It was to be one of the The Great
Boondoggles -- a real record-smasher for pure waste. </small>
  <p><small>I laughed when I read ecologists were fighting it to save
the
habitat of some unremembered nothing-bird, say the 'Least Southwestern
Shiny-rumped Fleapicker.'<strong> ... </strong>  </small></p>
  <p><small><b>'You have no right to stop growth,' says the
hydro-imperialist.
I agree, but insist on the counterpart: we have no duty to subsidize
growth. Hydro-imperialists and allied land speculators have no right to
demand subsidies.</b> Water supply and flood control and navigation
projects, the traditional kinds, are heavily subsidized. Subsidy
generates waste almost by definition, in the amount of the subsidy. If
it is a subsidy to withdraw water it also creates scarcity of water
where nature may have given us plenty. Consider the lower Colorado
River. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Every major user
is
subsidized, mostly by Congress. </span>No one pays a dime for water at
the source, but everyone gets paid to suck it up and take it home. No
wonder there is a shortage. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No
wonder there are 82 golf courses operating in the Coachella Valley, a
Sonoran desert, and 50 more planned.</span> </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No wonder The
U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation can't even find takers for water carried to
Phoenix in its multi-billion dollar Granite Reef Aqueduct. </span>I
could go on, but exhorting Congress not to waste money is scolding
sinners in Sodom. Come on, ecologists, find an endangered species! </small></p>
  <small> <b>(c) Correct
economic analysis prescribes more water for fish</b> <br>
Twenty years ago a study on the S... River of B.... prescribed
sacrificing the fishery to a proposed power project, reasoning as
follows. The fishery has no value because it is overcrowded; 'its rent
has been dissipated by the tragedy of the commons'. </small>
  <p><small>The value of the catch is only great enough to pay the
fishermen.
The fishery as such therefore has no residual value; it adds nothing to
the total value. Take it away and nothing is lost, net of costs. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>That is a profound fallacy. You will have noted it is a way
of
'dehumanizing' fishermen and assuming away their unemployment costs,
but that is not my main point. It says you should remove water from the
use that is crowded with people, and dedicate it to the use of fewer
people. This violates the basic law of diminishing return'; (a.k.a.
variable proportions). It violates good marginal analysis, a bedrock of
economics. <strong>... </strong>  </small></p>
  <small><b>(d) Correct
economic analysis presumes public trusts</b> <br>
Another thing some economists do right is to acknowledge that
'entitlements' -- the initial assignments of property rights - have a
major effect on the relative bargaining power of different parties. </small>
  <p><small>For years, economists would ask, say, canoers what they as
individuals would pay to keep a river wild.. They got rather low
valuations, and duly reported them as the value of recreation. This was
an effective defensive strategy for dam builders. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>One day it occurred to some unsung genius to ask not what
the
canoer would pay for the wild river; ask what the power company would
have to pay the canoer, and all potential canoers, to extinguish their
entitlements.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>The second question presumes that canoers, as citizens,
already
own the wild river. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>In recent years ecologists have been catching onto this
point and
rubbing the noses of legislators and bad economists in it. In the
currert lingo, one arguing ex parte the canoers stresses that canoers' <b>WTA
(Willingness to Accept)</b> is the relevant dollar value, and it is
higher, perhaps much higher, than their <b>WTP (Willingness to Pay)</b>.&nbsp;
  </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>In defense, the black-hat economists are developing the new
defensive strategy of trivializing the matter by claiming WTP = WTA. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>They follow a Chicago-School guru, one Ronald Coase, who
has
written it doesn't really matter how you assign entitlements so long as
it is clear and firm. Then just call the signal for 'Free Market!' an
punt: everything will work out for the best. Property will be allocate
the same, no matter who starts the game with all the chips, because WTP
= WTA. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Bunk! You are not surprised when someone says 'My home is
not for
sale. I will not sell at any price' even in our highly mobile,
commercially oriented society. They can take that attitude when they
hold the initial entitlement. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>You would be amazed to hear anyone say 'I will pay any
price,'
There are many documented instances of a person swearing under oath his
land is worth no more than $X for tax assessment purpose and soon
thereafter swearing again it is worth $15X when being condemned for a
park or other public use, because he wouldn't sell it for less. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Modern' micro-economics is a throwback to the old
Manchester
School, some of whose members carried Adam Smith far beyond Smith's
intent. They prescribed 'free trade in land' as the solution to all
resource problems -- free trade beginning with entitlements inherited
from millennia of conquest, corruption, aristocracy, confiscations,
negligence, covin and fraud. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>In this narrow view, everyone is an economic man; everyone
has his
price; all decisions are marginal; etc. Facts are forced to fit that
theology. <i>One modernist works the northwest Pacific Coast these
days taking questionnaire surveys to put a value on environmental
values. He has written that he rejects and screens out WTA answers when
they exceed WTP answers by more than 5%. They don't fit the model, so
they are invalid 'aberrations.'</i></small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>If so, aborigines are aberrations. Consider Indian tribes
with
Treaty Rights to fish. Their WTP for those rights is minimal, partly
because their ability to pay (ATP) is minimal. In addition, the mere
hypothesis they are the ones who must pay implies they are impoverished
and cannot pay anything. </small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>On the other hand, their WTA presumes their Treaty Rights
are
valid and they are in control. In their culture, traditional land
rights rank very high relative to money. They have seen people squander
money and be ruined by it land is not squanderable, by nature. Land has
more than marginal value to them because they have just one way of
life, based on fishing. Substitution of other lands is not part of
their ethic. Religion is also involved. It is entirely believable they
mean it when they say they will not sell 'at any price.' They may be
unreasonable, but that's the point: ownership lets you be as
unreasonable as you please. We only notice when someone else has the
entitlement. Politics and institutions are involved: Treaty Rights are
the most valuable mode of holding property there can be. They enjoy
legal supremacy as high as the Constitution itself (Article VI, Section
2), preempting contracts and ordinary legislation. </small></p>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Indians are an extreme case, but
most of us have a streak of their
psychology. Not many generations back we shared the same kind of
culture, a dependence on traditional lands we held in common, in
trust for our descendants. These traditions affect current behavior,
and are totally disregarded in mechanical-type formal micro modeling
(except perhaps as tautological 'revealed preferences'). ... <a
