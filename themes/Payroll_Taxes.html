Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_HG%27sEoA.html">George's
    Economics of
    Abundance: Replacing dismal choices
    with practical resolutions and synergies</a>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Georgist
policy removes the many big tax wedges between worker and
employer, and employer and customer, and worker and consumable goods. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Thus labor can cost the employer
less, while the worker gets more
disposable income after-tax.</span></span> Many economists inveigh
against the
minimum wage, claiming it overprices labor. It is a matter of
suspicion that they are then silent on the deadly effects of the
payroll tax, which affects workers at all levels. Sales taxes, too,
cut into real wages, yet many of these same economists would raise
sales taxes and introduce VAT. President and Mrs. Clinton now speak
seriously of raising payroll taxes even more, to finance the new
health plan.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a high elasticity of
demand for labor. This may be
observed in farming, for example, where landowners have avoided union
wage rates simply by shifting their land from fresh fruits and
vegetables to labor-sparing uses like small grains or cotton.
Conversely, removing the payroll tax burden will move owners to shift
land back into labor-using enterprises.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp; <small><a

</small>Mason Gaffney:<a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_LaaDFoP.html"> Land as a
Distinctive Factor of Production</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Tip O'Neil, the former Speaker
of the US Congress, is oft-quoted that "All politics is local
politics." One might say the same of market power. Some lands are sold
or leased with covenants against competition, as Gimbel's Department
Store holds a covenant on a lot adjoining its parent store on 3rd
Street and Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee.&nbsp; Such anticompetitive
arrangements, however blatant, are intra-state, and apparently immune
from sanctions under US Federal anti-trust laws.&nbsp; Scholars of
industrial organization, many of them doing outstanding work otherwise,
pay these grass-roots matters little heed.&nbsp; Researchers and
activists concentrate on commodity markets at national and world levels
-- the ones subject to Federal sanctions, such as they are.&nbsp; They
could probably find more severe and blatant market failure in local
land markets.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Bargaining power increases with the number of options one
has.&nbsp; A large landowner with a chain of holdings in different
jurisdictions is positioned to bargain, to play off one against the
other.&nbsp; Thus, the Disney Corporation, 1991-93, considered
rebuilding and expanding Disneyland at its current site in Anaheim, or
in Long Beach where it had tenure over another suitable site.&nbsp;
Using this leverage it won concessions from both cities, "finally"
choosing to expand in Anaheim.&nbsp; It has yet to do so, however, and
nothing is really final.&nbsp; Disney has many other sites around the
world.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Likewise, land is a basis for oligopsony power in local labor
markets. A city's labor pool is often faced with a local employers'
association whose membership is limited by the amount of industrial
land within reach of the labor pool.&nbsp; Migrant farm labor is faced
with statewide employers' associations who have the advantages of
limited numbers, wealth, ancient roots and stability.&nbsp; Labor
unions that organize a local plant are faced with the threat of the
"runaway shop", or merely reallocating work among plants, when the
employer owns plants elsewhere.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom has dulled us to it, but
a corporation is a pool of separate individual landowners bargaining in
concert.&nbsp;</span> A century ago, corporations and limited liability
were viewed with suspicion and apprehension.&nbsp; Today, hundreds and
thousands of separate landowners pool their corporate strength against
labor, as a matter of course.&nbsp; Some employees bargain through
unions, but not as a matter of course, and hardly ever with
international options.&nbsp; In the US, less than 20% of the labor
force is unionized, yet many, probably most economists treat labor as
the only threatening monopoly.&nbsp; They see corporations as benign; a
prime cause carried by many economists today is to eliminate the
corporate income tax completely.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Would
we saw such support for eliminating the payroll tax, the most obvious
cause of unemployment.</span>... <a

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a
 href="../docs/Gaffney_LRiaTFS.html">Land Rent
in a Tax-free Society</a>&nbsp; (Outline of remarks by Mason Gaffney,
for use at Moscow Congress,
5/21/96)&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rent
will become huger yet when
you abate taxes
presently levied on production and exchange, because these now
depress the rent of land. </span>That is, in a tax-free market
economy, the
benefit of abating present taxes will lodge mainly in land rents. The
taxable surplus simply shifts from one form to another.</small>
<small> This is more than a simple shift of a fixed amount. When you
substitute land revenues for existing taxes, the surplus actually
grows, as if by synergy. You gain more revenue base than you lose,
because existing taxes now suppress much latent production.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Payroll
taxes directly drive workers from taxable jobs to untaxed gains from
crime.</span> Abating those taxes will unleash suppressed economic
giants,
along with all the new surplus values their latent production will
generate. "Monetarists" warn you that "there are no free lunches." In
fact, however, good policy creates lots of "free lunches." It makes
the whole greater than the sum of its parts. Imagine the benefits,
alone, of turning people from destructive careers in crime to useful
jobs producing goods. ... <a

<p>Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Gaffney_TTSoLMGaGI.html">The
Taxable Surplus of Land: Measuring, Guarding and Gathering It&nbsp;</a>
(for the Duma Hearings in Moscow, 1999)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...
There are many more possible tax types we might consider, taxes
imposed on parts of C, but not all. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A
payroll tax is an example.</span> This tax would discourage the use of
labor on land, but not the use of capital, and so would have two
biases: less labor use, with the same capital use, or even more capital
use as capital substitutes for labor. We do not here pursue all such
possibilities of bad tax policy, for they are too numerous. The major
point is that taxes on any base other than N, the Net Product of land,
bias the market against the best and fullest use of land.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Taxing the Net Product of
Land Permits Untaxing Labor</b></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The IMF and its allies advise
you to
impose heavy taxes on the payrolls of labor, and on employers who hire
labor, and on the goods labor must buy to survive and support families.
</span>Then they turn around and tell you that labor-intensive
operations, like some of your coal mines, are inefficient because labor
is so costly, even though the workers are getting very little after
taxes. They advise you to downsize or close these operations, throwing
labor out of work. They even lend you money for the purpose: not to
develop and build up Russia, but to dismantle its industry, which they
call "restructuring," and throw its workers onto welfare. In a few
specific cases they may be right, but in general, this is a strange way
to develop Russia's economy and living standards!<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It is enough to
make one wonder whose welfare they have in mind.</span>&nbsp;
