<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><small>In broadening one's
understanding of Geonomics, the newcomer repeatedly
encounters the name of Henry George. Since George did not discover
Geonomics (but rather rediscovered it quite independently), why is his
name so prominent?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Firstly, George's writings enlarged Geonomics - its details and
full
consequences - far more than any single person before or since.
Secondly, his persuasiveness and sheer character popularised these
reforms enormously, building up a sweeping tide of millions in the late
1800s. Thirdly, George's concepts were clearly a living, integral part
of his being, and his writings are better understood with the
understanding of his peculiar personal surroundings.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A REMARKABLE LIFE</span></small><br>
<small>But there's one more reason - George's remarkable life. The
singular
uniqueness of George's life and training, bizarre as compared to the
biographies of other thinkers, must be grasped by anyone interested in
his ideas. It is certainly unusual for a noted philosopher to have been
a sailor and a printer, a journalist, tramp, worldwide lecturer and
political candidate.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the goldfields of California and British Columbia, George had
the
unique opportunity of studying the formation of a civilization - the
change of an encampment into a thriving metropolis. He saw towns of
tents and mud change into fine cities of paved streets and decent
housing, with tramways and buses. And as he saw the appearance of
wealth, he noted the first appearance of real poverty. He saw human
degradation forming as an integral part of the rise of leisure and
prosperity, and he felt compelled to discover the cause of this awful
paradox.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Born in Philadelphia in 1839, George broke away from his
restrictive
family at the earliest opportunity, sailing the world at the age of 16.
His restless and ever-inquisitive nature took him to the west coast
where, after a spell in the goldfields of Canada, he based himself in
San Francisco. From a type-setter he became a newspaper editor, and was
soon churning out fierce condemnations of the social problems of his
day. In particular he became a strong critic of mining interests,
political corruption and land speculation.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE PROSPERITY PARADOX</span></small><br>
<small>But it was a visit to New York which really galvanised his
reformist
resolve, where he was shocked by the co-existence of wealth and
poverty. The result was the book <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>
in 1879, which is the all-time bestseller on economics and, in its day,
was the most widely-read English book in the world after the bible. In
a nutshell, his fundamental remedy for poverty was a tax/rental levied
on the value of land exclusive of improvements, and the simultaneous
abolition of all taxes which fall upon industry and thrift.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Despite his growing public profile and his reputation as a
magnetic
public speaker, George never had (or cared for) personal wealth. In
fact, his early years of dire poverty - to the point of starvation for
himself and his young family - were major character-builders. Even
during the height of his much-acclaimed world lecture tours, he never
forgot his roots and what he saw as his calling. A passage from a poem
by Louis Untermeyer has been said to well reflect George's sentiments:</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open my ears to music; let</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me thrill with Spring's first flutes and
drums -</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But never let me dare forget</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bitter ballads of the slums.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open my eyes to visions girt</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With beauty, and with wonder lit -</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me always see the dirt,</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all that spawn and die in it. </small><br>
<br>
<small>George ran for mayor of New York in 1886 and was nearly elected.
He
died in 1897 at the height of his second campaign for mayor of New
York. During his lifetime, he became the third most famous man in the
United States, only surpassed in public acclaim by Thomas Edison and
Mark Twain (himself an outspoken supporter of Georgist economics). Leo
Tolstoy's appreciation stressed the logic of George's exposition: "The
chief weapon against the teaching of Henry George was that which is
always used against irrefutable and self-evident truths. This method,
which is still being applied in relation to George, was that of hushing
up."</small><br>
<br>
<small>His ideas stand: he who makes should have; he who saves should
enjoy;
what the community produces belongs to the community for communal uses;
and God's earth, all of it, is the right of the people who inhabit the
earth.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Williams_IdK.html"><span

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HISTORY:
HENRY GEORGE AND THE LAND VALUE TAX</span></small><br style="font-style: italic;">
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"We
ought to tax all idle land the way Henry George said - tax it heavily
so that its owners have to make it productive." </span>- Henry Ford,
(1863 - 1947)</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"I
believe that Henry George was one of those really great thinkers
produced by our country."</span> - Franklin D. Roosevelt, (1882 - 1945)
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Beyond knowing that Henry George had all the experience he
needed in
terms of poverty, odd-jobbing, writing and publishing, the life of this
man of vision can be read elsewhere. On finding himself out of work in
Philadelphia, he followed the trail of the forty-niners to San
Francisco. Two expeditions in search of gold produced nothing but
hunger and disappointment.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT PARADOX</span></small><br>
<small>For a long time an idea was turning over in his head. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Why are salaries in new countries always higher than in
old ones? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why do progress and poverty not only appear together, but
also drift farther and farther apart? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why are public as well as private charity impotent in
solving the problem with any permanence?
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Why do beggars, tramps and prostitutes cluster around
millionaires' districts?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In San Francisco he had seen the
growth of progress together with
poverty. A trip to New York showed him the process in its full
maturity. The shocking contrast between the most bare-faced opulence
with the most abject squalor turned into an obsession the need to find
an answer to the old question.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But he did not find that answer in New York. He found it in San
Francisco a few months later. During a horse ride in the hills east of
the city he dismounted to let the animal rest. Just to start
conversation he asked a teamster what the value of land was in the
district. "I don't know," answered the man, "but there is a man over
there asking 1000 dollars for an acre." What was happening "over there"
for an acre of land to be worth a fortune in the California of 1869?</small><br>
<br>
<small>The transcontinental railway was about to arrive. The land value
throughout Oakland was being catapulted to the stars with speculators
vying with each other to secure land titles before the arrival of those
who would need land to live and work.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">"EUREKA!"</span></small><br>
<small>In a flash, George understood. Land value increases with the
increase
in population, and those who needed land had to pay for the privilege
of using it. But the land is the primary source of all that human
beings need to live. If there is such a thing as a universal right to
life, there must also be a universal right to the Global Commons
necessary for life. He who owns ends up controlling the destiny of him
who works. Words like "republicanism" or "democracy" may be
high-sounding, but empty.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The remedy suggests itself. To restore the control of land to
those who
use it, it is enough to take the rent of it as a social charge with
which to defray public expenditure. The rent of land, instead of ending
up in private pockets, would pay for defence, administration and the
social services. Put it another way, let whoever occupies land pay in
proportion to the quantity and quality of value subtracted from the
common resources of nature, not for value added on them by his/her own
exertion. And let all receive the value of those resources in the form
of public services. Nobody would thus be defrauded of the fruits of
their labour, and the load of taxation would cease to fall on
production.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">There was nothing new in that
flash of
understanding. He had independently arrived at the conclusions of
feudalism, of Quesnay and of Turgot, without having ever heard of the
three.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HIS WORK</span></small><br>
<small>He began studying and writing. In 1879, at 40, he finished <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><em>Progress and Poverty</em></a>.
The book is still in print, by far outselling all the works of Marx put
together and has been translated into the major world languages.</small><br>
<br>
<small>In the 1880s and 1890s Henry George had captivated much of the
English-speaking world with his books and hundreds of public speeches.
The merit of Henry George is therefore not originality but an uncommon
clear argument backed by a polished expression that makes of the book a
classic of both economics and literature. Why is its author then not
better known? Because he championed the efficiency of Land Value
Taxation so well and identified the underlying cause of social
injustice so successfully that he had to be stopped.</small><br>
<br>
<small>And he was stopped, by the so-called neo-classical economists
bankrolled by vested interests. ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
