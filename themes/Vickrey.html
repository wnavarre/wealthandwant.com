Bill Vickrey was a friend of my Georgist grandparents, and very kindly brought
my grandfather to my home after one of the TRED meetings in Cambridge.
He
was
a wonderful conversational partner, and we covered many topics. I'm
only
familiar
with
part
of
Bill's
work,
but
one
of
my
inspirations for this website is his frequently-heard and oft-quoted
comment on academic papers he heard presented:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> 
  <p>"<em><strong>This paper would benefit
  from an application of Henry George's idea of taxing land values." </strong></em> </p>
</div>
<p>So if you see the exclamation <em><strong>Vickrey!</strong></em> applied to
   a study
on this website, you'll know what it means.</p>
<p>Bill would be been very pleased with the opportunities for pricing highway
  services that EZPass technology offers.</p>

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications of Land
  Value Taxation to Problems of Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient
  Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The logic of efficient environmental protection applies with few changes to
    issues of congestion. <b>Parking meters</b> are simple example of the application
    of land value taxation to solving a problem of congestion. If there is a shortage
    of parking places (at a zero price) then the introduction of parking meters
    (charging rent for the use of land) can relieve the shortage. Ideally, the
    price of a parking meter should vary by time of day to reflect variations in
    the demand for parking places. The ideal fee would equate supply and demand
    at each time of day, with lanes of streets devoted to parking only where the
    revenue generated by the parking fees exceeds the value of the additional lane
    in speeding traffic. Perhaps in a few years we will have parking meters with
    prices that vary by time of day. We certainly have the technology. In the meantime,
    we get by with meters that charge a single price throughout the part of the
    day
  when demand is greatest.</p>
  <p>Charging rent for parking is only a small step from charging rent for cars
    that are moving on city streets. The more cars there are on the streets, the
    slower everyone goes. The marginal cost of having one more car on the streets
    is the value of the extra travel time that everyone else endures because of
    the one additional car. In many places, the congestion cost of traffic is less
    than the cost of administering a system of congestion fees. But this is not
    the case everywhere. <b><a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William Vickrey</a></b> used
    to say that his estimate of the cost in additional delays of having one more
    car in midtown Manhattan in the middle of the day was about $20,000 per hour.
    He would go on to say that this did not imply that people should be charged
    $20,000 per hour for using the streets of midtown Manhattan. He had estimated
    marginal cost at the present level of usage. The efficient charge -- perhaps
    $25 per hour -- would reduce use of the streets so greatly that the marginal
    congestion cost of street usage would equal the price. Efficient congestion
    prices for using the streets of Manhattan (or Boston or other large cities)
    would not merely charge for ordinary usage but would also entail special charges
    for anyone who double-parked or parked in some other illegal way that created
    congestion. If we could keep track of the movements of vehicles, then for any
    vehicle that stood still ahead of backed-up vehicles that wanted to move, there
    would be a charge for the resulting congestion cost, which would be quite high.
    Companies making deliveries to downtown areas might decide that it was far
    better to make deliveries at night than to tie up the streets in the day. </p>
  <p><b>Congestion charges also apply to bottlenecks such as bridges and tunnels.</b> Whenever
    such a facility has cars backed up seeking to use it, efficiency is improved
    by applying a toll that reduces demand to capacity. The same output is produced,
    revenue is generated, and the waste of queuing is avoided. </p>
  <p><b>The efficiency of congestion pricing would also apply to such public facilities
      as airports and parks.</b> When airlines want to have more take-offs and
      landings than an airport can accommodate, it is efficient and just to allocate
      take-off and landing slots by price. Unfortunately, Congress, at the behest
      of airlines, has prohibited airports from doing this, requiring them instead
      to allocate take-off and landing slots by non-price means. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">read the whole article</a></p>
