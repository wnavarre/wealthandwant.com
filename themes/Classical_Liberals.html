<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Classical
Liberals</span><br>
</div>
Dan Sullivan: <a
 href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to royal libertarians,
land becomes private property
when one mixes one's labor with it. And mixing what is yours with
what is not yours in order to own the whole thing is considered great
sport. But the notion is filled with problems. How much labor does it
take to claim land, and how much land can one claim for that labor?
And for how long can one make that claim?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to classical liberals,
land belonged to the user for as
long as the land was being used, and no longer. But according to
royal libertarians, land belongs to the first user, forever. So, do
the oceans belong to the heirs of the first person to take a fish out
or put a boat in? Does someone who plows the same field each year own
only one field, while someone who plows a different field each year
owns dozens of fields? Should the builder of the first
transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn't we at least
have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to
the earth at all? To royal libertarians there are not, but classical
liberals recognized that unlimited ownership of land never flowed
from use, but from the state:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><i>A right of property in
movable things is admitted before
the establishment of government. A separate property in lands not till
after that establishment.... He who plants a field keeps possession of
it till he has gathered the produce, after which one has as good a
right as another to occupy it. Government must be established and laws
provided, before lands can be separately appropriated and their owner
protected in his possession. Till then the property is in the body of
the nation.</i> --Thomas Jefferson ...
  </small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Classical liberals recognized that
exclusive access to land, and
especially to more land than one was using, was a privilege that
should be paid for, thereby eliminating the need for taxes. It is not
a fee for using land, but a fee for the state privilege of denying
use of that land to everyone else.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><i>Men did not make the
earth.... It is the value of the
improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is individual
property.... Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for
the land which he holds.</i> --Tom Paine, "<a
 href="http://geolib.pair.com/essays/paine.tom/agjst.html">Agrarian
Justice</a>," paragraphs 11 to 15 </small>
  <p><small><i>Another means of silently lessening the inequality of
[landed]
property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to
tax the higher portions or property in geometrical progression as they
rise.</i> --Thomas Jefferson</small></p>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today's land value tax advocates
consider graduated land value tax
to be unnecessary and problematic, leading to artificial subdivision
(and phony subdivision) of land. The point is that Jefferson, to whom
libertarians pay homage, considered land monopoly a great evil and
land value tax a remedy, as did many other classical liberals:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <blockquote>
    <p><small><i>Ground rents are a
    species of revenue which the owner,
    in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Ground
    rents are, therefore, perhaps a species of revenue which can best bear
    to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them.</i> --Adam Smith </small>
    </p>
    <p><small><i>Landlords grow richer in their sleep, without working,
    risking,
    or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it does
    from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.</i> --John Stuart Mill
    ...
    </small></p>
  </blockquote>
  <small></small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Socialist Confusions</b>
</small><br>
<small>The classical liberal distinctions between land, labor and
capital
were greatly confused by socialists, and particularly Marxists, who
substituted the fuzzy abstract term, "means of production," for all
three factors. They also blurred the distinction between common
property and state property, for socialists believed, as royalty also
believed, that they were the people.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Today, the confusions between land
and capital and between state
property and common property are shared by socialists and royal
libertarians, and only classical liberals keep these distinctions
clearly defined. Yet royal libertarians frequently duck the land
issue by charging that it is the classical liberals, not the royal
libertarians, who have embraced socialist ideas.... <a

 style="font-weight: bold;">THE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS</span>:
  OPPORTUNITY LOST?</a>&nbsp; (reviews)
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><small>Publisher's pamphlet,
    circa 1970: </small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The republication of any Churchill work
    after sixty
    years is an event commanding widespread public interest. Such attention
    is owed the rich desert of <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The People's Rights</span>,
    last published at the
    culmination of the election campaign of 1909/10, when the speeches from
    which Churchill compiled the book were delivered</small>.<br>
    <br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many a reader will find himself astonished
    that so
    vivid a portrayal of one of the great men of our time should have lain
    so long out of print. Yet modern readers will miss much of the value of
    the book if it is read only for the brilliant and sometimes surprising
    insight into this vital stage of Churchill's political development.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the principles and aspirations set out
    here are
    not those of the individual, but the life force of the great movement
    that reached its zenith in the Liberal Governments of Sir Henry
    Campbell Bannerman and Herbert Asquith that followed the landslide
    Liberal victory of 1906. <span style="font-weight: bold;">If one dares
    to summarise the purpose and
    vision of Liberal leaders of that time, it was to bring in a society in
    which the poverty and social injustice of the previous century would be
    eradicated without diminishing the liberty and independence of the
    individual. The incentive would remain to develop his abilities to the
    full for the good of himself and of the community. ...</span></small><br>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Apart from Free Trade, the great
    economic and social issues were
    taxation and the alleviation of poverty. The Liberals were concerned to
    remove the basic cause of the problem -- not just to mitigate its
    undesirable effects.<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the American economist <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George</span> who, towards the end of
    the 19th century, had examined the paradox of the age in his <a
 href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>.
    His principles had a major impact, first upon the radicals of Scotland
    and Ireland, including Campbell Bannerman himself; and later upon the
    policy of the Liberal Party.<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry George
    propounded that whilst people have the right to possess what they
    produce, or receive in exchange for their work, there is no such right
    to private ownership of the elements upon which all depend -- air,
    water, sunshine and land. Indeed, George held the right of access to
    these basic elements as strong and equal as the right to life itself,
    and that if private ownership of basic elements is permitted,
    suppression and exploitation of one class by another is inevitable. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The consequent injustice must
    become more acute as the community develops.</span></span><br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus it became a major point of Liberal policy to
    shift taxation from production, and to raise taxation upon the value of
    land, on the basis that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this value, as
    witnessed by the tremendously high prices even then demanded for
    commercial land, is created not by any individual but by the existence
    and work of the whole community.</span> A natural source thus arises
    from which the community may meet its growing needs without
    discouraging production or inhibiting the growth of earnings.<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">The justice and
    practicality of this proposition can rarely if ever have enjoyed a more
    brilliant advocate than Winston Churchill, and today's reader is left
    to wonder how different might be the present state of Britain had the
    forces of social change pursued these principles to their enactment. </span>As
    it was, the great power and intellectual prowess of the Liberal
    Movement, which had commanded worldwide admiration for the breadth and
    nobility of its vision, was soon to be dissipated by war, internal
    feuding and the fear of Bolshevism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Under the cruel
    heel of war and unemployment, Britons came to value security more and
    independence less. The emphasis in social advance shifted to the
    massive provision of public benefits, and the increasing intervention
    of the State in almost every area of human activity.</span> The two
    World Wars and the great depression between them severed, to a great
    extent, the line of liberal thought that had developed over the
    previous century.<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Churchill himself, one can only feel that he was
    fated to be the great war leader. Certainly, opposition to communism
    and later to the rise of European tyrannies dominated the remainder of
    his political life. It is perhaps ironic that a reason so often given
    for his dismissal in 1945 is that he was not capable of dealing with
    social problems, and thus was unfit to be a peacetime leader.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">The
    People's Rights</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> tells
    a very different story and comes now not as a document of historic
    interest but as a challenge to politicians, indeed to the entire
    electorate, to consider again the causes of poverty and the basic
    issues of social and economic justice.</span> Perhaps current
    disillusionment with politics springs from a sense that if justice in
    the community can only be achieved at the expense of individual
    liberty, the price -- especially in terms of ever-increasing taxation
    and bureaucracy -- is too high to pay.<br>
    <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a proposition that justice in the community and
    the freedom of the individual are complementary and that taxes may be
    raised without undermining either, The People's Rights comes as a major
    contribution to current political and economic thought. Indeed it
    deserves a place in the annals of Man's struggle for freedom and
    yearning for a society in which the genius of every person would be
    nurtured and the liberty of every person respected.
