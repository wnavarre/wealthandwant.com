    <div align="left">This is a method of assessing land which tends to lead
                to assessments which favor commercial property over residential,
          providing a lower overall
                    value, and a value which doesn't encourage the holder of underused
                land to redevelop the land. Far better is to value the land first,
          because it will be there long after the current building is long forgotten,

</div>
<div style="text-align: center;">
      <div align="left"><small><b>Turning land-value
        gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
  </div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value
gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually
a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
new entries into the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">
or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Hiding the free
lunch</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>BAUDELAIRE OBSERVED that the devil
wins at the point where he
convinces humanity that he does not exist. The <b>Financial,
Insurance and Real Estate (FIRE)</b> sectors seem to have adopted a
kindred philosophy that what is not quantified and reported will be
invisible to the tax collector, leaving more to be pledged for
mortgage credit and paid out as interest. It appears to have worked.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">To academic theorists as well.,
breathlessly focused on their own
particular hypothetical world, the magnitude of land rent and
land-price gains has become invisible.</span> <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">But not to investors. </span>They
are
out to pick a property whose location value increases faster rate
than the interest charges, and they want to stay away from earnings
on man-made capital -- like improvements. That's earned income, not
the "free lunch" they get from land value increases.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Chicago School economists insist
that no free lunch exists. But
when one begins to look beneath the surface of national income
statistics and the national balance sheet of assets and liabilities,
one can see that modern economies are all about obtaining a free
lunch. However, to make this free ride go all the faster, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">it helps if
the rest of the world does not see that anyone is getting the
proverbial something for nothing</span> - what classical economists
called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unearned income</span>, most
characteristically in the form of land rent.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">You start by using a method of
appraising that undervalues the real
income producer, land. Here's how it's done.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two appraisal
methods</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
Both start by estimating its
market value.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their
replacement cost (which usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
little land value) or their depreciated value (which gives an
unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
the land,
and treats the difference as representing the building's value. The
first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map for the
district or city. This displays fairly smooth contours for land values.
Overlays would show zoning variations. Most of the variations in
property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
in neighbourhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
maximise the site's current economic value.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Federal Reserve
multiplies the building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. </span>The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If it is agreed that any
explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
<b><i>uniform</i></b> and <b><i>homogeneous</i></b> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How land gets a
negative value!</b>
</small></p>
<p
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; margin-left: 40px;"><small>THE
DRIVING FORCE behind the anomalies is the political lobbying
eager to depict real estate gains simply as "protecting capital from
inflation." In reality, it helps land owners and their creditors get
a free ride out of land asset-price inflation -- that is, The
Bubble.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> ...
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This leaves in limbo the
macro-economists and business analysts
whose business is to explain the finance, insurance and real
estate (FIRE) sector's dominant role in the economy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">According to
the land-residual appraisal technique, high-rise buildings seem to
have the lowest land values. </span>Real estate interests argue that
this is
realistic, because at least in New York City the higher a building
is, the more of a subsidy its developers need, given the economics of
space involved for elevators, surrounding air space and so forth. The
land itself is assigned a negative value as a statistically balancing
residual reflecting the difference between the building's high
construction costs and its lower market value.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>One obvious problem with the
land-residual approach is that
many buildings would not be rebuilt in their existing form. ... </b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The land-residual approach
appears to work as long as a fairly
constant proportion of land to buildings is maintained.</span>
Statistically, this can occur only when property prices are rising at
about the same rate as commodity prices and wages. But business
cycles snake around the economy's basic trends, rising steadily and
then plunging sharply. This fluctuation is what causes the most
serious problems for statisticians.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
a thriving real estate market
appraisers typically use a rule
of thumb in allocating resale prices as between land and buildings to
reflect their pre-existing proportions. Buildings typically are
assumed to account for between 40 percent and 60 percent of the
property's value. As a result, building values are estimated to grow
along with a property's overall sales value. </span>This appraisal
practice
is made to appear plausible as the pace of asset-price inflation
tends to go hand in hand with rising construction costs, and hence in
the theoretical replacement cost of buildings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As noted, the anomaly occurs when
real estate prices fall. Real
estate prices are volatile, while construction costs rarely dip more
than slightly, if at all. When real estate prices turn down, they
often plunge below the reproduction cost of buildings. Hence, the
residual ("land") rises and falls much more sharply than do building
replacement costs (which are estimated as rising at a fairly steady
pace) and overall property values.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result is a curious asymmetry.
Building prices seem to be
responsible for the rise in real estate prices, while land prices are
held responsible for their decline. When the fall in property values
intersects the rising reproduction-cost trend, the land residual
turns negative.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Because this land value often
represents the owner's equity, this
decline may prompt heavily indebted owners to default on their loans
or even to walk away from their property, which reverts to the bank
or other mortgage holder. In this sense the financial system itself
is based largely on real estate, as the economy learned in the
savings and loan (S&amp;L) deposit insurance crisis of the late
1980s. Real estate prices reflect the supply of property (including a
fixed supply of land) as compared with the fluctuating supply of
mortgage credit, which tends to be a function of the economy's
overall liquidity. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Real estate
industry's priorities</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>REAL ESTATE LOBBIES recognize that
what is not seen is less likely
to be taxed. What is not quantified for public policy-makers to see
clearly may avoid taxes, leaving property owners with a larger
after-tax return. They prefer land-residual's capital gains
statistics at the national level, even as individual investors seek
site-value gains at the local level.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This explains the seeming irony
that investors in an industry
dealing primarily with the development of land sites have campaigned
to minimize the statistical treatment of land. Relegating land to
merely secondary status enables the real estate industry to depict
its "capital" gains as resulting from cost inflation and hence the
reproduction costs of buildings -- whose value is allowed to be
depreciated and re-depreciated at rising values over time. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><small>The free
lunch of land-price gains is unseen as attention is diverted from the
real estate bubble and land-price inflation to building costs. These
fiscal considerations help to explain why it has been so hard to get
Washington to produce national land value statistics.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

      on the eve of demolition, is listed as higher than the land under them.
      This betrays the erroneous use of the &#8220;land-residual&#8221; method
      of separating land from building values. It should be obvious that the
      old junker has no residual value: that is why it is being junked. Junking

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">Land Taxation and Efficient
    Land Speculation</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An <em>ad valorem</em> tax is administered by having assessors who estimate
    the sale value of land. When tax rates are modest, it is easy enough for assessors
    to do this by monitoring sales of land that is vacant or has only structures
    that are about to be demolished. However, if
  the rate of an <em>ad valorem</em> tax is very high, then the influence of inherent
  value of land will be overwhelmed in prices by idiosyncratic features of transactions
  between particular buyers and sellers. Assessors would need to rely on processes
  in which sale prices were
  linked directly to taxes. These could be either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">auctions</span>, where participants knew that the
  auction result would be used to set the
  tax for a specified period, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">options</span>,
  where potential uses of land offered specified payments for any site meeting
  certain standards.
  Because <em>ad valorem</em> taxes on land have no distorting effects, they neither
  retard nor advance the timing of land development in a world of perfect information.
  This has been denied by Shoup (1970, p. 38-39), Bentick (1979, pp. 861-63; 1982)
  and a variety of other writers who have followed them. The tax that Shoup and
  Bentick
  analyze, however, is not an <em>ad valorem</em> tax, but rather a tax whose base
  is the present value of the future net income that is expected to result from
  the plans for a site. Thus a change in the plan produces a change in the tax
  bill, generating an incentive for
  inefficient changes in plans (Tideman, 1982).</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">An element of truth in the analyses of Shoup
        and Bentick is that
    it is possible that while the tax base will be called "land," the size of the
    tax bill will in fact vary with land development actions of the holders of land.
    If assessors assign a different value to land if it is developed than if it is
    not developed, then a tax on land is
    not neutral. </span>This may occur in particular if assessors use a "<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">land as
    residual</span>" method of assessing sites with old improvements, estimating
    the selling price of land as the difference between the selling price of
    the improved site and the undepreciated value of the improvements. For a
    tax on the
    assessed selling price of land to be neutral, assessors must assess land
    according to what its sale value would be
    if it were bare. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read the whole article</a></p>
