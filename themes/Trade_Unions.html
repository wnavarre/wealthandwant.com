    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-2">[18]</font> The people are largely conscious of all this, and there is among the
  masses much dissatisfaction. But there is a lack of that intelligent interest
  necessary to adapt political organization to changing conditions. The popular
  idea of reform seems to be merely a change of men or a change of parties, not
  a change of system. Political children, we attribute to bad men or wicked parties
  what really springs from deep general causes. Our two great political parties
  have really nothing more to propose than the keeping or the taking of the offices
  from the other party. On their outskirts are the Greenbackers, who, with a
  more or less definite idea of what they want to do with the currency, represent
  vague social dissatisfaction; civil service reformers, who hope to accomplish
  a political reform while keeping it out of politics; and anti-monopolists,
  who propose to tie up locomotives with packthread. <strong>Even the labor organizations
  seem to fear to go further in their platforms than some such propositions as
  eight-hour laws, bureaus of labor statistics, mechanics' liens, and prohibition
  of prison contracts.</strong> <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

    <p>Henry George: <a

  </div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div align="left"><small>What most strikingly shows how
        opposed to Christianity is the
        existing system of raising public revenue is its influence on thought.</small></div>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Christianity teaches us that all
men are brethren; that their
true interests are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the
golden rule of life, that we should do to others as we would have
others do to us. But, out of the system of taxing the products and
processes of labor, and out of its effects in increasing the price of
what some have to sell and others must buy, has grown the theory of
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Protection</span>,&#8221; which denies this
gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of
political economy, and proclaims laws for the nation utterly at
variance with His teaching.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>This theory
sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a
universal war of hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their
prosperity lies in imposing on the productions of other peoples
restrictions they do not wish imposed, on their own; and, instead of
the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood, it makes injury of
foreigners a civic virtue. ... 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The vice of Socialism in all its
degrees is its want of
radicalism, of going to the root.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Its advocates generally teach the
preposterous and degrading
doctrine that slavery was the first condition of labor. It assumes
that the tendency of wages to a minimum is the natural law, and seeks
to abolish wages; it assumes that the natural result of competition is
to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish competition by
restrictions, prohibitions, and extensions of governing power. Thus,
mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the state for
hitting it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not
worse are futile.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Associated though it is in many
places with democratic
aspiration, yet its essence is the same delusion to which the Children
of Israel yielded when, against the protest of their prophet, they
insisted on a king; the delusion that has everywhere corrupted
democracies and enthroned, tyrants &#8211; that power over the people can be
used for the benefit of the people; that there may be devised machinery
that through human agencies will secure for the management of
individual affairs more wisdom and mare virtue than the people
themselves possess. This superficiality and this tendency may be seen
in all the phases of Socialism.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Though not usually classed as
Socialists; both the Trade
Unionists and the Protectionists have the same essential character.
Take, for instance, Protectionism. The Protectionists seek by
governmental prohibitions or taxes on imports to regulate the industry
and control the exchanges of their country, so as they imagine, to
diversify home industries and prevent the competition of people of
other countries.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What support <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Protectionism </span>has, beyond the mere
selfish desire
of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their goods are
worth, springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not
consumption, is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than
money&#8217;s worth, and to sell more profitable than to buy; and, above all,
from a desire to limit competition, springing from an unanalysing
recognition of the phenomena that necessarily follow when men who have
the need to labor are deprived by monopoly of access to the natural
and indispensable element of all labor.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Its
methods involve the idea that Governments can more wisely
direct the expenditure of labor and the investment of capital than can
laborers and capitalists, and that the men who control Governments
will use this power for the general good and not in their own
interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict liberty, invent
crimes. They promote perjury, fraud, and corruption. And they would,
were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilisation
and reduce mankind to savagery.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Take
Trades Unionism.</span> The Trade Unionists seek the increase of
wages, the reduction of working hours, and the general improvement in
the condition of wage workers by organising them into guilds or
associations which shall fix the rates at which they will sell their
labor, shall deal as one body with employers in case of dispute, shall
use on occasion their necessary weapon, the strike, and shall
accumulate funds for such purposes and for the purpose of assisting
members when on strike, or (sometimes) when out of employment.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While within narrow lines trades
unionism promotes the idea of
the mutuality of interests, and often helps to raise courage and
further political education, and while it has enabled limited bodies of
working-men to improve somewhat their condition, and gain, as it were,
breathing space, yet it takes no note of the general causes that
determine the condition of labor, and strives for the elevation of
only a small part of the great body by means that cannot help the rest.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Aiming at the restriction of
competition &#8211; the limitation of
the right to labor &#8211; its methods are like those of an army, which even
in a righteous cause are subversive of liberty and liable to abuse,
while its weapon, the strike, is destructive in its nature both to
combatants and non-combatants, being a form of passive war. To apply
the principle of Trades Unionism to all industry, as some dream of
doing, would be to enthrall men in a caste system.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Or take even such moderate
measures as the limitation of
working hours and of the labor of women and children. They are
superficial in looking no further than to the eagerness of men and
women and little children to work unduly, and in proposing forcibly to
restrain overwork while utterly ignoring its cause, the sting of
poverty that forces human beings to it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And the methods by which these
restraints must be enforced,
multiply officials, interfere with personal liberty, tend to
corruption, and are liable to abuse.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Working-men&#8217;s associations may
promote fraternity among their
members, extend social intercourse, and provide assurance in case of
sickness or death &#8211; but if they go no further they are powerless to
affect wages even among their members.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to trade unions proper, the
attitude of many good people is
one of warm approbation provided that they do not go too far. <font
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" color="#ff3300">For these good people
abject to strikes they reprehend </font>societies that do their best
to get into their hands the
whole field of labor and to force working-men either to join them or
to starve; they discountenance the coercing of employers, and seem to
think that arbitration might take the place of strikes.<strong> ... 
</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Labor associations of the nature
of Trade Guilds or Unions
are necessarily selfish. By the law of their being they must fight for
their own hand, regardless of who is hurt; they ignore and must ignore
the teaching of Christ that we should do to others as we would have
them do to us, which a true political economy shows is the only way to
the full emancipation of the masses; they must do their best to starve
workmen who do not join them; they must by all means in their power
force back the &#8220;blackleg&#8221; &#8211; as the soldier in battle must shoot down
his mother&#8217;s son if in the opposing ranks!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>And who is the blackleg? A
fellow-creature seeking work &#8211; a
fellow creature in all probability more pressed and starved than those
who so bitterly denounce him, and often with the hungry, pleading faces
of wife and child behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;<a

<blockquote>
  <p>I have said enough to show your Holiness the injustice into which you fall
    in classing us, who in seeking virtually to abolish private property in land
    seek more fully to secure the true rights of property, with those whom you
    speak of as socialists, who wish to make all property common. But you also
    do injustice to the socialists.<br>
    <br>
    There are many, it is true, who feeling bitterly the monstrous wrongs of
    the present distribution of wealth are animated only by a blind hatred of
    the rich and a fierce desire to destroy existing social adjustments. This
    class is indeed only less dangerous than those who proclaim that no social
    improvement is needed or is possible. But it is not fair to confound with
    them those who, however mistakenly, propose definite schemes of remedy.</p>
  <p>The socialists, as I understand them, and as the term has come to apply
    to anything like a definite theory and not to be vaguely and improperly used
    to include all who desire social improvement, do not, as you imply, seek
    the abolition of all private property. Those who do this are properly called
    communists. What the socialists seek is the state assumption of capital (in
    which they vaguely and erroneously include land), or more properly speaking,
    of large capitals, and state management and direction of at least the larger
    operations of industry. In this way they hope to abolish interest, which
    they regard as a wrong and an evil; to do away with the gains of exchangers,
    speculators, contractors and middlemen, which they regard as waste; to do
    away with the wage system and secure general cooperation; and to prevent
    competition, which they deem the fundamental cause of the impoverishment
    of labor. The more moderate of them, without going so far, go in the same
    direction, and seek some remedy or palliation of the worst forms of poverty
    by government regulation. The essential character of socialism is that it
    looks to the extension of the functions of the state for the remedy of social
    evils; that it would substitute regulation and direction for competition;
    and intelligent control by organized society for the free play of individual
    desire and effort.</p>
  <p><strong>Though not usually classed as socialists, both the trades-unionists
      and the protectionists have the same essential character</strong>. The trades-unionists
    seek the increase of wages, the reduction of working-hours and the general
    improvement in the condition of wage-workers, by organizing them into guilds
    or associations which shall fix the rates at which they will sell their labor;
    shall deal as one body with employers in case of dispute; shall use on occasion
    their necessary weapon, the strike; and shall accumulate funds for such purposes
    and for the purpose of assisting members when on a strike, or (sometimes)
    when out of employment. The protectionists seek by governmental prohibitions
    or taxes on imports to regulate the industry and control the exchanges of
    each country, so as, they imagine, to diversify home industries and prevent
    the competition of people of other countries. ...</p>
  <p>With the socialists we have some points of agreement, for we recognize fully
    the social nature of man and believe that all monopolies should be held and
    governed by the state. In these, and in directions where the general health,
    knowledge, comfort and convenience might be improved, we, too, would extend
    the functions of the state.</p>
  <p>But it seems to us the vice of socialism in all its degrees is its want
    of radicalism, of going to the root. It takes its theories from those who
    have sought to justify the impoverishment of the masses, and its advocates
    generally teach the preposterous and degrading doctrine that slavery was
    the first condition of labor. It assumes that the tendency of wages to a
    minimum is the natural law, and seeks to abolish wages; it assumes that the
    natural result of competition is to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish
    competition by restrictions, prohibitions and extensions of governing power.
    Thus mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the stone for hitting
    it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not worse are futile.
    Associated though it is in many places with democratic aspiration, yet its
    essence is the same delusion to which the children of Israel yielded when

    methods by which these restraints must be enforced, multiply officials, interfere
    with personal liberty, tend to corruption, and are liable to abuse.</strong></p>
  <p>As for thoroughgoing socialism, which is the more to be honored as having
    the courage of its convictions, it would carry these vices to full expression.
    Jumping to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it fails to see
    that oppression does not come from the nature of capital, but from the wrong
    that robs labor of capital by divorcing it from land, and that creates a
    fictitious capital that is really capitalized monopoly. It fails to see that
    it would be impossible for capital to oppress labor were labor free to the
    natural material of production; that the wage system in itself springs from
    mutual convenience, being a form of cooperation in which one of the parties
    prefers a certain to a contingent result; and that what it calls the &#8220;iron
    law of wages&#8221; is not the natural law of wages, but only the law of
    wages in that unnatural condition in which men are made helpless by being
    deprived of the materials for life and work. It fails to see that what it
    mistakes for the evils of competition are really the evils of restricted
    competition &#8212; are due to a one-sided competition to which men are forced
    when deprived of land. While its methods, the organization of men into industrial
    armies, the direction and control of all production and exchange by governmental
    or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried to full expression, mean
    Egyptian despotism.</p>
  <p>We differ from the socialists in our diagnosis of the evil and we differ
    from them as to remedies. We have no fear of capital, regarding it as the
    natural handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself as natural and
    just; we would set no limit to accumulation, nor impose on the rich any burden
    that is not equally placed on the poor; we see no evil in competition, but
    deem unrestricted competition to be as necessary to the health of the industrial
    and social organism as the free circulation of the blood is to the health
    of the bodily organism &#8212; to be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation
    is to be secured. We would simply take for the community what belongs to
    the community, the value that attaches to land by the growth of the community;
    leave sacredly to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and,
    treating necessary monopolies as functions of the state, abolish all restrictions
    and prohibitions save those required for public health, safety, morals and
    convenience.</p>
  <p>But the fundamental difference &#8212; the difference I ask your Holiness
    specially to note, is in this: socialism in all its phases looks on the evils
    of our civilization as springing from the inadequacy or inharmony of natural
    relations, which must be artificially organized or improved. In its idea
    there devolves on the state the necessity of intelligently organizing the
    industrial relations of men; the construction, as it were, of a great machine
    whose complicated parts shall properly work together under the direction
    of human intelligence. This is the reason why socialism tends toward atheism.
    Failing to see the order and symmetry of natural law, it fails to recognize
    God.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, we who call ourselves single-tax men (a name which expresses
    merely our practical propositions) see in the social and industrial relations
    of men not a machine which requires construction, but an organism which needs
    only to be suffered to grow. We see in the natural social and industrial
    laws such harmony as we see in the adjustments of the human body, and that
    as far transcends the power of man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct
    as it is beyond man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct the vital movements
    of his frame. We see in these social and industrial laws so close a relation
    to the moral law as must spring from the same Authorship, and that proves
    the moral law to be the sure guide of man where his intelligence would wander
    and go astray. Thus, to us, all that is needed to remedy the evils of our
    time is to do justice and give freedom. This is the reason why our beliefs
    tend toward, nay are indeed the only beliefs consistent with a firm and reverent
    faith in God, and with the recognition of his law as the supreme law which
    men must follow if they would secure prosperity and avoid destruction. This
    is the reason why to us political economy only serves to show the depth of
    wisdom in the simple truths which common people heard gladly from the lips
    of Him of whom it was said with wonder, &#8220;Is not this the Carpenter
    of Nazareth?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And it is because that in what we propose &#8212; the securing to all men
    of equal natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers and the removal
    of all legal restriction on the legitimate exercise of those powers &#8212; we
    see the conformation of human law to the moral law, that we hold with confidence
    that this is not merely the sufficient remedy for all the evils you so strikingly
    portray, but that it is the only possible remedy. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p><br>
    You state that you approach the subject with confidence, yet in all that
      greater part of the Encyclical (19-67) devoted to the remedy, while there
      is an abundance of moral reflections and injunctions, excellent in themselves
      but dead and meaningless as you apply them, the only definite practical
      proposals for the improvement of the condition of labor are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. That the state should step in to prevent overwork, to restrict the employment
        of women and children, to secure in workshops conditions not unfavorable
        to health and morals, and, at least where there is danger of insufficient
        wages provoking strikes, to regulate wages (39-40).</p>
    <p>2. That it should encourage the acquisition of property (in land) by working-men
        (50-51).</p>
    <p>3. That working-men&#8217;s associations should be formed (52-67). These
        remedies so far as they go are socialistic, and though the Encyclical is
        not without recognition of the individual character of man and of the priority
        of the individual and the family to the state, yet the whole tendency and
        spirit of its remedial suggestions lean unmistakably to socialism &#8212; extremely
        moderate socialism it is true; socialism hampered and emasculated by a supreme
        respect for private possessions; yet socialism still. But, although you frequently
        use the ambiguous term &#8220;private property&#8221; when the context
        shows that you have in mind private property in land, the one thing clear
        on the
        surface and becoming clearer still with examination is that you insist
        that whatever else may be done, the private ownership of land shall be
        left untouched.
        ...</p>

  <p>I have already referred generally to the defects that attach to all socialistic
    remedies for the evil condition of labor, but respect for your Holiness dictates
    that I should speak specifically, even though briefly, of the remedies proposed
    or suggested by you.</p>
  <p>Of these, the widest and strongest are that the state should restrict the
    hours of labor, the employment of women and children, the unsanitary conditions
    of workshops, etc. Yet how little may in this way be accomplished.</p>
  <p>A strong, absolute ruler might hope by such regulations to alleviate the
    conditions of chattel slaves. But the tendency of our times is toward democracy,
    and democratic states are necessarily weaker in paternalism, while in the
    industrial slavery, growing out of private ownership of land, that prevails
    in Christendom today, it is not the master who forces the slave to labor,
    but the slave who urges the master to let him labor. Thus the greatest difficulty
    in enforcing such regulations comes from those whom they are intended to
    benefit. It is not, for instance, the masters who make it difficult to enforce
    restrictions on child labor in factories, but the mothers, who, prompted
    by poverty, misrepresent the ages of their children even to the masters,
    and teach the children to misrepresent.</p>
  <p>But while in large factories and mines regulations as to hours, ages, etc.,
    though subject to evasion and offering opportunities for extortion and corruption,
    may be to some extent enforced, how can they have any effect in those far
    wider branches of industry where the laborer works for himself or for small
    employers?</p>
  <p>All such remedies are of the nature of the remedy for overcrowding that
    is generally prescribed with them &#8212; the restriction under penalty of
    the number who may occupy a room and the demolition of unsanitary buildings.
    Since these measures have no tendency to increase house accommodation or
    to augment ability to pay for it, the overcrowding that is forced back in
    some places goes on in other places and to a worse degree. All such remedies
    begin at the wrong end. They are like putting on brake and bit to hold in
    quietness horses that are being lashed into frenzy; they are like trying
    to stop a locomotive by holding its wheels instead of shutting off steam;
    like attempting to cure smallpox by driving back its pustules. Men do not
    overwork themselves because they like it; it is not in the nature of the
    mother&#8217;s heart to send children to work when they ought to be at play;
    it is not of choice that laborers will work under dangerous and unsanitary
    conditions. These things, like overcrowding, come from the sting of poverty.
    And so long as the poverty of which they are the expression is left untouched,
    restrictions such as you indorse can have only partial and evanescent results.
    The cause remaining, repression in one place can only bring out its effects
    in other places, and the task you assign to the state is as hopeless as to
    ask it to lower the level of the ocean by bailing out the sea.</p>
  <p>Nor can the state cure poverty by regulating wages. It is as much beyond
    the power of the state to regulate wages as it is to regulate the rates of
    interest. Usury laws have been tried again and again, but the only effect
    they have ever had has been to increase what the poorer borrowers must pay,
    and for the same reasons that all attempts to lower by regulation the price
    of goods have always resulted merely in increasing them. The general rate
    of wages is fixed by the ease or difficulty with which labor can obtain access
    to land, ranging from the full earnings of labor, where land is free, to
    the least on which laborers can live and reproduce, where land is fully monopolized.
    Thus, where it has been comparatively easy for laborers to get land, as in
    the United States and in Australasia, wages have been higher than in Europe
    and it has been impossible to get European laborers to work there for wages
    that they would gladly accept at home; while as monopolization goes on under
    the influence of private property in land, wages tend to fall, and the social
    conditions of Europe to appear. Thus, under the partial yet substantial recognition
    of common rights to land, of which I have spoken, the many attempts of the
    British Parliament to reduce wages by regulation failed utterly. And so,
    when the institution of private property in land had done its work in England,
    all attempts of Parliament to raise wages proved unavailing. In the beginning
    of this century it was even attempted to increase the earnings of laborers
    by grants in aid of wages. But the only result was to lower commensurately
    what wages employers paid.</p>
  <p>The state could maintain wages above the tendency of the market (for as
    I have shown labor deprived of land becomes a commodity), only by offering
    employment to all who wish it; or by lending its sanction to strikes and
    supporting them with its funds. Thus it is, that the thoroughgoing socialists
    who want the state to take all industry into its hands are much more logical
    than those timid socialists who propose that the state should regulate private
    industry &#8212; but only a little.</p>
  <p>The same hopelessness attends your suggestion that working-people should
    be encouraged by the state in obtaining a share of the land. It is evident
    that by this you mean that, as is now being attempted in Ireland, the state
    shall buy out large landowners in favor of small ones, establishing what
    are known as peasant proprietors. Supposing that this can be done even to
    a considerable extent, what will be accomplished save to substitute a larger
    privileged class for a smaller privileged class? What will be done for the
    still larger class that must remain, the laborers of the agricultural districts,
    the workmen of the towns, the proletarians of the cities? Is it not true,
    as Professor De Laveleye says, that in such countries as Belgium, where peasant
    proprietary exists, the tenants, for there still exist tenants, are rack-rented
    with a mercilessness unknown in Ireland? Is it not true that in such countries
    as Belgium the condition of the mere laborer is even worse than it is in
    Great Britain, where large ownerships obtain? And if the state attempts to
    buy up land for peasant proprietors will not the effect be, what is seen
    today in Ireland, to increase the market value of land and thus make it more
    difficult for those not so favored, and for those who will come after, to
    get land? How, moreover, on the principle which you declare (36), that &#8220;to
    the state the interests of all are equal, whether high or low,&#8221; will
    you justify state aid to one man to buy a bit of land without also insisting
    on state aid to another man to buy a donkey, to another to buy a shop, to
    another to buy the tools and materials of a trade &#8212; state aid in short
    to everybody who may be able to make good use of it or thinks that he could?
    And are you not thus landed in communism &#8212; not the communism of the
    early Christians and of the religious orders, but communism that uses the
    coercive power of the state to take rightful property by force from those
    who have, to give to those who have not? For the state has no purse of Fortunatus;
    the state cannot repeat the miracle of the loaves and fishes; all that the
    state can give, it must get by some form or other of the taxing power. And
    whether it gives or lends money, or gives or lends credit, it cannot give
    to those who have not, without taking from those who have.</p>
  <p>But aside from all this, any scheme of dividing up land while maintaining
    private property in land is futile. Small holdings cannot coexist with the
    treatment of land as private property where civilization is materially advancing
    and wealth augments. We may see this in the economic tendencies that in ancient
    times were the main cause that transformed world-conquering Italy from a
    land of small farms to a land of great estates. We may see it in the fact
    that while two centuries ago the majority of English farmers were owners
    of the land they tilled, tenancy has been for a long time the all but universal
    condition of the English farmer. And now the mighty forces of steam and electricity
    have come to urge concentration. It is in the United States that we may see
    on the largest scale how their power is operating to turn a nation of landowners
    into a nation of tenants. The principle is clear and irresistible. Material
    progress makes land more valuable, and when this increasing value is left
    to private owners land must pass from the ownership of the poor into the
    ownership of the rich, just as diamonds so pass when poor men find them.
    What the British government is attempting in Ireland is to build snow-houses
    in the Arabian desert! to plant bananas in Labrador!</p>
  <p>There is one way, and only one way, in which working-people in our civilization
    may be secured a share in the land of their country, and that is the way
    that we propose &#8212; the taking of the profits of landownership for the
    community.</p>
  <p>As to working-men&#8217;s associations, what your Holiness seems to contemplate
    is the formation and encouragement of societies akin to the Catholic sodalities,
    and to the friendly and beneficial societies, like the Odd Fellows, which
    have had a large extension in English-speaking countries. Such associations
    may promote fraternity, extend social intercourse and provide assurance in
    case of sickness or death, but if they go no further they are powerless to
    affect wages even among their members. As to trades-unions proper, it is
    hard to define your position, which is, perhaps, best stated as one of warm
    approbation provided that they do not go too far. For while you object to
    strikes; while you reprehend societies that &#8220;do their best to get into
    their hands the whole field of labor and to force working-men either to join
    them or to starve;&#8221; while you discountenance the coercing of employers
    and seem to think that arbitration might take the place of strikes; yet you
    use expressions and assert principles that are all that the trades-unionist
    would ask, not merely to justify the strike and the boycott, but even the
    use of violence where only violence would suffice. For you speak of the insufficient
    wages of workmen as due to the greed of rich employers; you assume the moral
    right of the workman to obtain employment from others at wages greater than
    those others are willing freely to give; and you deny the right of any one
    to work for such wages as he pleases, in such a way as to lead Mr. Stead,
    in so widely read a journal as the Review of Reviews, approvingly to declare
    that you regard &#8220;blacklegging,&#8221; i.e., the working for less than
    union wages, as a crime.</p>
  <p>To men conscious of bitter injustice, to men steeped in poverty yet mocked
    by flaunting wealth, such words mean more than I can think you realize.</p>
  <p>When fire shall be cool and ice be warm, when armies shall throw away lead
    and iron, to try conclusions by the pelting of rose-leaves, such labor associations
    as you are thinking of may be possible. But not till then. For labor associations
    can do nothing to raise wages but by force. It may be force applied passively,
    or force applied actively, or force held in reserve, but it must be force.
    They must coerce or hold the power to coerce employers; they must coerce
    those among their own members disposed to straggle; they must do their best
    to get into their hands the whole field of labor they seek to occupy and
    to force other working-men either to join them or to starve. Those who tell
    you of trades-unions bent on raising wages by moral suasion alone are like
    those who would tell you of tigers that live on oranges.</p>
  <p>The condition of the masses today is that of men pressed together in a hall
    where ingress is open and more are constantly coming, but where the doors
    for egress are closed. If forbidden to relieve the general pressure by throwing
    open those doors, whose bars and bolts are private property in land, they
    can only mitigate the pressure on themselves by forcing back others, and
    the weakest must be driven to the wall. This is the way of labor-unions and
    trade-guilds. Even those amiable societies that you recommend would in their
    efforts to find employment for their own members necessarily displace others.</p>
  <p>For even the philanthropy which, recognizing the evil of trying to help
    labor by alms, seeks to help men to help themselves by finding them work,
    becomes aggressive in the blind and bitter struggle that private property
    in land entails, and in helping one set of men injures others. Thus, to minimize
    the bitter complaints of taking work from others and lessening the wages
    of others in providing their own beneficiaries with work and wages, benevolent
    societies are forced to devices akin to the digging of holes and filling
    them up again. Our American societies feel this difficulty, General Booth
    encounters it in England, and the Catholic societies which your Holiness
    recommends must find it, when they are formed.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness knows of, and I am sure honors, the princely generosity of
    Baron Hirsch toward his suffering coreligionists. But, as I write, the New
    York newspapers contain accounts of an immense meeting held in Cooper Union,
    in this city, on the evening of Friday, September 4, in which a number of
    Hebrew trades-unions protested in the strongest manner against the loss of
    work and reduction of wages that are being effected by Baron Hirsch&#8217;s
    generosity in bringing their own countrymen here and teaching them to work.
    The resolution unanimously adopted at this great meeting thus concludes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We now demand of Baron Hirsch himself that he release us from his &#8220;charity&#8221; and
        take back the millions, which, instead of a blessing, have proved a curse
        and a source of misery.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Nor does this show that the members of these Hebrew labor-unions &#8212; who
    are themselves immigrants of the same class as those Baron Hirsch is striving
    to help, for in the next generation they lose with us their distinctiveness &#8212; are
    a whit less generous than other men.</p>
  <p>Labor associations of the nature of trade-guilds or unions are necessarily
    selfish; by the law of their being they must fight for their own hand, regardless
    of who is hurt; they ignore and must ignore the teaching of Christ that we
    should do to others as we would have them do to us, which a true political
    economy shows is the only way to the full emancipation of the masses. They
    must do their best to starve workmen who do not join them, they must by all
    means in their power force back the &#8220;blackleg&#8221; &#8212; as the
    soldier in battle must shoot down his mother&#8217;s son if in the opposing
    ranks. And who is the blackleg? A fellow-creature seeking work &#8212; a
    fellow-creature in all probability more pressed and starved than those who
    so bitterly denounce him, and often with the hungry pleading faces of wife
    and child behind him.</p>
  <p>And, in so far as they succeed, what is it that trade-guilds and unions
    do but to impose more restrictions on natural rights; to create &#8220;trusts&#8221; in
    labor; to add to privileged classes other somewhat privileged classes; and
    to press the weaker closer to the wall?</p>
  <p>I speak without prejudice against trades-unions, of which for years I was
    an active member. And in pointing out to your Holiness that their principle
    is selfish and incapable of large and permanent benefits, and that their
    methods violate natural rights and work hardship and injustice, I am only
    saying to you what, both in my books and by word of mouth, I have said over
    and over again to them. Nor is what I say capable of dispute. Intelligent
    trades-unionists know it, and the less intelligent vaguely feel it. And even
    those of the classes of wealth and leisure who, as if to head off the demand
    for natural rights, are preaching trades-unionism to working-men, must needs
    admit it.</p>
  <p>Your Holiness will remember the great London dock strike of two years ago,
    which, with that of other influential men, received the moral support of
    that Prince of the Church whom we of the English speech hold higher and dearer
    than any prelate has been held by us since the blood of Thomas &agrave; Becket
    stained the Canterbury altar.</p>
  <p>In a volume called &#8220;<em>The Story of the Dockers&#8217; Strike</em>,&#8221; written
    by Messrs. H. Llewellyn Smith and Vaughan Nash, with an introduction by Sydney
    Buxton, M.P., which advocates trades-unionism as the solution of the labor
    question, and of which a large number were sent to Australia as a sort of
    official recognition of the generous aid received from there by the strikers,
    I find in the summing up, on pages 164-165, the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If the settlement lasts, work at the docks will be more regular, better
        paid, and carried on under better conditions than ever before. All this
      will be an unqualified gain to those who get the benefit from it. But another
        result will undoubtedly be to contract the field of employment and lessen
        the number of those for whom work can be found. The lower-class casual
      will,
        in the end, find his position more precarious than ever before, in proportion
        to the increased regularity of work which the &#8220;fitter&#8221; of the
        laborers will secure. The effect of the organization of dock labor, as of
        all classes of labor, will be to squeeze out the residuum. The loafer, the
        cadger, the failure in the industrial race &#8212; the members of &#8220;Class
        B&#8221; of Mr. Charles Booth&#8217;s hierarchy of social classes &#8212; will
        be no gainers by the change, but will rather find another door closed
        against them, and this in many cases the last door to employment.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I am far from wishing that your Holiness should join in that pharisaical
    denunciation of trades-unions common among those who, while quick to point
    out the injustice of trades-unions in denying to others the equal right to
    work, are themselves supporters of that more primary injustice that denies
    the equal right to the standing-place and natural material necessary to work.
    What I wish to point out is that trades-unionism, while it may be a partial
    palliative, is not a remedy; that it has not that moral character which could
    alone justify one in the position of your Holiness in urging it as good in
    itself. Yet, so long as you insist on private property in land what better
    can you do?</p>
