Irish Famine of '46 is example

landlords would have their rents in spite of famine and in defiance of

it. Had the people of Ireland been the landlords of Ireland, not a

  <p>Many Americans can trace their roots to at least one ancestor who came here
    from Ireland. Henry George wrote a long piece on what he called &quot;The Irish
    Land Question.&quot;
    Later, it was republished under the title <em>The Land Question</em>. Indeed, in the
    original, George made the point that there was nothing unique about what was
    going on in
    Ireland, just that it was easier to see the dynamics there than it might be
    in other places. This might give those whose ancestors left Ireland some additional
    perspective -- but should be equally relevant for most of us with immigrant
  ancestors.</p>

<p>Henry George:&nbsp; <a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
Irish Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a
 href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/George/what_the_railroad_will_bring_us.html">    </a>... It is the fashion of Land League orators and sympathizing
    newspapers in this country to talk as if the distress and disquiet in
    Ireland were wholly due to political oppression, and our national
    House of Representatives recently passed, by unanimous vote, a
    resolution which censured England for her treatment of Ireland. But,
    while it is indeed true that Ireland has been deeply wronged and
    bitterly oppressed by England, it is not true that there is any
    economic oppression of Ireland by England now. To whatever cause
    Irish distress may be due, it is certainly not due to the existence
    of laws which press on industry more heavily in Ireland than in any
    other part of the United Kingdom. <br>
    <br>
    And, further than this, the Irish land system, which is so much
    talked of as though it were some peculiarly atrocious system, is
    essentially the same land system which prevails in all civilized
    countries, which we of the United States have accepted
    unquestioningly, and have extended over the whole temperate zone of a
    new continent &#8211; the same system which all over the civilized world
  men are accustomed to consider natural and just.<strong> ...</strong>  </p>
  <p>And as to the United States, let me ask the men who to applauding
    audiences are nightly comparing the freedom of America with the
    oppression of Ireland &#8211; let me ask the Representatives who voted
    for the resolution of sympathy with Ireland, this simple question:
    What would the Irish landlords lose, what would the Irish tenants
    gain, if tomorrow, Ireland were made a State in the American Union
    and American law substituted for English law?</p>
  <p>I think it will puzzle them to reply. The truth is that the gain
    would be to the landlords, the loss to the tenants. The simple truth
    is that, under our laws, the Irish landlords could rack-rent,
    distrain, evict, or absent themselves, as they pleased, and without
    any restriction from Ulster tenant-right or legal requirement of
    compensation for improvements. Under our laws they could, just as
    freely as they can now, impose whatever terms they pleased upon their
    tenants &#8211; whether as to cultivation, as to improvements, as to
    game, as to marriages, as to voting, or as to anything else. For
    these powers do not spring from special laws. They are merely
    incident to the right of property; they result simply from the
    acknowledgment of the right of the owner of land to do as he pleases
    with his own &#8211; to let it, or not let it. So far as law can give
    them to him, every American landlord has these powers as fully as any
    Irish landlord. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cannot the American owner of land make, in letting
      it, any stipulation he pleases as to how it shall be used, or
      improved, or cultivated? </li>
    <li>Can he not reserve any of his own rights
      upon it, such as the right of entry, or of cutting wood, or shooting
      game, or catching fish? </li>
    <li>And, in the absence of special agreement,
      does not American law give him, what the law of Ireland does not now
      give him, the ownership at the expiration of the lease of all the
      improvements made by the tenant? </li>
    <li>What single power has the Irish
      landowner that the American landowner has not as fully?</li>
    <li>Is not the
      American landlord just as free as is the Irish landlord to refuse to
      rent his lands or his houses to any one who does not attend a certain
      church or vote a certain ticket? Is he not quite as free to do this
      as he is free to refuse his contributions to all but one particular
      benevolent society or political committee? </li>
    <li>Or, if, not liking a
      certain newspaper, he chooses to give notice to quit to any tenant
      whom he finds taking that newspaper, what law can be invoked to
      prevent him? There is none. The property is his, and he can let it,
      or not let it, as he wills. And, having this power to let or not let,
      he has power to demand any terms he pleases.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The truth is that the Irish land system is simply the general
    system of modern civilization. In no essential feature does it differ
    from the system that obtains here &#8211; in what we are accustomed to
    consider the freest country under the sun. Entails and primogeniture
    and family settlements may be in themselves bad things, and may
    sometimes interfere with putting the land to its best use, but their
    effects upon the relations of landlord and tenant are not worth
    talking about. As for rack-rent, which is simply a rent fixed at
    short intervals by competition, that is in the United States even a
    more common way of letting land than in Ireland. In our cities the
    majority of our people live in houses rented from month to month or
    year to year for the highest price the landlord thinks he can get.
    The usual term, in the newer States, at least, for the letting of
    agricultural land is from season to season. And that the rent of land
    in the United States comes, on the whole, more closely to the
    standard of rack, or full competition rent, there can be, I think,
    little doubt. That the land of Ireland is, as the apologists for
    landlordism say, largely under-rented (that is, not rented for the
    full amount the landlord might get with free competition) is probably
    true. Miss C. G. O'Brien, in a recent article in the Nineteenth
    Century, states that the tenant-farmers generally get for such
    patches as they sub-let to their laborers twice the rent they pay the
    landlords. And we hear incidentally of many "good landlords," i.e.,
    landlords not in the habit of pushing their tenants for as much as
    they might get by rigorously demanding all that any one would
    give. <strong>...</strong><br>
    <br>
    ... it is best that the truth be fully stated and clearly recognized.
    He who sees the truth, let him proclaim it, without asking who is for
    it or who is against it. This is not radicalism in the bad sense
    which so many attach to the word. This is conservatism in the true
    sense.
  </p>
  <p>What gives to the Irish Land Question its supreme significance is
    that it brings into attention and discussion &#8211; nay, that it forces
    into attention and discussion, not a mere Irish question, but a
    question of world-wide importance. <strong>...</strong></p>
  <p>What has brought the land question to the front in Ireland, what
    permits the relation between land and labor to be seen there with
    such distinctness &#8211; to be seen even by those who cannot in other
    places perceive them &#8211; is certain special conditions. Ireland is a
    country of dense population, so that competition for the use of land
    is so sharp and high as to produce marked effects upon the
    distribution of wealth. It is mainly an agricultural country so that
    production is concerned directly and unmistakably with the soil. Its
    industrial organization is largely that simple one in which an
    employing capitalist does not mind between laborer and landowner, so
    that the connection between rent and wages is not obscured. Ireland,
    moreover, was never conquered by the Romans, nor, until comparatively
    recently, by any people who had felt in their legal system the effect
    of Roman domination. It is the European country in which primitive
    ideas as to land tenures have longest held their sway, and the
    circumstances of its conquest, its cruel misgovernment, and the
    differences of race and religion between the masses of the people and
    those among whom the land was parceled, have tended to preserve old
    traditions and to direct the strength of Irish feeling and the fervor
    of Irish imagination against a system which forces the descendant of
    the ancient possessors of the soil to pay tribute for it to the
    representative of a hated stranger. It is for these reasons that the
    connection between Irish distress and Irish landlordism is so easily
    seen and readily realized.

  Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
  of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;
Poverty! Can there be any doubt of its cause? Go, into the old
countries &#8212; go into western Ireland, into the highlands of Scotland &#8212;
these are purely primitive communities. There you will find people as
poor as poor can be &#8212; living year after year on oatmeal or on potatoes,
and often going hungry. I could tell you many a pathetic story.
Speaking to a Scottish physician who was telling me how this diet was
inducing among these people a disease similar to that which from the
same cause is ravaging Italy (the Pellagra), I said to him: "There is
plenty of fish; why don't they catch fish? There is plenty of game; I
know the laws are against it, but cannot they take it on the sly?"
"That," he said, "never enters their heads. Why, if a man was even
suspected of having a taste for trout or grouse he would have to leave
at once."</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is no difficulty in discovering what makes those people
poor. They have no right to anything that nature gives them. All they
can make above a living they must pay to the landlord. They not only
have to pay for the land that they use, but they have to pay for the
seaweed that comes ashore and for the turf they dig from the bogs. They
dare not improve, for any improvements they make are made an excuse for
putting up the rent. These people who work hard live in hovels, and the
landlords, who do not work at all&#8212;oh! they live in luxury in London or
Paris. If they have hunting boxes there, why they are magnificent
castles as compared with the hovels in which the men live who do the
work. Is there any question as to the cause of poverty there?&nbsp; ...

    Reform Meeting at the Liverpool Rotunda </a>(1889)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is the old, old story! And no wonder, for property in land is just as
    absurd! just as monstrous as property in human beings. (Hear, hear, and cheers)
    What
      difference does it make whether you enslave a man by making his flesh and
    blood the property of another, or whether you enslave him by making the property
      of another that element on which and from which he must live if he is to
    live
      at all? (A voice: &quot;None whatever!&quot; and cheers)</p>
  <p>Why, in those old days slave ships used to set out from this town of Liverpool
      for the coast of Africa to buy slaves. They did not bring them to Liverpool;
      they took them over to America. Why? Because you people were so good, and
    the Englishmen who had got to the other side of the Atlantic, and had settled
    there,
      were so bad? Not at all. I will tell you why the Liverpool ships carried
    slaves to America and did not bring them back to England. Because in America
    population
      was sparse and land was plentiful. Therefore to rob a man of his labor &#8212; and
      that is what the slaveowner wanted the slave for &#8212; you had got to catch
      and hold the man. That is the reason the slaves went to America. The reason
      they did not come here, the reason they were not carried over to Ireland was
      that here population was relatively dense, land was relatively scarce and could
      easily be monopolized, and to get out of the laborer all that his labor could
      furnish, save only wages enough to keep him alive even the slaveowner had to
      give this &#8212; it was only necessary to own land.</p>
  <p>What is the difference, economically speaking, between the slaves of South
      Carolina, Missouri, Mississippi, and Georgia and the free peasantry of
    Ireland or the agricultural laborer of England? (Cheers) Go to one of those
    slave states
      in the slave days, and there you would find a planter, the owner of five
    hundred slaves, living in elegant luxury, without doing a stroke of work,
    having a
      fine mansion, horses, [and a] carriage &#8212; all the things that work
      produces, but doing none of it himself. The people who did the work were
      living in negro
      huts, on coarse food; they were clothed in coarse raiment. If they ran
      away, he had the privilege of chasing them back, tying them up and whipping
      them
      and making them work.</p>
  <p>Come to this side of the Atlantic, in a place where you saw the same state
      of development. There you found also five hundred people living in little cabins,
      eating coarse food, clothed in coarse raiment, working hard, yet getting only
      enough of the things that work produces to keep them in good times, when bad
      times came having to appeal to the world for charity. But you found among those
      little cabins, too, the lordly mansion of the man who did no work. (Hear, hear,
      and groans)</p>
  <p>You found the mansion; you did not often find the man. (Laughter and cheers)
      As a general rule he was off in London, or in Paris, enjoying himself on the
      fruits of their labor. (Hear, hear) He had no legal right to make them work
      for him. Oh! no. If they ran away he could not put bloodhounds on their track
      and bring them back and whip them; but he had, in hunger, in starvation, a
      ban dog40 more swift, more keen, more sure than the bloodhound of the south.
      (Cheers)</p>
  <p>The slaveowner of the south &#8212; the owner of men &#8212; had to make those
      men work for him. He went to all that trouble. The landlord of Ireland did
      not have to make men work for him. He owned the land, and without land men
      cannot work; and so men would come to him &#8212; equal children of the Creator,
      equal citizens of Great Britain &#8212; would come to him, with their hats
      in their hands, and beg to be allowed to live on his land, to be allowed
      to work and to give to him all the produce of their work, except enough
      to merely
      keep them alive, and thank him for the privilege. . . . ... <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">read

How has labour got the land when it
was much further off? Irish labourers have gone some 3,000 miles
across the sea; and then in many cases 1,000 miles further west, by
saving or by borrowing some member of the family has gone across, and
their earnings have constituted an emigration fund for the rest of
the family. That great emigration has been going on all these years,
not by capital supplied by the Government, but by capital earned by
the strong arm of labour. (Applause.) The whole development of the
United States, the whole development of every new country, proves the
fallacy of this assertion that labour cannot employ itself without
capital, and proves the fallacy of the assertion, that the opening of
land to labour would do nothing to improve wages. Go into a new
country where land is free; go into a country where the price of land
is not yet high, and there, you will find no such thing as an
unemployed man; there you will find no such thing as a man begging
for employment as though it were a boon. (Hear, hear.)&nbsp; ... <a

... The people of Ireland are now keenly alive to the important fact
that if they are loyal and true to themselves, and that they set
their faces against every form of violence and crime, they have the
power to compel the landlords to surrender all their just rights in
their entirety.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the tenant farmers refuse to
pay more than a just rent for
their farms, and no one takes a farm from which a tenant has been
evicted for the non-payment of an unjust or exorbitant rent, then our
cause is practically gained. The landlords may, no doubt, wreak their
vengeance on a few, whom they may regard as the leaders of the
movement; but the patriotism and generosity of their countrymen will
compensate these abundantly for their losses, and superabundantly
reward them for the essential and important services they have
rendered to their country at the critical period of its history.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You know but too well, and
perhaps to your cost, that there are
bad landlords in Meath, and worse still in Westmeath, and perhaps
also in the other Counties of this Diocese. We are, unfortunately,
too familiar with all forms of extermination, from the eviction of a
Parish Priest, who was willing to pay his rent, to the wholesale
clearance of the honest, industrious people of an entire district.
But we have, thank God, a few good landlords, too. Some of these,
like the Earl of Fingal, belong to our own faith; some, like the late
Lord Athlumny, are Protestants; and some among the very best are
Tories of the highest type of conservatism.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>You have always cherished feelings
of the deepest gratitude and
affection for every landlord, irrespective of his politics or his
creed, who treated you with justice, consideration and kindness. I
have always heartily commended you for these feelings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For my own part, I can assure you,
I entertain no unfriendly
feelings for any landlord living, and in this Essay I write of them
not as individuals, but as a class, and further, I freely admit that
there are individual landlords who are highly honourable exceptions
to the class to which they belong. But that I heartily dislike the
existing system of Land Tenure, and the frightful extent to which it
has been abused, by the vast majority of landlords, will be evident
to anyone who reads this Essay through. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Human Slavery Once Generally
Accepted.</b>
</small><br>
<small>Slavery is found to have existed, as a social institution, in
almost all nations, civilised as well as barbarous, and in every age
of the world, up almost to our own times. We hardly ever find it in
the state of a merely passing phenomenon, or as a purely temporary
result of conquest or of war, but always as a settled, established
and recognised state of social existence, in which generation
followed generation in unbroken succession, and in which thousands
upon thousands of human beings lived and died. Hardly anyone had the
public spirit to question its character or to denounce its excesses;
it had no struggle to make for its existence, and the degradation in
which it held its unhappy victims was universally regarded as nothing
worse than a mere sentimental grievance.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On the other hand, the justice of
the right of property which a
master claimed in his slaves was universally accepted in the light of
a first principle of morality. His slaves were either born on his
estate, and he had to submit to the labour and the cost of rearing
and maintaining them to manhood, or he acquired them by inheritance
or by free gift, or, failing these, he acquired them by the right of
purchase -- having paid in exchange for them what, according to the
usages of society and the common estimation of his countrymen, was
regarded as their full pecuniary value. Property, therefore, in
slaves was regarded as sacred, and as inviolable as any other species
of property.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Even Christians Recognised
Slavery.</b>
</small><br>
<small>So deeply rooted and so universally received was this conviction
that the Christian religion itself, though it recognised no
distinction between Jew and Gentile, between slave or freeman,
cautiously abstained from denouncing slavery itself as an injustice
or a wrong. It prudently tolerated this crying evil, because in the
state of public feeling then existing, and at the low standard of
enlightenment and intelligence then prevailing, it was simply
impossible to remedy it.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus then had slavery come down
almost to our own time as an
established social institution, carrying with it the practical
sanction and approval of ages and nations, and surrounded with a
prestige of standing and general acceptance well calculated to
recommend it to men's feelings and sympathies. And yet it was the
embodiment of the most odious and cruel injustice that ever afflicted
humanity. To claim a right of property in man was to lower a rational
creature to the level of the beast of the field; it was a revolting
and an unnatural degradation of the nobility of human nature
itself.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That thousands upon thousands of
human beings who had committed no
crime, who had violated no law, and who had done no wrong to anyone,
should be wantonly robbed of their liberty and freedom; should be
deprived of the sacred and inalienable moral rights, which they could
not voluntarily abdicate themselves; should be bought and sold, like
cattle in the markets; and should be worked to death, or allowed to
live on at the whim or caprice of their owner, was the last and most
galling injustice which human nature could be called on to
endure.</small></p>

    <small>To arrest public attention, and fix its gaze effectively on the
  intrinsic character and constitution of slavery, was to seal its
  doom; and its death knell was sounded in the indignant cry of the
  great statesman who "denied that man could hold property in man." Twenty millions
  of British money were paid over to the slave owners as compensation for the
  loss of property to which they had no just
  title, and slavery was abolished forever.</small>    </p>
  <p><small>The practical approval, therefore, which the world has bestowed
      on
      a social institution that has lasted for centuries is no proof that
      it ought to be allowed to live on longer, if, on close examination,
      it be found to be intrinsically unjust and cruel, and mischievous and
      injurious besides to the general good of mankind. No amount of
      sanction or approval that the world can give to a social institution
      can alter its intrinsic constitution and nature; and the fact of the
      world's having thus approved of an institution which was essentially
      unjust, cruel and degrading to human nature, only proves that the
      world was wrong: it furnishes no arguments or justification for
      allowing it to live on a moment longer.

    <small><b>Irish Land Tenure the Twin Sister of Slavery</b>.
    </small><br>
    <small>The system of Land Tenure in Ireland enjoyed a long and
      similarly
      prosperous career, and it, too, has created a state of human
      existence, which, in strict truth and justice, can be briefly
      characterised as the twin sister of slavery. The vast majority of
      tenant farmers of Ireland are at the present moment slaves. They are
      dependent for their peace of mind, for their material comforts, for
      the privilege of living under the roof beneath which they were born,
      and for the right of earning their bread on the farms which their
      forefathers enriched with their toil, on the arbitrary and
    irresponsible will of their landlord.</small></p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Abject, absolute and degrading
dependence of this kind involves
the very essence, and is, in fact, the definition of slavery. They
toil like galley slaves in the cultivation of their farms from the
opening to the close of the year, only to see substantially the whole
produce of their labour and capital appropriated by others who have
not toiled at all, and who even leave them not what would be allowed
for the maintenance of slaves who would be expected to work, but what
hardly suffices to keep them from dying of want.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When grazing on land had been
found more remunerative than
tillage, and the people consequently became too numerous, the
superfluous multitudes, who were now no longer wanted under the new
state of things, were mercilessly cleared off the lands by wholesale
evictions to make room for the brute beast, which paid better. Such
of the evicted as had the means left to take themselves away were
forced to fly for refuge as exiles into almost every land; and the
thousands who could not leave were coolly passed on through hunger
and starvation to premature graves.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let anyone who wishes visit this
Diocese and see with his own eyes
the vast and boundless extent of the fairest land in Europe that has
been ruthlessly depopulated since the commencement of the present
century, and which is now abandoned to a loneliness and solitude more
depressing than that of the prairie or the wilderness. Thus has this
land system actually exercised the power of life and death on a vast
scale, for which there is no parallel even in the dark records of
slavery.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the attention of the civilised
world is now steadily fixed on
the cruel and degrading bondage in which it still holds a nation
enslaved, and therefore its doom is inevitably sealed. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><b>The Landlord the Greatest
  Burden on the Land.</b>
    </small><br>
    <small>The land is a commodity that strictly belongs to this class. It
  is
  limited in extent, and no human power can enlarge or extend its area.
  The competition for it is excessive, the competitors struggling for
  its attainment -- not for the purpose of satisfying a taste for the
  fine arts, or to gratify a passion for the rare or beautiful, but to
  secure a necessary means of existence: for they must live on and by
  the land, or they cannot live at all. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The owner, therefore, of that
  land can put on it any rent he pleases, and the poor people competing
  for it have no choice but to accept his terms or die in a ditch or a
  poorhouse. Under the present system of Land Tenure, the owners are
  not only enabled, but actually exact for the use of the land the last
  shilling the tenant is able to pay, leaving him only what is barely
  sufficient to keep him from dying.</span></small>    </p>
  <p><small>Mr. Mill, who is the highest of all authorities on this subject,
      thus writes on the letting of land as it is actually carried out in
      Ireland: "With individual exceptions (some of them very honourable
      ones) the owners of Irish estates do nothing for the land but drain
      it of its produce. What has been epigrammatically said in the
      discussions on 'peculiar burdens' is literally true when applied to
      them, that the greatest 'burden' on the land is the landlords.
      Returning nothing to the soil, they consume its whole produce, minus
      the potatoes strictly necessary to keep the inhabitants from dying of
      famine." ... </small>    <small><a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html"><span

the natural element necessary to all, the natural element that was
made by the Creator for the use of all, the property of some of the
people, that great wrong that in every civilized country disinherited
the mass of men of the bounty of their Creator. What we aim at is not
the increase in the number of a privileged class, not making some
thousands of earth owners into some more thousands. No, no; what we
aim at is to secure the natural and God-given right to the humblest
in the community--to secure to every child born in Ireland, or in any
other country, his natural right to the equal use of his native
land.&nbsp;

<p>Albert Jay Nock &#8212; <a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">Henry George: Unorthodox
    American</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ireland at that time was front-page news on every paper printed in the English
      language. Parnell and Dillon crossed the ocean, spoke in sixty-two American
      cities, addressed the House of Representatives, and took away a great fund
      of American dollars wherewith to fight the battles of the rack-rented Irish
      tenant. They were followed by the best man in the movement, Michael Davitt,
      who came over late in 1880 to tend the fire that Parnell and Dillon had
    kindled. George met him and got him &#8220;under conviction,&#8221; as the
    revivalists say, and then wrote a pamphlet entitled &#8220;<a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
      Irish Land Question; what it involves, and how alone it can be settled.</a>&#8221;</p>
  <p>From that moment Henry George was, in the good sense of the term, a made
    man. The pamphlet was a masterpiece of polemics, a call to action, and a
    prophecy,
      all in one. Published simultaneously in America and England, it had an
    immense success. George was amazed at the space it got in the Eastern papers. &#8220;The
      astonishing thing,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;is the goodness of the comments...
      I am getting famous, if I am not making money.&#8221; It is hard to see how
      a man who had ever done a day&#8217;s work on a newspaper could write in
      that unimaginative way. With Irish influence as strong as it was on the
      Eastern
      seaboard, and with every Irishman sitting up nights to curse the hated
      Sassenach landlords and their puppet government, how could the newspaper
      comments not
      be good? The Eastern papers simply knew which side their bread was buttered
      on.</p>
  <p>A rabble of charmed and vociferous Irish closed around the simple-hearted
      pamphleteer, probably not troubling themselves much about his philosophy of
      the Irish land question, but nevertheless all for him. He was against the government
      and against the landlords, and that was enough. In this they were like the
      vast majority of readers who were led to peck at <em>Progress and Poverty</em> because
      they had heard that the book voiced their discontent; probably not five
      per cent of them read it through, or were able to understand what they
      did read,
      but they were all for it nevertheless, and all for glorifying Henry George.
      The American branch of the Land League immediately put George on the lecture
      platform, and when the Irish troubles culminated in the imprisonment of
      Davitt, Dillon, Parnell, and O&#8217;Kelly, an Irish newspaper published
      in New York sent him to the seat of war as a correspondent.</p>
  <p>He reached Dublin, dogged by secret service men, and gave a public lecture
      with such effect that his audience went fairly wild. He wrote a friend
    that he had &#8220;the hardest work possible&#8221; to keep the crowd from
    unharnessing his cab-horse and dragging his carriage through the streets
    to his hotel. His
      reports to the <em>Irish World </em>got wide distribution. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HISTORY:
THE RISE AND FALL OF FEUDALISM</span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"To
be ignorant of what happened before you were born is to be ever a
child, for what is man's lifetime without the memory of past events
woven with those of earlier times?"</span> - Cicero (106 - 43 BC),
Roman orator, statesman and man of letters
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><br>
One of the main reasons for the decline and fall of the Roman Empire
was economic. It had been eaten from within by that very malaise that
curses us today: the appropriation of the land on the part of a
powerful, politically empowered elite to the exclusion of the rest. The
result was inevitable.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Who wants to
fight for land he does not own?
Certainly not the slaves who were doing the donkey work to support the
landowners of the decaying Roman Empire.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
When the barbarian tribes began to turn into civilised nations, they
realised that the privilege of controlling land had to be
counterweighted by extra duties like the costs of administration,
defence and the social services (education, health, hostelry etc.).</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">BALANCED FEUDALISM - GIVING AND
TAKING</span></small><br>
<small>Hence Feudalism. This social system, which lasted about seven
centuries
(far longer than either capitalism or socialism) consisted in an
exchange of services between king, nobility, the Church and the people.
Who did what?</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The king was the nominal owner of the land. This provided him with an
independent income, which allowed him (occasionally her) to govern. The
nobility were the actual occupiers of the various duchies, counties
etc. They controlled the land by taking part of the rent as
personal/family income and spending the rest in the services of
defence, administration and justice. The Church also occupied large
tracts of land, taking part of the rent for the upkeep of its
monasteries and spending the rest in the social services: education,
health, hostelry etc.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The people supported the system by working, mostly
agriculturally.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT SO NOBLE!</span></small><br>
<small>What broke the equilibrium was the nobility. Conventional
history books
gloat over the English barons demanding "freedom" from king John by
forcing him to append his seal to the famous Magna Charta. What they
don't explain is the type of freedom demanded. It was freedom from
duty, i.e. from spending the excess rent on administration and defence.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
In time, the nobility of other countries followed suit, but
administration and defence costs remained, gradually becoming the
responsibility of the king. Increasingly it was the people who had to
pay for such, by means of increasing taxation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Things deteriorated, but not too much while the social services
remained in the hands of Church bureaucracy. A dramatic slide for the
worse occurred when the king, unable to get sufficient income, had to
start selling his land to the nobility, the only people who had the
money to buy it.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT LAND GRAB</span></small><br>
<small>The trend continued. Henry VIII of England having run out of
land of
his own, confiscated Church lands while the nobility began the process
of enclosing more and more common land which forced the people either
to work in the large estates for bare subsistence or to starve outside
them.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Slavery, shown the door during the first millennium, re-entered through
the window during the second. There exist in fact two ways of unjustly
appropriating the work of others: either considering a human being as
private property, or preventing him from accessing land and its natural
resources, forcing the landless to work for whatever conditions
dictated to them by the exclusive holders of land. Philosophically it
is possible to distinguish between the two forms of slavery. For those
at the receiving end it makes little difference.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The process of enclosure was completed towards the end of the 18th
century. The landless, expelled from the commons where they had sought
refuge, had no choice but to pour into the cities, which at the time
were experiencing the Industrial Revolution.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
Conventional historians are only too ready to blame the Industrial
Revolution for the appalling social conditions of the workers, but keep
silent about the more plausible interpretation that it was the
Industrial Revolution which had actually saved those poor wretches from
starvation, however unwittingly.</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">HISTORY:
THE NEW SLAVERY</span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
Irish Famine of '46 is example and proof. The corn crops were
sufficient to feed the island. But the landlords would have their rents
in spite of famine and in defiance of fever. They took the whole
harvest and left hunger to those who raised it. Had the people of
Ireland been the landlords of Ireland, not a human creature would have
died of hunger, nor the failure of the potato been considered a matter
of any consequence."</span> - James Fintan Lalor, (1807 - 49), Irish
patriot
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>
The accursed social conditions of workers during the Industrial
Revolution naturally prompted many inquiries - in those days, the
connection between the enclosures and the Dickensian conditions in the
cities was much more apparent. ... </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Europe had serfdom. America, a
younger land, saw traditional slavery instituted afresh.</span>
Why were the African slaves not sent to Europe? - because Europe was
already full of such! H.M. Government indeed began enthusiastically to
transport its "surplus" population to Australia. The land there was
"free" in the sense that the militarily weak Aborigines could be
rendered landless with a few musket shots, much as the American Indians
would a few decades later.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">NO LAND = NO HOPE</span></small><br>
<small>At the time when Don Bosco was gathering his stray waifs thrown
onto
the streets of Turin by the same policy of forced landlessness, the
blight struck the Irish potato, sole crop of the landless there. Eight
million of them, expelled from their ancestral lands for the benefit of
a couple of a hundred absentee landlords, were being rack-rented to the
point of either starvation or emigration. Meanwhile, Ireland remained a
net food exporter!</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The Irish and later the Italians, both militarily weak, crossed the
Atlantic. The British, militarily strong, and thrown out of America
three generations earlier, found their opportunity in Africa. They
enclosed the land and forced the indigenous people to work for them
exactly along the same pattern as their English and Scottish landowner
forebears had done before. But they had another problem: a surplus
industrial production that the impoverished Britons could not buy for
lack of purchasing power. So what did they do? They went to "open up"
China, Korea and Japan, which reacted with Oriental swiftness and
cunning deception, filibuster and well-struck murderous blows.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
The American Civil War of 1861-65 dramatically exposed the difference
between the two forms of slavery. The economic victors were the
militarily defeated Confederates, who found that hired labour was a
great deal cheaper than having to feed, clothe, shelter and cure slaves.</small> <small>...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a
