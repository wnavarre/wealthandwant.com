<p align="left"><strong> &#8220;Free to Choose: A Conversation with Milton Friedman&#8221;</strong> &#8212; July
  2006: <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/imprimis/">http://www.hillsdale.edu/imprimis/</a> <font size="-1">The
  following is an edited transcript of a conversation between Hillsdale College
  President Larry Arnn and Milton Friedman, which took place on May 22, 2006,
  at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in San Francisco, California, during a two-day Hillsdale
  College National Leadership Seminar celebrating the 25th anniversary of Milton
  and Rose Friedman's book, <em>Free to Choose: A Personal Statement</em>. </font>excerpt: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><em><strong>LA:</strong> Let me ask you about demographic trends.
      Columnist Mark Steyn writes that in ten years, 40 percent of young men
      in the world are going to be living in oppressed Muslim countries. What
      do you think the effect of that is going to be?</em></p>
  <p><strong>MF:</strong> What happens will depend on whether we succeed in bringing
    some element of greater economic freedom to those Muslim countries. Just
    as India in 1955 had great but unrealized potential, I think the Middle East
    is in a similar situation today. In part this is because of the curse of
    oil. Oil has been a blessing from one point of view, but a curse from another.
    Almost every country in the Middle East that is rich in oil is a despotism.</p>
  <p><em><strong>LA:</strong> Why do you think that is so?</em></p>
  <p><strong>MF:</strong> One reason, and one reason only &#8212; the oil is
    owned by the governments in question. If that oil were privately owned and
    thus someone's private property, the political outcome would be freedom rather
    than tyranny. This is why <strong>I believe the first step following the
    2003 invasion of Iraq should have been the privatization of the oil fields.
    If the government had given every individual over 21 years of age equal shares
    in a corporation that had the right and responsibility to make appropriate
    arrangements with foreign oil companies for the purpose of discovering and
    developing Iraq's oil reserves, the oil income would have flowed in the form
    of dividends to the people &#8212; the shareholders &#8212; rather than into
    government coffers.</strong> This would have provided an income to the whole
    people of Iraq and thereby prevented the current disputes over oil between
    the Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, because oil income would have been distributed
    on an individual rather than a group basis.</p>
  <p><em><strong>LA:</strong> Many Middle Eastern societies have a kind of tribal
      or theocratic basis and long-held habits of despotic rule that make it
      difficult to establish a system of contract between strangers. Is it your
      view that the introduction of free markets in such places could overcome
      those obstacles?</em></p>
  <p>MF: Eventually, yes. I think that nothing is so important for freedom as
    recognizing in the law each individual's natural right to property, and giving
    individuals a sense that they own something that they're responsible for,
    that they have control over, and that they can dispose of.</p>

</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This relationship has been
demonstrated more empirically in a recent
study by the Urban Land Institute. The author concluded that, for
Portland Oregon,</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small>each additional mile [traveled]
  translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in
  locations command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile
  difference, all other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000
  in new home value.</small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>For a household in which
one worker
drives downtown (or at least to a more central location) to work, that
ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles annually, assuming 230
days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each day. Moreover, if
non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled that amount,
the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could mean a
higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
saved/spent.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(7)
</span></small></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That's the savings for living
closer to the urban center by ten miles.
If the urban resident has to rely upon a car nonetheless, subtracting
some $3,000 annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again
that much, and likely more, to own a car. Seven years ago James
Kunstler put the true costs along with other experts at about $6,100
annually.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(<small>8</small>)</span>
The American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000
miles in 2001 cost 51&cent; per mile or $7,650.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(9)</span></small> Even
that figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not those passed
on to society. One study calculated that the total costs of motor
vehicle transportation to our society equal approximately one-fourth of
our Gross Domestic Product (GDP)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(10)</span></small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(11)</span></small> put
another way, drivers paid only 10% of the true costs of their motor
vehicle use.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(12)</span></small></small>
<small>In
1991 road user fees totaled only about $33 billion whereas the true
costs to society were ten times that;</small></div>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The latter figures include
externalities like pollution and the costs
of highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their
engines so they pollute less, inflate their tires properly, and drive
more safely are not likely to change the reality that people are
forgetful and fallible. Regardless, pollution-free cars are not
available; people must drive to participate in this society. The
consequences of SO2, CO2, and ozone are no longer a matter of debate;
they are scientific fact. Despite frequent headlines about replacing
the internal combustion engine, all the realistic substitutes also rely
upon fossil fuel power directly or indirectly; solar powered cars are
far in the future, if at all, and also fail to deal with any
transition.&nbsp; ...&nbsp; However, if the direct pecuniary costs of
driving
increase in any substantial way, such as for an increase in motor fuel
as many experts forecast, there will surely be significant changes in
the tradeoffs involved in housing/transportation choices.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(14)</span></small> And
indeed a radical shift in the use of petroleum looms closely on the
horizon. The consensus view of most oil geologists is that worldwide
oil extraction will peak sometime in about 2009 or shortly thereafter,
then to fall off rather quickly. That graphic record and projection of
oil mining is shown in Figure 3.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(15)</span></small>
Making costs visible and linked to private personal behavior is one way
to ensure that transportation pays its own way -- if it isn't already
too late to save us.... <a

DIVIDENDS AND OIL RESOURCE RENTS</a><br>
<p><small> <b>Abstract:</b> Citizens of Alaska have been receiving
individual dividend checks from an oil rent trust fund since 1982.
Norway's citizens receive substantial social services and invest
oil rents in a permanent fund for the future. Nigeria has yet to
establish a similar fund for its oil revenue stream. This paper
explores the oil rent institutions of Alaska, Norway and Nigeria with
a focus on these questions: 
</small></p>
<ul>
  <li><small>Are citizen dividends from oil rent funds
currently or potentially a source of substantial basic income? <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are
oil rent funds the best source for citizen dividends or should CDs be
based on other types of resource rents?</small></li>
</ul>
<p><small>The paper recommends full use of information and communication
  technologies for transparency in extractive resource industries,
  that resource rent from non-renewable resources should be invested in
  socially and environmentally responsible ways and primarily in the
  needed transition to renewable energy based economies, and that oil
  and other non-renewable resource rent funds should transition towards
  capturing substantial resource rents from surface land site values
  (ground rent) and other permanent and sustainable sources of rent for
  possible distribution of citizen dividends. ...</small><span

<blockquote>
  <p>Sooner than Americans are likely to bear the real burden of global warming's
      environmental consequences, they are likely to experience the onset of price
      rises for petroleum. Experts are divided, but among those best insulated from
      the pressures of bias, there is increasing consensus that the peak of oil extraction
      worldwide will come sometime around 2010 if not sooner.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font> Rising
      prices will not induce greater supply; it will not change the fact that the
      world will have passed the point of most easily extracted oil and will enter
      a long and increasingly steep period of declining availability. It is rather
      a matter of physics: When it costs more in energy to bring oil from deep in
      the earth than what can be extracted, it is not worth the investment. Even
      the greater wealth of American society will not insulate it from world competition
      over what is a limited and fungible commodity. How this alters the calculations
      Americans make about where to live and work will increasingly depend on the
      price they are willing to pay for transportation service. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">Who Owns Southern California?</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major oil companies</span> loom large in
      California land. Their chains of gas stations on "hot" corners are their
      essential means for dominating the retail market. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Exxon, Shell,
  Mobil and Chevron</span> are the dominant sellers. Of these, only Chevron is
  a California Company, and that only means its headquarters are here. Directors
  and major stockholders may live anywhere.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">All oil firms overbought retail outlets in the
  gas station land rush of the 1960s, but closed stations are now profitably converted
  to other uses like mini-malls, drive-ins, etc. More important, these closed sites
  are preempted from competing sellers of gasoline. </span>With such market power
  it has been possible for the majors to reduce the number of stations and convert
  to the now-standard non-service "service" station. For a look at what "service" really
  meant until about 1970, see the service station episode in <em>Back to the
  Future</em>  with Michael J. Fox: it is of course exaggerated, but not as much as one might
  assume.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Acreages held or leased for oil and gas exploration
  and drilling are in the millions of acres per company. </span>No attempt is
  made here to list the California holdings, but in oil-prone areas like Kern
  County
  some major holders are Texaco, Shell, Arco, Chevron, and Tenneco. Often other
  valuable assets like <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">water and
  farmland and townsites </span>are acquired as incidents. Thus Tenneco, in acquiring
  Kern County Land Company, also gained nearly total control of the Kern River,
  including Isabella Dam and Reservoir, wholly financed
  by U.S. taxpayers. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">read the whole article</a></p>
