</small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We believe that the
opportunities that governments assign to
citizens should be assigned in ways that recognize the equal rights
of all. Governments should not enrich some persons at the expense
of, or to the exclusion of, others. </span>When governments must
assign
opportunities that cannot be made available to all, those to whom the
opportunities are assigned should be required to pay into the public
treasury, on an annual basis, an amount equal to what the
opportunities would have been worth to others.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For some opportunities this
principle is widely recognized. An
example would be the allocation of off-shore oil drilling rights. No
one says that governments should decide how much drilling rights each
oil company deserves, and pass the rights out without charge. It is
recognized that the value of these rights ought to accrue to the
public treasury, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">any company that
extracts the oil should be
obliged to pay, through an auction, what the rights it exercises
would have been worth to some other oil company. <span

principle should be applied to all opportunities that are assigned by
governments.</span></span></small></p>

NTIA's Comprehensive Policy Review of Use and Management of the Radio

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both on grounds of justice and
on grounds of efficiency, a market-based
system of allocating rights to use the radio frequency spectrum, with
public collection of the value of rights granted, is best. The right to
use the frequency spectrum is a scarce resource, whose value is derived
primarily from the mere existence of the spectrum and not from the
efforts of those who might be granted use. Thus the whole population
has equal respectable claims to use. But efficient use of the resource
requires exclusive assignment of frequencies within particular
geographical areas. Therefore justice is served by requiring those who
receive the privilege of use to compensate the rest of the population
for that privilege. <a href="../docs/Tideman_Spectrum.html"><span

Nic Tideman: <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html">The Case for Site
Value Rating</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Social Justice of Site Value
Rating</small><br>
<small>The Efficiency of Site Value Rating</small><br>
<small>How Valuations would be Made</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Both for reasons of social justice
and for reasons of economic
efficiency, site value rating deserves a continued place in the
programme of the Liberal Party.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of social justice is
founded on two understandings: first, that the value of land in the
absence of economic development is the common heritage of humanity,
and second, that increases in the rental value of land arising from
economic development and government expenditures should be collected
by governments to finance those activities. What is meant by "land"
is the unimproved value of sites and the value of extractable natural
resources such as North Sea oil. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While there may someday be
institutions capable of implementing a
recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on a worldwide
basis, in the absence of such institutions each nation should
implement a recognition that land within its boundaries is the common
heritage of its citizens. This is accomplished not by making the
nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government management of
all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations that
are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what the
rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an
unimproved condition.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The case for site value rating in
terms of economic efficiency is
founded on the fact that a tax on resources that are not produced by
human effort is one of the few sources of government revenue that
does not reduce incentives for people to be productive. Two other
revenue sources that have this virtue are taxes on other
government-granted privileges such as exclusive use of radio
frequencies and taxes on activities with harmful consequences, such
as polluting the air. An economy will be more efficient if revenue
sources that do not diminish productivity are employed to the
greatest possible extent before any use is made of taxes that impede
productivity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What makes a tax efficient is that
the amount of tax that is due
cannot be reduced by reducing productive activities. When incomes are
taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by working less.
They do so, and the productivity of the economy falls. When houses
are taxed, people can reduce the amount of taxes owed by building
fewer house and smaller houses. They do so, and the housing shortage
worsens. But when the unimproved value of land is taxed, there is no
resulting diminution in the quantity of land. Thus taxes can be
levied on land without diminishing the productivity of an economy.
And shifting taxes from other, destructive bases to land will improve
the productivity of an economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Subsequent sections explain in
more detail these social justice
and efficiency arguments for site value rating, describe procedures
for implementing such a tax system, and explain why a variety of
potential objections are without merit. <strong>... 
</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>How Valuations would
be Made</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Before describing the valuation
process, which employs auctions,
it is useful to discuss the concept of a "second-price auction." <b>A
second price auction is one in which each bidder submits a single
sealed bid, and the object is sold to the highest bidder at a price
equal to the second highest bid.</b> Second-price auctions have the
advantage of making bidding simpler and more straight-forward. In an
ordinary sealed-bid auction, in which the highest bidder pays what he
or she bids, bidders are induced to under-bid strategically, not
revealing the full value to them of the auctioned item, so that they
can obtain it at a more advantageous price. This incentive for
strategic underbidding is eliminated by a second-price auction. With
a second price auction, a bidder who bids less than the object is
worth saves no money as long as he or she is the highest bidder, and
if the bid is low enough not to be the highest bid, the object is
lost to another bidder. Nor is over-bidding beneficial. Either it
makes no difference, or it results in the object being bought at a
price of more that it is worth to the bidder. Thus honest statements
of the value of the thing being auctioned are in the self-interest of
bidders in second-price auctions. By a similar line of reasoning,
when a contract is to be let to the lowest bidder, honest statements
of the lowest price at which a party is willing to do the work can be
obtained by letting the contract to the lowest bidder at a price
equal to the second-lowest bid. There are two efficiency advantages
to second-price auctions. Bidders do not have to spend resources
trying to compute their strategically most advantageous bids, and
because bids represent accurate valuations, the winning bidder is the
person who values the object most, or can truly do the work at the
lowest cost. It might seem that the amount received by the seller
would be smaller in a second-price auction. However, the higher bids
that result from removing the incentive for strategic under-bidding
approximately offset the reduced returns from charging only the
second-highest bid.... <a href="../docs/Tideman_SVR.html"><span

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">Market-Based Systems
    for Assigning Rental Value to Land</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This paper describes systems for assigning rental value to land through markets
    for the use of land that are created and managed by government officials. The
    central idea of the paper is that the full rent of land can be collected while
    achieving an efficient allocation of land if the rent for improved sites is
    revised annually, based on offers for the use of similar unimproved sites for
    the current year. The efficient allocation of land requires neither the sale
    of land
  nor leases of long duration at fixed rents.</p>
  <p>Two systems for assigning rental value to land are presented. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">One system employs a market in which land is actually
      turned over to bidders for their use, while the other employs a market in
      options to use land. </span>While these systems are applicable in many settings,
      they are particularly applicable to current conditions in the Soviet Union,
      where land is being transferred from public to private management. The new
      manager of each site will receive the profit or bear the loss from production
      on that site. The main question under consideration concerns the process
      to be used to determine how much must be paid for the use of each site.</p>
  <p>A standard response of economists to such questions is, "Sell everything to
    the highest bidder." In the context of land in the Soviet Union, this would
    mean selling, for a lump-sum amount, the right to use each site into the
    indefinite future. However, for a number of reasons, such an approach is
    less attractive
    than selling the right to use sites for rent to be paid annually. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, the person who can make best use of the site may be unable to
      match a purchase bid from someone else, because of unequal access to lending
      markets
          (due to inequalities in wealth, for example). Selling land-use rights
      for annual rent makes sites more available to users with relatively little
      in
          assets. </li>
    <li>Second, uncertainty about future political conditions would tend to depress
          purchase offers. Selling land-use rights for annual rent requires the
      state to accept the risk of future unfavorable public policies, and thereby
      tends
          to promote favorable future conditions. </li>
    <li>Third, the high degree of general uncertainty about future economic conditions
          can lead to offers of less than the expected value of opportunities,
      simply because people have no idea how to guess what the opportunities
      are worth.
          Selling land-use rights on an annual basis permits many of the future
      uncertainties to be resolved before bids must be made. </li>
    <li>Finally, the returns from future use of a site can more justly be claimed
          by future generations than by the present generation. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Selling land-use rights for annual rent allows each year's population to claim
    that year's rent. While the proceeds of sales can be invested for the benefit
    of future generations, not collecting the money in advance helps preserve the
    heritage of the future against political predations. For all of these reasons,
    I assume that what is desired is not a purchase price but a rental price to
    be assigned to each site for each year. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">read the whole article</a></p>
