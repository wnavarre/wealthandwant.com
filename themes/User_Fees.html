<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Under Henry George's system,
private land titles would not be
disturbed one iota.</b> No one would be expropriated. Instead, the
community would simply take something approaching the total annual
economic rent of land for public purposes. This amount would be
determined by the value of each site on the free market, not by any
arbitrary governmental fiat. In other words, the privilege of
monopolizing a site is a benefit received from society and for which
society should be fully compensated; and so, under the Georgist
system, the person who wished to monopolize a site would pay a rent
for it to the community, approaching 100 percent of its annual rental
value, exclusive of improvements.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let me emphasize that last phrase,
"exclusive of improvements."
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

  <li><small>crop, his livestock or his machinery; </small></li>
  <li><small>the homeowner would pay the full value of his lot, and
nothing on

</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the land had no market value,
the owner would pay nothing; if
it had a value, he would pay regardless of whether he were using it
or deriving income from it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>This would, of course,
eliminate all speculative profit in
landholding, squeeze the "speculative water" out of land prices, and
in effect bring back the frontier by making cheap land readily
available to everyone -- at least initially. <i>The result would be
to raise the margin of production, increase real wages, and stimulate
building and productivity.</i></b><i> </i>Eventually, the flourishing
economy would cause use value to exceed the former speculative value,
but instead of being engrossed by those who make no contribution to
the economy, land rent would flow into the public coffers in place of
taxes levied upon labor and capital. The land-value charge is really
what <a href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/auth/Rybeck.html">Walt Rybeck</a>
so aptly calls "a super user's fee." For the
privilege of exclusive access to and disposition of a site and its
natural resources, the owner pays an indemnity to those who are
thereby dispossessed -- an indemnity reflecting precisely the market
value of his privilege, collected through the tax mechanism and
relieving them of the burden of payment for public services. What
could be more fair?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Actually, I daresay that each one
of you, probably without
realizing it, frequently pays something that partakes of the
principle of such a "super user's fee" whether you own land or not.
<b>Every time you put money in a parking meter, you are purchasing a

difference between what you pay and what a commercial parking lot in
the vicinity would charge!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<blockquote>
  <p>Taxes, while ostensibly payments made for the services of government, are
      quite unlike payments made in the marketplace. The prominent libertarian
    economist Murray Rothbard was among those who emphasized taxation as a &#8220;coerced
      exchange,&#8221;3 in that few would freely choose to pay taxes if not for the
      penalties imposed on those who refuse to do so. But taxes are also different
      from market prices in that the tax usually has no relation to any specific
      benefit. Income and spending are taxed because of &#8220;ability to pay,&#8221; meaning
      there is a flow of funds from which money can be siphoned, to put it politely.</p>
  <p>In contrast, user fees (truly voluntary fees, not excise taxes disguised
    as fees) are somewhat like market prices, as the user pays for a specific
    and
      wanted benefit, such as entrance to a park. Land value taxation, too, is
    based on the benefit principle and on market prices. A landowner receives
    extra land
      value or land rental from the government infrastructure, security, schooling,
      transit, fire protection, and so on. Land rent, priced by the market, reflects
      the neighborhood amenities. ... </p>
  <p>Frank Chodorov, a fervent individualist and founding editor of The Freeman,
    published by the Foundation for Economic Education and still a leading libertarian
    journal of ideas, became in 1937 director of the Henry George School of Social
    Science in New York City, serving until 1942. Like most followers of Henry
    George, Chodorov regarded a charge on land value as not a true tax, which
    arbitrarily extracts wealth, but a &#8220;payment for the use of a location,
    determined by the higgling and haggling of the market, and it makes no difference
    to the land user whether he pays rent to the city fathers or to a private
    owner.&#8221;26 Explaining the value of a location derives to a great extent
    from community services, rather than the efforts of the landowner as such,
    Chodorov noted &#8220;it would seem logical that this value&#8212;which we
    call land rent&#8212;should go to defray the expenses of these common services.&#8221;27

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... Not all revenue collection
on the part of government is grounded in

constitutional authority of its tax powers. Taxes in the strictest
sense of the term are revenues involuntarily paid to general funds for

paid to government that would never be construed as taxes: lottery
revenues, fines, interest payments, environmental (green) fees, payment
for information, and user fees being the most common examples. Fines,
green fees, and user fees are instruments of police power precisely
because their primary purpose is to correct behavior, and only
secondarily to raise revenue. User fees, along with environmental fees
particularly, are employed to recover the costs of use, wear or damage
to environmental or government-provided "services." (Only in recent
years has it been fashionable to regard use or degradation of the
natural environment as a "service," necessitating "correction," as was

    Lectures, with Illustrative Notes and Charts (1894)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2. THE TWO KINDS OF DIRECT TAXATION</strong><br />
    <br />
Direct taxes fall into two general classes: (1) Taxes that are levied upon men
in proportion to their <em>ability to pay</em>, and (2) taxes that are levied
in proportion to the <em>benefits received</em> by the tax-payer from the public.
Income taxes are the principal ones of the first class, though probate and inheritance
taxes would rank high. The single tax is the only important one of the second
class.</p>
  <p> There should be no difficulty in choosing between the two. To tax in proportion
    to ability to pay, regardless of benefits received, is in accord with no
    principle of just government; it is a device of piracy. The single tax, therefore,
    as the only important tax in proportion to benefits, is the ideal tax.</p>
  <p> But here we encounter two plausible objections. One arises from the mistaken
    but common notion that men are not taxed in proportion to benefits unless
    they pay taxes upon every kind of property they own that comes under the
    protection of government; the other is founded in the assumption that it
    is impossible to measure the value of the public benefits that each individual
    enjoys. Though the first of these objections ostensibly accepts the doctrine
    of taxation according to benefits,12 yet, as it leads to attempts at taxation
    in proportion to wealth, it, like the other, is really a plea for the piratical
    doctrine of taxation according to ability to pay. The two objections stand
    or fall together.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">12. It is often said, for instance, by its advocates,
        that house owners should in justice contribute to the support of the
        fire departments that protect them and it is even gravely argued that
        houses are more appropriate subjects of taxation than land; because they
        need protection, whereas land needs none. Read note 8.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Let it once be perceived that the value of the service which government
    renders to each individual would be justly measured by the single tax, and
    neither objection would any longer have weight. We should then no more think
    of taxing people in proportion to their wealth or ability to pay, regardless
    of the benefits they receive from government than an honest merchant would
    think of charging his customers in proportion to their wealth or ability
    to pay, regardless of the value of the goods they bought of him.&quot; 13</p>

        of the present system of taxation for the taxable year, beginning May
        1, 1892, there should be added to the taxes assessed upon them what it
        cost them to pay the owners of the land of Boston for the use of the
        land, being the net ground rent, which I estimate at four per cent on
        the land value.</font></p>

        that year, being $12.90 per $1000, or 1.29 per cent added to 4 per cent

    <p><font size="-1">This, however, is not a complete contrast between the

        exempt from taxation, being held by the United States, the Commonwealth,
        by the city itself, by religious societies and corporations, and by charitable,
        literary, and scientific institutions. The total amount of the value
        of land so held as returned by the assessors for the year 1892 is $60,626,171.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Reasons can be given why all lands within the city should
        be assessed for taxation to secure a just distribution of the public
        burdens, which I cannot take the space to enter into here. There is good
        reason to believe also that lands in the city of Boston are assessed
        to quite an appreciable extent below their fair market value. As an indication
        of this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily Advertiser</em> for
        October 3, 1893, under the title, &quot;Their Own Figures.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">The vacant lands, marsh lands, and flats in Boston were

  <p><strong>  3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</strong><br />
  <br />
  To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
  service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and
  now, in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service in
  proportion to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a government
  must use land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from where government
  is poor to where it is good; neither can he carry it from where the benefits
  of good government are few or enjoyed with difficulty to where they are many
  and fully enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where the benefits of government
  are available, or forego them. And unless he buys or rents where they are greatest
  and most available he must forego them in degree. Consequently, if he would
  work or live where the benefits of government are available, and does not already
  own land there, he will be compelled to rent or buy at a valuation which, other
  things being equal, will depend upon the value of the government service that
  the site he selects enables him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service
  of government in proportion to its value to him. But he does not pay the public
  which provides the service; he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">14. Land values are lower in all countries of poor government
        than in any country of better government, other things being equal. They
        are lower in cities of poor government, other things being equal, than
        in cities of better government. Land values are lower, for example, in
        Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, where government is bad,
        than in El Paso, the neighboring city on the American side, where government
        is better. They are lower in the same city under bad government than
        under improved government. When Seth Low, after a reform campaign, was
        elected mayor of Brooklyn, N.Y., rents advanced before he took the oath
        of office, upon the bare expectation that he would eradicate municipal
        abuses. Let the city authorities anywhere pave a street, put water through
        it and sewer it, or do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood
        rise in value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation of
        wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent land
        has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public improvements
        might be collected in abundance. Every man must be able to recall some
        within his own experience.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should be so.
        Land and not other property must rise in value with desired improvements
        in government, because, while any tendency on the part of other kinds
        of property to rise in value is checked by greater production, land can
        not be reproduced.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and property
        are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be either a very bold
        man or a very avaricious one who will build a store in such a community
        and stock it with goods; but suppose such a man should appear. His store
        costs him more than the same building would cost in a civilized community;
        mechanics are not plentiful in such a place, and materials are hard to
        get. The building is finally erected, however, and stocked. And now what
        about this merchant's prices for goods? Competition is weak, because
        there are few men who will take the chances he has taken, and he charges
        all that his customers will pay. A hundred per cent, five hundred per
        cent, perhaps one or two thousand per cent profit rewards him for his
        pains and risk. His goods are dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough
        to satisfy the most contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should
        wish to buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
        the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This is the
        type of community in which may be found that land, so often mentioned
        and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually can't give away,
        you know!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient administration
        of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and life and property are safe.
        What about prices then? It would no longer require a bold or desperately
        avaricious man to engage in selling goods in that community, and competition
        would set in. High profits would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as
        cheap as anywhere in the world, the cost of transportation considered.
        Builders and building materials could be had without difficulty, and
        stores would be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement
        in government increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus able
    to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their common government
    points to the true method of taxation. With the exception of such other monopoly
    property as is analogous to land titles, and which in the purview of the
    single tax is included with land for purposes of taxation, 15 land is the
    only kind of property that is increased in value by government; and the increase
    of value is in proportion, other influences aside, to the public service
    which its possession secures to the occupant. Therefore, by taxing land in
    proportion to its value, and exempting all other property, kindred monopolies
    excepted &#8212; that is to say, by adopting the single tax &#8212; we should
    be levying taxes according to benefits.16</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not usually
        thought of as land titles, but that is what they are. By an act of sovereign
        authority they confer rights of control for transportation purposes over
        narrow strips of land between terminals and along trading points. The
        value of this right of way is a land value.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the value
        of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools, courts, police
        and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled him to enjoy. The landlord
        would pay a tax proportioned to the pecuniary benefits conferred upon
        him by the public in raising and maintaining the value of his holding.
        And if occupant and owner were the same, he would pay directly according
        to the value of his land for all the public benefits he enjoyed, both
        intangible and pecuniary.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of class
    taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land to raise against
    the single tax, when it is considered that under existing systems of taxation
    they are exempt. 17 Even the poorest and the most degraded classes in the
    community, besides paying land-owners for such public benefits as come their
    way, are compelled by indirect taxation to contribute to the support of government.
    But landowners as a class go free. They enjoy the protection of the courts,
    and of police and fire departments, and they have the use of schools and
    the benefit of highways and other public improvements, all in common with
    the most favored, and upon the same specific terms; yet, though they go through
    the form of paying taxes, and if their holdings are of considerable value
    pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on all important occasions, they,
    in effect and considered as a class, pay no taxes, because government, by
    increasing the value of their land, enables them to recover back in higher
    rents and higher prices more than their taxes amount to. Enjoying the same
    tangible benefits of government that others do, many of them as individuals
    and all of them as a class receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit
    which government confers upon no other property-owners. The value of their
    property is enhanced in proportion to the benefits of government which its
    occupants enjoy. To tax them alone, therefore, is not to discriminate against
    them; it is to charge them for what they get.18</p>

    <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington were
        paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes, a Congressional
        Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee to Investigate Tax Assessments
        in the District of Columbia, composed of Messrs. Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman,
        Wadsworth, of New York, and Washington, of Tennessee. Made to the House
        of Representatives, May 24, 1892. Report No. 1469</em>), brought out
        the fact that the value of their land had been increasing at a minimum
        rate of ten per cent per annum. The Washington land-owners as a class
        thus appear to have received back in higher land values, actually and
        potentially, about ten dollars for every two dollars that as land-owners
        they paid in taxes. If any one supposes that this condition is peculiar
        to Washington let him make similar estimates for any progressive locality,
        and see if the land-owners there are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase in the capitalized
        value of land. If the land yields or will yield to its owner an income
        in the nature of actual or potential ground rent, then to the extent
        that this actual or possible income is dependent upon government the
        landlord is in effect exempt from taxation. No matter what tax he pays
        on account of his ownership of land, the public gives it back to him
        to that extent.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
        government and the other of inefficient government, but in all other

        find a suitable site in the town of good government. For simplicity of
        illustration let us suppose that the land there is not sold outright
        but is let upon ground rent. You meet the owner of the lot you have selected
        and ask him his terms. He replies:</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year! &quot; you

        may break your legs and will be lucky if you don t break your neck; they
        have no street pavements and their sidewalks are dangerously out of repair.
        When the moon doesn't shine the streets are in darkness, for they have
        no street lights. The water you need for your house you must get from
        a well; there is no water supply there. Now in our town it is different.
        We have a splendid fire department, and the best police force in the
        world. Our streets are macadamized, and lighted with electricity; our
        sidewalks are always in first class repair; we have a water system that
        equals that of New York; and in every way the public benefits in this
        town are unsurpassed. It is the best governed town in all this region.

        Are not you protected from robbery by the best police force in the world?
        Do not you have the use of macadamized pavements, and good sidewalks,

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Correcting
Distortions by Pricing:
Increasing the Collection of Land Rent</span></small><br>
<small>Recovering the economic rent from urban parcels helps people to
appreciate the true costs of the transportation versus location
trade-off. It brings the carrying costs of site choices back to the
present time and makes them comparable with travel choices. The payment
of site rent becomes an operating cost. The other corrective policy
needed is to raise transportation costs to a level commensurate with
their full value as private goods. Transportation user fees, in the
form of motor fuel taxes, green taxes, congestion fees, and
administrative costs (for the administration of drivers' licenses and
registration fees) could easily provide the needed price corrections to
bring into balance marginal transportation costs and land rent
collection. Doing so would equilibrate choices between people living
and working in high rent urban centers and those in peripheral low rent
(but higher travel cost) locales.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Figure 2 shows how a tax on land value (or alternatively the tax
on
land rent) coupled with the proper design of transportation fees can
equilibrate the competitive advantage of markets in urban areas
relative to suburbs, thereby reducing, and perhaps even reversing, the
centrifugal forces of sprawl development. The land tax cannot alone
redress the problem, especially so long as such inordinate social
subsidies are granted to private motor vehicle transportation services.
Nor can transportation fees, raised to a level fully commensurate with
the social and private costs they incur, alone ensure that the price of
locations will be matched. But to the extent that both are assessed,
they reach far toward correcting this disequilibrium. One could even
argue that all site rent should be recaptured by society and that all
transportation costs that are identifiable as consumption of private
goods should be priced accordingly. Some advocates even suggest that
doing so will not only foster economic efficient behavior but also
provide sufficient revenue for a citizen's dividend consistent with
economic justice.... <a href="file:///C|/George/aa%20W&W/docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html"><span

<blockquote>
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The "Great Australian Dream" now
      - as
      in preceding years - has been to own your own home. </span>From their
      earliest years of adulthood, most citizens have attempted to purchase "a roof over their head." It used to be - no more than two human
      generations ago - "a three-bedroom weatherboard - or brick veneer, if
      you could afford it! - on a quarter-acre block in the suburbs." Most
      citizens - then - succeeded in realising that dream; at least they
      started repaying a loan that was large compared with their earnings.
      Nowadays, it's quite impossible for most. Why? Simply because
      land-price has escalated out of the reach of most. Allow me to give you
      a specific instance:- </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... </span><br>
    <br>
    <small>
    As you can very clearly see, it now costs couples - or singles - a
      great deal more to own a residence. Naturally, if they don't own their
  own residence, they must </small>  </p>

  <li><small>share a home with relatives or friends or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>have no place to call "home".&nbsp;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">None of these alternatives lead
to a
high quality lifestyle and undoubtedly are potent factors in separation
and divorce and reliance on drug abuse which, itself, leads to
anti-social - even criminal - behaviour. </span>We also know to our
great regret that these aberrations are becoming increasingly
prevalent. So is there a solution? And if so, what is it? </small><br>
<br>
<small>
In my opinion, there certainly is a solution ... but, seemingly, very
few want to know it. Judging by your article, I think you do. Here it
is:</small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modern
conventional wisdom is that increasing land price signifies a healthy
economy. Exactly the reverse is true!</span> Increasing land price
demonstrates that much money is being invested in real estate and that
necessarily means that less money is being invested in productive
ventures. Increasing land price causes increasing rents ... because the
land owner must derive sufficient income to pay the interest charged on
the loan needed to buy the land and its improvements. This makes it
increasingly difficult for businesses to trade profitably ...
especially when there is a plethora of complicated taxes that cause
extremely high compliance costs. It's no wonder that more and more
goods are now imported as local manufacturers choose to close their
operations. In many places in Australia, land lies relatively idle. For
example, in Melbourne's CBD, several large blocks have been idle for
years and in the suburbs, shops remain empty for months, even years.
Yet government-released figures on unemployment - the reality may well
be much worse! - admit that unemployment exceeds 6%. The old adage,
"Idle lands cause idle hands" is clearly demonstrated in Australia ...
and elsewhere.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The only possible "winners" in
this
"game" are those who presently own land; the more they own, the more
they have the potential to "win". Land owners enjoy enormous increase
in the price of land they own simply because they were able to purchase
it when its price was comparatively low. They do not - in their role as
owners - contribute in any way to the prosperity of the nation. Indeed,
because they grow wealthier without producing, they are, in fact,
parasites! That sounds incredible but it is true nonetheless. How so?
Simply because those owners receive part of the wealth earned by all
citizens; at least some of that wealth is used to push up land prices
but only owners enjoy those increased prices. Tenants certainly do not!
All who labour - and this includes land owners who perform labour! -
are thereby effectively robbed of some of their earnings. (Please note
that I do not blame landowners personally; most would - I'm certain -
be horrified to think that they are <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">parasites</span>. The fault lies
in the
parliamentary enactments that permit such a situation to prevail.)</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficult as the situation is
now, it
will be worse still in another </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">two
human generations' time.</span> How so? Because the same forces that
have been exerted in the past continue unabated. In fact, these forces
appear to be intensifying! Taxation is continuing to escalate as
pressure groups clamour ever louder for financial assistance. The
average rate at which personal income tax is levied is increasing -
even though the maximum rate levied is falling - and sales taxes and
the like are being applied to a widening range of goods and services.
The wealthy continue to derive benefit from the tax-minimisation
experts they employ - because they save more tax than they pay to those
experts - leaving the relatively poorly-paid employees to carry most of
the burden. Unless, of course,
steps are taken to change these tendencies, Australia will become an
increasingly unpleasant country in which to live. That's definitely not
the future I want for my 3 children and
7 grandchildren. And I'm sure you don't, either!</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution to this conundrum
is,
perhaps amazingly, incredibly simple; namely, require all owners of
land - in fact, all natural resources, including intangibles such as
broadcast bands, to pay to all Australians, via the government, an
annual rental in exchange for exclusive ownership rights to those
natural resources. What could be </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">fairer?</span> If a citizen has exclusive
ownership rights to a natural resource, that obviously means that all
others have no rights to it whatsoever. Therefore, that citizen must
pay compensation - in the form of a periodic rent - to all others. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Now
that's a perfect manifestation of "user pays".</span> How big is this
periodic
rent? That's simply answered, too. It's what the citizens, generally,
think that natural resource is worth! And that's easily - and
accurately - determined by valuers, individuals who have great
experience because they simply note the prices at which similar natural
resources in the vicinity - both in space and in time - are sold then
use those prices to predict that of a similar resource.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
This would constitute real tax reform and - when implemented - would
obviate the need for income taxes and sales taxes. How is this? When a
continuing rent is charged for ownership rights to a natural resource,
that natural resource will have little or no purchase price. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Setting up a
business or residence will be much cheaper first up as only the
improvements must be paid for initially. </span>Money that presently
must be borrowed to pay for access to natural resources will become
available for productive purposes. Because rents will be payable on all
natural resources that are privately owned - whether or not they are in
use - those natural resources will become used or will return to the
nation as public land. Speculation in natural resources will be
immediately terminated thus eliminating a major factor in escalating
price. The converse of the old adage quoted earlier is apposite:- <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Far less idle land will translate into far
fewer idle hands! That </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">will
translate into a reduced need </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">for
social security expenditure. </span>Additionally, lower levels of
unemployment will cause reduced anti-social and criminal activity with
consequent savings in law enforcement, punishment and rehabilitation.
And elimination of most of our taxation regulations will cause
compliance costs to all but disappear. The brakes that presently retard
Australia's productivity will not merely be released; they will be
discarded! ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>You assume that the labor question is a question between wage-workers and
    their employers. But working for wages is not the primary or exclusive occupation
    of labor. Primarily men work for themselves without the intervention of an
    employer. And the primary source of wages is in the earnings of labor, the
    man who works for himself and consumes his own products receiving his wages
    in the fruits of his labor. Are not fishermen, boatmen, cab-drivers, peddlers,
    working farmers &#8212; all, in short, of the many workers who get their
    wages directly by the sale of their services or products without the medium
    of an employer, as much laborers as those who work for the specific wages
    of an employer? In your consideration of remedies you do not seem even to
    have thought of them. Yet in reality the laborers who work for themselves
    are the first to be considered, since what men will be willing to accept
    from employers depends manifestly on what they can get by working for themselves.</p>
  <p>You assume that all employers are rich men, who might raise wages much higher
    were they not so grasping. But is it not the fact that the great majority
    of employers are in reality as much pressed by competition as their workmen,
    many of them constantly on the verge of failure? Such employers could not
    possibly raise the wages they pay, however they might wish to, unless all
    others were compelled to do so.</p>
  <p>You assume that there are in the natural order two classes, the rich and
    the poor, and that laborers naturally belong to the poor.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say that there are differences in capacity, in diligence,
    in health and in strength, that may produce differences in fortune. These,
    however, are not the differences that divide men into rich and poor. The
    natural differences in powers and aptitudes are certainly not greater than
    are natural differences in stature. But while it is only by selecting giants
    and dwarfs that we can find men twice as tall as others, yet in the difference
    between rich and poor that exists today we find some men richer than other
    men by the thousandfold and the millionfold.</p>
  <p>Nowhere do these differences between wealth and poverty coincide with differences
    in individual powers and aptitudes. The real difference between rich and
    poor is the difference between those who hold the tollgates and those who
    pay toll; between tribute-receivers and tribute-yielders. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <p><small>My fellow Green-lighters have a

    and charges, too. Much of what all of us need to learn has been
    worked out by those often-awful but sometimes-useful economists,
    under the name of "marginal-cost pricing." On private land, where the
    owner controls access, there is little need for user charges (except
    for externalities). The owner's self-interest takes care of finding
    the optimal intensity of use. On public land, however, with
    unrestricted access, it is another matter. Witness, for example, the
    crowding of Oxford sidewalks relative to the undercrowding of private
    and University lands abutting them.</small></p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>On public lands, when a bridge is
new, and oversized for its
traffic, no toll should be charged: circumstances call instead for a
Green Light Tax on the benefited lands, to hasten their settlement.
When traffic queues up, however, it is time to charge a toll (and/or
to widen the bridge).</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Likewise, when demand for water
exceeds supply, it is time to
price it and charge people for withdrawing it from Nature. The
history of irrigation in California is instructive. During the
Populist and Progressive eras Californians developed the legal
framework for what we call <b>Irrigation Districts</b>, to divert,
store and distribute water. They raised funds by taxing land; most of
them delivered water free of variable cost. Likewise, no one charged
them for taking our water from our rivers. There was ample water, so
it seemed, running to waste, or into swamps. The result, from
1900-30, was to convert California from pasture and wasteland to the
#1 farm state in America. It was a Georgist object lesson, and a
brilliant success story. Quoth Albert Henley, a prominent

<blockquote>
  <p>We do an awful lot of driving just to do what we need to do. This is because
      transportation engineers and land use planners have confused two fundamental
      concepts: access and mobility.</p>
  <p>By confusing these two principles, we spend an inordinate amount of money
      on transportation services, most of it on roads and highways. One 1993 study
      calculated that the total costs of motor vehicle transportation to our society
      equal approximately a fourth of our gross domestic product (GDP).<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> The
      study concluded that &quot;when the full range of costs of transportation
      are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public
      a total
      of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. Just the costs of automobile crashes
      represents a figure equal to 8 percent of the American GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></font> Japan,
      by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4 percent to satisfy all its transportation
      requirements, although the figure might be a bit low because not all externalities
      are included in the calculation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5] </em></strong></font>Road
      user fees in 1991 totaled only about $33 billion, whereas the true costs to
      society were ten times that;<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> put
      another way, drivers pay only 10 percent of the true costs of their motor vehicle
      use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7] </em></strong></font>The balance is paid
      by society, effectively subsidizing highway use by paying for all but the marginal
      out-of-pocket operating costs. ...</p>
  <p><strong>Stemming Sprawl: Pricing Measures for Transportation</strong></p>
  <p> From the foregoing, it is clear that insofar as the causes of sprawl development
      are economic, the solution needs to be economic as well. The equilibrium of
      forces can be restored in two ways: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1) by charging the true marginal costs of motor vehicle transportation to
          users and <br>
                2) by recovering the economic rent from urban site owners that
                    is really the socially created value. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It is easy to distinguish five elements of transportation service cost: capital
      investment, maintenance costs, regulation costs, environmental externalities,
      and congestion costs. Each of these calls for a different treatment with respect
      to revenue design. Capital costs are best recovered by recapturing the land
      rent proximate to the highway corridors. This is socially created value, which
      is better used to honor debt service of infrastructure investment than allowing
      it to be retained as windfall gains by titleholders to property close by. User
      fees, most aptly linked to the purchase of motor fuel and tire wear, serve
      as a proxy for the use of the roads and can be designed to be commensurate
      with use. As the wear and tear of roads as well as police patrol, snow and
      ice control, and signaling all involve operating and maintenance costs, such
      charges are easily linked with benefits received. In the future, still more
      accurate systems of service charges are likely to appear: Singapore, Hong Kong,
      and New Zealand are already reliant on electronic devices that record road
      use by time, place, and vehicle weight.</p>
  <p>Ensuring the safety of drivers and vehicles through licenses, registrations,
      and inspections is most appropriately financed by fees commensurate with the
      costs of their administration. This way, if a vehicle is used but seldom, it
      is charged on the basis of its identification rather than assuming any projected
      level of use. Environmental externalities such as pollution costs can be linked
      to the polluting source, such as diesel fuel and gasoline consumption, to the
      full extent necessary to equilibrate air quality and other environmental ambiences.
      Congestion costs, the last of the major components of a pricing design for
      highway use, are partially paid for by the time loss of those caught in traffic.
      The costs of time lost due to highway congestion are enormous: In 2000, the
      average driver spent 62 hours sitting in traffic at a nationwide cost of $68
      billion in gas and time lost In Los Angeles, the average driver spent 136 hours
      stalled in traffic at an average cost of $2,510.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[33]</em></strong></font> Commuting
      times were also 20 percent longer than they were a decade ago, about 22 minutes
      one way nationally on average but as high as 32 minutes on average in New York.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[34]</em></strong></font> But
      not all people's time is valued equally, and people themselves value their
      time differently at different times, and it is unfair to require people to
      impose their congestion on others. Therefore, congestion pricing, being explored
      in several urban regions, provides a rationing of limited highway space. In
      a sense, that payment for space usage, in time or money, is a form of land
      rent. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

    the rent of land to finance public activities applies to certain other sources
    of public revenue as well:</small>
    <blockquote><small>1. Charges on any publicly granted privileges, such as
        the exclusive right to use a portion of the frequency spectrum for radio
        and TV broadcasts. </small>
        <p><small>2. Payments for extractions of natural resources. Such payments

        <small> </small>
        <p><small>3. Taxes on pollution. Every individual or enterprise that
            pollutes the air, water or ground should be required to pay the estimated
            cost of the pollution it generates. The effect of pollution on the
            rental value of surrounding land is one possible measure of its cost.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>4. Taxes on any other activities that reduce the rental value
            of surrounding land.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>5. Taxes on activities such as driving or parking in crowded
            streets, where one person's activities reduce opportunities for others.
            The administration of such charges may be so expensive that it is
            not worth implementing them, but if the administration can be handled
            sufficiently cheaply, these charges are efficient to the extent that
            they only charge people for costs imposed on others.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>6. Taxes on activities, such as the consumption of alcohol,
            which impose costs on others (e.g., higher traffic fatalities).</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>7. Charges for local public services, such as water, electricity,
            sewer connections, etc. It is not generally desirable to make every
            service completely self-financing. Rather, what is desirable is that
            each user be required to pay the marginal cost of the service he
            receives. Extensions of service networks are efficient when they
            increase publicly collected land rents by enough to cover the costs
            not covered by user charges.</small></p>

        <p><small>8. A self-assessed tax on permanent improvements to land, at
            a very low rate (perhaps 1/10 of 1% per year). With a self-assessed
            tax, each possessor of land names a price at which he would be willing
            to part with the land he possesses (and any immovable improvements).
            He pays a tax proportional to the value he names, and anyone who
            wishes to may take over possession at that price. The value of such
            a tax is that it makes it much easier to assemble land for redevelopment,
            and to identify appropriate compensation when land is taken for public
            purposes.</small></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All
          of the above taxes are positively beneficial and should be collected
          even if the revenue is not needed for public purposes. Any excess can
          be returned to the population on an equal per capita basis. </span>If
          these attractive sources of revenue do not suffice to finance necessary
          public expenditures, then the least damaging additional tax would probably
          be a "poll tax," a uniform charge on all residents. If some residents
          are regarded to be incapable of paying such a tax, then the next most
          efficient tax is a proportional tax on income up to some specified
          amount. Then there is no disincentive effect for all persons who reach
          the tax limit. The next most efficient tax is a proportional tax on
          all income.</small></p>
    <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is important not to tax the
          profits of corporations</span>. Capital moves from where it is taxed
          to where it is not, until the same rate of return is earned everywhere.
          If the city refrains from taxing corporations they will invest more
          in St. Petersburg. Wages will be higher, and the rent of land, collected
          by the government, will be higher. The least damaging tax on corporations
          is one that provides a complete write-off of investments, with a carry-over
          of tax credits to future years. Such a tax has the effect of making
          the government a partner in all new investments. With such a tax the
          government provides, through tax credits, the same share of costs that
          it later receives in revenues. However, the tax does diminish the incentive
          for entrepreneurial activity, and it raises no revenue when investment
          is expanding rapidly. Furthermore, the efficiency of such a tax requires
          that everyone believe that the tax rate will never change. Thus it
          is best not to tax the profits of corporations at all. If the people
          of St. Petersburg want to share in the profits of corporations, then
          they should invest directly in the corporations, either privately or
          publicly. The residents of St. Petersburg would be best served by refraining
          from taxing the profits of corporations. Creating a place where profits
          are not taxed can be expected to attract so much capital that the resulting
          rises in wages and in government-collected rents will more than offset
          what might have been collected by taxing profits.</small></p>
    <p><small>The taxes that promote urban growth have at least one of two features. </small></p>
    <ul>
      <li><small>The first feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is that
          it can serve to allocate a naturally occurring resource among competing
          potential users. Charges for the use of land, for the use of the frequency
          spectrum and for depleting natural resources share this feature. <br>
      </small></li>
      <li><small>The second feature that a growth-promoting tax can have is that
          of being a charge for the costs imposed on the city by the person who
          pays the tax. This feature is shared by taxes on pollution, taxes on
          other activities that reduce the value of surrounding land, taxes on
          imposing congestion and other costs on other residents of the city,
          charges for the marginal cost of publicly provided services, and a
          self-assessed tax on property, reflecting the hindrance to future growth
          represented by existing development. </small></li>
    </ul>
    <small>A city that confines itself to these taxes can expect to attract capital

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Indirect
    Effects of Taxing Land</b></p>
  <p>One consequence of levying additional taxes on land is that it becomes possible
    to lower taxes on other things. One of the things most likely to be taxed less
    when land is taxed more is improvements. Lowering taxes on improvements makes
    the present value of land development very much less costly, and hence is likely
    to accelerate development although it would be possible to construct cases
    in which the effect of lowering taxes on improvements would be to postpone
    development. Whether it retards or accelerates development, the lowering of
    taxes on improvements results in more intensive development when development
    occurs. The possibility of promoting more intensive development by reducing
    or eliminating taxes on improvements is an important beneficial effect of an
    increase in taxes on land.</p>
  <p>A second consequence of levying additional taxes on land is that it becomes
    possible to price public services more efficiently. Services to land such
    as sewers, water and electricity are used most effectively when they are
    priced
    at marginal cost. The costs of these services, however, are generally such
    that the sum of marginal costs will not cover total costs. Land taxes have
    the potential to provide a fund to cover the difference between total costs
    and the sum of marginal costs. If land taxes are so used, the reductions
    in the costs of using services that complement development will promote more
    efficient
    development. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">The Morality of Taxation:
    The Local Case</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Consider first the question of adequacy of revenue. There is a theorem in
    economics, known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
  Henry George Theorem</span>, that addresses this question (Arnott and Stiglitz,
  1979). One of the
  simpler versions of this theorem is: </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If the following three conditions are met:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">1. Public expenditures provide benefits
        only over a limited area, <br>
      2. People can move costlessly, and <br>
      3. The number of persons who value a public service as highly as anyone does
        exceeds the number of persons who can live in the area where the service
        provides benefits,</div>
  </blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;">  then for any public service that is worth at least as much as it costs to those
    who receive it, the increase in the rental value of land that results from
    providing the service exceeds the net cost of the service.</div>
  <p>The Henry George Theorem is true because people who can move costlessly will
    bid up the rental value of land to reflect the value of public services that
    are not available elsewhere. The assumption that the number of bidders exceeds
    the number of people who can benefit from the public service guarantees that
    the upward movement of rents will not end until all the benefits of the public
    service are reflected in these rents. If some people who receive a public service
    value it more highly than others, then they will receive a surplus in addition
    to the rent they pay for land, and some worthwhile increments of public services
    will not add quite enough to rent to pay for themselves (Tideman 1993). But
    rent increments will go a very long way toward paying for worthwhile local
    public services.</p>
  <p>With some local public services, such as weather reports that are broadcasted
    by radio at a specified wattage, there is no social cost of having another
    person within the reception area use the service. With others, such as distribution
    of water, the extra cost of one additional user will be noticeable, but still
    a relatively small fraction of the average cost of the service. For public
    services to provide the greatest possible net value, users must be charged
    the costs of additional use (what economists call marginal cost). If they are
    charged less than marginal cost, self-interest will motivate them to use the
    service wastefully. And if they are charged more than marginal cost, self-interest
    will motivate them to economize inefficiently on the service. </p>
  <p><b>Thus local public services are financed efficiently when users are required
      to pay marginal costs, and the component of total cost that is not covered
      by marginal cost charges is financed by levies on land that collect the increases
      in rental value of land that result from provision of the service.</b> If
      all citizens in a locality valued the service equally, then every increment
      in the level of the service that was worthwhile would have a cost that was
      less than or equal to the sum of the revenue that could be raised from charges
      for use equal to marginal cost and the increase in the rental value of land
      in the community that resulted from the availability of the service. When
      people value the service differently, the increase in the rental value of
      land that results from the provision of a service will be less than the value
      of the service to those who receive it. By a criterion of maximizing the
      real incomes of residents, the best outcome that covers the full cost of
      a service will involve a level of service somewhat lower than that for which
      marginal cost is equal to the sum of marginal benefits, along with charges
      that exceed somewhat the marginal cost of providing the service to additional
      persons. Still,<strong> in general, the combination of user fees approximately equal
      to marginal cost and taxes on land to finance the remainder of costs is capable
      of providing financing for local public services that is adequate and reasonably
      efficient.</strong></p>
  <p><b>Next consider fairness.</b> The fairness of such financing is the fairness
    of incremental decisions in an environment in which the initial allocation
    is fair. (It does not provide special opportunities for disadvantaged persons.
    They would need to be provided for by insurance that operated independently
    of the provision of public goods.) A person who is treated fairly in the absence
    of public goods cannot reasonably complain about being required to pay for
    a service according to its marginal cost, or about have to pay the value that
    is added to his land by the availability of a public service. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Morality_Local.html">read the whole article</a></p>

<p>Frank Stilwell and Kirrily Jordan: <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">The
    Political Economy of Land: Putting Henry George in His Place</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What about the relevance of Georgist ideas to current concerns with environmental
    quality and ecological sustainability? Here too there is a strong claim to
    consider. Interest in Georgism has been reinvigorated in recent years by
    the need to develop public policies that reflect the nature of land as a
    finite natural resource. From a &#8216;green&#8217; perspective, land tax
    is a useful tool in discouraging the excessive and wasteful use of land.
    That is, the prospect of paying a high rate of land tax can be expected to
    discourage people from purchasing more land than they need directly for their
    own purposes. It accords with the principle that people should be taxed according
    to their use of scarce environmental assets.</p>
  <p>This &#8216;ecological take&#8217; on Georgism is particularly powerful
    at a time of intensifying global environmental problems and recognition of
    the need for remedial policy responses. It requires creative extension of
    Georgist principles because the limitation of George&#8217;s own analysis
    in this context is its primary focus on land. A range of other natural resources
    needs to be considered, linking up with the broader concerns of modern environmentalists
    such as Herman Daly (see, for example, Daly and Cobb, 1990). Hence, land
    tax should be seen as an adjunct to taxes on the use of other scarce environmental
    assets, including mineral, forestry and fishing stocks, and also bandwidth
    for radio and telecommunications, for example (Stilwell, 2002: 316-317).
    It should also be seen as a corollary to other taxes that discourage environmental
    damage, including resource rental taxes, carbon taxes and fuel excises.</p>
  <p>The case for these environmental taxes need not necessarily rest on Georgist
    principles, of course, but Georgism can claim to provide a unifying analytical
    framework. A common feature of &#8216;environmental taxes&#8217; is that
    they are all targeted, like land tax, at reducing the scope for profiting
    from the private appropriation of natural resources, and thereby restricting
    the profligate use of those resources.</p>
  <p>A tension remains, reflecting the Georgist orientation towards taxes rather
    than more directly regulatory interventions. Whether the use of the price
    mechanism in this &#8216;environmental fine tuning&#8217; is sufficient for
    dealing with pervasive environment threats is a moot point. The nature and
    severity of environmental stresses is such that more directly proscriptive
    environmental policies are commonly needed to protect natural resources.
    The creation and maintenance of national parks, for example, constitutes
    a necessary direct regulation of land-use: the market, even when modified
    by taxes, cannot absolutely guarantee the conservation of such crucial assets.
    In other words, protection of &#8216;natural capital&#8217; may commonly
    require regulation as well as taxation. ... <a href="../docs/Stilwell_PEHG.html">read the whole article</a></p>
