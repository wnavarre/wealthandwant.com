<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">What
is Land Rent?</span></small><br>
<small>John Houseman, an actor perhaps most widely known as Professor
Kingsfield in the long-running TV series, The Paper Chase, later became
the pitchman for Smith Barney. In that advertisement, his tag line was
"We make money the old-fashioned way -- we earn it."</small><br>
<br>
<small>That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts
of
others seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its
cogency in contemporary economic thought. More than a century ago John
Stuart Mill noted that</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords
grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
title.</span><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1)
</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Today, on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly titles -- largely
the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done,<span style="font-weight: bold;"> ways
that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.</span><small
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(2)</span></small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> The
surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.</span></small><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of
cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> Land
values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
areas. Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in the
United States illustrate the point. ... <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Georgist main agenda, as
earlier noted, is economic justice.
If one searches the term &#8220;economic justice&#8221; online, the first site that
will appear is the Georgist website, <a href="http://www.progress.org">progress.org</a>.
The starting point
is that people are entitled to what they earn, but only to what they
earn.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">50</span></small>
The fruits of the commons generated in rent might also be distributed
to citizens equally if not used to finance the general services of
government. In practice this means the abolition of those taxes that
represent an unjust capture of one&#8217;s personal property &#8212; taxes such as
income, sales, and other nuisance taxes. It accepts, to be sure, the
need to collect user fees, Pigouvian taxes, and perhaps sumptuary (sin)
taxes. It argues aggressively for the collection of economic rent in
support of government and, for any remaining surplus, its distribution
as a citizens&#8217; dividend.&nbsp; The justification for the collection of
rent has several grounds: </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the first is to preclude the entitlement of
windfall gains to those who have unfairly captured monopoly control of
parts of what are rightfully the public commons. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>A second reason is to
enhance the efficiency of economic productivity which the failure to
collect rent prevents. It is not just that monopoly control of commons
sites drives less attractive and less valuable land into production
because the primary choices are unavailable; it is also that the use of
alternative taxes leads to a deadweight loss in the economy which
reduces the wealth of every citizen except the monopoly titleholder.The
proper collection of land rent leads to increases in economic
efficiency in a way that wages are not artificially depressed and more
opportunities arise in the labor market.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result of these factors
leads to a greater equality in the income of each person. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The theme of economic justice runs throughout Daly&#8217;s work,
evident of
course in the title <span style="font-style: italic;">For the Common
Good</span>.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">122</span></small>
But
the formulations of justice are not explicit. One looks in vain for a
statement of what if any entitlements people should possess by virtue
of being human, or what nature or posterity is due in turn. Absent is
anything that Harvard Law professor Mary Ann Glendon calls &#8220;rights
talk.&#8221; <small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">123
</span></small>But it is clear that the ecological economists are
struggling mightily with these questions. They are boldly posed
elsewhere in the writing of Joan Martinez-Alier, a Spanish scholar who
is widely known in the movement not just by his own writing but as
editor of the journal <span style="font-style: italic;">Ecological
Politica</span>. In one article, he sees an
ever-widening standing for environmental claims, as the environmental
movement evolves from one based on the efficient and sustainable use of
natural resources (the &#8220;gospel of eco-efficiency,&#8221; in the tradition of
Gifford Pinchot), later to the &#8220;cult of wilderness&#8221; (in the tradition
of John Muir and Aldo Leopold).&#8221; <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">124125</span></small> As
people come to understand their relationship and dependence upon their
natural environment, he envisions an unfolding pattern of litigation to
preserve the sanctity and protection of peoples dependent upon it.
Distant corporate interests will be blocked from exploiting the lands
of local populations who are otherwise left with
the liabilities of their repair. <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>The focus of Henry George&#8217;s inquiry, and of his disciples, is
the
pursuit of justice. Economic justice is an agenda which ecological
economists also subscribe to, even though their immediate focus is
concern about the earth&#8217;s survival at all, let alone the distribution
of its fruits. Here, however, is where the Georgist tradition is able
to contribute most to the environmental justice program. There is a
broad appreciation, particularly among ecological economists that have
worked in poorer nations, that natural resources are endangered every
bit as much by the scarcity of basic necessities as by overpopulation.
Urban elites usurp high value lands and retain land rents growing out
of their production; poor people are marginalized and left to fend for
themselves. They often survive by taking what little environmental
resources are left on ravaged land sites, further reducing the
resiliency of these local ecologies. Collection and redistribution of
land rents, either in the form of public services or in the form of a
citizens&#8217; dividends, offers a way to restore equity without
redistribution of land titles and without all the dislocations this
might entail. Many third world leaders at the present time see
solutions to poverty and economic inequality in the redistribution of
land titles. Georgists argue that this is not necessary; all that is
necessary is to recover the land rent and assure its equitable
distribution to rightful claimants.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The justice in the Georgist tradition grows out of the premise
that one
is entitled to what one makes with one&#8217;s own hands or mind, but one is
not personally entitled to the gains that grow out of communal efforts.
Those are owed to and should be returned to the community. The justice
inherent in ecological economics, to the extent that it has solidified,
involves a recognition that preservation of natural capital is in the
interest of everyone. Both recognize and value the preservation of a
world commons in nature. Both appreciate the diversity preserved in
local community institutions and cultures. Both accept models based on
self-regulating assumptions &#8212; in one case using the phrase &#8220;steady
state&#8221; economics, in the other case the recovery of land rent in the
pursuit of open and stable markets over monopoly control. There is
great promise in the confluence of the two perspectives: they offer a
solution to the age-old challenge of resolving what in the world ought
to be public and common, and what else ought to be individual and
private. It remains now for proponents of each perspective to continue
exploring commonalities. ... <a

 style="font-weight: bold;">read the whole article</span></a></small>
They
are evident also in the work of Bernardo Aguilar, particularly with
reference to north-south trade arrangements which essentially exchange
natural resources for developed nations&#8217; currencies. <br>
