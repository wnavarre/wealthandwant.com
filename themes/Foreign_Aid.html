<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When there is famine among
savages it is because food enough is
not to be had. But this was not the case in Ireland. In any part of
Ireland, during the height of what was called the famine, there was
food enough for whoever had means to pay for it. The trouble was not
in the scarcity of food. There was, as a matter of fact, no real
scarcity of food, and the proof of it is that food did not command
scarcity prices. During all the so-called famine, food was constantly
exported from Ireland to England, which would not have been the case
had there been true famine in one country any more than in the other.
During all the so-called famine a practically unlimited supply of
American meat and grain could have been poured into Ireland, through
the existing mechanism of exchange, so quickly that the relief would
have been felt instantaneously. Our sending of supplies in a national
war-ship was a piece of vulgar ostentation, fitly paralleled by their
ostentatious distribution in British gunboats under the nominal
superintendence of a royal prince. Had we been bent on relief, not
display, we might have saved our government the expense of fitting up
its antiquated warship, the British gunboats their coal, the Lord
Mayor his dinner, and the Royal Prince his valuable time. A cable
draft, turned in Dublin into postal orders, would have afforded the
relief, not merely much more easily and cheaply, but in less time
than it took our war-ship to get ready to receive her cargo; for the
reason that so many of the Irish people were starving was, not that
the food was not to be had, but that they had not the means to buy
it. Had the Irish people had money or its equivalent, the bad seasons
might have come and gone without stinting any one of a full meal.
Their effect would merely have been to determine toward Ireland the
flow of more abundant harvests.</small><small>&nbsp; ... <span

Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The
Crime of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the Old Testament we are told
that when
the Israelites journeyed through the desert, they were hungered, and
that God sent manna down out of the heavens. There was enough for all
of them, and they all took it and were relieved. But supposing that
desert had been held as private property, as the soil of Great
Britain is held, as the soil even of our new States is being held;
suppose that one of the Israelites had a square mile, and another one
had twenty square miles, and another one had a hundred square miles,
and the great majority of the Israelites did not have enough to set
the soles of their feet upon, which they could call their
own &#8212; what would become of the manna? What good would it have done
to the majority? Not a whit. Though God had sent down manna enough
for all, that manna would have been the property of the landholders;
they would have employed some of the others perhaps, to gather it up
into heaps for them, and would have sold it to their hungry brethren.
Consider it; this purchase and sale of manna might have gone on until
the majority of Israelites had given all they had, even to the
clothes off their backs. What then? Then they would not have had
anything left to buy manna with, and the consequences would have been
that while they went hungry the manna would have lain in great heaps,
and the landowners would have been complaining of the over-production
of manna. There would have been a great harvest of manna and hungry
people, just precisely the phenomenon that we see today. ... <a

the Creator and ask Him to relieve it? Supposing the prayer were heard,
and at the behest with which the universe sprang into being there
should glow in the sun a greater power; new virtue fill the air; fresh
vigor the soil; that for every blade of grass that now grows two should
spring up, and the seed that now increases fifty-fold should increase a
hundredfold! Would poverty be abated or want relieved? Manifestly no!
Whatever benefit would accrue would be but temporary. The new powers
streaming through the material universe could be utilized only through
land. And land, being private property, the classes that now monopolize
the bounty of the Creator would monopolize all the new bounty. Land
owners would alone be benefited. Rents would increase, but wages would
still tend to the starvation point! ... <a

<small>As important as our ideas are for the justice and efficiency of
the American economy, their application is even more important in
less developed countries, where often 80% of the land is held by 3%
of the population. To give all the citizens of these countries
chances to make something of their lives, it is extremely important
to equalize access to land, not by redividing the land (which
inevitably winds up putting land into the hands of people who cannot
use it well) but by requiring any one who uses land to pay according
to the unimproved value of the land that he or she uses. To bring
this message to the world, we must first apply it to ourselves.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE
FOLLY OF MOST THIRD WORLD AID</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"Philanthropy
is commendable, but it must not cause the philanthropist to overlook
the circumstances of economic injustice which make philanthropy
necessary." </span>- Martin Luther King, (1929 - 1968), civil rights

</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>When you're confronted by those images of mournful young eyes
which
gaze pleadingly at you from an emaciated body, it's pretty hard to
resist reaching for your wallet. Well, I hope that's made you sleep a
lot more contently at night, but I'm afraid the grinding poverty of
much of the Third World will grind on just the same.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GREAT PLANETARY CURSE</span></small><br>
<small>'Twas ever thus, within an economic system that, deliberately or
not,
supports the mother of all monopolies - land monopoly. Landlords get
rich in their sleep because of what happens around, not on their land.
The vice-like grip of land privileges crosses all national and cultural
boundaries, and this writer has spent years tramping around places like
Iran, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Yemen and Uganda, and had this
bitter fact confirmed everywhere.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Here is the type of thing I saw again and again. Landless
peasants are
living on the breadline, working for their relatively wealthy
landlords. Some philanthropic organisation funds the building of a
well, so that the women don't have to spend so many hours each day
tramping to fetch it. Guess what happens to their rents when the well
is completed? With amazing certainty, rents rise in proportion to the
benefits of access to that well. It's the same deal with the provision
of roads, schools, clinics, irrigation schemes, bridges etc. Net
result: the living standards of the landless change little, but that of
the landlords are considerably enriched. Someone wasn't kidding when he
said, <strong>"Third World aid is the giving by the poor people of rich
countries to the rich people of poor countries."</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE FEEL-GOOD FACTOR</span></small><br>
<small>Of course, this is not to deny outright the goodwill and even
the
occasional good result of aid programs. Indisputably, emergency aid
that puts food into starving hands will always be a blessing. Also,
where there is a high percentage of land ownership, benefits obviously
accrue to more people. But to which people? Some will undoubtedly
benefit more than others, and some won't benefit at all. Furthermore,
when you factor in the political corruption of many Third World
governments, the benefits are more unevenly distributed.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE ROOT, NOT THE FLOWER</span></small><br>
<small>Again, land monopoly and all its privileges would be destroyed
by LVT.
Whereas landlords had been able to sit back and leave much of their
land to be idle or inefficiently used, LVT would force them either to
put it to its optimum use or to effectively stand aside to allow others
to do so. The boot would then be on the other foot, as vast amounts of
land will be thrown onto the market and labourers would be offered a
fair wage.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Nor would any landowner - small or large - benefit, in net
terms, more
than another when a domestic or foreign government finances local
development . Land rendered more productive or desirable would pay
proportionally more LVT. And, of course, that LVT would not end up in
any private pocket but would be the natural source of that society's
revenue, benefiting one and all. We'll take this up a theoretical notch
in the very next module "Land Reform - Real and Illusory".</small><br>

</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
teaching of Henry George will be the basis of our program of reform&#8230;The
(land tax) as the only means of supporting the government is an
infinitely just, reasonable and equitably distributed tax, and on it we
will found our new system. The centuries of heavy and irregular
taxation for the benefit of the Manchus have shown China the injustice
of any other system of taxation." </span>- Dr. Sun Yat Sen (1866 -
1925), democrat, reformer and acknowledged "father of the Chinese
republic"</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>In the last module we've just seen how LVT would place the
benefits of
aid and development fairly and squarely in the hands of the people, not
just the landowners. "But, hang on!" comes the objection, "There are
other types of land reform besides LVT." This, as the module title
suggests, is our subject - how other types of land reform have never
delivered and never will.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">VIVA LA REVOLUCI&Oacute;N!</span></small><br>
<small>Certainly there have been endless attempts at land reform. "<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Viva la revoluci&oacute;n!</span>"
has been the cry all through Latin America, for instance, but the lot
of the average peasant has changed little, even with the best will in
the world behind land reform.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Here's the problem. So-called land reform has always been seen
as land
redistribution, based on the same form of outright land ownership. But
there are three cogent reasons why land redistribution, as remarked
above, does not work and never will.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Firstly, to redistribute
land means to divide it up. But land is so vastly different as to make
this task utterly impractical,</span>
what with wilderness, marginal agricultural land, good agricultural
land, outer suburban land and prime real estate in the heart of the
cities. Where's Solomon to wisely divide it all up, with the added
problem of buildings and improvements that some people have built and
others haven't? Would A have to get 100 square kilometres of desert to
match B's parcel of two square metres opposite the GPO?</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondly, even if the
different
values were measured at a given moment, they would immediately begin to
change, and would continue to do so.</span> Even if everyone might
start with a parcel of land equal in value to everyone else's, those
values would at once begin to shift. In the first year a dam is built
here, a school is closed down there, and roads are built everywhere.
Appreciation and depreciation would continue year after year, and in no
time everyone's "equal" parcels would have ceased to be such. A great
way to operate a casino, but what sort of way to run a society?</small></li>
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>Thirdly, even if you could wave
a
magic wand and somehow take into account the different and
ever-changing values of land, what about new entrants like the newborn
of the next and future generations? And what do immigrants get?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides the Big Three reasons
above, there are two minor ones worth mentioning.</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li style="font-weight: bold;"><small>After the land "reform," would
selling, speculating and profiteering go on as before, or would all
have to stick to their allocated plots for the rest of their lives?</small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It would require a really
squeaky-clean government for the "casino" of changing land values not
to turn into a den of political influence and corruption.</span> Most
likely, development would be skewed towards the land of the politically
empowered. Or maybe the kleptocracy would get the tip-off to buy land
where development is going to take place. </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">REAL
REFORM, NOT REVOLUTION</span></small><br>
<small>None of the problems above would exist with LVT, the
implementation of
which would be far less revolutionary than that of historical land
reforms. We need land reform here in Australia, of course - but in the
Third World where poverty is so great, matters are urgent. What good
has foreign aid done over all these years, when you look at the
disparities of wealth in recipient countries? Why do governments even
today (as in Zimbabwe) still go down the path of land reform whereby
land is doled out to a handful of government supporters?</small><br>
<br>
<small>We all know the proverb: Give a man a fish and he'll be fed for
a day,
but teach a man to fish and he'll feed himself for a lifetime. One
would assume that Western governments, the World Bank and the IMF also
knew it, but they continue to hand out fish instead. ... <span

the

economic rent and rent-seeking behaviour would assist the appreciation
of some points made here, but an explanation of this extends beyond the
immediate ambit of this paper. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This
succinct summary, however, may assist: </span></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"For the failure to make people
pay
rent for access, or possession of, natural resources is at the heart of
all major environmental problems, and is the cause of some of the most
fractious geo-political problems .... <span

 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[3]</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">For reasons similar to those
we've
seen with the example of landowners benefiting from investment in
infrastructure, much aid to developing countries does little to
alleviate the plight and environmentally-destructive practices of the
desperate landless, who can only work on the conditions demanded by the
landowners because of the aforementioned monopolistic qualities of
land. </span>Improvements to infrastructure simply boost land values
and the rents demanded of the landless. Furthermore, as Banks notes,
"Canceling part of the debt amounts to the infusion of billions of
dollars into these less developed countries which, under the existing
tenure and tax regimes, would benefit the price of land rather than
provide work for the landless." <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_CSRS.html">Canada's System of
Revenue Sharing</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now another similarity to the
two countries us that the
subventions that do go from the federal government to the provinces
in Canada (and you find a similar thing in the United States) do not
come from the richer provinces. They come instead from the general
fund, the general taxpayer.<b> There is in other words more vertical
balancing than there is horizontal balancing (horizontal balancing
you remember means equalization among the different
jurisdictions).</b> It's a little like what somebody said about
foreign aid. 'Foreign aid is a device by which poor people in rich
countries are taxed to subsidize rich people in poor countries.'</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We'll see that equalisation in
most countries works something like
that; that is, in addition to this inter-provincial equalisation,
there's a tax shift involved where local sources of taxation like the
property tax are being displaced by the federal income tax. I suppose
Ferdinand Marcos would be a splendid example of the kind of person I
was talking about in the poor country and in West Virginia you have
all these coal companies whose owners live in Palm Beach, whose
shareholders live in Palm Beach and such places, who benefit from an
inter-state equalisation that benefits West Virginia. Well these are
similarities. Now differences.&nbsp; ... <a

<p>Lindy Davies: <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">Land
    and Justice</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Wealth &#8212; products, widgets &#8212; these things are made by human
    beings. If customers are willing to buy more of them, then manufacturers
    will make
    more of them. But human beings can't make land. The supply of land cannot
    be increased. If the demand for land increases, only one thing can happen:
    its
  price will go up. </p>
  <p>The owners of land see population and production go up, up, up &#8212; and
      no more land. So, they will only put their land to use if they have an
    immediate need for the cash. If they can afford to wait, they will wait,
    because they
      expect the land's value to increase with time.</p>
  <p> That, in a nutshell, is the key to the land problem &#8212; the problem
    of poverty.</p>
  <p> That is why millions upon millions of people who are willing and able to
    work cannot find work, even while millions upon millions of acres of useable
    land (city land, industrial land, farm land, you name it) are held idle. </p>
  <p>This leads to no end of problems. In the United States, it brings urban
    blight and suburban sprawl, which disrupt communities, and waste energy and
    resources.
    You don&#8217;t think under-use of land is that big a deal? Consider the fact
    that in the five boroughs of New York City, 7.5% of its land, or 18.6 square
    miles, is vacant. That&#8217;s buildable land, not parks or streets. And, of
    course, a great deal more land in New York, as in every other city, is used
    somewhat, but far less than the local economy would support. New York City
    has about 80 people per acre of residential land. That means that New York&#8217;s
    vacant land could house another 956,000 people at current density levels,
    without even starting to use its vast stock of under-used land.</p>
  <p> Even though downtowns are underbuilt, people want to move away from the
    high prices and high crime rates they often find there &#8212; so development leapfrogs,
    using far more land than is necessary, jacking up the price of farmland near
    the city &#8212; so that local farms can no longer compete. All this sprawl
    creates more and more need for roads &#8212; provided by tax dollars, of course.
    With all these roads, and all these cars, public transportation systems become
    less popular and harder to finance. This chokes the cities with even more traffic,
    making them even less desirable places to be. Meanwhile, all these subsidized
    highways are just great for the big trucks, burning subsidized fuel, carrying
    imported merchandise to all the big-box stores and franchise restaurants of
    suburbia. In other words: two of the hugest problems that progressives are
    trying to address today &#8212; the decay of communities and the rise of the
    corporate big box &#8212; are all about the land.</p>
  <p> Around the world, it gives too much power to the banks, for land is by
    far the greatest source of collateral for loans, everywhere. The more money
    we
    have to pay for land, the more power we give to the banks. Although 66% of
    American families own their homes, the overall net equity of American home &#8220;owners&#8221; is
    only 18%.</p>
  <p> It&#8217;s all about treating the land as an &#8220;asset.&#8221;</p>
  <p>In &quot;developing countries&quot; it leads to a terrible vicious circle:
    peasants lose their land to one of two groups: either, first, to land-baron
    cronies of corrupt regimes &#8212; who hold land idle for the specific reason
    of not allowing peasants to use it, thus making sure they have no place to
    go, and are willing to work for subsistence wages &#8212; or, second, to
    multinational corporations, who run huge plantations to grow crops for export.
    The foreign
    exchange thus gained goes for debt service, which allows the ruling regime
    to keep playing by the IMF's rules, and stay in power. Meanwhile, the peasants
    gravitate to the cities, seeking nonexistent jobs, and end up in shantytowns
  that lack clean water and sewers.</p>
  <p> We're told that two billion people live on less than two dollars a day.
    Now, certainly there is lots of poverty in the world &#8212; but that statistic
    troubles me. Two dollars a day? Consider your own basic needs, and ask yourself
    how far two bucks will go toward satisfying them. Nobody can survive on two
    dollars a day. Why haven't those two billion people just keeled over by now? </p>
  <p>This sort of paradox led the Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen to
    the studies described in his book <em>Development as Freedom</em>. Sen contends
    that the true measure of economic welfare &#8212; and therefore of development
    in any meaningful sense &#8212; can't be a matter of GDP and other conventional
    measures of &quot;growth.&quot; Any true measure of economic welfare must
    have to do with the degree to which each person can set and achieve his or
    her own
    economic goals. </p>
  <p> Economic freedom for the world&#8217;s poorest people is unquestionably all
    about the land. Let's say a peasant family has a goat and a garden, and, working
    carefully, can grow enough to feed itself. Occasionally a good harvest will
    yield some surplus which can be sold &#8212; there wouldn't be much of that,
    but let's say it brought in an average of two dollars a day. With thrift,
    enough for school clothes, maybe even books. </p>
  <p>Now, let's imagine that the family lost their land &#8212; perhaps an injury
    or some other disaster made it impossible to keep farming it &#8212; and they
    had to go to the city, where they managed to find a combination of odd jobs,
    yielding them an income of $10 per day. Now, they had to somehow buy their
    food and every other necessity out of that ten dollars, and they had to live
    in a miserable shack, with open sewage running in unpaved streets &#8212; yet
    in terms of development numbers, their income had increased by $500%.</p>
  <p> In which case did the family have more freedom? Which scenario is more conducive
    to development?</p>
  <p>We were talking about the tendency for landowners to use land as an investment &#8212; a
    sensible thing to do &#8212; not to use it now if they don't need to, but to
    think in terms of enjoying its increase in value over time. We even identified
    that as the key to the problem of poverty. But &#8212; good heavens, what
    can we do about that? Isn't that just how the economy works? Isn't the private
    ownership of land a basic part of a modern economy? How can we do without
    such
  an important institution?</p>
  <p> Or in other words &#8212; won't the poor always be with us?</p>
  <p> Not necessarily. It has been plain, since very earliest days of civil society,
    that the private ownership of land leads to exploitation and great extremes
    of wealth and poverty. And, since the time of the Book of Leviticus, we have
    had a pretty good idea of what to do about it. In that book were recorded
    the words &quot;The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is Mine,
    for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.&quot; ... <a href="/docs/Davies_Land_Justice.htm">read
