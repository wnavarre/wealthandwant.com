</div>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">Political Dangers</a> (Chapter 2 of <em><a href="../HG/SP/SP00_TOC.htm">Social Problems</a></em>, 1883)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <span class="style1">[05] </span>There is a  suggestive fact that must impress any one who thinks over the history  of past eras and preceding civilizations. The great, wealthy and  powerful nations have always lost their freedom; it is only in small,  poor and isolated communities that Liberty has been maintained. So true  is this that the poets have always sung that Liberty loves the rocks  and the mountains; that she shrinks from wealth and power and splendor,  from the crowded city and the busy mart. So true is this that  philosophical historians have sought in the richness of material  resources the causes of the corruption and enslavement of peoples.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style1">[08]</span> But to the changes produced by growth are, with us, added the  changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of  steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the  concentration of wealth and power. Workmen are becoming massed by  hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;  small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen  of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues  and payrolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this  <strong>concentration</strong> grows the facility of combination among these great  business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal  operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers, combine,  either to regulate prices or to use the powers of government! The  tendency in all branches of industry is to the formation of rings  against which the individual is helpless, and which exert their power  upon government whenever their interests may thus be served.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[09] </span><strong>It is not merely positively, but negatively, that great  aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to  corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of the  people.</strong> "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars &mdash; except two  million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in power, no  matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for reform, for it  instinctively fears change. It never struggles against misgovernment.  When threatened by the holders of political power it does not agitate,  nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is in this way, no less  than by its direct interference, that aggregated wealth corrupts  government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our organized lobbies,  both legislative and Congressional, rely as much upon the fears as upon  the hopes of moneyed interests. When "business" is dull, their resource  is to get up a bill which some moneyed interest will pay them to beat.  So, too, these large moneyed interests will subscribe to political  funds, on the principle of keeping on the right side of those in power,  just as the railroad companies deadhead President Arthur when he goes  to Florida to fish.<br>
<br>
<span class="style1">[10]</span> <strong>The more corrupt a government the easier wealth can use it. </strong>Where  legislation is to be bought, the rich make the laws; where justice is  to be purchased, the rich have the ear of the courts. And if, for this  reason, great wealth does not absolutely prefer corrupt government to  pure government, it becomes none the less a corrupting influence. A  community composed of very rich and very poor falls an easy prey to  whoever can seize power. The very poor have not spirit and intelligence  enough to resist; the very rich have too much at stake. <a href="../HG/SP/SP02_Political_Dangers.htm">...

<p>Henry George: <a
 href="../HG/ST_what_why_1890.html">The Single Tax: What It Is and Why We Urge
  It</a> (1890)</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To show briefly why we urge this change,
    let me treat (1) of <b><i>its expediency, </i></b>and (2) of <b><i>its justice.</i></b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the Single Tax we may expect these <small><small><small><b>advantages</b></small></small>:</small></small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. It would dispense with a whole
    army of tax gatherers and other officials which present taxes require, and
    place in the treasury a much larger portion of what is taken from people,
    while by making government simpler and cheaper, it would tend to make it
    purer. <strong>It would get rid of taxes which necessarily promote fraud,
    perjury, bribery, and corruption, which lead men into temptation, and which
    tax what the nation can least afford to spare -- honesty and conscience.</strong> Since
    land lies out-of-doors and cannot be removed, and its value is the most readily
    ascertained of all values, the tax to which we would resort can be collected
    with the minimum of cost and the least strain on public morals. </small>
    <p><small>2. It would enormously increase the production of wealth &#8212;</small></p>
    <small> </small>
    <blockquote><small>(a) By the removal of the burdens that now weigh upon
        industry and thrift. If we tax houses, there will be fewer and poorer
        houses; if we tax machinery, there will be less machinery; if we tax
        trade, there will be less trade; if we tax capital, there will be less
        capital; if we tax savings, there will be less savings. All the taxes
        therefore that we would abolish are those that repress industry and lessen
        wealth. But <b>if we tax land values, there will be no less land.</b> </small>
        <p><small>(b) On the contrary, <b>the taxation of land values has the
              effect of making land more easily available by industry,</b> since
              it makes it more difficult for owners of valuable land which they
              themselves do not care to use to hold it idle for a large future
              price. While the abolition of taxes on labor and the products of
              labor would free the active element of production, the taking of
              land values by taxation would free the passive element by destroying
              speculative land values and preventing the holding out of use of
              land needed for use. If any one will but look around today and
              see the unused or but half-used land, the idle labor, the unemployed
              or poorly employed capital, he will get some idea of how enormous
              would be the production of wealth were all the forces of production
              free to engage.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>(c) <b>The taxation of the processes and products of labor
              on one hand, and the insufficient taxation of land values on the
              other, produce an unjust distribution of wealth</b> which is building
              up in the hands of a few, fortunes more monstrous than the world
              has ever before seen, while the masses of our people are steadily
              becoming relatively poorer. These taxes necessarily fall on the
              poor more heavily than on the rich; by increasing prices, they
              necessitate a larger capital in all businesses, and consequently
              give an advantage to large capitals; and they give, and in some
              cases are designed to give, special advantage and monopolies to
              combinations and trusts. On the other hand, the insufficient taxation
              of land values enables men to make large fortunes by land speculation
              and the increase of ground values--fortunes which do not represent
              any addition by them to the general wealth of the community, but
              merely the appropriation by some of what the labor of others creates.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small><b>This unjust distribution of wealth develops on the one hand
              a class idle and wasteful because they are too rich, and on the
              other hand a class idle and wasteful because they are too poor</b>.
              It deprives men of capital and opportunities which would make them
              more efficient producers. It thus greatly diminishes production.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>(d) <b>The unjust distribution which is giving us the hundred-fold
              millionaire on the one side and the tramp and pauper on the other,
              generates thieves, gamblers, and social parasites of all kinds,</b> and
              requires large expenditure of money and energy in watchmen, policemen,
              courts, prisons, and other means of defense and repression. It
              kindles a greed of gain and a worship of wealth, and produces a
              bitter struggle for existence which fosters drunkenness, increases
              insanity, and causes men whose energies ought to be devoted to
              honest production to spend their time and strength in cheating
              and grabbing from each other. Besides the moral loss, all this
              involves an enormous economic loss which the Single Tax would save.</small></p>
        <small> </small>
        <p><small>(e)<b> The taxes we would abolish fall most heavily on the
              poorer agricultural districts, and tend to drive population and
              wealth from them to the great cities</b>. The tax we would increase
              would destroy that monopoly of land which is the great cause of
              that distribution of population which is crowding the people too
              closely together in some places and scattering them too far apart
              in other places. Families live on top of one another in cities
              because of the enormous speculative prices at which vacant lots
              are held. In the country they are scattered too far apart for social
              intercourse and convenience, because, instead of each taking what
              land he can use, every one who can grabs all he can get, in the
              hope of profiting by its increase in value, and the next man must
              pass farther on. Thus we have scores of families living under a
              single roof, and other families living in dugouts on the prairies
              afar from neighbors--some living too close to each other for moral,
              mental, or physical health, and others too far separated for the
              stimulating and refining influences of society. The wastes in health,
              in mental vigor, and in unnecessary transportation result in great
          economic losses which the Single Tax would save.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Take it from any aspect you

we ought to consider clearly and plainly), while we boast of our
democratic republicanism, democratic republicanism is passing away. I

demoralisation? Largely from our system of taxation. What does our

frauds of all kinds; the private interests that are enlisted in

    of intelligence to social affairs has not kept pace with the application
    of intelligence to individual needs and material ends. Natural science strides
    forward, but political science lags. With all our progress in the arts which
    produce wealth, we have made no progress in securing its equitable distribution.
    Knowledge has vastly increased; industry and commerce have been revolutionized;
    but whether free trade or protection is best for a nation we are not yet
    agreed. We have brought machinery to a pitch of perfection that, fifty years
    ago, could not have been imagined; but, in the presence of political corruption,
    we seem as helpless as idiots. The East River bridge is a crowning triumph
    of mechanical skill; but to get it built a leading citizen of Brooklyn had
    to carry to New York sixty thousand dollars in a carpet bag to bribe New
    York aldermen. The human soul that thought out the great bridge is prisoned
    in a crazed and broken body that lies bedfast, and could watch it grow only
    by peering through a telescope. Nevertheless, the weight of the immense mass

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a suggestive fact that
must impress any one who
thinks over the history of past eras and preceding civilizations. The
great, wealthy and powerful nations have always lost their freedom;
it is only in small, poor and isolated communities that Liberty has
been maintained. So true is this that the poets have always sung that
Liberty loves the rocks and tile mountains; that she shrinks from
wealth and power and splendor, from the crowded city and the busy
mart....</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> The mere growth of society
involves danger of the gradual
conversion of government into something independent of and beyond the
people, and the gradual seizure of its powers by a ruling
class -- though not necessarily a class marked off by personal titles
and a hereditary status, for, as history shows, personal titles and
hereditary status do not accompany the concentration of power, but
follow it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The same methods which, in
a little town where each knows
his neighbor and matters of common interest are under the common eye,
enable the citizens freely to govern themselves, may, in a great
city, as we have in many cases seen, enable an organized ring of
plunderers to gain and hold the government. </span>So, too, as we see
in
Congress, and even in our State legislatures, the growth of the
country and the greater number of interests make the proportion of
the votes of a representative, of which his constituents know or care
to know, less and less. And so, too, the executive and judicial
departments tend constantly to pass beyond the scrutiny of the
people.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But to the changes produced by
growth are, with us, added the
changes brought about by improved industrial methods. The tendency of
steam and of machinery is to the division of labor, to the
concentration of wealth and power. Workmen are becoming massed by
hundreds and thousands in the employ of single individuals and firms;
small storekeepers and merchants are becoming the clerks and salesmen
of great business houses; we have already corporations whose revenues
and pay rolls belittle those of the greatest States. And with this
concentration grows the facility of combination among these great
business interests. How readily the railroad companies, the coal
operators, the steel producers, even the match manufacturers,
combine, either to regulate prices or to use the powers of
government! The tendency in all branches of industry is to the
formation of rings against which the individual is helpless, and
which exert their power upon government whenever their interests may
thus be served. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> It is not merely positively, but
negatively, that great
aggregations of wealth, whether individual or corporate, tend to
corrupt government and take it out of the control of the masses of
the people. "Nothing is more timorous than a million dollars -- except
two million dollars." Great wealth always supports the party in
power, no matter how corrupt it may be. It never exerts itself for
reform, for it instinctively fears change. It never struggles against
misgovemment. When threatened by the holders of political power it
does not agitate, nor appeal to the people; it buys them off. It is
in this way, no less than by its direct interference, that aggregated
wealth corrupts government, and helps to make politics a trade. Our
organized lobbies, both legislative and Congressional, rely as much
upon the fears as upon the hopes of moneyed interests. When
"business" is dull, their resource is to get up a bill which some
moneyed interest will pay them to beat. So, too, these large moneyed
interests will subscribe to political funds, on the principle of
keeping on the right side of those in power, just as the railroad
companies deadhead [transport for free] President
[Chester A.] Arthur when he goes to Florida to fish. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Evils of
Monopolists</b>
</small><br>
<small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the
increase of land values has had, and is having, in the United States.
This is, of course, monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in
value it does not mean that its owner has added to the general
wealth. The owner may never have seen the land or done aught to
improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant city or in
another country. Increase of land values simply means that the
owners, by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed
before man was, have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth
produced by other people's labor. Consider how much the monopolies
created and the advantages given to the unscrupulous by the tariff
and by our system of internal taxation -- how much the railroad (a
business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water and other
similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and
stock-gambling, the destructive use of wealth in driving off or
buying off opposition which the public must finally pay for, and many
other things which these will suggest, have operated to build up
large fortunes, and it will at least appear that the unequal
distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many
who work little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the
earnings of the one class are, in one way or another, filched away
from them to swell the incomes of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly
making their way from the
ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the ranks of those
who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state of things
right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that
piracy was right and that no effort should be made to suppress
it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor
seeking, by speaking of
these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get a clear
understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that it
is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which
we give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by
law and by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so
enormously rich while others remain so miserably poor. If we look
around us and note the elements of monopoly, extortion and spoliation
which go to the building up of all, or nearly all, fortunes, we see
on the one hand now disingenuous are those who preach to us that
there is nothing wrong in social relations and that the inequalities
in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities of human
nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk as
though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
restricting the acquisition of wealth. Capital is a good; the
capitalist is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely
let any one get as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in
doing so.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the
present constitution of society,
but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in
those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are
the laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from
bad
adjustments which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social
state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but
in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general
stock. And in such a social state there would not be less incentive
to exertion than now; there would be far more incentive. Men will be
more industrious and more moral, better workmen and better citizens,
if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his family, than
where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them until
some have far more than they could have earned, and others have
little or nothing.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

  <p>The generation that abolished chattel slavery is passing away, and the political
      distinctions that grew out of that contest are becoming meaningless. The work
      now before us is the abolition of industrial slavery.</p>
  <p>What God created for the use of all should be utilized for the benefit of
      all; what is produced by the individual belongs rightfully to the individual.
      The neglect of these simple principles has brought upon us the curse of widespread
      poverty and all the evils that flow from it. Their recognition will abolish
      poverty, will secure to the humblest independence and leisure, and will lay
      abroad and strong foundation on which all other reforms may be based. To secure
      the full recognition of these principles is the most important task to which
      any man can address himself today. It is in the hope of aiding in this work
      that I establish this paper.</p>
  <p>I believe that the Declaration of Independence is not a mere string of glittering
      generalities. I believe that all men are really created equal, and that the
      securing of those equal natural rights is the true purpose and test of government.
      And against whatever law, custom or device that restrains men in the exercise
      of their natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness I shall
      raise my voice.</p>
  <p>Confident in the strength of truth, I shall give no quarter to abuses and
      ask none from their champions. <strong>The political corruption that shames
      our democracy,</strong> the false theories that assume that a nation's
      prosperity lies in shutting itself in from free intercourse with other
      nations, the stupid fiscal system
      that piles up hundreds of millions of dollars in our treasury vaults while
      we are paying interest on an enormous debt; the aping of foreign nations
      that insists upon standing armies and navies modeled on aristocratic plans;
      the
      judicial system that offers a mockery of justice on one side and condones
      evildoing on the other; the false philanthropy that gives a dole while
      it denies a right;
      the lip worship of a just God and the heart worship of the Golden Calf &#8212; all
      these are to my mind parts of one connected whole whose foundations are
      in the denial of the equal rights of man to the use of Nature's bounty;
      and in
      attacking and exposing them as opportunity may offer, I shall render easier
      the exposure and abolition of the great wrong from which they primarily
      spring. ... <a href="../HG/short/Salutatory_1887Std.htm">read the whole column</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>    Take, for instance, protectionism. What support it has, beyond the mere selfish
      desire of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their goods are
      worth, springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not consumption,
      is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s-worth,
      and to sell more profitable than to buy; and above all from a desire to
      limit competition, springing from an unanalyzing recognition of the phenomena
      that necessarily follow when men who have the need to labor are deprived
      by monopoly of access to the natural and indispensable element of all labor.
      Its methods involve the idea that governments can more wisely direct the
      expenditure of labor and the investment of capital than can laborers and
      capitalists, and that the men who control governments will use this power
      for the general good and not in their own interests. <strong>They tend
      to multiply officials, restrict liberty, invent crimes. They promote perjury,
      fraud
      and corruption.</strong> And they would, were the theory carried to its logical
      conclusion, destroy civilization and reduce mankind to savagery.</p>
  <p>    Take trades-unionism. While within narrow lines trades-unionism promotes
      the idea of the mutuality of interests, and often helps to raise courage
      and further political education, and while it has enabled limited bodies
      of working-men to improve somewhat their condition, and gain, as it were,
      breathing-space, yet it takes no note of the general causes that determine
      the conditions of labor, and strives for the elevation of only a small
      part of the great body by means that cannot help the rest. Aiming at the
      restriction of competition &#8212; the limitation of the right to labor,
      its methods are like those of an army, which even in a righteous cause
      are subversive of liberty and liable to abuse, while its weapon, the strike,
      is destructive in its nature, both to combatants and non-combatants, being
      a form of passive war. To apply the principle of trades-unions to all industry,
      as some dream of doing, would be to enthrall men in a caste system.</p>
  <p>Or take even such moderate measures as the limitation of working-hours and
    of the labor of women and children. They are superficial in looking no further
    than to the eagerness of men and women and little children to work unduly,
    and in proposing forcibly to restrain overwork while utterly ignoring its
    cause &#8212; the sting of poverty that forces human beings to it. <strong>And
    the methods by which these restraints must be enforced, multiply officials,
    interfere
    with personal liberty, tend to corruption, and are liable to abuse.</strong> ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  of society, as a standing army is to an unorganized mob. It gains intensity
  and energy in its specialization, and in the wealth it takes from the general
  stock finds power to mold opinion. Leisure and culture and the circumstances
  and conditions that command respect accompany wealth, and intellectual ability
  is attracted by it. On the other hand, those who suffer from the injustice
  that takes from the many to enrich the few, are in that very thing deprived
  of the leisure to think, and the opportunities, education, and graces necessary
  to give their thought acceptable expression. They are necessarily the "unlettered," the "ignorant," the "vulgar," prone

WE may be wise to distrust our knowledge; and, unless we have tested them, to
distrust what we may call our reasonings; but never to distrust reason itself.
. . . That the powers with which the human reason must work are limited and are
subject to faults and failures, our reason itself teaches us as soon as it begins
to examine what we find around us and to endeavor to look in upon our own consciousness.
But human reason is the only reason that men can have, and to assume that in
so far as it can see clearly it does not see truly, is in the man who does it
not only to assume the possession of a superior to human reason, but it is to
deny the validity of all thought and to reduce the mental world to chaos. &#8212; <em><a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe305.html">The

  <p>Indirect taxation costs the real tax-payers much more than the government
    receives, partly because the middlemen through whose hands taxed commodities
    pass are able to exact compound profits upon the tax,8 and partly on account
    of extraordinary expenses of original collection;9<strong> it favors corruption
    in government by concealing from the people the fact that they contribute
    to
    the support of government; </strong>and it tends, by obstructing production,
    to crush legitimate industry and establish monopolies.10 The questions it
    raises are

  <p><font size="-1"><strong>4. CONFORMITY TO GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION</strong></font></p>
  <p> The single tax conforms most closely to the essential principles of Adam
    Smith's four classical maxims, which are stated best by Henry George 19 as
    follows:</p>
  <p>The best tax by which public revenues can be raised is evidently that which
    will closest conform to the following conditions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> That it bear as lightly as possible upon production &#8212; so as least
      to check the increase of the general fund from which taxes must be paid
      and the community maintained. 20</li>
    <li> That it be easily and cheaply collected, and fall as directly as may
      be upon the ultimate payers &#8212; so as to take from the people as little
      as possible in addition to what it yields the government. 21</li>
    <li> That it be certain &#8212; so as to give the least opportunity for tyranny
      or corruption on the part of officials, and the least temptation to law-breaking
      and evasion on the part of the tax-payers. 22</li>
    <li> That it bear equally &#8212; so as to give no citizen an advantage or
      put any at a disadvantage, as compared with others. 23</li>
  </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">19. &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book viii. ch.iii. </font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">20. This is the second part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim.
        He states it as follows: &quot;Every tax ought to be so contrived as
        both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little
        as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of
        the state. A tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the
        people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the
        four following ways: . . . Secondly, it may obstruct the industry of
        the people, and discourage them from applying to certain branches of
        business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes.
        While it obliges the people to pay, it may thus diminish or perhaps destroy
        some of the funds which might enable them more easily to do so.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 21. This is the first part of Adam Smith's fourth maxim,
        in which he condemns a tax that takes out of the pockets of the people
        more than it brings into the public treasury.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 22. This is Adam Smith's second maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to
        be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment,
        the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor
        and to every other person. Where it is otherwise, every person subject
        to the tax is put more or less in the power of the tax gatherer.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> 23. This is Adam Smith's first maxim. He states it as
        follows: &quot;The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards
        the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to
        their respective abilities, that is to say, in proportion to the revenue
        which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state. The
        expense of government to the individuals of a great nation is like the
        expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate, who are
        all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests
        in the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what
        is called the equality or inequality of taxation.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> In changing this Mr. George says (&quot;<em>Progress
          and Poverty,&quot; book viii, ch. iii, subd. 4</em>): &quot;Adam Smith
          speaks of incomes as enjoyed 'under the protection of the state'; and
          this is the ground upon which the equal taxation of all species of
          property is commonly insisted upon &#8212; that it is equally protected
          by the state. The basis of this idea is evidently that the enjoyment
          of property is made possible by the state &#8212; that there is a value
          created and maintained by the community; which is justly called upon
          to meet community expenses. Now, of what values is this true? Only
          of the value of land. This is a value that does not arise until a community
          is formed, and that, unlike other values, grows with the growth of
          the community. It only exists as the community exists. Scatter again
          the largest community, and land, now so valuable, would have no value
          at all. With every increase of population the value of land rises;
          with every decrease it falls. This is true of nothing else save of
          things which, like the ownership of land, are in their nature monopolies.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1"> Adam Smith's third maxim refers only to conveniency of
        payment, and gives countenance to indirect taxation, which is in conflict
        with the principle of his fourth maxim. Mr. George properly excludes
        it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>a. Interference with Production</em><br />
      <br />
  Indirect taxes tend to check production and cause scarcity, by obstructing
  the processes of production. They fall upon men <em>as</em> they work, <em>as</em> they
  do business, <em>as</em> they invest capital productively. 24 But the single
  tax, which must be paid and be the same in amount regardless of whether the
  payer works or plays, of whether he invests his capital productively or wastes
  it, of whether he uses his land for the most productive purposes 25 or in lesser
  degree or not at all, removes fiscal penalties from industry and thrift, and
  tends to leave production free. It therefore conforms more closely than indirect
  taxation to the first maxim quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">24. &quot;Taxation which falls upon the processes of production
        interposes an artificial obstacle to the creation of wealth. Taxation
        which falls upon labor as it is exerted, wealth as it is used as capital,
        land as it is cultivated, will manifestly tend to discourage production
        much more powerfully than taxation to the same amount levied upon laborers
        whether they work or play, upon wealth whether used productively or unproductively,
        or upon land whether cultivated or left waste&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress
        and Poverty, book viii, ch. iii, subd. I.</em></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">25. It is common, besides taxing improvements, as fast
        as they are made, to levy higher taxes upon land when put to its best
        use than when put to partial use or to no use at all. This is upon the
        theory that when his land is used the owner gets full income from it
        and can afford to pay high taxes; but that he gets little or no income
        when the land is out of use, and so cannot afford to pay much. It is
        an absurd but perfectly legitimate illustration of the pretentious doctrine
        of taxation according to ability to pay.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Examples are numerous. Improved building lots, and even
        those that are only plotted for improvement, are usually taxed more than
        contiguous unused and unplotted land which is equally in demand for building
        purposes and equally valuable. So coal land, iron land, oil land, and
        sugar land are as a rule taxed less as land when opened up for appropriate
        use than when lying idle or put to inferior uses, though the land value
        be the same. Any serious proposal to put land to its appropriate use
        is commonly regarded as a signal for increasing the tax upon it.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>b. Cheapness of Collection</em></p>
  <p>Indirect taxes are passed along from first payers to final consumers through
    many exchanges, accumulating compound profits as they go, until they take
    enormous sums from the people in addition to what the government receives.26
    But the single tax takes nothing from the people in excess of the tax. It
    therefore conforms more closely than indirect taxation to the second maxim
    quoted above.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">26. &quot;All taxes upon things of unfixed quantity increase
        prices, and in the course of exchange are shifted from seller to buyer,
        increasing as they go. If we impose a tax on money loaned, as has been
        often attempted, the lender will charge the tax to the borrower, and
        the borrower must pay it or not obtain the loan. If the borrower uses
        it in his business, he in his turn must get back the tax from his customers,
        or his business becomes unprofitable. If we impose a tax upon buildings,
        the users of buildings must finally pay it, for the erection of buildings
        will cease until building rents become high enough to pay the regular
        profit and the tax besides. If we impose a tax upon manufactures or imported
        goods, the manufacturer or importer will charge it in a higher price
        to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer. and the retailer to the consumer.
        Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately falls, must not only
        pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this amount to everyone
        who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital he has advanced
        in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit on the capital
        he has advanced in paying for goods.&quot; &#8212; <em>Progress and Poverty,
        book viii, ch. iii, subd. 2.</em></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>c. Certainty</em></p>
  <p>No other tax, direct or indirect, conforms so closely to the third maxim. &quot;Land
    lies out of doors.&quot; It cannot be hidden; it cannot be &quot;accidentally&quot; overlooked.
    Nor can its value be seriously misstated. Neither under-appraisement nor
    over-appraisement to any important degree is possible without the connivance
    of the whole community. 27 The land values of a neighborhood are matters
    of common knowledge. Any intelligent resident can justly appraise them, and
    every other intelligent resident can fairly test the appraisement. Therefore,
    the tyranny, corruption, fraud, favoritism, and evasions that are so common
    in connection with the taxation of imports, manufactures, incomes, personal
    property, and buildings &#8212; the values of which, even when the object
    itself cannot be hidden, are so distinctly matters of minute special knowledge
    that only experts can fairly appraise them &#8212; would be out of the question
    if the single tax were substituted for existing fiscal methods. 28</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">27. The under-appraisements so common at present, and
        alluded to in note 25, are possible because the community, ignorant of
        the just principles of taxation, does connive at them. Under-appraisements
        are not secret crimes on the part of assessors; they are distinctly recognized,
        but thoughtlessly disregarded when not actually insisted upon, by the
        people themselves. And this is due to the dishonest ideas of taxation
        that are taught. Let the vicious doctrine that people ought to pay taxes
        according to their ability give way to the honest principle that they
        should pay in proportion to the benefits they receive, which benefits,
        as we have already seen, are measured by the land values they own, and
        underappraisement of land would cease. No assessor can befool the community
        in respect of the value of the land within his jurisdiction.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And, with the cessation of general under-appraisement,
        favoritism in individual appraisements also would cease. General under-appraisement
        fosters unfair individual appraisements. If land were generally appraised
        at its full value, a particular unfair appraisement would stand out in
        such relief that the crime of the assessor would be exposed. But now
        if a man's land is appraised at a higher valuation than his neighbor's
        equally valuable land, and he complains of the unfairness, he is promptly
        and effectually silenced with a warning that his land is worth much more
        than it is appraised at, anyhow, and if he makes a fuss his appraisement
        will be increased. To complain further of the deficient taxation of his
        neighbor is to invite the imposition of a higher tax upon himself.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">28. If you wish to test the merits in point of certainty
        of the single tax as compared with other taxes, go to a real estate agent
        in your community, and, showing him a building lot upon the map, ask
        him its value. If he inquires about the improvements, instruct him to
        ignore them. He will be able at once to tell you what the lot is worth.
        And if you go to twenty other agents their estimates will not materially
        vary from his. Yet none of the agents will have left his office. Each
        will have inferred the value from the size and location of the lot.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">But suppose when you show the map to the first agent you
        ask him the value of the land and its improvements. He will tell you
        that he cannot give an estimate until he examines the improvements. And
        if it is the highly improved property of a rich man he will engage building
        experts to assist him. Should you ask him to include the value of the
        contents of the buildings, he would need a corps of selected experts,
        including artists and liverymen, dealers in furniture and bric-a-brac,
        librarians and jewelers. Should you propose that he also include the
        value of the occupant's income, the agent would throw up his hands in
        despair.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">If without the aid of an army of experts the agent should
        make an estimate of these miscellaneous values, and twenty others should
        do the same, their several estimates would be as wide apart as ignorant
        guesses usually are. And the richer the owner of the property the lower
        as a proportion would the guesses probably be.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Now turn the real estate agent into an assessor, and is
        it not plain that he would appraise the land values with much greater
        certainty and cheapness than he could appraise the values of all kinds
        of property? With a plot map before him he might fairly make every appraisement
        without leaving his desk at the town hall.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">And there would be no material difference if the property
        in question were a farm instead of a building lot. A competent farmer
        or business man in a farming community can, without leaving his own door-yard,
        appraise the value of the land of any farm there; whereas it would be
        impossible for him to value the improvements, stock, produce, etc., without
        at least inspecting them.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>d. Equality</strong></em></p>
  <p>In respect of the fourth maxim the single tax bears more equally&#8212; that
    is to say, more justly &#8212; than any other tax. It is the only tax that

  <p>    <em>Q5. If the full rental value were taken would it not produce too much revenue
      and encourage official extravagance? If only what was needed for an economical
      administration of government, would not land still have a speculative value?</em><br>
    A. In the first part of your question you are thinking of a vast centralized
    government as administering public revenues. With the revenues raised locally,
    each locality being assessed for its contribution to the state and the nation,
    there would be no such danger. <strong>The possibility of this danger would
    be still further reduced by the fact that private business would then offer
    greater
    pecuniary prizes than would public office, wherefore public office would
    be sought for purer purposes than as money-making opportunities. As to the
    second part of your question, the speculative value of land would be wiped
    out as soon as the tax on land values was high enough and that on improvement
    values low enough to make production more profitable than speculation.</strong> And
    this point would be reached long before the whole rental value was absorbed
    in taxation. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
  <p>... The third great principle which Henry George gave his life to promote
      was the necessity for government, especially in democracies, to free its processes
      from the influence of corruption. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read

<p>Charles T. Root &#8212; <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">Not a Single Tax!</a> (1925)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Briefly defined the land value or economic rent of any piece of ground is
      the largest annual amount voluntarily offered for the exclusive use of that
      ground, or of an equivalent parcel, independent of improvements thereon. Every
      holder or user of land pays economic rent, but he now pays most of it to the
      wrong party. The aggregate economic rent of the territory occupied by any political
      unit is, as has been stated above, always sufficient, usually more than sufficient,
      for the legitimate expenses of the government of that unit. As also stated
      above, the economic rent belongs to the community, and not to individual landowners.
      ... </p>
  <p>Under the normal system which this article advocates, the user of land would
      pay substantially the same economic rent as now, for the reason that economic
      rent is fixed by the payer and not by the payee; but it would be paid to
    the credit of the community instead of for the benefit of the individual
    landowner.
      And the economic rent is all the land user would have to pay; no taxes
    on industry or personal product and no other forced contribution for governmental
    purposes. ...</p>
  <p>This principle of economic rent applies to all the users of land, including
      mining, use of waterpower, and rights of way over or under its surface. Had
      this principle always been recognized, and the economic rent always been retained
      by the community, taxation would never have been heard of. When the economic
      rent is reclaimed by the community, the need of taxation will disappear.</p>
  <p>Let us roughly restate the proposition: All members of the community having
      a joint right to the income which the social advantages of the land will command,
      they are all partners in this income.</p>
  <p>Therefore, when one of their number wishes to take for his private use a parcel
      of this land, he should buy out his partners, i.e., the rest of the community,
      by paying regularly into the common treasury the economic rent of that parcel,
      instead of paying, as at present, the purchase price, i.e., the right to collect
      the economic rent, in a lump, to some other individual who has no more original
      right to it than himself.</p>
  <p>But before this time the reader, unless he has given previous attention
    to the subject, is full of objections to the above doctrine: &quot;How about the
      law?&quot; he is asking. &quot;Hasn't a man the right to buy a piece of land
      as cheaply as he can, to do what he pleases with it, and hold on to it till
      he gets ready to sell?&quot; The answer is that at present he certainly
      has this statutory right, which has been so long and so universally recognized
      that most people suppose it to be not only a legal, but a real or equitable
      right. A shrewd man, foreseeing the direction of growth of population in
      a
      city, for example, can buy a well-located block at a moderate figure from
      some less far-seeing owner, can let it grow up to weeds, fence it off against
      all
      comers and give it no further attention except to pay the very small tax
      usually imposed upon vacant land.</p>
  <p>Meantime the increasing community builds up all around it with homes, banks,
      stores, churches, schools, paving and lighting the streets, giving police and
      fire protection, etc., and at last comes to need this block so urgently that
      the owner is fairly begged to sell it, at three or ten or fifty times what
      it cost him. Quite often the purchaser at this enormous advance is the very
      community which has through its presence and the expenditure of its taxes created
      practically the whole value of the land in question!</p>
  <p>It was said above that an individual has a statutory right to pursue this
      very common course. That was an error. The statement should have been that
      he has a statutory wrong; for no disinterested person can follow the course
      of land speculation as almost universally practiced, without feeling its rank
      injustice. ...</p>
  <p>Being the high financiers of their days and generations, they managed to
    contrive taxes which could be plausibly and gradually imposed upon the landless,
    until
      within a few generations they had succeeded in shifting most of the cost
    of government on to the plebeians without giving up a foot of land or any
    considerable
      part of the income therefrom. The &quot;common people&quot; were deftly
      loaded with the heavy end of the beam, which they have been carrying ever
      since; while
      the arbitrarily created landlords and their successors, down to the present
      day, have kept their tight hold on the community's natural income.</p>
  <p>The landlords, being also the lawmakers, have seen to it that their tenure
      of this easy money should not be disturbed, but on the contrary have so buttressed
      it with centuries of legislation, precedents, and judicial decisions, that
      any proposition to hark back to the terms of the original bargain, whereby
      the owners of the land agreed to pay the expenses of the government, is now
      denounced as anarchy and sacrilege.</p>
  <p>      Lapse of time, however, never can transform wrong into right, nor can a buyer
        acquire any better title than the seller possessed. The economic rent belongs
        to the community, which can and will begin to reclaim it as soon as the voters
        thoroughly awake to the facts and the right and wrong of the matter, which
        are not hard to grasp when the subject is presented in its simplest form.<font size="+1"><strong>    ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>... That the latter has no good right to it is at once evident when we remember
      that &quot;When one man gets something for nothing somebody else has got to
      give something for nothing.&quot; Here are $20,000 that some men and women
      have got to work to earn every year to hand over to a man who does not
      render, and does not feel any obligation to render, one dollar's worth
      of public or
      private service in return. Such is the wild travesty of justice which we
      call law. It is not comical only because it is frankly tragic in its social
      results.</p>
  <p>Now suppose this $20,000 and all the rest of this same community product &#8212; i.e.,
      the site or location rent of its ground &#8212; were paid every year to
      its rightful owner, the treasurer of New York City, what would become of
      taxation,
      with its inseparable retinue, Fraud, Evasion, Perjury, Inequality, and
      an all-pervading public sense of injustice?<br>
      <br>
      An authority on municipal taxation estimates the present economic rent of the
      land embraced in the City of New York at from $350,000,000 to $400,000,000.
      Assuming the lesser of these figures and adding the receipts from licenses,
      fees and fines, New York City should receive, of her own income, enough to
      pay all her own legitimate bills, to make her proper contributions to county
      and state and build a new subway or its equivalent every year.</p>
  <p>And this with nobody paying a dollar of taxes, or, if we except the fines,
      a dollar that he was not ready and glad to pay for his own advantage.</p>
  <p>We repeat, this is not taxation; but for the sake of those who cannot grasp
      the idea of public revenue without taxation, let us state the matter in their
      own language.</p>
  <p>Think of a tax which both assesses itself and collects itself, which burdens
      no one, which is paid voluntarily, and only by those who do so for their
    own profit or other advantage. Compare this with our present system of taxes,
    which
      everyone despises, which can be collected in full only from the very scrupulous
      and from the helpless, from trust funds of widows and orphans, or from
    estates which lie naked before the tax gatherer on the records of court;
    a system which
      drives men of property from state to state and town to town in flight from
      the assessor, and well-nigh forces many worthy citizens to practices of
    evasion which must make it hard for them to look into their own mirrors during
    the
      season for &quot;Correction of Assessments;&quot; there can be but one
      verdict upon such comparison. ... <a href="../docs/Root_NaST.html">read the whole article</a></p>
