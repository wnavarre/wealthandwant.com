<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>Property taxes are the most common way
  to fund many local services.&nbsp; In California in 1978, the voters opted
  for Proposition 13, which (a) limited the sales tax to 1% of the assessed
  value of each property; and (b) limited annual increases in assessed values
  to the lesser of 2% or the increase in the cost of living for the year,
  with the exception that upon the sale of a property, the assessment would be
  updated to the transaction price. The effects of this have been
  widespread and of great impact on the well-being of Californians.&nbsp;  </p>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Homeownership, which is among the lowest
        of all the states in the US, increased among those who in 1978 were of
        prime homeowning age and dropped among all younger age groups.&nbsp; </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Commercial properties, which change hands
              infrequently, are paying a lower share of property taxes because
        of Proposition 13's protections.&nbsp; </div>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Young

                  located cottages and huge apartment complexes &#8212;  and
                  then, they
          and California's tenants, who are a large share of the population,
        also are
                faced with sales and other taxes.&nbsp; </div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The negative effects are

    merit.&nbsp; Those
      who have bought more recently are carrying a larger share than they should
      be &#8212; and they must also pay income and sales taxes, and parcel taxes,
      on top of that. Those who own waterfront or waterview properties, which
      appreciate
      much faster, are getting fabulous bargains on their property taxes&#8212;      at the expense of those who own small, poorly located properties.&nbsp; Amazingly,
      the US Supreme Court has approved this!&nbsp; (One would like to think
      that, had they had the benefit of an additional 10 years of data, they
      could not
      have reached the same conclusion.&nbsp; They ruled in 1992.) </p>
  <p>Warren Buffett
          attempted to call attention to the iniquities and inequities of Proposition
          13 during the gubernatorial race of 2003, but was ordered to silence,
      which he
          kept until after the election. Proposition 13 is known as the third
          rail of California politics.  One would think that with a homeownership
          rate of only slightly over 50%, this terribly unjust structure would
          be politically vulnerable, especially in view of the evils it has produced.<br>

          Georgists seek to eliminate or at least reduce taxes on buildings, and
          assert that higher taxes on land values will promote the common good,
          and that ceilings
          on property taxes, such as Proposition 13, cause far
        more harm than taxes on buildings create. <br>

        Mason Gaffney's article, "<a href="../docs/Gaffney_WOSC97.html">Who
        Owns Southern California?</a>" includes a lot of parcels which are
        large and have not changed hands in decades.&nbsp; Many of them collect
        a lot of rent and pay little in property taxes, shifting the costs of
        providing services onto individuals &#8212; often the same individuals
        who are paying that rent! </p>
  <p>A May, 2006, Federal Reserve Board study found that in the top 46 metro
    markets, land accounted for, on average, 50.9% of the value of single-family
    housing stock, in 2004. The study reported that in the remainder of the country,
    the corresponding value, for 2000, was about 27%. The 50.9% figure ranged
    from a low of 23.3% in Oklahoma City to a high of 88.5% in the San Francisco
    metro. <font size="-1">(source:</font> <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2006/200625/index.html">http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2006/200625/index.html</a><font size="-1">;

  <p>Proposition 13, and other legislation similar to it, are
      to be avoided at all costs by states and muncipalities and societies which
      claim to be run by rationality and/or by the golden rule. They have produced
    a state in which the poor labor to line the pockets of (1) those who own
    the land and (2) those who will lend them money to buy that land from them.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Territorial
expansion:</b> Regional cross-subsidy, with subeconomic extension of
public works and services. George&#8217;s critique of land speculation
came to be focused on
&#8220;<b>Speculator Type
#1</b>,&#8221; who withholds good lands from timely use. Georgists
have neglected to condemn the counterpart
&#8220;<b>Speculator Type
#2</b>,&#8221; who acquires marginal lands cheaply, and then lobbies
public agencies to extend roads, utilities, military and police
protection, and other public services to them, below cost. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some Georgists may even see this
as a legitimate way, and an
easier way, to combat the artificial scarcity of land that Speculator
Type #1 causes &#8211; a way of perpetuating the &#8220;frontier
safety-valve.&#8221; However, it unbalances development severely: too
much roading, et al., too little use of the land thus &#8220;opened
up.&#8221; Some taxpayer must pay for the roading et al. If the taxes
are activity-based or improvement-based (i.e. anything but land
taxes) they will sterilize marginal land, and lower the intensity of
use of all land.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In my political experiences, one
collects more cuts and bruises
combating Speculators Type #2 than Type #1. I was, for example, able
to lead the local countywide campaign against Howard Jarvis&#8217;
&#8220;Proposition 13&#8221; without being seriously punished, but a
few years later when I led the campaign against southern
California&#8217;s favorite public water-works boondoggle, the
&#8220;Peripheral Canal,&#8221; my academic and professional world
collapsed about me. Earlier, when I joined the furor against American
imperialism (Gaffney, 1971) and the myth of infinite natural
resources (Gaffney, 1972), I became persona non grata at Resources
for the Future, Inc., where I then worked. In British Columbia, 1975,
I learned that the self-styled &#8220;socialist&#8221; government under
Premier David Barrett was unwilling even to consider withdrawing any
of its expensive cross-subsidies to speculators Type #2, and resented
me for raising the issue. The moose-pastures of northern B.C.
&#8220;are a mighty empire,&#8221; they told me, and the rich retirees
on the Gulf Islands are important constituents who should have both
their subsidized ferry service and their exclusionary zoning to keep
hoi polloi from sharing it. I have war stories, but the objective
point is that the socio-political bias for territorial expansion is
even stronger than the bias against cultivating, intensifying and
renewing our internal frontiers. The Georgist dream of taxing central
rents to finance public services becomes a nightmare when the public
money is dissipated in enriching Speculators Type #2. This kind of
spending not only dissipates rents, and wastes capital, at the same
time it despoils the environment. Worst of all, as the subeconomic
land development proceeds, each new settlement makes a platform for
the next, so there is no end to it short of the limits of capital and
of Earth. It is perhaps fortunate for Earth that, historically, the
limits of capital have been reached first, at the ends of bursts of
territorial overexpansion. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The true purposes of government are well stated in the preamble to the Constitution
    of the United States, as they are in the Declaration of Independence. To
    insure the general peace, to promote the general welfare, to secure to each
    individual the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &#8212; these
    are the proper ends of government, and are therefore the ends which in every
    scheme of taxation should be kept in mind.</p>
  <p>As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
    limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation, if
    the increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could
    not be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.
    Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
    and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained
    in this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York
    a more desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and
    light could be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied
    to each house at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual
    effort, or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to
    give every one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average
    resident, the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be
    increased burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York
    would become a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn
    taxation as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional
    provision, as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our
    States has been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction
    upon the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is
    the far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his
    proposition that all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain
    brief term &#8212; a proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth
    that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have
    no control over it, and can give no title to any part of it. But restriction
    upon public debts is a very different thing from restriction upon the power
    of taxation, and reasons which urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor
    is increased taxation necessarily proof of governmental extravagance. Increase
    in taxation is in the order of social development, for the reason that social
    development tends to the doing of things collectively that in a ruder state
    are done individually, to the giving to government of new functions and the
    imposing of new duties. Our public schools and libraries and parks, our signal
    service and fish commissions and agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations,
    are evidences of this.</p>
  <p><strong>But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation,
      the method of taxation is of supreme importance.</strong> A horse may be anchored by fastening
    to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
    him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of
    a cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
    So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
    a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
    would hardly be felt.</p>
  <p><strong>Now discarding all idea that there rests upon us any obligation to equally
    tax all kinds of property, and assuming for our guidance the true rule, that
    taxation should be levied with a view to the promotion of the general prosperity,
    the securing of substantial equality, and the recognition of inalienable
    rights, let us consider upon what species of property it may be best laid.</strong></p>
  <p>To consider what is included in the category of property is to see the absurdity
    of saying that all property should be equally taxed. For not to speak of
    minor differences that arise from application and use, there are commonly
    included under this term things of essentially different nature. Whatever
    is recognized by municipal law as subject to ownership is property. But between
    things thus classed together are wide differences. In the first place, there
    are certain of them which have in themselves no value, but are merely the
    representatives or doubles of property in itself valuable. Such are stocks,
    bonds, mortgages, promissory notes of all kinds, whether made by individuals
    or issued by governments to serve as money, solvent debts, book-accounts,
    etc. These things may be to the individual valuable property, and are correctly
    included in any estimate of his wealth. But they are no part of the wealth
    of the community. Their increase does not make the community a whit the richer;
    and they may be utterly destroyed without the community becoming a whit the
    poorer. If I buy a horse, giving my note for the amount, the result of the
    transaction (supposing me to be solvent) is that the seller gets property
    to the value of the horse, while I get the horse. But there has been no increase
    in wealth. To the seller, my note may be quite as good as the horse, and
    in estimating his wealth it may be as properly included as the horse; but
    if the note be destroyed, the community is nothing the poorer, while if the
    horse break his neck, there is a lessening of the general wealth by one horse.
    And so, the issuance of bonds by a government, or the watering of stock by
    a corporation, can in no wise increase the general sum of wealth, nor will
    any diminution either in the amount or in the selling price of such bonds
    or stock reduce it. If all the governments of the world were to repudiate
    their debts tomorrow, an immense amount of property, now carefully guarded,
    would become waste paper, and thousands of people now rich would be made
    poor, but the wealth of the human race would not be diminished one iota.</p>
  <p>These are truisms. Yet so widespread and persistent is the notion that all
    property should be taxed, that they are generally ignored. Nothing is clearer
    than that when a farmer who wants more capital puts a mortgage on his farm,
    no new value is thereby created. Yet, in most of our States, both the farm
    and the mortgage are taxed; though so obvious is the double taxation that
    in some of them the clumsy expedient of making an exemption to the debtor
    is resorted to.</p>
  <p>But it is manifest that property of this kind is not a fit subject for taxation,
    and ought not to be considered in making up the assessment rolls. It has,
    in itself, no value. It is merely the representative, or token, of value &#8212; the
    certificate of ownership, or the obligation to pay value. It either represents
    other property, or property yet to be brought into existence. And, as nothing
    real can be drawn from that which is not real, taxation upon property of
    this kind must ultimately fall, either upon the property represented, in
    which case there is double taxation, or upon those whose obligations it expresses,
    in which case men are taxed, not upon what they own, but upon what they owe;
    and all cumbrous devices to prevent the unjust effects of such taxation,
    like other complications of the revenue system, simply give to the stronger
    and more unscrupulous opportunities of throwing the burden upon the weaker
    and more conscientious. Property of this kind ought not to be taxed at all.
    Property in itself valuable is clearly that with which any wise scheme of
    taxation should alone deal.</p>
  <p>To consider the nature of property of this kind is again to see a clear
    distinction. That distinction is not, as the lawyers have it, between movables
    and immovables, between personal property and real estate. The true distinction
    is between property which is, and property which is not, the result of human
    labor; or, to use the terms of political economy, between land and wealth.
    For, in any precise use of the term, land is not wealth, any more than labor
    is wealth. Land and labor are the factors of production. Wealth is such result
    of their union as retains the capacity of ministering to human desire. A
    lot and the house which stands upon it are alike property, alike have a tangible
    value, and are alike classed as real estate. But there are between them the
    most essential differences. The one is the free gift of Nature, the other
    the result of human exertion; the one exists from generation to generation,
    while men come and go; the other is constantly tending to decay, and can
    only be preserved by continual exertion. To the one, the right of exclusive
    possession, which makes it individual property, can, like the right of property
    in slaves, be traced to nothing but municipal law; to the other, the right
    of exclusive property springs clearly from those natural relations which
    are among the primary perceptions of the human mind. Nor are these mere abstract
    distinctions. They are distinctions of the first importance in determining
    what should and what should not be taxed.</p>
  <p>For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human exertion,
    it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the general prosperity,
    it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of revenue while
    there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to land. <strong>We
    may tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree
    lessening
    the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement to use
    land.</strong> But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to the production
    of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. <strong>We might take the
    whole value of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land worth
    nothing, and
    the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. The effect would
    be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its capabilities,
    which are brought out by increased population.</strong> But impose anything like such
    taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth would
    be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable wealth
    would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon be
    the silence of desolation.</p>
  <p>And the reason of this difference is clear. The possession of wealth is
    the inducement to the exertion necessary to the production and maintenance
    of wealth. Men do not work for the pleasure of working, but to get the things
    their work will give them. And to tax the things that are produced by exertion
    is to lessen the inducement to exertion. But over and above the benefit to
    the possessor, which is the stimulating motive to the production of wealth,
    there is a benefit to the community, for no matter how selfish he may be,
    it is utterly impossible for any one to entirely keep to himself the benefit
    of any desirable thing he may possess. These diffused benefits when localized
    give value to land, and this may be taxed without in any wise diminishing
    the incentive to production.</p>
  <p>To illustrate: A man builds a fine house or large factory in a poorly improved
    neighborhood. To tax this building and its adjuncts is to make him pay for
    his enterprise and expenditure &#8212; to take from him part of his natural
    reward. But the improvement thus made has given new beauty or life to the
    neighborhood, making it a more desirable place than before for the erection
    of other houses or factories, and additional value is given to land all about.
    Now to tax improvements is not only to deprive of his proper reward the man
    who has made the improvement, but it is to deter others from making similar
    improvements. But, instead of taxing improvements, to tax these land values
    is to leave the natural inducement to further improvement in full force,
    and at the same time to keep down an obstacle to further improvement, which,
    under the present system, improvement itself tends to raise. For the advance
    of land values which follows improvement, and even the expectation of improvement,
    makes further improvement more costly.</p>
  <p>See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. Before he can put this land to the
    use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away. In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p>Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. The elevated
    railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury. The elevated railroads ought not to be
    taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. It is the increased land values which
    they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares.</p>
  <p>So with railroads everywhere. And so not alone with railroads, but with
    all industrial enterprises. So long as we consider that community most prosperous
    which increases most rapidly in wealth, so long is it the height of absurdity
    for us to tax wealth in any of its beneficial forms. We should tax what we
    want to repress, not what we want to encourage. We should tax that which
    results from the general prosperity, not that which conduces to it. It is
    the increase of population, the extension of cultivation, the manufacture
    of goods, the building of houses and ships and railroads, the accumulation
    of capital, and the growth of commerce that add to the value of land &#8212; not
    the increase in the value of land that induces the increase of population
    and increase of wealth. It is not that the land of Manhattan Island is now
    worth hundreds of millions where, in the time of the early Dutch settlers,
    it was only worth dollars, that there are on it now so many more people,
    and so much more wealth. It is because of the increase of population and
    the increase of wealth that the value of the land has so much increased.
    Increase of land values tends of itself to repel population and prevent improvement.
    And thus the taxation of land values, unlike taxation of other property,
    does not tend to prevent the increase of wealth, but rather to stimulate
    it. It is the taking of the golden egg, not the choking of the goose that
    lays it.</p>
  <p>Every consideration of policy and ethics squares with this conclusion. The
    tax upon land values is the most economically perfect of all taxes. It does
    not raise prices; it maybe collected at least cost, and with the utmost ease
    and certainty; it leaves in full strength all the springs of production;
    and, above all, it consorts with the truest equality and the highest justice.
    For, to take for the common purposes of the community that value which results
    from the growth of the community, and to free industry and enterprise and
    thrift from burden and restraint, is to leave to each that which he fairly
    earns, and to assert the first and most comprehensive of equal rights &#8212; the
    equal right of all to the land on which, and from which, all must live.</p>
  <p>Thus it is that the scheme of taxation which conduces to the greatest production
    is also that which conduces to the fairest distribution, and that in the
    proper adjustment of taxation lies not merely the possibility of enormously
    increasing the general wealth, but the solution of these pressing social
    and political problems which spring from unnatural inequality in the distribution
    of wealth.</p>
  <p>&quot;There is,&quot; says M. de Laveleye, in concluding that work in which
    he shows that the first perceptions of mankind have everywhere recognized
    a most vital distinction between property in land and property which results
    from labor, &#8212; &quot;there is in human affairs one system which is the
    best; it is not that system which always exists, otherwise why should we
    desire to change it; but it is that system which should exist for the greatest
    good of humanity. God knows it, and wills it; man's duty it is to discover
    and establish it.&quot; ... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

      for Negabucks: Solving the Water
  Crisis</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There&#8217;s more than one way to
skin a cat. When Henry George
wrote &#8220;We must make land common property&#8221; it was in a place
and at a time when most land in sight had been privatized only
recently, using crude methods. &#8220;Force and fraud&#8221; were not
dim memories in 1879, but a living presence. So George&#8217;s phrase
did not strike people then as being any more shocking than it is
today to remind them that the public domain, with its pasturelands,
waters, rights of way, the air, radio spectrum, fish, mineral riches
and timber, belongs to us all in common. Today, to replicate
George&#8217;s impact, we would do well to train our sights on the
public domain that is currently being privatized. <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
</strong><br>
<small>The California Constitution and Water Code, like those of most
states, are explicit that &#8220;The waters of California belong to
the people of California.&#8221; Water is not private property,
evidenced by its not being taxed as such (except indirectly, as it
adds to the value of fee simple land). Water is not, therefore,
subject to the limits that Prop. 13 (and cognate laws in other
states) impose on property tax rates. The State, as owner, can
presumably charge whatever the legislature decides, without its being
considered a tax at all. Water claimants would of course resist
strenuously, with all the lawyers and pawns and media that money can
buy, and social pressure sway, but the public has a strong case.&nbsp;

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tantamount
to ignoring land is
minimizing its weight. </span>Thus
one may acknowledge it indulgently, while actually dismissing it. In
fact, though, land comprises some half the assessed value of taxable
real estate in California, and is not dismissable. Half the assessed
value means more than half the market value because of assessment
discrimination favoring land. A raft of studies of assessment
discrimination, like the sales/assessment ratio studies of the U.S.
Census, show consistent patterns of discrimination favoring land. In
addition to ordinary assessment discrimination there is much
legislated underassessment, for land in forest, farm, country club,
and other favored uses. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>[An interesting recent case
involves Charles H. Keating, Jr. of
Arizona. He and Kemper Marley posed as farmers to secure "millions of
dollars in agricultural tax breaks on land they planned to develop."

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most states legislate similar

if we eliminated the sales tax,
and replaced it by raising the property tax?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>A. No catastrophe </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Five states and the Province of
Alberta already get along nicely
with no sales tax, so it must be possible. No state at all had a
retail sales tax before 1929 (GA). 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>California opened its gates in
1933 with the Riley-Stuart Act, and so did several other states. It
was sold as an "emergency measure," at a rate of 2%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>As late as 1977
it was 4.75%. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Now it is 7.25% statewide, with many cities, counties
and transportation districts adding their tolls to the total, but for
most of our state's existence we got along nicely with either no
sales tax, or much lower rates than today. </small><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Property Tax rate
would rise to a level lower than it was
before Prop. 13. </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Assessed Value
(A.V.)</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> of taxable
property. Add that to the
current 1%, and get 2.19%, compared to 2.7% before Prop. 13 - except
that the 2.7% was applied to actual value, while today's assessed
valuations are far below that. </span></small></li>
</ul>
<small> </small>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The A.V. value of land is probably
about 1/3 or so of market
value; buildings are closer to market.</span> </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>B. Greater equity:&nbsp; </b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The distribution of the tax burden would
shift from poor counties
to richer ones.&nbsp;</span></small><small>
</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Thus, in the poor inland counties of Fresno, Tulare,
Imperial, and Stanislaus, sales tax revenues are about 1.5% of A.V.s. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>In rich coastal and suburban counties of Sta. Barbara and
Marin,
sales tax revenues are about .75% of A.V.s. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Thus, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the state sales tax
takes a lot more money from the poor counties than it would cost them
to replace the services from local taxes; the rich counties, with the
high property tax bases, are contributing less to the common pool
than they are saving in property taxes.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Within counties, by extension and
analogy, I am reasonably certain
that a careful study will show that the burden would shift from
poorer cities and districts to richer ones. Again, among individuals,
I believe we would find the same. One of these days, God willing, I
will find the time and money to conduct or sponsor such a study. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The relevance here of this equity
question is that most states and
provinces have complex and expensive systems and formulae for "power
equalization," and the like, designed to shift resources from rich
counties to poorer ones. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">One
reason such programs are needed is to
offset the effects of the very same state sales taxes used to finance
them.</span> There are great savings to be realized by quashing this

increments and reality in California's recall
election</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California homeowners are
wallowing in unearned increments beyond
the dreams of avarice, while its governments are courting bankruptcy. <a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/pieces/Buffett_Prop13.html">Warren
Buffett</a> dared point this out, and overnight changed from
the Oracle of Omaha into the Numbskull of Nebraska because he does
not understand the "reality of California politics," the oxymoron du
jour.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most candidates for Governor fled
like startled deer. Buffett's
sponsor, well-tailored Mr. Muscles, recalled meeting a tearful widow
who said she would have been taxed out of her home were it not for
Prop 13. Poor thing, her home had risen in value. No one asked her
name, or whether she knew what she was talking about, or had her
claims audited - being a tearful widow "on a fixed income" insulates
one from reality checks. The press chimed in with pix of poster
oldsters, gazing from their multi-million dollar perches over the
blue Pacific, fretting about Buffett's solecism and its possible
effect on them, never mind anyone else.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Fact is, unearned increments ARE
income, at the time they accrue.
Illiquid? They are better than cash income because you can turn them
into cash by borrowing on them, and pay no income tax on the cash. If
you have trouble with that, the tax man himself will arrange it
for you by placing a tax lien on your appreciated home, rather than
foreclose and evict you. This helps explain why we never actually
see one of these evicted widows suffering from unearned increments --
they are maudlin figments for mythmakers. <b>The evictees we do see
are renters who couldn't pay, and had no equity to mortgage. Who
cries for them? ...
</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Only Cruz Bustamante has proposed
any specifics. He would begin
dismantling Prop 13 -- still not menacing the mythical widow -- by
raising assessments on industrial/commercial property. A whispering
campaign right off has it that Bustamante is leading an Hispanic
conspiracy to take over the southwest and turn "white, European"
Americans into a minority to kick around. We observe mixed marriages
on every hand, and Spain is still European, but this is California,
where "reality" means mythology. <span style="font-weight: bold;">May

Governor-Elect</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For better or worse, California
has recalled its governor and
elected Arnold Schwarzenegger (A.S.) to replace him. A.S. has
revealed no specifics of how he will stanch our deficit. He
campaigned on generalities: he is against taxes, against waste in
government, against measures to rein in vehicle use, and nostalgic
about the good old days when Governor Pat Brown was spending heavily
on roads and water projects. No one seems sure how he will connect
the dots. After his first visit to Sacto last week, he seemed not
sure, either.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>His choice of advisors, however,
tells us A.S. will repeat Pete
Wilson's performance from the early 1990s. Chief of Staff Patricia
Clarey is a good soldier from Wilson's old staff; Auditor Donna
Arduin is from Jeb Bush's Florida. The gurus who set the doctrinal
tone give the clearest hints: they are neo-classical economists of
deepest dye. These are advisors George Shultz and Michael Boskin
from the Hoover Institution. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economics,
to them, is a set of dismal
choices. California's choice is to cut public services, or lose
business and jobs. That is what they told Wilson in 1994. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">All taxes
are the same, always "burdens," always driving away "business."</span></span>&nbsp;
<strong>...</strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Boskin and Shultz, posing their
dismal choice for California,
dismissed by silence that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we
can raise needed revenues while also
spurring job creation and stimulating the economy. It is simple:
restore that part of the property tax that falls on land, while
continuing to cap the rate on buildings</span>. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>It is also alleged that land
values are too small to support
government. Let us test that idea.</b> In 2003, at the current
rate, there will be about 15,000 "confirmed" sales of owner-occupied
urban California residences at prices over $1 million. That is from
DataQuick, a standard source of current real estate data. 15,000 is
about 2.7% of all confirmed sales. Some of those go much higher. The
mean is probably over $2 million.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Turnover of costlier homes is
lower than that of ordinary homes. (For example, turnover of existing
homes is 30% greater in Riverside
County, with lower values, than in Orange County, with higher
values.) 2% a year is a fair guess at the turnover of homes valued
at $1 million or more. If so, there are 50 x 15,000, or 750,000 homes
in Calif valued at a mean $2 millions. Their aggregate value is
750,000 x $2million = $1.5 trillions.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These are not large buildings:
they average 2864 s.f., with 4
bdrms, 3 baths. In the north end of Sta. Monica, a vacant lot alone
is over $1m. They are not new buildings: only 9% are new. It's the
land that makes them worth so much.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">A tax of 1% on that value would
yield $15 billions a year.</span> </b>
That's from only 2.7% of the urban homes in Calif. The data exclude
many sales, country manors, for example. Some well-known lands thus
excluded are </small></div>

residential real estate.</b> A lot of it is just under $1 million a

Westwood, Brentwood, La Canada, Calabasas, and others. <span

all the other land: commercial, industrial, farm, forest, etc., which
is 60% of the assessed property value in California, and a much
higher fraction of the real value because it is so egregiously
underassessed. ...</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><b>A high fraction of California real estate is absentee owned.
</b> The Sultan of Brunei, for example, owns several houses and sites
in Beverly Hills and Bel Air. California's official Legislative

over fifty per cent of the value of taxable property in California

 href="../docs/Gaffney_PoICG.html"><small>The
Partiality of Indexing Capital
Gains</small></a><big> (1990)</big></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Now we are witnessing a major effort to revive the exclusion
of part or all of capital gains from taxable income, partly on the
grounds that much of the gains are "phantom" income, an illusion of
inflation. ...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><small></small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land is not
formed, like
capital, by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls). ...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is. ...</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small>Ignoring land and its distinctive attributes has the effect
of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
in the normal course of life and business. It lets advocates of
investing and capital formation abuse the legitimate case for macro
incentives, exploiting the case to camouflage unearned, nonfunctional
rents and increments to land value.</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tantamount to ignoring land is
minimizing its weight. </span>Thus
one may acknowledge it indulgently, while actually dismissing it. In
fact, though, land comprises some half the assessed value of taxable
real estate in California, and is not dismissable. Half the assessed
value means more than half the market value because of assessment
discrimination favoring land. A raft of studies of assessment
discrimination, like the sales/assessment ratio studies of the U.S.
Census, show consistent patterns of discrimination favoring land. In
addition to ordinary assessment discrimination there is much
legislated underassessment, for land in forest, farm, country club,
and other favored uses. ///</small><br>
<small></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">... most of us resident in
California
have been through one or more years since 1976 when the value of our
homes alone rose by more than our annual salaries. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small>We are not pushing for a general wealth tax, but for
impartiality and accurate thinking about indexing capital gains, a
policy that would protect some forms of wealth, but not others. This
apparently temperate, common-sense proposal is in fact partial and
discriminatory. Worse, it protects most where the macro social
benefits are least. </small><font><small><small><small><small><a

A Plea to Public Economists</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Land values in many parts of the United States are very high, and one
reason is supply-side restrictions. But much of the value reflects the
capitalization of amenities. Today, government works are financed in
large part by taxes on labor, profits, sales, and non-land real estate.
The owners of land receive an implicit subsidy. This implicit subsidy
is of great empirical importance, yet is not discussed in
microeconomics textbooks, and is usually ignored in the tax analysis in

Safeguarding the property tax</b></small></div>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>What happens
when a state radically
slashes its property tax?
Michiganders are saying they must wait and see, but there is no need
for that: California can show you 17 years of experience. To read
your future, just study our past. Here is what has happened since
California passed Proposition 13 in 1978.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The obvious direct results have
been to cut public services, raise
other taxes, and lose credit rating.
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Our school support fell from #5,
nationally, to #40 in 1985 when last seen, still falling. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>County road
maintenance is down to where my county (Riverside) is repaving its
roads at an annual rate of once every 130 years. Once in 20 years is
recommended here, and up north you generally need higher frequency.
You can't just build infrastructure and then stop paying for it, it's
a perpetual commitment. Thanks to urban sprawl, a high fraction of
our population now depends on these county roads.</small></li>
  <li><small>In 1978 we had a surplus in Sacramento. Since then we have
raised
business taxes, income taxes, sales taxes and gas taxes, but go broke
every June. Now our State bond rating is last among the states. One
of our richest counties (Orange) has gone bankrupt; Los Angeles is on
the brink of it, saving itself by closing emergency rooms and
hospitals that serve as a last resort for the uninsured poor.</small></li>
  <li><small>The private sector is doing badly, too. Raising income
taxes,
business taxes, and sales taxes is no way to stimulate an economy;
they are all a drag on work and enterprise. <br>
    </small></li>
  <ul>
    <li><small>Our income pc was down
from #7 to #12 among the states by 1992, then fell some more. From
1992-94, California was one of three states where median household
income fell.</small></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small>Our unemployment rate is 9%, 50% higher than the
national mean of 6%. 
      </small></li>
    <li><small>Our poverty rate is 18%, compared to 14.5%
nationally.
      </small></li>
    <li><small>Not surprisingly, therefore, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the
only government function
that grows now is building and operating prisons.</span>      </small></li>
    <li><small>One of our few
rebounding industries is cinema, the art of escaping from reality: we
excel at that. Another thriving activity is that of auctioning off
used machinery for export to the east.</small></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>In 1993 there was net outmigration (including
international
migration) from this state that has symbolized American growth since
time immemorial. It is unheard of. 426,000 people were lost, nearly
2% of the population. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This is a
watershed change: imagine of all
states California, America's trend-setter, our El Dorado, The Golden
State, our Horn of Plenty, the safety-valve for job-seekers and
retirees and entrepreneurs from everywhere, the end of the rainbow,
losing population! It's almost enough to make a person click off the
TV and think!</span></small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our fall of income pc (per capita)
is greater than appears from a
purely monetary measure. Real pay (in contrast $) has fallen more
because of the drastic rise in shelter prices. In San Francisco,
shelter takes 50 percent of the median income, with many other
cities, especially coastal ones, not far behind. It is unusual to
find livable quarters for less than $600 per month. The median home
price rose 163 percent during the 1980s to $258,000 (that is just the
median - the mean is higher). These prices are part of the C.O.L. of
all renters and new buyers, a part not fully incorporated in standard
CPI measures.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Some cities are in desperate
straits. In 1976 San Bernardino was
chosen an "AllAmerican City, A City on the Go." Go it did: today 40
percent of its people are on welfare!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California is earthquake country.
But it has always renewed
itself. It was different after the Northridge quake in the San
Fernando Valley, January 1994. This is the uppermiddle neighborhood
of Los Angeles, but now large pockets of ruined buildings remain,
unreconstructed, inhabited by vagrants and criminals: an instant
Bronx West. These ominous blighted sections portend the spread of
more blight.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It
should give one pause. It is the
expectable consequence of what
the voters did. They rejected the concept of taxing inert wealth in
favor of the alternative: taxing liquidity, cash flow, work,
production and commerce. </span>The predictable result has been to
inhibit
economic activity, and encourage holding wealth inert and stagnant.
They turned property from a functional concept into a sacred one;
from a commission to be enterprising, hire people, produce goods, and
pay taxes into a welfare entitlement.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California had a construction boom
in the late 1980s, but it was
not healthy. It was marked by extreme scatter and instability.
Downtown L.A. was to become a great new financial capital. But it now
has nearly the highest office vacancy rate in the U.S., with of
course a high rate of builder bankruptcies. Speculative builders were
led on to over-build, in part by anticipated higher land rents and
prices. This Lorelei effect was magnified by national income-tax
provisions luring on speculative builders. But we have to ask why
California fell harder than other states, even with the
object-lessons of the oil states in clear view.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>David Shulaman tersely summarized <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the
distributive effects of
Prop. 13 </span>as he left us to become Chief Equity Strategist for
Salamon
Brothers in Manhattan: <span style="font-weight: bold;">"it breached
the social compact." </span>Alienation
is the result, and the results of alienation are the Rodney King
riots, arson and looting. (The consistent leader in death rate from
violent causes is New Mexico, with the lowest property tax in the
nation.) The Watts riots, you may object, preceded Prop. 13, and you
are right. However, the Watts riots were part of a national epidemic.
By 1967 there were riots with arson and looting in 70 or more
American cities. The Rodney King riots were endemic to California,
and they spread over a much wider area of Los Angeles than the Watts
riots did. The looters and arsonists were not all black, and the
targets were not all white, but mainly Korean-Americans who just
happened to be there minding their stores.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Conventional wisdom now blames our
California bust on the end of
the Cold War. Surely that is a factor, but as a casual explanation,
it is too pat, too easy and too convenient. It shifts the load onto
impersonal historical forces - the Marxist world view. Let us see if
it can survive analysis.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Compare
today with 1945. Los
Angeles' economy depended much more
on The Hot War, 1940-1945, than it every did on The Cold War.</span>
Los
Angeles' wartime boom had swelled its population as no other great
city, 1940-45. After 1945 the U.S. pulled the plug on defense
spending, more than today. Jane Jacobs, in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Economy of Cities</span>,
tells us what happened to military spending in Los Angeles after
1945. It lost 3/4 of its aircraft workers, and 80 percent of its
shipbuilders. It lost its military and naval overseas supply and
replacement businesses. Troops stopped funneling through. It got
worse: petroleum and cinema and citrus, its traditional exports, all
declined.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pundits
then forecast a regional
collapse, but Los Angeles boomed
instead. </span>The wartime immigrants stayed. They formed creative,
innovative small businesses in large numbers, giving L.A. its
deserved reputation for having the most dynamic, flexible, adaptable
industrial base in the nation. Besides exporting goods, L.A. also
became more self-contained, providing itself with more of the goods
it previously imported. How could this be? Angelenos had access to
land, the basis of all supply and demand in any economy.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Between 1945-50, one-eighth of all
new businesses started in the
U.S. were established in L.A. They were small, creative, flexible,
miscellaneous, and too varied and dynamic to classify. No Linnaeus
could sort them in static conventional boxes; they were the despair
traditional economic geographers and base theorists who were at a
loss to explain the region's thriving economy. The new Angelenos
stayed and started producing everything for themselves, some things
previously imported, and others never seen before.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Eastern firms established branch
plants. Top eastern students came
to California's great university system and stayed behind to take
jobs and make careers here, then sent their children through
California's excellent public schools. California became famous for
supporting outstanding higher education, highways, water supplies,
public health, public safety, and other public services, all without
repelling business by taxation. There was a regional "El Dorado
Effect" as demand and supply grew together. Growing local demand
allowed for economies of scale serving local markets. Food and
shelter were cheap and abundant. Land for business was accessible,
providing a basis for the California self-contained phenomenon. A
"continental tilt" developed in both interest rates and wage rates,
drawing in eastern capital and labor. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Why is that not
continuing
today?</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The invisible, pervasive change is
due to Proposition 13, which
makes it possible to hold land at negligible tax cost. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">In 1945 land
was taxed at 3 percent every year, building a fire under holdouts to
turn their land to use. Today that same tax cost is well below 1
percent. Using Gwartney's Rule of Thumb (see below under #2, A,
"Reassessing Land Frequently") it is about 1/8 of 1 percent: a rate
of 1 percent applied to 1/8 of the true value.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Landowners are only taxed now if
they use their land to hire
people and produce something useful. Then they are confronted by the
drag of our high business and employment and sales taxes,
necessitated by the fall of property taxes. A handful of
oligopolistic landowners control most of the market; small businesses
are squeezed out. This helps us segue from being at the cutting edge
of industrial progress to a third-world economy - from the NH model
to the AL model - with little relief in sight.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What was different then? We had
high property tax rates, but they
were more focused on land than now, less on new buildings. Another
obvious difference was the lower burdens of sales tax, business tax,
and income tax. California was more hospitable to Georgist thinking
than perhaps any other state, shown by its long run of Georgist
political action in the prior thirty years. Most people today are
totally ignnorant of this subject. It has been deleted from our
history books. Here is a brief review.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Several states had "single-tax"
movements and initiatives,
1910-14, but most of them petered out. In California they continued
through 1924, and then popped up again in 1934-38. In 1934 the "EPIC"
campaign of Upton Sinclair included a strong Georgist element - he
proposed the establishment of new factories and farms on idle land.
At the same time, Jackson Ralston was pursuing a pure land tax
initiative, 1934-38.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Sinclair and Ralston lost. But the
very existence of such
political action in California, when the movement was torpid
elsewhere, tells us a lot. It reveals a large matrix of supportive
voters and workers, with effective leaders, to whom politicians
(including elected County Assessors) would naturally respond by
focusing on land assessments. Politicians survive by accommodating
and absorbing dissident movements. Even while "losing," such
campaigns raise consciousness of the issue. Thus,<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> in California,
1917, land value constituted 72 percent of the assessment roll for
property taxation.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This remained the California norm
for years. California was
different. Even into the 1960s, Sacramento County elected an avowed
single-tax Assessor, Irene Hickman; San Diego County harbored an
active movement for raising land assessments. The Henry George
Schools of San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles and Sacramento were
the most active such schools in the country: four in one state, when
most had none. State Senator Al Rodd, Chair of the Senate Finance
Committee, held hearings and tried to push land tax legislation
through his Committee in the 1960s and early 1970s. He assigned a
staffer, Jack Massen, to spend a year working out the detailed
effects on intergovernmentai relations. Assemblyman Dr. William
Filante, from a base of Georgist support in Marin County, picked up
the torch too.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>California displayed
amazing
prosperity and growth up to 1978. It
had the resilience to shrug off the loss of war industries after 1945
and still grow "explosively" (as Jane Jacobs put it). After 1978 we
suffered a string of reverses. The timing, along with a priori
causative analysis, plus direct observations too numerous to review
support an hypothesis that the reverses were aggravated by Prop. 13.
Michigan, be warned: "This Could Happen to You.&nbsp;</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Priority #2:
Enforce Good Laws </b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Reassess
Land Frequently</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><strong>In California, where we used to
have good assessment, we now have
bad assessment legally mandated by Prop. 13. </strong>So long as land is
unsold, and/or not newly improved, its assessment rise is capped at 2
percent a year, while market prices soar. Here is one example of the
results. This year the Metro Water District of Southern California
(MWD) condemned 410 acres for its new Domenigoni Reservoir to expand
the system (to accommodate land speculators in the desert boonies).
The jury hit them for $43 million, which works out to about $1.95 a
square foot.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The question occurred to me, how
does that square with the
assessed value for property taxation? I asked <a href="../auth/Gwartney.htm">Ted
Gwartney</a>, a
professional appraiser with the Bank of America, to check the
assessed value. It is about seven cents a square foot; The
condemnation price, supposedly based on market value, is about 28
times the assessed value.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is not the result of
fractional assessment. In California we
assess property at 100 percent when land changes ownership or there
is a new building. Rather, this is the result of Prop. 13 and its
prohibition of market reassessment until land sells.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I thought that was startling, but
Mr. Gwartney's reaction was,
"What else is new?" He, who works with such data every day, has a
rule of thumb that market land value in California today is about
eight times assessed value. That is important enough to repeat: our
assessed land values are routinely at 1/8 of true land value. I
wouldn't dare say that on my own authority, but Mr. Gwartney is here
to confirm it. He is a veteran appraiser; for many years he was
Director of Assessments for the entire Province of British
Columbia.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Does this help you understand why
California landowners are now so
slow to adapt to new demands? In 1945 the assessors were building
fires under landowners, so they sought new strategies to meet new
circumstances. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Today there remains a
weak incentive to improve to
improve property: tax collectors generally cost them money when they
make improvements. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sit still, lie
low, hire no one, hang on, produce
nothing, and your holding costs are negligible. 
</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A little of the old magic
lingers. In October, 1995, a 225-acre
parcel in Corona, the Chase Ranch, was sold to a builder, Coscan
Davidson Homes, for building 967 units. The previous owners, "GGS,"
including a Japanese insurance firm, were "seeking a way out. They
were behind in tax payments and GGS was losing its staying power,..."
quoth Stephen Doyle, spokesman for the buyer. It is that "staying
power" that stifles land use and production. Coscan wants to build
immediately. Even so, though, they plan to take five years to build
out the project - if everything goes well. This is the new,
post-Prop. 13 meaning of "immediately."</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In spite of extreme
underassessment, the assessed value of taxable
land in California is 40 percent of the total real estate value.
Imagine what it would be if assessed values were real values,
"marked-to-market,'' as the law used to stipulate. It would be over
70 percent, as in 1917. "Staying power" would go down; land use, jobs
and production would rise.</small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land, in an economic sense, is
defined as the entire material
universe outside of people themselves and the products of people. It
includes all natural resources, materials, airwaves, as well as the
ground. All air, soil, minerals and water is included in the
definition of land. Everything that is freely supplied by nature, and
not made by man, is categorized as land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land holds a unique and pivotal
position in social, political,
environmental and economic theory. Land supports all life and stands
at the center of human culture and institutions. All people, at all
times, must make use of land. Land has no cost of production. It is
nature's gift to mankind, which enables life to continue and
prosper.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land's uniqueness stems from its
fixed supply and immobility. Land
cannot be manufactured or reproduced. Land is required directly or
indirectly in the production of all goods and services. Land is our
most basic resource and the source of all wealth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price paid
annually for the exclusive right (a
monopoly) to use a certain location, piece of land or other natural
resource. People receive wages for work, capital receives interest
for investment, and land receives rent for the exclusive use of a
location. Equity and efficiency require that the local general
public, who created land value, should be paid for the exclusive use
of a land site. That Payment is in the form of a land tax.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When considering world-wide
economics, most people think that land
rent contributes only a small insignificant portion of value. But as
societies progress, land has become the predominant force in
determining the progress or poverty of all people within a community.
Land in major or cities is so costly that people are forced to move
further away and travel great distances in order to get to work and
social attractions. In the more developed countries of the world,
land rent represents more than 40% of gross annual production.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since land is fixed in supply, as
more land is demanded by people
the rent will increase proportionally. Demand is the sole determinant
of land rent. Changes in land rent and land taxes have no impact on
the supply of land, because the land supply is fixed and cannot be
significantly expanded. Labor and capital are variable in supply. A
higher price for commodities causes more labor and capital to make
itself available. Labor and capital are rewarded for their work. A
high price is an incentive to work harder and longer, while a low
price is not an incentive to work harder and longer.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rent of land, however, serves
no such incentive function,
because the supply of land is fixed. The same amount is available no
matter how high or low the price. Buildings are not a part of land
rent. Land rent results from the desire made by everyone who lives
within a community to use land. Economic rent is the only source of
revenue that could be taken for community purposes without having any
negative effect on the productive potential of the economy.
Economists consider rent to be a surplus payment which is unnecessary
to ensure that land is available. When a community captures land rent
for public purposes, both efficiency and equity are realized.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The economic market rental value
of land should be sufficient to
finance public services and to obviate the need for raising revenue
from taxes, such as income or wage taxes; sales, commodity or
value-added taxes; and taxes on buildings, machinery and industry.
Public revenue should not be supplied by taxes on people and
enterprise until after all of the available revenue has been first
collected from the natural and community created value of land. Only
if land rent were insufficient would it be necessary to collect any
taxes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The collection of land rent, by
the public for supplying public
needs, returns the advantage an individual receives from the
exclusive use of a land site to the balance of the community, who
along with nature, contributed to its value and allow its exclusive
use.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land Market Value is the land
rental value, minus land taxes,
divided by a capitalization rate. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
<small>Not only is land rent a potentially important source of public
revenue, the tax on land is a means of limiting excessive speculation
in land prices. This would ensure that the equal opportunity to be
productive would be available to all citizens. With limited money to
invest, people could invest in productive equipment and wages, rather
than in high land prices which produce no additional tangible
wealth.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What are the factors that cause
land to have market value and to
whom does this market revenue advantage properly belong? Land has
market value for three reasons: </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the limited supply and "natural"
productivity of the soil and natural resources, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the publicly provided
services, including planning, improvements that increase the market
value of land and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the growth of communities and peoples' competitive
demand for the exclusive use of prime locations.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land rent is the price that
people and businesses are willing to
pay for the exclusive right to possess and use a good land site for a
period of time. For example, people prefer to use sites of good
location because it gives them an advantage of spending less time in
travel by being near what they choose to do and where they work. A
businessman can sell more goods at a site where many people pass each
day, compared to a site where only a few people would pass.
The collection of land rent should be used as revenue, by the
community for supplying public needs. This returns the advantage an
individual land possessor receives from the exclusive use of a land
site, to the balance of the people who live within the community and
have allowed the land possessor the exclusive use of the land site
for the period of time.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It is the responsibility of the local communities to insure that
the market rent of land is collected for public purposes. When a
major part of land rent is not collected, which is the case in most
of the world today, land title holders obtain rights to sell the
value of the public improvements which were made by the whole
community.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The community added to the
market value of land by making
improvements which increases demand and rent for the land. The longer
the possessors hold the land out of use the greater will be the bonus
they obtain. <big>... </big></span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Adam Smith, in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">The Wealth of
Nations</span>, suggested that any "tax"
should be a charge for services which benefit all people and are more
efficiently performed by a single cooperative effort. He postulated
four principles of taxation which any source of revenue should
meet:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Light on the
production of wealth, and does not impede
or reduce production; <br>
2. Cheap to collect, requiring few collectors, and easy to
understand; <br>
3. Certain; can't be avoided, little opportunity for corruption,
and provides adequate revenue; <br>
4. Equitable and fair, payment for benefits received, impartial,
and just. </small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Collecting public revenue from
land rent is the only revenue
source, or "tax", that meets these criteria.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While the major argument for
raising public revenue from land rent
and natural resources is because it is equitable and fair, it is also
the most efficient method of raising the revenue which is needed for
public facilities and services. Land is visible, can't be hidden and
its valuation is less intrusive than valuations of income and sales.
Taxes on labor and capital cause people to consider alternative
options, including working with less effort, which produces less real
goods. For example, a tax on wages will reduce after-tax net wages
and weaken the incentive to work. A person might be willing to work
hard for a wage of $20 per hour, but decide to drop out if the taxes
take $8 and the net wage is only $12 per hour. Economists claim that
present taxes account for a 25% loss in production in the United
States. Production and consumption would be greatly improved if
public revenue came primarily from land rather than a wage tax. The
same would occur when buildings and machinery are taxed. The tax on
building reduces the quantity and quality of buildings produced. A
tax on sales, commerce or value added reduces consumption, production
and net wealth. Sales tax evasion in the United States has exceeded
30% in recent years.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As new inventions and more
efficient ways of producing goods are
discovered, people's economic well-being is not improved, because
they have lost access to land and must pay both rent and taxes. <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(5)</span>
Instead of rent being used to provide community services, capital and
wages must be depleted, which obstructs private enterprise.</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the rent of land is taken
for public purposes production and
distribution are not held back. This is because the same amount of
rent would otherwise have been taken by some private individual. The
rent would be the same, the difference is how it is utilized. There
is evidence that communities who raise their revenue from land,
rather than from labor and capital, are more prosperous, many
increasing productivity by more than 25%. </small><br>
<br>
<small>In order to preserve the environment, it is necessary and
possible
to better utilize our communities. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">If the
producers of the land
market value (nature, government and people) don't utilize land rent,
someone else will.</span> This is why efficient land use fails under
contemporary land systems in most countries. All countries collect
some of the land rent, perhaps 10%, 20% or 30%, but none yet, collect
all of the market rent of land. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">...</span></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Cities which choose to collect
land rent as their primary source
of revenue have the advantage of not requiring burdensome taxes to be
paid by workers, businesspeople, entrepreneurs or citizens.
Individuals who work to create wealth should be allowed to keep what
they produce. When labor is not taxed, greater production and
consumption occurs. Investment capital is formed which is used to
produce more wealth. New jobs are created and economic diversity
results.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Each person has a right to keep
what he or she produces, but no
one has the right to waste what belongs to all people, the land which
includes the natural environment. Each person should have an
opportunity to use the best land for his business or personal needs,
as long as they are willing to pay the land rent that other land
users are willing to pay.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not only is land rent
potentially an important source of public
revenue, collecting all of it would ensure that the equal opportunity
to be productive would be available to all citizens. People could
fund useful buildings, equipment and wages, rather than having to buy
land at inflated prices.<small>&nbsp;</small>

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_TCoL.html">The Taxable
Capacity of Land</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The question I am
assigned is whether the taxable
capacity of land without buildings is up to the job of financing
cities, counties, and schools. Will the revenue be enough? The answer
is "yes."</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;The universal state and
local revenue problem today is
whether we must cap tax rates to avoid driving business away. It is
exemplified by Governor Pete Wilson of the suffering State of
California. <span style="font-weight: bold;">He keeps repeating we
must make a hard choice: cut taxes
and public services, or drive out business and jobs. (When a public
figure gives you two choices you know they're both bad, and he wants
one of them.)</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span><b><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The unique, remarkable quality of
a property tax based on
land ex buildings is that you may raise the rate with no fear of
driving away business, construction, people, jobs, or capital! You
certainly will not drive away the land.</span> However high the tax
rate,
not one square foot of it will put on a track shoe and hop out of
town. The only bad thing to say about this tax's incentive effects is
that it stimulates revitalization, and makes jobs. If some people
think that is bad, maybe this attitude is the problem.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;There is the answer to
Governor Wilson' dilemma. I hope here
in The Empire State you will supply a practical demonstration of the
answer, one we may then use to inspire The Golden State. California
now, following Proposition 13, has become a morality play, a gruesome
object lesson in what happens when the property tax is pushed down
toward zero. It forces higher taxes on production and exchange.
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Non-property
taxes, you know, mostly have the character that they
"shoot anything that moves," penalizing and discouraging economic
activity.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>New
buildings gain by having a lower property tax burden,
it is true; but they bear the brunt of these new taxes and impost
fees up front, at the time they are built. These offset the benefits
of their lower property tax rate.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Most California land, on
the other hand, is now taxed at
well below the allowable max of 1%</b>. <b>Speculators may sit on it
at little tax cost, however many highways and water and sewer lines
run to and past it, however many policemen are guarding it from
trespass.</b> Little wonder that California enterprise, once so
dynamic, flexible, and vital, is giving way to stasis and decay. We
used to lead the nation in making jobs; now in losing them. We used
to lead in school quality; now in jail population. 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">When you tax land,
the market moves each owner to join it with labor and capital as a
vehicle for enterprise or shelter.</span> <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>When you untax it, the market
moves each owner to hold it more passively and obstructively as a
"store of value," like a dog burying a bone. The market not only
moves the sitting owners, it moves ownership itself to new owners
whose needs are compatible with the tax system you impose. <strong>... 
    </strong></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The dearer the land parcels, the
higher is
the "land fraction" (the fraction of total real estate value that is
land value). From such data, one might formulate a rule along the
lines that "the lot value increases with the square of the house
value." It is hard to be so precise, and not necessary. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The relevant
rule we need here is just that people's house values are more alike
than their lot values. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is
lot value, more than house value, that
divides the rich from the poor.</span></span></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>&nbsp;The average <span style="font-weight: bold;">house
(ex land)</span> in the posh UEL jurisdiction
is worth <span style="font-weight: bold;">2.8 time</span>s the average
in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($173.1/$61.9). 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>The average <span style="font-weight: bold;">land parcel
(ex building)</span> in the UEL is
worth <span style="font-weight: bold;">17.5 times</span> the average
in the Victoria Rural jurisdiction
($692.5/$39.6).</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Now do us both a favor,
please. Pause and savor that
comparison. Let it linger, as though you were testing a slow sip of
wine from Fredonia's famous grapes. Roll it on your tongue, mull
sensually over its aroma and bouquet, and, getting back to business,
mull cerebrally over its full import<b>. The house that shelters the
very rich family is worth 2.8 times the house of the modest family;
but the land under the house of the very rich is worth 17.5 times the
land of the modest.</b> Seventeen and one half times as much! Again,
it is lot value, more than building value, that divides the rich from
the poor. <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Seldom
will you find an economic rule more strongly
supported by data. It's just a matter of presenting the data so as to
test and bring out the rule.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>An American counterpart of
Vancouver's "University Endowment
Lands" is <b>Beverly Hills, California, where land value composes
some 80% of residential values</b>, and the mean parcel is worth
something like a million dollars. Beverly Hills, with its great
wealth and mansions, is known as "Tear-down City." Every year many a
grand old palace that once sheltered some renowned matinee idol, and
rang to scandalous parties, is torn down to salvage its site for the
next, grander one. In a land boom, such as crested in 1989, half the
city goes to the brink of demolition and replacement.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Making the property tax more
progressive is not just
equitable, it raises its revenue capacity. That is because visible
damage to the poor and marginal puts a cap on any tax. You can't
squeeze blood out of a turnip, and if you try you'll look like the
Sheriff of Nottingham. <b>A land tax won't drive the poor from their
humble huts, because it exempts the huts, and the sites have low tax
valuations. It may tax a few off valuable land, if their poor huts
are there and they own the land. However, if they own such land, are
they really poor?</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;They may be "land-poor:" a
few folks always are. They have
non-cash assets, but are illiquid. "Illiquid" may be just a euphemism
for "holding out for more" -- there is always a market at a price.
Even so their plight, genuine or affected, traditionally evokes
sympathy and support. We must address it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;California, although
backward in many ways, has addressed it
effectively. In our <b>special improvement districts (SIDs)</b>,
State law allows the SID to contract with the landowner as follows.<small>
<small><small>You don't have to pay your annual charge
in cash. If
you choose not to, we take an equity in your property, charging a
modest rate of interest. Our equity accumulates over time. When you
die, we sell the property and take our share; your estate gets the
rest. Should our equity reach 100% during your lifetime, you stay
there for the duration, tax free.</small></small></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Objectively, it looks like a
good deal for the taxpayer.
They can't come out behind, even if they die soon; if they live long,
they come out ahead. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The instructive
result is that very few people
take this apparently advantageous option.</span> UCLA's Donald Shoup
has
published several works on the program. One way or another, they
manage to pay on time. Perhaps it attracts the attention of potential
heirs, in a compelling way, but somehow the cash comes forth. While
intending only to relieve distress, the program seems to have called
a great bluff. The lachrymose plea of the cash-poor widow is
unanswerable in debate, without appearing callous, doctrinaire, and
jackbooted. Meantime wealthy interests, thoroughly undistressed, hide
behind the widow's skirt and get their way. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Land prices boom and bust
too, jeopardizing revenue
stability. That can be a problem, but land taxation contains a
built-in contra-cyclical factor. <b>When a land boom reaches its
manic phase, as it did in California before 1989, growth expectations
rise so high that they offset interest costs: people think they are
holding land with no net carrying cost. </b>Your home is expected not
just to shelter you, but pay off its own mortgage, upkeep, and
maintenance by appreciating. Call it irrational, but it happens. In
this phase, the fast-moving tax assessor is an equilibrating force.
The quicker he follows such a market, the quicker he showers it with
cold water, by imposing a sobering cash drain on the participants.
This is an excellent time for local governments, if they have the
wit, to pay their debts, fix their potholes, and fill the fiscal
reservoir against the next drought. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those getting the cold shower,
meantime, may resist it. In
California, the land of extremes, we got Howard Jarvis and <b>Prop.
13. This Constitutional Amendment capped the property tax rate at 1%,
and virtually froze assessed values until land sold. </b>Then the
boom really went wild. I myself, after campaigning hard against
Jarvis, unexpectedly made $200,000 in a few months after it passed.
Buyers were chasing me around the block, just to buy a scrap of land
I happened to have in the right place at the right time. It was blind
luck, but the money was as good as though I had earned it honestly:
better, in fact, because 60% of the gain was not even reportable as
taxable income. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but buyers
and sellers came to regard it as normal, and only fair. They saw
regular annual increments as a divine right of property. For a few
mad years, they were.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>It was the lack of a tax
stabilizer that took the cap off
land prices. When my lot rose to $240,000, it was still assessed at
$10,000, and capped there by constitutional law! Taxes were 1% of
$10,000 - that's right, $100/year, 1/24 of 1% of the market value.
Was I in a strong bargaining position? You bet, and I loved it, just
as you might. Now we are paying the price, or beginning to, as our
public services collapse and our criminals outgun our police. This
year they are cutting faculty salaries (that's me) 5%, and raising
college tuition (that's my three children) 100%.</b> I'll pay all
right. All tax rates other than property are headed north; land
prices south. Our once-vibrant economy is dying; our unemployment
rate leads the nation. Our largest city was torched last year by the
frustrated unemployed. Our once-leading schools trail the nation; our
murder rate leads it. Those are the economic consequences of Howard
Jarvis. Like Tokyo and London and Faust, we signed with
Mephistopheles. He showed us a grand time, but now his bill is due.
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">To
paraphrase Kipling, "Be warned of our lot, which I dread you may
not, and learn about Jarvis from me."</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>&nbsp;Another attractive
feature of land taxation is its
interesting positive effect on the economic base of a city. It
strengthens it by its tendency to hit absentee owners harder than
resident owners.</b> The land fraction in real estate is generally
highest in the CBD of any city, so that is a favorite place for
absentees to buy and hold. They like the steady income, and the
"trophy" quality. The surplus in real estate is what attracts outside
buyers, and land is what yields the surplus. <b>About 2/3 of downtown
Los Angeles is owned by non-resident aliens, for example. In a more
workaday city, Milwaukee, the absentee owners consist of former
residents, or their heirs, who grew too rich to abide the harsh
winters.</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the effect on
your balance of payments. When you
get more tax money from absentees, money that used to flow to Tehran,
Zurich, or Palm Beach now flows into your local treasury to pay your
local teachers and city workers, and relieve your builders and
building managers. In this way taxing land actually acts to undergird
the value of its own base. ... </small><br>

study more on this fascinating subject. I hope you think it as
important as I do. <b>Please pick up this ball and run with it.

California. This is partly
because the lands are here, but moreso because certain places in
California are good places to live. One of the advantages of receiving
property as opposed to labor income is it lets one choose his
residence. California ranks after New York in the number of rich
Americans (using Forbes' list) who reside here.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Also included here are California-based corporations. A
corporation's
"base" refers simply to the site of its headquarters: its shareholders
are scattered around the world, and the major shareholders, who
exercise control, are effectively screened behind layers of trusts and
financial institutions, so they are impossible to identify with
certainty.</small><br>

<small>Institutions acquire land for their operations and then it tends
to
stick to them for various reasons. It is tax free, for one, so long as
they retain it (and do not use it commercially). They are not subject
to corporate raids. Thus there is no mechanism whereby the current
opportunity cost of land is felt by management. It never appears in
their budgets; they never need compete for or justify it. College
Boards are not accountable to any public body, a precedent set by
Marshall's U.S. Supreme Court in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819.</small>...<small>&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>In PTS, the T stands for tax. Taxes, at best,
are grudgingly accepted as "the price of civilization". The property
tax, a threat to home ownership, is roundly disliked. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Rather than
recognize the two different taxes rolled up in the property tax, most
reformers and most electorates simply choose to cap the property tax
rate (and thereby inflate the price of land).</span> To parry the
anti-tax
fervor, it is possible to rename the proposal as a "sprawl tax" (as
does Alan Thein Durning in <i>Tax Shift). </i>This name suggests the
new charge would counter a negative condition. It's also possible to
formulate the proposal as a user fee. A jurisdiction could raise the
fee for deeds and collect it annually, as states do for titles to
vehicles, and thereby technically avoid being a tax.<br>
<br>
The proposal is often seen as a tax on land, on one's private property,
the under girding of one's home, "everyman's castle." The associations
with land<b> </b>are
so positive, and the connotations of tax are so negative, that the
proposal feels to the public like a threat to one's own niche in the
universe. One way to try to defuse this emotional reaction is to
replace "land" with terms such as "site" and "location."&nbsp; Also,
proponents can insert the word "value" which is not only more accurate,
it's also more abstract, softening the emotional blow.<br>
<br>
People prefer "the devil they know."&nbsp; People may not like their
tax
burden, but they sure don't want to risk letting it go any higher. Yet
the proposal is to increase the land tax rate or deed fee. Plus, a levy
on site value, in the many growing jurisdictions, constitutes a higher
charge on something growing -- site values. To prevent "inflating
residents out of their homes", the proposal could either <br>
</small></font></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="3"><small>(a) exempt
the
first $20,000 or so of site value, ensuring that the poorest landowners
pay at most a modicum, or <br>
(b) rebate some rent (collected site value)
once some threshold is reached, say when the land dues owed by the
poorest quintile equal, say, 5% of average local income. (The actual
trigger figure needs more thorough calculating.) </small></font><br>
</small></div>
<small><font size="3"><small>PTS proponents could
present their proposal as an even lower cap on improvements, down even
to zero, with an equivalent quasi-cap on locations, above which any
surplus collected rent would automatically be rebated to residents on a
per capita basis. This higher rate on land may be made even more
sellable than a lower one were the PTS hitched to a reduction of taxes
on income or sales, too.<br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>The PTS is social engineering, an
attempt to manipulate behavior. Yet
all taxes spur a different response from taxpayers. Hence legislators
offer credits, deductions, exemptions, deferments, abatements, and
assess property at current use versus market value. Which is the real
distortion of free choice? The present practice of privatizing
publicly-generated land values or the proposed policy of sharing rent
while respecting earnings?</small></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn
needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

    Distinctive Factor of Production</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
values are hypersensitive to discount rates</span></small><br>
<small>The sensitivity of present values to discount rates increases as
the
value being discounted.&nbsp; Land values are discounted from more
remote
future values than are values of most capital, even most durable and
"fixed" capital.&nbsp; Consider land yielding an expected constant cash
flow: let the interest rate double and the present value is
halved.&nbsp;
Compare the present value of a steer to be slaughtered in one year: let
the interest rate double from 5% to 10% and the present value drops
from .95 of slaughter value to .91. Even that overstates it a lot
because we haven't accounted for the feed bill, but never mind, the
point should be clear.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Let buyers expect land's cash flow to rise annually by a growth
coefficient, G, and the valuation formula is cash flow divided by the
interest rate minus the growth rate (I-G), rather than I alone.&nbsp;
Now
let the interest rate double, and the present value is cut to less than
half.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Or let land be yielding a nominal current cash flow and to be
held in
anticipation of a higher use to begin 10 years down the road, and
thirty years after that to be renewed for an even higher use.&nbsp; Let
there be a whiff of oil, or the floating value of a shopping center, or
the possible extension of a freeway and a new water supply paid by
others.&nbsp; Let there be a fear (or hope) that Washington will
debauch the
currency sometime again in this century, or that another Howard Jarvis
will cut land taxes some more, or that future building costs will fall:
any and all of these, which are common and familiar expectations, make
present values of land more sensitive to discount rates than in the
simple basic capitalization model which is based on assumed constant
cash flow in perpetuity.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Expectations like those denoted above by G, or like the
anticipated
higher future use referred to, are "a state of the public mind"
(Richard Hurd, Principles of City Land Values).&nbsp; They are
incapable of
proof or disproof in the present and, whether proven true or false in
the future, will have lost relevance, to be replaced by new
expectations of new futures that unfold endlessly as time passes.... <a

<span style="font-style: italic;">While this one was written a decade
before Prop 13, it speaks to some relevant issues:</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span>Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property Tax -- Cause of
Unemployment</a> (circa 1964)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Let
  us now turn to that part of the
  tax that is assessed on land. </span>Increases in population,
  immigration from the farms and other forces have led to a rapid
  increase in the population of our large cities and metropolitan areas. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Population
  pressure is bound to increase the value of urban land. Yet an adequate
  system of land taxation could have prevented the steep rise in urban
  land values.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Economists agree that taxes on land can not be shifted but are
  capitalized. For instance a lot having a value of $10,000 -- will have
  an imputed or expected income of $500 -- assuming a 5% rate of
  capitalization. A 2-1/2% yearly "ad valorem" tax would reduce the
  imputed income by $250 -- or 50%. Such a tax would naturally reduce the
  value of the land by the same percentage.</small><br>
  <br style="font-style: italic;">
  <small>For these reasons increases in land values can be prevented by
  taxing land at an appropriate rate. Yet urban land values have
  increased tremendously during recent years. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">For instance in Los Angeles county the
  assessed value of land increased from $1,972 millions in 1952 to $4,002
  millions in 1962, an increase of a little over 100%. </span>The
  assessed values, are supposed to represent 25% of the market value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Thus the unearned increment in land values
  during this period amounted to not less than $8 billions.</span> Even
  this figure is an understatement because it is based on assessed values
  and land is greatly underassessed. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">While land
  values have risen by about 10% yearly, property taxes assessed on land
  averaged about 1.5%. Thus a person owning vacant or underimproved land
  would have earned about 8 1/2% per year just by withholding land from
  its proper use.</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>A higher tax on vacant or unimproved land would make it
  unprofitable to
  hold such lands. It will tax land into better use and it will lead to a
  spurt in construction activity. While all other taxes are deterrents to
  employment and economic growth, though to a varying extent, land taxes
  are the only genuine incentive taxes.</small><br>
