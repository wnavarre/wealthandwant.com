<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>That the value attaching to land with social growth is intended for social
    needs is shown by the final proof. God is indeed a jealous God in the sense
    that nothing but injury and disaster can attend the effort of men to do things
    other than in the way he has intended; in the sense that where the blessings
    he proffers to men are refused or misused they turn to evils that scourge
    us. And just as for the mother to withhold the provision that fills her breast
    with the birth of the child is to endanger physical health, so for society
    to refuse to take for social uses the provision intended for them is to breed
    social disease.</p>
  <p>For refusal to take for public purposes the increasing values that attach
    to land with social growth is to necessitate the getting of public revenues
    by taxes that lessen production, distort distribution and corrupt society.
    It is to leave some to take what justly belongs to all; it is to forego the
    only means by which it is possible in an advanced civilization to combine
    the security of possession that is necessary to improvement with the equality
    of natural opportunity that is the most important of all natural rights.
    It is thus at the basis of all social life to set up an unjust inequality
    between man and man, compelling some to pay others for the privilege of living,
    for the chance of working, for the advantages of civilization, for the gifts
    of their God. But it is even more than this. The very robbery that the masses
    of men thus suffer gives rise in advancing communities to a new robbery.
    For the value that with the increase of population and social advance attaches
    to land being suffered to go to individuals who have secured ownership of
    the land, it prompts to a forestalling of and speculation in land wherever
    there is any prospect of advancing population or of coming improvement, thus
    producing an artificial scarcity of the natural elements of life and labor,
    and a strangulation of production that shows itself in recurring spasms of
    industrial depression as disastrous to the world as destructive wars. It
    is this that is driving men from the old countries to the new countries,
    only to bring there the same curses. It is this that causes our material
    advance not merely to fail to improve the condition of the mere worker, but
    to make the condition of large classes positively worse. It is this that
    in our richest Christian countries is giving us a large population whose
    lives are harder, more hopeless, more degraded than those of the veriest
    savages. It is this that leads so many men to think that God is a bungler
    and is constantly bringing more people into his world than he has made provision
    for; or that there is no God, and that belief in him is a superstition which
    the facts of life and the advance of science are dispelling.</p>
  <p>The darkness in light, the weakness in strength, the poverty amid wealth,
    the seething discontent foreboding civil strife, that characterize our civilization
    of today, are the natural, the inevitable results of our rejection of God&#8217;s
    beneficence, of our ignoring of his intent. Were we on the other hand to
    follow his clear, simple rule of right, leaving scrupulously to the individual
    all that individual labor produces, and taking for the community the value
    that attaches to land by the growth of the community itself, not merely could
    evil modes of raising public revenues be dispensed with, but all men would
    be placed on an equal level of opportunity with regard to the bounty of their
    Creator, on an equal level of opportunity to exert their labor and to enjoy
    its fruits. And then, without drastic or restrictive measures the forestalling
    of land would cease. For then the possession of land would mean only security
    for the permanence of its use, and there would be no object for any one to
    get land or to keep land except for use; nor would his possession of better
    land than others had confer any unjust advantage on him, or unjust deprivation
    on them, since the equivalent of the advantage would be taken by the state
    for the benefit of all.</p>
  <p>The Right Reverend Dr. Thomas Nulty, Bishop of Meath, who sees all this
    as clearly as we do, in pointing out to the clergy and laity of his diocese*
    the design of Divine Providence that the rent of land should be taken for
    the community, says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">I think, therefore, that I may fairly infer, on the strength of authority
        as well as of reason, that the people are and always must be the real owners
        of the land of their country. This great social fact appears to me to be
        of incalculable importance, and it is fortunate, indeed, that on the strictest
        principles of justice it is not clouded even by a shadow of uncertainty or
        doubt. There is, moreover, a charm and a peculiar beauty in the clearness
        with which it reveals the wisdom and the benevolence of the designs of Providence
        in the admirable provision he has made for the wants and the necessities
        of that state of social existence of which he is author, and in which the
        very instincts of nature tell us we are to spend our lives. A vast public
        property, a great national fund, has been placed under the dominion and at
        the disposal of the nation to supply itself abundantly with resources necessary
        to liquidate the expenses of its government, the administration of its laws
        and the education of its youth, and to enable it to provide for the suitable
        sustentation and support of its criminal and pauper population. One of the
        most interesting peculiarities of this property is that its value is never
        stationary; it is constantly progressive and increasing in a direct ratio
        to the growth of the population, and the very causes thatincrease and multiply
        the demands made on it increase proportionately its ability to meet them.<br>
        * Letter addressed to the Clergy and Laity of the Diocese of Meath, Ireland,
        April 2, 1881.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>There is, indeed, as Bishop Nulty says, a peculiar beauty in the clearness
    with which the wisdom and benevolence of Providence are revealed in this
    great social fact, the provision made for the common needs of society in
    what economists call <em>the law of rent</em>. Of all the evidence that natural religion
    gives, it is this that most clearly shows the existence of a beneficent God,
    and most conclusively silences the doubts that in our days lead so many to
    materialism.</strong></p>
  <p>For in this beautiful provision made by natural law for the social needs
    of civilization we see that God has intended civilization; that all our discoveries
    and inventions do not and cannot outrun his forethought, and that steam,
    electricity and labor-saving appliances only make the great moral laws clearer
    and more important. In the growth of this great fund, increasing with social
    advance &#8212; a fund that accrues from the growth of the community and
    belongs therefore to the community &#8212; we see not only that there is
    no need for the taxes that lessen wealth, that engender corruption, that
    promote inequality and teach men to deny the gospel; but that to take this
    fund for the purpose for which it was evidently intended would in the highest
    civilization secure to all the equal enjoyment of God&#8217;s bounty, the
    abundant opportunity to satisfy their wants, and would provide amply for
    every legitimate need of the state. We see that God in his dealings with
    men has not been a bungler or a niggard; that he has not brought too many
    men into the world; that he has not neglected abundantly to supply them;
    that he has not intended that bitter competition of the masses for a mere
    animal existence and that monstrous aggregation of wealth which characterize
    our civilization; but that these evils which lead so many to say there is
    no God, or yet more impiously to say that they are of God&#8217;s ordering,
    are due to our denial of his moral law. We see that the law of justice, the
    law of the Golden Rule, is not a mere counsel of perfection, but indeed the
    law of social life. We see that if we were only to observe it there would
    be work for all, leisure for all, abundance for all; and that civilization
    would tend to give to the poorest not only necessities, but all comforts
    and reasonable luxuries as well. We see that Christ was not a mere dreamer
    when he told men that if they would seek the kingdom of God and its right-doing
    they might no more worry about material things than do the lilies of the
    field about their raiment; but that he was only declaring what political
    economy in the light of modern discovery shows to be a sober truth. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

  <p><em>Q36. How is it possible to determine what part of a man's product is due
    to land, and what part is due to labor?</em><br>
    A. All products are due wholly to the union of land and labor. Labor is the
    active force, land is the passive material; and without both there can be
    no product at all. But the part of a man's product that he individually earns,
    as distinguished from the part that he obtains by virtue of advantageous
    location, is determined by the law of rent &#8212; by what his location is
    worth. ... <a href="../docs/Post_Lectures.htm">read the book</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Picture an unpopulated island
where we're going to produce one
good, corn, and there are eleven grades of land. On the best land, we
can grow ten bushels of corn per week; the second land grows nine
bushels, and so on to the worst land that grows zero bushels. We'll
ignore capital goods at first. The first settlers go the best land.
While there is free ten-bushel land, rent is zero, so wages are 10.
When the 10-bushel land is all settled, immigrants go to the 9-bushel
land. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Wages in the 9-bushel land equal
9 while free land is available.
What then are wages in the 10-bushel land? They must also be 9, since
labor is mobile. If you offer less, nobody will come, and if you
offer a bit more than 9, everybody in the 9-bushel land will want to
work for you. Competition among workers makes wages the same all over
(we assume all workers are alike). So that extra bushel in the
10-bushel land, after paying 9 for labor, is rent. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That border line where the best
free land is being settled is
called the "margin of production." When the margin moves to the
8-bushel land, wages drop to 8. Rent is now 1 on the 9-bushel land and
2 on the 10-bushel land. Do you see what the trend is? <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">As the margin
moves to less productive lands, wages are going down and rent is
going up. We can also now see that wages are determined at the margin
of production. That is the "law of wages." The wage at the margin
sets the wage for all lands.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
production in the better lands left
after paying wages goes to rent. That is the "law of rent."</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If you
understand the law of wages and the law of rent, you see the cat! </span>To
complete our cat story, suppose folks can get land to rent and sell
for higher prices later rather than using it now. This land
speculation will hog up lands and make the margin move further out
than without speculation, lowering wages and raising rent even more.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Now we have good news and bad
news. The good news is that when we
put in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">capital goods</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">So there is this constant
race between technology raising wages and lower margins reducing
wages.&nbsp; </span>...</small>
we first left out from the example above,
the tools and technology increase the productivity of all the lands.
If production doubles, rent doubles, and wages go up. Wages won't
double, because workers have to pay for the tools, but even if wages
go up 50 percent, that's good news, and why industrialized economies
have a high standard of living. Also, high skills enable educated
workers to have a wage premium above the basic wage level. The bad
news is that the technology enables us to extend the margin to less
productive land, which lowers wages again. <span

</a></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
primary cause of the enormous and
growing wealth gap is that the land and natural resources of the earth
are treated as if they are mere market commodities from which a few are
allowed to reap massive private profits or hold land and resources out
of use in anticipation of future profits. </span>Henry George, the
great 19th century American political economist and social philosopher,
proposed a solution to a problem that too few understood at the time
and too few understand today. Early Christian teachings drew upon deep
wisdom teachings of the Jubilee justice tradition when they addressed
this problem. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is the Land
Problem.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The
Land
Problem takes two primary forms: land price escalation and concentrated
land ownership.</span> </small><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">As our system of economic
development proceeds, land values rise faster than wages increase,
until inevitably the price paid for access to land consumes increasing
amounts of a worker's wages.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
In classical economics, this dilemma is
called the "law of rent" and has been mostly ignored by mainstream
economists.</span> The predictability of the "law of rent" - that land
values
will continually rise - fuels frenzies of land speculation and the
inevitable bust that follows the boom.</span> A recent <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Fortune </span>cover story informs us
that there are big gains and huge risks in housing speculation in about
30 predominantly coastal markets that encompass 100 million people.
Since 2000, home prices in New York, Washington, and Boston have surged
56% to 61%. Prices jumped 58% in Miami and Los Angeles and 76% in San
Diego where the median home price county-wide is $582,000. The gap
between home prices and fundamentals like job growth and incomes is
greater than ever.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[7]</span></small></small></li>
  <li><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The second form of the
Land Problem is the
fact that in most countries, including the United States, a small
minority of people own and control a disproportionately large amount of
land and natural resources.</span> Data suggests that about 3% of the
population owns 95% of the privately held land in the US. Less than 600
companies control 22% of our private land, a land mass the size of
Spain. Those same companies land interests worldwide comprise a total
area larger than that of Europe - almost 2 billion acres.&nbsp; </small><small>...&nbsp;</small>&nbsp;<small><small>

<blockquote>
  <p>WHEREVER land has an exchange value there is rent in the economic meaning
    of the term. Wherever land having a value is used, either by owner or hirer,
    there is rent actual; wherever it is not used, but still has a value, there
    is rent potential. It is this capacity of yielding rent which gives value
    to land. . . . No matter what are its capabilities, land can yield no rent
    and have no value until some one is willing to give labor or the results
    of labor for the privilege of using it; and what anyone will thus give, depends
    not upon the capacity of the land, but upon its capacity as compared with
    that of land that can be had for nothing. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html"> Book

STATED reversely, the law of rent is necessarily the law of wages and interest
taken together, for it is the assertion, that no matter what be the production
which results from the application of labor and capital, these two factors will
only receive in wages and interest such part of the produce as they could have
produced on land free to them without the payment of rent &#8212; that is the
least productive land or point in use. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp032.html"> Book
