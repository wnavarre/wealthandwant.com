<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>I can no more call myself an
individualist or a socialist
than one who considers the forces by which the planets are held to
their orbits could call himself a centrifugalist or a centripetalist. </i>&#8212;Henry George</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The
    socialist mistake [is] looking
    on capital and labor as the two factors of production and as the two
    parties to the division of the produce. As a matter of fact there are,
    in our highly-developed industrial system, three parties of production,
    and always a fourth and generally a fifth related to distribution. In
    addition to A the employing capitalist and B the employed laborer,
    there are C the landowner, D the tax collector and generally E the
    representative of monopolies other than that of land. What A and B can
    divide between them is not the product of their joint efforts, but the
    product which C, D and E leaves to them."</span> - Henry George</div>
  <p>    Among the first questions people tend to ask when they start to hear
    about these ideas are whether we are talking about socialism, or
    even communism.&nbsp; The
  short answer is "neither &#8212; rather, we want capitalism on a level
  playing field!"&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  This website will lead you to think about what rightly belongs to the
  individual and what rightly belongs to the community.&nbsp; It provides
  a simple way to collect for the community what is rightly common
  property, and to leave to the individual what he created.&nbsp; So,
  yes, we seek to socialize that which the individual or corporation <em>didn't</em> create, <em>couldn't</em> possibly
  create, <em>can't</em> create more of &#8212; and
  privatize that which he <em>does</em> make: the fruits of his labor and the
  results of his saving which aren't in the nature of common property. <br>
  <br>
  One of the phrases to describe America's existing economic system is "Land
  Monopoly Capitalism." [The board game <em>Monopoly</em> was an outgrowth
  of a turn-of-the-century game called <em>The Landlord's Game</em>, designed
  to teach these ideas.]&nbsp; What Georgists are proposing is
  capitalism on a level playing field &#8212;  something along the line of
"Capitalism is a very fine system, and America really ought to try it
  some
  time!"&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>Having said all that, it is also fair to say that <em><a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress
      &amp; Poverty</a></em>, while
    explicitly and exuberantly in favor of a purer form of capitalism than is
    practiced anywhere in the world now, probably played a role in bringing
    many people in the 19th century, particularly in
    England,
    to
    the socialist movement, including <a href="Shaw.html">George Bernard Shaw.</a></p>
  <p>This page also contains many of Henry George's comments on socialism, few
    of which are positive.</p>

    Henry George debated Social Democrat H. M. Hyndman in London in 1889,
    and <a href="../HG/debate_hyndman_1889.html">the text of that
    debate</a> highlights the points of commonality and
    the very significant differences.&nbsp; In <a

    extremely critical of the Socialist "solution," making clear why he
    thinks it both wrong and ineffective.</p>

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/debate_hyndman_1889.html">The
  Great
Debate: Single Tax vs Social Democracy&nbsp; (1889)</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to the injustice and wrong of
present
social conditions, the parties who are here represented tonight
both agree. We both agree, moreover, as to the end to be sought
&#8211; a condition of things in which there shall be opportunities
for work for all, leisure for all, a sufficiency of the necessities
of life for all, an abundance of the reasonable luxuries of life for
all. (Hear, hear.) </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We differ as to the means by which
that end is to attained. Mr
Hyndman styles himself a Social Democrat: I a Single Tax man. Let me
state why we have adopted that name and what we mean by it. Looking
over the civilised world today, 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>we see that labour nowhere gets its
just dues. (Hear, hear.)</small></li>
  <li><small>We see there is everywhere a fringe of unemployed labour. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>We see
all the phenomena that are called sometimes over-production and
industrial depression; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>we reject as superficial the theory that this
is caused by there being too many people; that this is caused by
there not being enough work; that this is caused by the
multiplication of labour-saving machinery.</small></li>
  <li><small>We say that until human wants are satisfied there can be
no such
thing as over-production (applause) that until all have enough there
is yet plenty of work. (Hear, hear.)</small></li>
  <li><small>We trace the cause of all these phenomena to one great
fundamental
wrong. We ask what work is, and we see that what we call productive
work is alteration in place or in form of the raw material of the
universe that we call land. We see that man is a land animal; that
his very body comes from the land; that all his productions consist
in but the working up of the land; and that land to him is absolutely
necessary; and we behold everywhere the phenomena of which I have
spoken. We see everywhere that this element, indispensable to all,
has been made the property of some. (Hear, hear) </small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To that wrong we trace all the
great social evils of which we
complain today, and we propose to right them by going to the root
and removing that wrong. (Loud applause) </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It is perfectly clear that we are
all here with equal rights to
the use of the universe. We are all here equally entitled to the use
of land.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Capital is wealth produced by
labour from
land, used again in increasing the production of wealth. And not only
will it not hurt labour to leave to capital its full reward but we
must leave to capital its full natural reward, if we would have a
progressive community &#8211; (cheers) &#8211; and if we would give
each what is his due. (Hear, hear.) What the labourers have to fight
against is not competition &#8211; (hear hear and &#8220;Yes&#8221;)
&#8211; but the restriction of production to their injury. Let there
be competition all around from the highest to the lowest, fencing in
no class against competition.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Abolish
monopoly everywhere, put all
men on an equal footing and then trust to freedom.</span> In that way
we
would have the most delicate system of co-operation that can possibly
be devised by the wit of man. <br>
<br>
The fight of labour is not against
capital; it is against monopoly. Why just think of that state of
things. when all the means of production belong to the community and
all production is regulated by the State, when every individual would
have, his work, his time of work, and everything else prescribed for
him; when it would be utterly impossible for men to employ
themselves! To abolish competition you must have restriction; you
must call on the coercive powers of the State. How else are you going
to do it? Supposing you organise industry in the way our friends
dream of, if any individuals go outside of this organization and
propose to compete with it, how are you going to stop their
competition but by coming in with the strong arm of the law, and
putting an end to it? Why such a state of society, instead of being
the ideal to which the Anglo-Saxon community ought to aspire, would
be going back to a worse despotism than that of ancient Egypt.
(Applause and cries of &#8220;No, no.&#8221;)&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now we have
heard a good deal tonight, as we always do whenever our Socialist
friends talk, a great deal about nationalising all the instruments of
production, a great deal about making capital the property of the
State, and about organising labour by the State; but I have not heard
tonight, and I have yet to hear, of any practical steps in this
direction. (Hear, hear.) How do they propose to begin, and what will
be involved? Here let me say, to interrupt for one moment, that I
have never made any proposition to confiscate the railways. What I
propose to take is the rent of land for the use of the community;
what I propose is to take for the community are all valuable
franchises; but I would take nothing that is the product of labour
for the use of the community without paying its owner its full value.
Now, to take the instruments of production will involve a good deal.
(Hear, hear.) The instruments of production comprise not merely the
railways, not merely the ships of the steamship lines; they go down
to the axe, the spade, and the other tools of the individual workman,
and to the stock of the storekeeper. Are you going to take all that?
(&#8220;Yes.&#8221;) It is a big job. (Laughter and applause.)
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Has it
ever happened in the history of the world that the men that had
nothing took everything from the possessing classes? Never. And when
it is taken, what do you propose to do with it? (&#8220;Use it.&#8221;)
To use it under Governmental directions, and to have a Government
official or a board at the head of every vocation; lawyers, doctors
&#8211; I suppose no lawyers would be needed &#8211; down to milkmen,
costermongers, and bootblacks. Now what does that mean? We are told
it is all to be managed in the interest of the community &#8211; the
whole people &#8211; but is that the history of such organization?
Does not organization always mean a concentration of power in the
hands of a few? Do not you men who belong, as I have belonged, to a
political organization, know that always the tendency is to the
management by a few? Is it not always true that when things are left
to the vote of a large number of people that a few designing men
always have the advantage?&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wherever
you end competition you give some special privilege. Monopoly in what
does it consist? In the abolition of competition. </span>What are the
things
of which you complain in Government? The absence of competition. Your
House of Lords is not opposed to competition; it is fenced in by
monopoly (Loud applause.) So wherever you find a special privilege,
there you find it a special privilege because competition is
excluded. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What was the essence of slavery to
which Mr&middot;Hyndman
has alluded? The prohibition of competition; so no one else could
employ the slave save his owner &#8211; the slave was not free to
compete with owner. (Hear, hear.) If you men seriously think of these
things you will see that the Social Democratic Federation vaguely
proposes, if it were possible to carry it out, would inevitably
result in the worst system of slavery. (Loud cries of &#8220;No;
no,&#8221; and &#8220;Order&#8221;) 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Simply imagine a state of things
in
which no one could work save under State control, in which no one
could display any energy save under the control of a board of
officials, and ask yourselves who this board of officials are likely
to be. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Socialism begins at the wrong

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>God&#8217;s laws do not change. Though their applications may alter with
    altering conditions, the same principles of right and wrong that hold when
    men are few and industry is rude also hold amid teeming populations and complex
    industries. In our cities of millions and our states of scores of millions,
    in a civilization where the division of labor has gone so far that large
    numbers are hardly conscious that they are land-users, it still remains true
    that we are all land animals and can live only on land, and that land is
    God&#8217;s bounty to all, of which no one can be deprived without being
    murdered, and for which no one can be compelled to pay another without being
    robbed. But even in a state of society where the elaboration of industry
    and the increase of permanent improvements have made the need for private
    possession of land wide-spread, there is no difficulty in conforming individual
    possession with the equal right to land. For as soon as any piece of land
    will yield to the possessor a larger return than is had by similar labor
    on other land a value attaches to it which is shown when it is sold or rented.
    Thus, the value of the land itself, irrespective of the value of any improvements
    in or on it, always indicates the precise value of the benefit to which all
    are entitled in its use, as distinguished from the value which, as producer
    or successor of a producer, belongs to the possessor in individual right.</p>
  <p>To combine the advantages of private possession with the justice of common
    ownership it is only necessary therefore to take for common uses what value
    attaches to land irrespective of any exertion of labor on it. The principle
    is the same as in the case referred to, where a human father leaves equally
    to his children things not susceptible of specific division or common use.
    In that case such things would be sold or rented and the value equally applied.</p>
  <p>It is on this common-sense principle that we, who term ourselves single-tax
    men, would have the community act.</p>
  <p>We do not propose to assert equal rights to land by keeping land common,
    letting any one use any part of it at any time. We do not propose the task,
    impossible in the present state of society, of dividing land in equal shares;
    still less the yet more impossible task of keeping it so divided.</p>
  <p>We propose &#8212; leaving land in the private possession of individuals,
    with full liberty on their part to give, sell or bequeath it &#8212; simply
    to levy on it for public uses a tax that shall equal the annual value of
    the land itself, irrespective of the use made of it or the improvements on
    it. And since this would provide amply for the need of public revenues, we
    would accompany this tax on land values with the repeal of all taxes now
    levied on the products and processes of industry &#8212; which taxes, since
    they take from the earnings of labor, we hold to be infringements of the
    right of property.</p>
  <p>This we propose, not as a cunning device of human ingenuity, but as a conforming
    of human regulations to the will of God.</p>
  <p>God cannot contradict himself nor impose on his creatures laws that clash.</p>
  <p>If it be God&#8217;s command to men that they should not steal &#8212; that
    is to say, that they should respect the right of property which each one
    has in the fruits of his labor;</p>
  <p>And if he be also the Father of all men, who in his common bounty has intended
    all to have equal opportunities for sharing;</p>
  <p>Then, in any possible stage of civilization, however elaborate, there must
    be some way in which the exclusive right to the products of industry may
    be reconciled with the equal right to land.</p>
  <p><strong>If the Almighty be consistent with himself, it cannot be, as say
      those socialists referred to by you, that in order to secure the equal
      participation of men
    in the opportunities of life and labor we must ignore the right of private
    property. </strong>Nor yet can it be, as you yourself in the Encyclical seem to argue,
    that to secure the right of private property we must ignore the equality
    of right in the opportunities of life and labor. To say the one thing or
    the other is equally to deny the harmony of God&#8217;s laws.</p>
  <p>But, the private possession of land, subject to the payment to the community
    of the value of any special advantage thus given to the individual, satisfies
    both laws, securing to all equal participation in the bounty of the Creator
    and to each the full ownership of the products of his labor. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>... I have said enough to show your Holiness the injustice into which you
    fall in classing us, who in seeking virtually to abolish private property
    in land
    seek more fully to secure the true rights of property, with those whom you
    speak of as socialists, who wish to make all property common. But you also
    do injustice to the socialists.<br>
    <br>
    There are many, it is true, who feeling bitterly the monstrous wrongs of
    the present distribution of wealth are animated only by a blind hatred of
    the rich and a fierce desire to destroy existing social adjustments. This
    class is indeed only less dangerous than those who proclaim that no social
    improvement is needed or is possible. But it is not fair to confound with
    them those who, however mistakenly, propose definite schemes of remedy.</p>
  <p><strong>The socialists, as I understand them, and as the term has come to
      apply to anything like a definite theory and not to be vaguely and improperly
      used
    to include all who desire social improvement, do not, as you imply, seek
    the abolition of all private property. Those who do this are properly called
    communists. What the socialists seek is the state assumption of capital (in
    which they vaguely and erroneously include land), or more properly speaking,
    of large capitals, and state management and direction of at least the larger
    operations of industry.</strong> In this way they hope to abolish interest, which
    they regard as a wrong and an evil; to do away with the gains of exchangers,
    speculators, contractors and middlemen, which they regard as waste; to do
    away with the wage system and secure general cooperation; and to prevent
    competition, which they deem the fundamental cause of the impoverishment
    of labor. The more moderate of them, without going so far, go in the same
    direction, and seek some remedy or palliation of the worst forms of poverty
    by government regulation. <strong>The essential character of socialism is that it
    looks to the extension of the functions of the state for the remedy of social
    evils; that it would substitute regulation and direction for competition;
    and intelligent control by organized society for the free play of individual
    desire and effort.</strong></p>
  <p>Though not usually classed as socialists, both the trades-unionists and
    the protectionists have the same essential character. The trades-unionists
    seek the increase of wages, the reduction of working-hours and the general
    improvement in the condition of wage-workers, by organizing them into guilds
    or associations which shall fix the rates at which they will sell their labor;
    shall deal as one body with employers in case of dispute; shall use on occasion
    their necessary weapon, the strike; and shall accumulate funds for such purposes
    and for the purpose of assisting members when on a strike, or (sometimes)
    when out of employment. The protectionists seek by governmental prohibitions
    or taxes on imports to regulate the industry and control the exchanges of
    each country, so as, they imagine, to diversify home industries and prevent
    the competition of people of other countries.</p>
  <p>At the opposite extreme are the anarchists, a term which, though frequently
    applied to mere violent destructionists, refers also to those who, seeing
    the many evils of too much government, regard government in itself as evil,
    and believe that in the absence of coercive power the mutual interests of
    men would secure voluntarily what cooperation is needed.</p>
  <p>Differing from all these are those for whom I would speak. Believing that
    the rights of true property are sacred, we would regard forcible communism
    as robbery that would bring destruction. But we would not be disposed to
    deny that voluntary communism might be the highest possible state of which
    men can conceive. Nor do we say that it cannot be possible for mankind to
    attain it, since among the early Christians and among the religious orders
    of the Catholic Church we have examples of communistic societies on a small
    scale. St. Peter and St. Paul, St. Thomas of Aquin and Fra Angelico, the
    illustrious orders of the Carmelites and Franciscans, the Jesuits, whose
    heroism carried the cross among the most savage tribes of American forests,
    the societies that wherever your communion is known have deemed no work of
    mercy too dangerous or too repellent &#8212; were or are communists. Knowing
    these things we cannot take it on ourselves to say that a social condition
    may not be possible in which an all-embracing love shall have taken the place
    of all other motives. But we see that communism is only possible where there
    exists a general and intense religious faith, and we see that such a state
    can be reached only through a state of justice. For before a man can be a
    saint he must first be an honest man.</p>
  <p><strong>With both anarchists and socialists, we, who for want of a better
      term have come to call ourselves single-tax men, fundamentally differ.
      We regard them
    as erring in opposite directions &#8212; the one in ignoring the social nature
    of man, the other in ignoring his individual nature.</strong> While we see that man
    is primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil has come or can come
    from the interference by the state with things that belong to individual
    action, we also see that he is a social being, or, as Aristotle called him,
    a political animal, and that the state is requisite to social advance, having
    an indispensable place in the natural order. Looking on the bodily organism
    as the analogue of the social organism, and on the proper functions of the
    state as akin to those that in the human organism are discharged by the conscious
    intelligence, while the play of individual impulse and interest performs
    functions akin to those discharged in the bodily organism by the unconscious
    instincts and involuntary motions, the anarchists seem to us like men who
    would try to get along without heads and the socialists like men who would
    try to rule the wonderfully complex and delicate internal relations of their
    frames by conscious will.</p>
  <p>The philosophical anarchists of whom I speak are few in number, and of little
    practical importance. It is with socialism in its various phases that we
    have to do battle.</p>
  <p><strong>With the socialists we have some points of agreement, for we recognize fully
    the social nature of man and believe that all monopolies should be held and
    governed by the state. In these, and in directions where the general health,
    knowledge, comfort and convenience might be improved, we, too, would extend
    the functions of the state.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>But it seems to us the vice of socialism in all its degrees is its
      want of radicalism, of going to the root. It takes its theories from those
      who
    have sought to justify the impoverishment of the masses, and its advocates
    generally teach the preposterous and degrading doctrine that slavery was
    the first condition of labor. It assumes that the tendency of wages to a
    minimum is the natural law, and seeks to abolish wages; it assumes that the
    natural result of competition is to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish
    competition by restrictions, prohibitions and extensions of governing power.
    Thus mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the stone for hitting
    it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not worse are futile.
    Associated though it is in many places with democratic aspiration, yet its
    essence is the same delusion to which the children of Israel yielded when
    against the protest of their prophet they insisted on a king; the delusion
    that has everywhere corrupted democracies and enthroned tyrants &#8212; that
    power over the people can be used for the benefit of the people; that there
    may be devised machinery that through human agencies will secure for the
    management of individual affairs more wisdom and more virtue than the people
    themselves possess. 
    This superficiality and this tendency may be seen in all the phases of socialism.</strong></p>
  <p>Take, for instance, protectionism. What support it has, beyond the mere
    selfish desire of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their goods
    are worth, springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not consumption,
    is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s-worth,
    and to sell more profitable than to buy; and above all from a desire to limit
    competition, springing from an unanalyzing recognition of the phenomena that
    necessarily follow when men who have the need to labor are deprived by monopoly
    of access to the natural and indispensable element of all labor. Its methods
    involve the idea that governments can more wisely direct the expenditure
    of labor and the investment of capital than can laborers and capitalists,
    and that the men who control governments will use this power for the general
    good and not in their own interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict
    liberty, invent crimes. They promote perjury, fraud and corruption. And they
    would, were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilization
    and reduce mankind to savagery.</p>
  <p>Take trades-unionism. While within narrow lines trades-unionism promotes
    the idea of the mutuality of interests, and often helps to raise courage
    and further political education, and while it has enabled limited bodies
    of working-men to improve somewhat their condition, and gain, as it were,
    breathing-space, yet it takes no note of the general causes that determine
    the conditions of labor, and strives for the elevation of only a small part
    of the great body by means that cannot help the rest. Aiming at the restriction
    of competition &#8212; the limitation of the right to labor, its methods
    are like those of an army, which even in a righteous cause are subversive
    of liberty and liable to abuse, while its weapon, the strike, is destructive
    in its nature, both to combatants and non-combatants, being a form of passive
    war. To apply the principle of trades-unions to all industry, as some dream
    of doing, would be to enthrall men in a caste system.</p>
  <p>Or take even such moderate measures as the limitation of working-hours and
    of the labor of women and children. They are superficial in looking no further
    than to the eagerness of men and women and little children to work unduly,
    and in proposing forcibly to restrain overwork while utterly ignoring its
    cause &#8212; the sting of poverty that forces human beings to it. And the
    methods by which these restraints must be enforced, multiply officials, interfere
    with personal liberty, tend to corruption, and are liable to abuse.</p>
  <p><strong>As for thoroughgoing socialism, which is the more to be honored
      as having the courage of its convictions, it would carry these vices to
      full expression.
    Jumping to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it fails to see
    that oppression does not come from the nature of capital, but from the wrong
    that robs labor of capital by divorcing it from land, and that creates a
    fictitious capital that is really capitalized monopoly.</strong> It fails to see that
    it would be impossible for capital to oppress labor were labor free to the
    natural material of production; that the wage system in itself springs from
    mutual convenience, being a form of cooperation in which one of the parties
    prefers a certain to a contingent result; and that what it calls the &#8220;iron
    law of wages&#8221; is not the natural law of wages, but only the law of
    wages in that unnatural condition in which men are made helpless by being
    deprived of the materials for life and work. It fails to see that what it
    mistakes for the evils of competition are really the evils of restricted
    competition &#8212; are due to a one-sided competition to which men are forced
    when deprived of land. While its methods, the organization of men into industrial
    armies, the direction and control of all production and exchange by governmental
    or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried to full expression, mean
    Egyptian despotism.</p>
  <p><strong><em>We differ from the socialists in our diagnosis of the evil and we
      differ from them as to remedies.</em></strong> We have no fear of capital, regarding it as the
    natural handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself as natural and
    just; we would set no limit to accumulation, nor impose on the rich any burden
    that is not equally placed on the poor; we see no evil in competition, but
    deem unrestricted competition to be as necessary to the health of the industrial
    and social organism as the free circulation of the blood is to the health
    of the bodily organism &#8212; to be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation
    is to be secured. <strong>We would simply take for the community what belongs to
    the community, the value that attaches to land by the growth of the community;
    leave sacredly to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and,
    treating necessary monopolies as functions of the state, abolish all restrictions
    and prohibitions save those required for public health, safety, morals and
    convenience.</strong></p>
  <p>But the fundamental difference &#8212; the difference I ask your Holiness
    specially to note, is in this: <strong>socialism in all its phases looks
    on the evils of our civilization as springing from the inadequacy or inharmony
    of natural
    relations, which must be artificially organized or improved.</strong> In its idea
    there devolves on the state the necessity of intelligently organizing the
    industrial relations of men; the construction, as it were, of a great machine
    whose complicated parts shall properly work together under the direction
    of human intelligence. This is the reason why socialism tends toward atheism.
    Failing to see the order and symmetry of natural law, it fails to recognize
    God.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, <strong>we who call ourselves single-tax men (a name
      which expresses merely our practical propositions) see in the social and
      industrial relations
    of men not a machine which requires construction, but an organism which needs
    only to be suffered to grow.</strong> We see in the natural social and industrial
    laws such harmony as we see in the adjustments of the human body, and that
    as far transcends the power of man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct
    as it is beyond man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct the vital movements
    of his frame. We see in these social and industrial laws so close a relation
    to the moral law as must spring from the same Authorship, and that proves
    the moral law to be the sure guide of man where his intelligence would wander
    and go astray. Thus, to us, all that is needed to remedy the evils of our
    time is to do justice and give freedom. This is the reason why our beliefs
    tend toward, nay are indeed the only beliefs consistent with a firm and reverent
    faith in God, and with the recognition of his law as the supreme law which
    men must follow if they would secure prosperity and avoid destruction. This
    is the reason why to us political economy only serves to show the depth of
    wisdom in the simple truths which common people heard gladly from the lips
    of Him of whom it was said with wonder, &#8220;Is not this the Carpenter
    of Nazareth?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And it is because that in what we propose &#8212; the securing to all men
    of equal natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers and the removal
    of all legal restriction on the legitimate exercise of those powers &#8212; we
    see the conformation of human law to the moral law, that we hold with confidence
    that this is not merely the sufficient remedy for all the evils you so strikingly
    portray, but that it is the only possible remedy.</p>
  <p>Nor is there any other. The organization of man is such, his relations to
    the world in which he is placed are such &#8212; that is to say, the immutable
    laws of God are such, that it is beyond the power of human ingenuity to devise
    any way by which the evils born of the injustice that robs men of their birthright
    can be removed otherwise than by doing justice, by opening to all the bounty
    that God has provided for all.</p>
  <p><strong>Since man can live only on land and from land, since land is the
      reservoir of matter and force from which man&#8217;s body itself is taken,
      and on which he must draw for all that he can produce, does it not irresistibly
      follow
    that to give the land in ownership to some men and to deny to others all
    right to it is to divide mankind into the rich and the poor, the privileged
    and the helpless?</strong> Does it not follow that those who have no rights
    to the use of land can live only by selling their power to labor to those
    who own
    the land? Does it not follow that what the <strong>socialists</strong> call &#8220;the
    iron law of wages,&#8221; what the political economists term &#8220;the tendency
    of wages to a minimum,&#8221; must take from the landless masses &#8212; the
    mere laborers, who of themselves have no power to use their labor &#8212; all
    the benefits of any possible advance or improvement that does not alter this
    unjust division of land? For having no power to employ themselves, they must,
    either as labor-sellers or as land-renters, compete with one another for
    permission to labor. This competition with one another of men shut out from
    God&#8217;s inexhaustible storehouse has no limit but starvation, and must
    ultimately force wages to their lowest point, the point at which life can
    just be maintained and reproduction carried on. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>You state that you approach the subject with confidence, yet in all that
    greater part of the Encyclical (19-67) devoted to the remedy, while there
    is an abundance of moral reflections and injunctions, excellent in themselves
    but dead and meaningless as you apply them, the only definite practical proposals
    for the improvement of the condition of labor are:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. That the state should step in to prevent overwork, to restrict the employment
        of women and children, to secure in workshops conditions not unfavorable
        to health and morals, and, at least where there is danger of insufficient
        wages provoking strikes, to regulate wages (39-40).</p>
    <p>2. That it should encourage the acquisition of property (in land) by working-men
        (50-51).</p>
    <p>3. That working-men&#8217;s associations should be formed (52-67). <strong>These
        remedies so far as they go are socialistic, and though the Encyclical
        is not without recognition of the individual character of man and of
        the priority
        of the individual and the family to the state, yet the whole tendency
        and spirit of its remedial suggestions lean unmistakably to socialism &#8212; extremely
        moderate socialism it is true; socialism hampered and emasculated by a supreme
        respect for private possessions; yet socialism still. </strong>But, although you frequently
        use the ambiguous term &#8220;private property&#8221; when the context
        shows that you have in mind private property in land, the one thing clear
        on the
        surface and becoming clearer still with examination is that you insist
        that whatever else may be done, the private ownership of land shall be
        left untouched. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the

    <br>
MANY if not most of the writers on political economy have treated exchange as
a part of distribution. On the contrary, it belongs to production. It is by exchange,
and through exchange, that man obtains, and is able to exert, the power of co-operation
which, with the advance of civilization, so enormously increases his ability
to produce wealth. &#8212; <em>The Science of Political Economy</em> &#8212; <a href="http://savingcommunities.org/docs/george.henry/spe311.html">unabridged:

Chapter 9, The Office of Exchange in Production</a><br>
          <br>
THEY who, seeing how men are forced by competition to the extreme of human wretchedness,
jump to the conclusion that competition should be abolished, are like those who,
seeing a house burn down, would prohibit the use of fire. <br>
          <br>
The air we breathe exerts upon every square inch of our bodies a pressure of
fifteen pounds. Were this pressure exerted only on one side, it would pin us
to the ground and crush us to a jelly. But being exerted on all sides, we move
under it with perfect freedom. It not only does not inconvenience us, but it
serves such indispensable purposes that, relieved of its pressure, we should
die. <br>
          <br>
So it is with competition. Where there exists a class denied all right to the
element necessary to life arid labor, competition is one-sided, and as population
increases must press the lowest class into virtual slavery, and even starvation.
But where the natural rights of all are secured, then competition, acting on
every hand &#8212; between employers as between employed, between buyers as between
sellers &#8212; can injure no one. <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
On the contrary it becomes the most simple, most extensive, most elastic, and
most refined system of co-operation that, in the present stage of social development,
and in the domain where it will freely act, we can rely on for the co-ordination
of industry and the economizing of social forces. <br>
          <br>
In short, competition plays just such a part in the social organism as those
vital impulses which are beneath consciousness do in the bodily organism. With
it, as with them, it is only necessary that it should be free. The line at which
the state should come in is that where free competition becomes impossible &#8212; a
line analogous to that which in the individual organism separates the conscious
from the unconscious functions. There is such a line, though extreme socialists
and extreme individualists both ignore it. The extreme individualist is like
the man who would have his hunger provide him food; the extreme socialist is
like the man who would have his conscious will direct his stomach how to digest
it. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>, chapter 28 <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT28.html#Chapter%2028">econlib</a><br>

  </span> IMAGINE an aggregation of men which it was attempted to secure by the
  external direction involved in socialistic theories that division of labor
  which grows, up naturally in society where men are left free. For the intelligent
  direction thus required an individual man or individual men must be selected,
  for even if there be angels and archangels in the world that is invisible to
  us, they are not at our command. Taking no note of the difficulties which universal
  experience shows always to attend the choice of the depositories of power,
  and ignoring the inevitable tendency to tyranny and oppression, of command
  over the actions of others, simply consider, even if the very wisest and best
  of men were selected for such purposes, the task that would be put upon them
  in the ordering of the when, where, how and by whom, that would be involved
  in the intelligent direction and supervision of the almost infinitely complex
  and constantly changing relations and adjustments involved in such division
  of labor as goes on in a civilized community. It is evidently as much beyond
  the ability of conscious direction as the correlation of the processes that
  maintain the human body in health and vigor is beyond it. &#8212; <em>The Science

THE ideal of socialism is grand and noble; and it is, I am convinced, possible
of realization, but such a state of society cannot be manufactured &#8212; it
must grow. Society is an organism, not a machine. It can only live by the individual
life of its parts. And in the free and natural development of all the parts will
be secured the harmony of the whole. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp061.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp061.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p> SOCIALISM in all its phases looks on the evils of our civilization as springing
    from the inadequacy or in harmony of natural relations, which must be artificially
    organized or improved. In its idea there devolves on the State the necessity
    of intelligently organizing the industrial relations of men, the construction

    Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII</a>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>IN socialism as distinguished from individualism there is an unquestionable
    truth &#8212; and that a truth to which (especially by those most identified
    with free-trade principles) too little attention has been paid. Man is primarily
    an individual &#8212; a separate entity, differing from his fellows in desires
    and powers, and requiring for the exercise of those powers and the gratification
    of those desires individual play and freedom. But he is also a social being,
    having desires that harmonize with those of his fellows, and powers that
    can only be brought out in concerted action. There is thus a domain of individual
    action and a domain of social action &#8212; some things which can best be
    done when each acts for himself, and some things which can best be done when
    society acts for all its members. And the natural tendency of advancing civilization
    is to make social conditions relatively more important, and more and more
    to enlarge the domain of social action. This has not been sufficiently regarded,
    and at the present time, evil unquestionably results from leaving to individual
    action functions that by reason of the growth of society and the developments
    of the arts have passed into the domain of <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> social
    action; just as, on the other hand, evil unquestionably results from social
    interference with what properly belongs to the individual. Society ought
    not to leave the telegraph and the railway to the management and control
    of individuals; nor yet ought society to step in and collect individual debts
    or attempt to direct individual industry. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free

  <p>THE primary purpose and end of government being to secure the natural rights
    and equal liberty of each, all businesses that involve monopoly are within
    the necessary province of governmental regulation, and businesses that are
    in their nature complete monopolies become properly functions of the State.
    As society develops, the State must assume these functions, in their nature
    co-operative, in order to secure the equal rights and liberty of all. That
    is to say, as, in the process of integration, the individual becomes more
    and more dependent upon and subordinate to the all, it becomes necessary
    for government, which is properly that social organ by which alone the whole
    body of individuals can act, to take upon itself, in the interest of all,
    certain functions which cannot safely be left to individuals. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp17.html">Social

IT is not the business of government to make men virtuous or religious, or to
preserve the fool from the consequences of his own folly. Government should be
repressive no further than is necessary to secure liberty by protecting the equal

prohibitions extend beyond this line they are in danger of defeating the very
ends they are intended to serve.&#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp17.html">Social

  <p>Note 49: The primary error in all forms of socialism consists in ignoring
    the fact that Capital is but a product of labor and land; or what in effect
    is
    the same thing, in disregarding the necessary inference that land is the
    only implement of labor. Intelligent socialists insist that they do not ignore
    it; but that, while acknowledging land to be the primary implement of labor,
    they see in this only an abstract formula, having at the present stage of
    civilization no practical importance. Society, they urge, is impossible without
    Capital; and he who would live in society must have Capital, or be the slave
    of those who do have it. Therefore, they, argue, Capital is in the social
    state as indispensable as land. Their reasoning hinges upon the mistaken
    assumption that Capital is an accumulation of the past instead of being a
    product of the present. As one socialistic author puts it, &quot;Though labor
    may originally have preceded Capital, yet it is now as absurd to place one
    before the other as it is to attempt to say whether the hen originates the
    egg or the egg the hen.&quot; The explanation of division of labor and trade.
    the effect of which is overlooked by socialistic philosophies, affords a
    better opportunity than the present for considering this elementary error
    of socialism, and a brief discussion of the subject will be given in that
    connection. See post, note 81.<strong> ...</strong></p>
  <p>Note 81: People with socialistic tendencies argue that while it is true
    that Labor and Land are the only things necessary in primitive conditions,
    Capital
    also is necessary in civilized conditions. (See ante, notes 49 and 58.) And
    they want to know, with something like a sneer, what clerks and mechanics
    and bookkeepers and other specialists in our highly organized industry would
    do with land even if it were freely open to them. &quot;They don't know how
    to make food, and they can't eat sand!&quot; I once heard a socialist exclaim.
    The same notion is widespread among that large class of single tax opponents
    in church and college, whom the late Wm. T. Croasdale described as &quot;people
    who believe in socialism, but don't believe in putting it into practice.&quot;</p>
  <p>The idea is best expressed perhaps by a writer of the most brilliant socialistic
    verses, Charlotte Perkins Stetson, in the following :</p>
  <p>&quot;Free land is not enough. In earliest days<br>
    When man, the baby, from the earth's bare breast<br>
    Drew for himself his simple sustenance,<br>
    Then freedom and his effort were enough.<br>
    The world to which a man is born to-day<br>
    Is a constructed, human, man-built world.<br>
    As the first savage needed the free wood,<br>
    We need the road, the ship, the bridge, the house,<br>
    The government, society, and church, &#8212;<br>
    These are the basis of our life to-day<br>
    As much necessities to modern man<br>
    As was the forest to his ancestor.<br>
    To say to the newborn, 'Take here your land;<br>
    In primal freedom settle where you will,<br>
    And work your own salvation in the world<br>
    Is but to put the last-come upon earth<br>
    Back with the dim fore-runners of his race,<br>
    To climb the race's stairway in one life<br>
    Allied society owes to the young&#8212;<br>
    The new men come to carry on the world&#8212;<br>
    Account for all the past, the deeds, the keys,<br>
    Full access to the riches of the earth.<br>
    Why? That these new ones may not be compelled<br>
    Each for himself to do our work again ;<br>
    But reach their manhood even with to-day,<br>
    And gain to-morrow sooner.<br>
    To go on,&#8212;<br>
    To start from where we are and go ahead<br>
    That is true progress, true humanity.&quot;&#8212;In This Our World.</p>
  <p>If one man were turned loose alone upon the earth, or shut off from trading
    with his fellows, it might in great degree be true, as Mrs. Stetson says,
    that he would be put &quot;back with the dim forerunners of his race, to
    climb the race's stairway in one life&quot;; but her criticism does not apply
    to millions of free men who freely trade. To them the land would be enough.
    Even though they were denied existing roads and ships and bridges and houses,
    they would soon make new ones, and starting &quot;from where we are,&quot; would &quot;go
    ahead.&quot; For free land means access to all natural materials and forces,
    and free trade means unobstructed industrial intercourse between laborer
    and laborer. These are the essential conditions, the only conditions, of
    all production &#8212; even of the most civilized.</p>
  <p>The root of the socialistic idea is the thought that we are dependent for
    social life upon accumulated capital. This is a mistake. Social life depends,
    not upon accumulated capital, but upon accumulated knowledge made effective
    by interchange of labor. A laborer who operates some great machine seems
    to be dependent upon the owner of his machine for opportunity to work; but
    the only people upon whom he really depends are laborers who are competent
    co-operatively to make such machines, and who have access to both the land
    from which the materials must be drawn and that upon which they must group
    themselves while doing the work. When socialists lay stress upon the importance
    of accumulated capital they are attributing to accumulated capital the power
    that resides in land and trade; for to control these is to command the benefits
    of accumulated knowledge.</p>
  <p>Since the production of a machine precedes its use, the inference is almost
    irresistible, upon a superficial consideration, that opportunities to labor
    and compensation for labor are governed by the existing supplies of machinery
    to which labor is allowed access. But this is of a piece with the old notion
    of classical political economy that opportunities to labor are dependent
    upon the existing supplies of subsistence that are devoted to the maintenance
    of laborers. The inference is wrong in either form. When we once grasp the
    essential truth of the law illustrated in the text, that the production of
    subsistence, or machinery, or any other unfinished object, that is to say,
    of Capital, is but a form of general wealth production, and that all forms
    of wealth production are in obedience to demand, we clearly see that labor
    is in no respect dependent upon capital either for employment or compensation.
    In the social as in the solitary state, Labor and Land are the only factors
    of wealth production. It is not Capital but Land that supplies materials
    to Labor for its subsistence and its machinery. Instead of capitalists supplying
    laborers with subsistence and machinery, laborers themselves continuously
    produce subsistence and machinery from the materials that land supplies.
    Capitalists neither employ nor pay laborers; laborers employ and pay one
    another.</p>

  <p><strong><em>c. Significance of the Upward Tendency of Rent</em></strong></p>
  <p>Now, what is the meaning of this tendency of Rent to rise with social progress,
    while Wages tend to fall? <strong>Is it not a plain promise that if Rent
    be treated as common property, advances in productive power shall be steps
    in the direction
    of realizing through orderly and natural growth those grand conceptions of
    both the socialist and the individualist, which in the present condition
    of society are justly ranked as Utopian? </strong>Is it not likewise a plain warning
    that if Rent be treated as private property, advances in productive power
    will be steps in the direction of making slaves of the many laborers, and
    masters of a few land-owners? Does it not mean that common ownership of Rent
    is in harmony with natural law, and that its private appropriation is disorderly
    and degrading? When the cause of Rent and the tendency illustrated in the
    preceding chart are considered in connection with the self-evident truth
    that God made the earth for common use and not for private monopoly, how
    can a contrary inference hold? Caused and increased by social growth, 97
    the benefits of which should be common, and attaching to land, the just right
    to which is equal, Rent must be the natural fund for public expenses. 98</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">97. Here, far away from civilization, is a solitary settler.
        Getting no benefits from government, he needs no public revenues, and
        none of the land about him has any value. Another settler comes, and
        another, until a village appears. Some public revenue is then required.
        Not much, but some. And the land has a little value, only a little; perhaps
        just enough to equal the need for public revenue. The village becomes
        a town. More revenues are needed, and land values are higher. It becomes
        a city. The public revenues required are enormous, and so are the land
        values.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">98. Society, and society alone, causes Rent. Rising with
        the rise, advancing with the growth, and receding with the decline of
        society, it measures the earning power of society as a whole as distinguished
        from that of the individuals. Wages, on the other hand, measure the earning
        power of the individuals as distinguished from that of society as a whole.
        We have distinguished the parts into which Wealth is distributed as Wages
        and Rent; but it would be correct, indeed it is the same thing, to regard
        all wealth as earnings, and to distinguish the two kinds as Communal
        Earnings and Individual Earnings. How, then, can there be any question
        as to the fund from which society should be supported? How can it be
        justly supported in any other way than out of its own earnings?</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If there be at all such a thing as design in the universe &#8212; and who
    can doubt it? &#8212; then has it been designed that Rent, the earnings of
    the community, shall be retained for the support of the community, and that
    Wages, the earnings of the individual, shall be left to the individual in
    proportion to the value of his service. This is the divine law, whether we
    trace it through complex moral and economic relations, or find it in the
    eighth commandment. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But what we are presented with,
from Right to Left, is not a
coordinated structure embodying the best elements from both sides,
not even a well-thought-out attempt at syncretism, but rather a
bewildering welter of jerry-built solutions, each one based on
political and emotional considerations and lacking any functional
relationship to a unified system of socio-economic truth -- let alone
any rootage in a grand scheme of teleology or ethics.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A little Socialism here, and a
little Capitalism there; a concern
for the public sector here, and a concession to the profit motive
there; a sop to the "underprivileged" here, and a bow to incentive
there - put them all together, and what have you got? Nothing but a
great big rag-bag, a haphazard pastiche of odds and ends without any
bones and without any guts!</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Nevertheless, there is a Middle
Way. There is a body of
socio-economic truth which incorporates the best insights of both
Capitalism and Socialism. </b>Yet they are not insights that are
artificially woven together to form a deliberate compromise. Instead,
they arise naturally, with a kind of inner logic, from the profound
ethical distinction which is the system's core. They arise
remorselessly from an understanding of the meaning of the
commandment: "Thou shalt not steal." This Middle Way is the
philosophy associated with the name of Henry George.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>I like to picture economic
theory as a vast jigsaw puzzle
distributed across two tables, one called Capitalism and the other,
Socialism.</b> But mingled with the genuine pieces of the puzzle are
many false pieces, also distributed across both tables. Most of us
are either perceptively limited to one table, or else we are unable
to distinguish the genuine pieces from the false. But Henry George
knew how to find the right pieces, and, therefore, he was able to put
the puzzle together -- at least in its general outlines. I don't
claim that he was infallible, or that there isn't further work to be
done. Yet if I find a little piece of puzzle missing here or there,
it doesn't shake my confidence in the harmony of the overall pattern
he discerned. It doesn't make me want to sweep the puzzle onto the
floor and start all over again from scratch.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George was born in 1839 in
Philadelphia, and died in 1897 in

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For a long time, it was the
fashion among academic economists to
ignore or patronize Henry George -- whether for his lack of formal
credentials, for his propensity to mingle moral arguments with
economic ones, or for other perceived intellectual crimes even more
monstrous. Today, this is becoming less and less the case, although,
of course, there were honorable exceptions from the outset. But now
we find economists of every stripe, including at least four Nobel
laureates, united in agreement that George has much to say that is of
vital contemporary importance. The list is far too long to read in
its entirety, but it includes such names as Gary Becker, Kenneth

[Adam] Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the
schools of Proudhon and Lasalle; to show that laissez faire (in its
full true meaning) opens the way to a realization of the noble dreams
of socialism..." <b>Let us return now to our illustration of the
economic jigsaw puzzle, and take a look at the pieces which he
selected from the two tables of Capitalism and Socialism.</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We will begin with the Capitalist
table. <span style="font-weight: bold;">George considered himself
a purifier of Capitalism, not its enemy.</span> He built upon the
foundations laid by the classical economists. The skeleton of his
system is essentially Capitalist. <span style="font-weight: bold;">In
fact, Karl Marx referred to
George's teaching as "Capitalism's last ditch."</span> George believed
in
competition, in the free market, in the unrestricted operation of the
laws of supply and demand. He distrusted government and despised
bureaucracy. He was no egalitarian leveler; the only equality he
sought was equal freedom of opportunity. Actually, what he intended
was to make free enterprise truly free, by ridding it of the
monopolistic hobbles which prevent its effective operation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In his book, <b><i>The Condition
of Labor</i></b>, George said:
"We differ from the Socialists in our diagnosis of the evil, and we
differ from them in remedies. We have no fear of capital, regarding
it as the natural handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself
as natural and just; we would set no limit to accumulation, nor
impose on the rich any burden that is not equally placed on the poor;
we see no evil in competition, but deem unrestricted competition to
be as necessary to the health of the industrial and social organism
as the free circulation of the blood is to the bodily organism &#8212; to
be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation is to be secured."</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Why did George take so many

    Speculation are Tenantry and Debt on the Farms, and Slums and Luxury in the
    Cities</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
      because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But it
      seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community was going
      to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not in any way useful
      to the community. The man may have planted trees, or built roads, and put in
      sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work, and for that he should be paid.
      But should he be paid for guessing what the rest of us were going to need?</p>
  <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences of this guessing game. The
    consequences of land speculation are tenantry and debt on the farms, and
    slums and luxury
      in the cities. A great part of the necessary land is held out of use, and
    so the value of all land continually increases, until the poor man can no
    longer
      own a home. The value of farm land also increases; so year by year more
    independent farmers are dispossessed, because they cannot pay interest on
    their mortgages.
      So the land becomes a place of serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where
      wealth accumulates and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering
      slums, and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous fortunes,
      which they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.</p>
  <p>This condition wrecked every empire in the history of mankind, and it is
    wrecking modern civilization. One of the first to perceive this was Henry
    George, and
      he worked out the program known as the Single Tax. Let society as a whole
    take the full rental value of land, so that no one would any longer be able
    to hold
      land out of use. So the value of land would decrease, and everyone could
    have land, and the community would have a great income to be spent for social
    ends. ...</p>
  <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities, are enormously wealthy families,
      living on hereditary incomes derived from crowded slums. Here and there among
      these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned what he is consuming,
      and that it has not brought him happiness, and is bringing still less to his
      children. Such men are casting about for ways to invest their money without
      breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them might be grateful to learn about
      this enclave plan, and to visit the lovely village of Arden, and see what its
      people are doing to make possible a peaceful and joyous life, even in this
      land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras. ... <a href="../docs/Sinclair_CoLS.html">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are defenders of
capitalism who attack Geonomics (Georgist
economics) for being socialist. Similarly, socialists and communists
criticise Geonomics for being capitalist - in fact, Marx called Henry
George "capitalism's last ditch". Who is right?</small><br>
<br>
<small>"Capitalism" is a woolly word, meaning different things to
different
people. Geonomists wouldn't criticise capitalism per se, but rather
decry "land monopoly capitalism".</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">WHEN TOO MUCH IS BARELY ENOUGH</span></small><br>
<small>Whatever is wrong with the acquisition of capital? Who would not
want
to afford a roof over one's head, adequate food and clothing, some
means of transportation, a decent education, and to go travelling and
see the world? I've put this question innumerable times to
self-declared opponents of capitalism - many of them very well read -
and have never received any sort of adequate rebuttal. The response is
usually along the lines of: "Well, some capital like that is OK, but
nobody should have too much capital". In the final analysis, "too much"
capital means any amount more than the speaker's!</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The flaw here, as we
see it,
is that socialists do not make the vital distinction between earned and
unearned wealth when they attack the owners of capital.</span> </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Was this accumulated capital honestly earned in a free and
a fair market? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Was there no monopolistic privilege? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Was there the creation of real wealth or was there merely
the gaining of speculative profits?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">NO
WEALTH-ENVY FROM US!</span></small><br>
<small>As we see it, if someone is a rich "capitalist" who has
accumulated a
fortune, say, by being a great inventor, author, sportsperson or a
plain hard worker who lives frugally, then "God bless him!" If they
then want to live in a big house and drive a big car, then "Good luck
to 'em!" They've provided services that actually benefit society in a
truly free and fair market, and they'd pay their way in the form of
LVT. We need more such capitalists!</small><br>
<br>
<small>The other capitalists are a different kettle of fish. Reaping
where you
don't sow is not in the Geonomic bible, and the full retention of the
economic rent for the benefit of society would leave absolutely nothing
for the cigar-chomping, would-be robber barons. But let's not forget
the subtle forms of speculation and unearned wealth as practiced even
by well-meaning citizens by speculating in one form or another.
Unfortunately, the "quick bucks" culture is not promoted only in
investment circles. Even the nightly news promotes, and even glorifies,
speculative profits without ever questioning where the wealth comes
from.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Socialism may well be inspired by noble ideals, but in terms of
economic policy it has been an unmitigated failure. Not that it is
necessarily undemocratic, but a command economy requires a large
bureaucracy with its attendant inefficiencies and corrupting
centralisation of power. Rent-seeking speculators have little chance to
do their stuff, true, but neither do ordinary people. There is no
economic incentive to work harder or better and, in any case, the
markets that might quickly adopt new products and processes don't exist.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Another blunder of socialism (and especially communism) is the
failure
to examine the source of property - the dictate that all property
should be socialised fails to differentiate between what is earned and
what is unearned. Again, Geonomics says that any confiscation of
privately created wealth, whether by taxation or by private monopoly,
is plain theft.</small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">NO ROYALISTS, ARE WE!</span></small><br>
<small>In general, Geonomists support a free and fair market with
governments
mainly stepping in to prevent unacceptable environmental damage (which
eco-taxes would largely prevent) and unfair trading practices
(particularly the formation of monopolies and cartels). In this sense
we could be called libertarians of a sort, but often apply the
distinguishing (and pejorative!) label of royalist to conventional
libertarians who effectively condone the privileges of land monopoly
capitalism.</small><br>
<br>
<small>It should be pretty clear by now that Geonomics doesn't fit on
the
conventional left-right spectrum. It's the Third Way - and the only
sustainable one at that. ... <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span

    upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed. ...</p>
  <p>Henry George's teachings involved more than the prescription of specific remedies
      for particular evils. The specific remedies which he proposed were means to
      an end. The end was the philosophy of freedom as applied to human relations.
      I do not say that the majority of the people of the world have given acceptance
      to many of his most important teachings. Indeed, in view of the world tendency
      since his death to aggrandize the powers of the political state and limit and
      subordinate the power of the people, it is self-evident that in this environment
      the principles of Henry George could not have won general acceptance. Had they
      done so, the world would have made greater progress toward the attainment of
      the goal of human freedom and economic contentment which is still the unrealized
      aspiration of humanity.</p>
  <p>Moreover, many who have believed in the necessity for basic social changes
      preferred to ignore the simple and fundamental teachings of Henry George, and
      to adopt, instead, the philosophy of Marx and Lenin. It is the wide acceptance
      of the doctrines of these false prophets which has contributed to making the
      economic condition of the masses worse, has reduced their standard of living
      and has made of Europe an armed camp. It is their disciples who are now attempting
      to introduce here the political and economic theories which in other countries
      have culminated in the totalitarian state, together with the host of iniquities
      which are inseparably connected with it. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
It may seem odd that both "capitalists" and "socialists" speak of the
justice of their system and the vile in-justice of their opponents'.
(Of course, the emotion behind such discussions is often heightened by
a kind of home-team fervor.) <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there any
universal standard of justice
upon which economic policy can be based?</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The answer lies in clarifying the question of the rightful basis (if
there is one) of public vs. private ownership. For the thorough-going
free-market capitalist, "public ownership" of anything is anathema: the
community's interests are best served by the unhindered interactions of
self-interested producers and traders.<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">But the poverty, suffering and
environmental destruction that come under such a "private property"
regime cannot be denied. </span>Because of this, the great bulk of
social-policy debate revolves around how much of the efficiency of free
enterprise must be traded for public interference, imposed in the name
of equity. The question of the rightful balance between public and
private control becomes one of expediency and political fashion,
lacking any guiding principle. Indeed, modern "neoclassical economics"
denies that any such principle exists.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
For Henry George, however, the principle was clear. The value of
natural opportunities belongs entirely to the community, and the
production of wealth by labor, using capital, should be entirely
unhindered by the penalty of taxation. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">For George, the most important
question was not the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">amount </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should be taken by
the
community, but the </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">kind </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">of wealth that should rightfully
go to the
community, because it is a value that the community has created.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>
In recent years, this understanding of the distinctive character of
natural opportunity (land) as a factor of production has led to the
coining of a new term: Geoism, indicating a philosophy based on the
rightful understanding of the place of the Earth (Geo-) in economic
life.</small>

    that is simple; they want it complex so they can be fooled.</p>
  <p>Now the theory of Henry George and of those who really believe in the common
      ownership of land is that the public should take not alone taxation from
    the land, but the public should take to itself the whole value of the land
    that
      has been created by the public &#8212; should take it all. It should be a part
      of the public wealth, should be used for public improvements, for pensions,
      and belong to the people who create the wealth &#8212; which is a strange doctrine
      in these strange times. It can be done simply and easily; it can be done by
      taxation. All the wealth created by the public could be taken back by the public
      and then poverty would disappear, most of it at least. The method is so simple,
      and so legal even &#8212; sometimes a thing is legal if it is simple &#8212; that
      it is the easiest substantial reform for men to accomplish, and when it
      is done this great problem of poverty, the problem of the ages, will be
      almost
      solved. We may need go farther.</p>
  <p>Henry George said, in &quot;<strong><em>Progress and Poverty</em></strong>&quot; that while the land
      tax may not bring about the dream of the socialist, it would still prepare
      the way for that &#8212; or for any dream. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_Land_Belongs.html">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Common Property in Land is
Compatible with the Market
Economy.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
to make a
hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
economists
and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
enjoy the other.
These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
you with
loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
variously call
Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
control your
resources.&nbsp; </small><br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To keep land common while shifting to a
market economy,
you simply use the tax system. </span>Taxation is the form that common
property takes in
a monetary, market-oriented economy. To tax is to socialize. It's then
just a simple question of what you will socialize through taxation, and
how; but in
the answers lie success or failure.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not
only can you have both common
land and free markets, you can't have one without the other. They go
together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices to help
identify land's taxable
surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
truly free
market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
and
capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
this second
point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
OECD nations that
now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
make
all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
own abysmal
systems. 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
The very people who gave us the term laissez-faire -- the
slogan at the core of a
free market economy -- made communizing land rents a
central part of their
program. </span>These were the French economistes of the 18th
Century, sometimes
called "Physiocrats," who were the tutors of Adam Smith,
and who inspired land
reforms throughout Europe. The best-known of them were
Fran&ccedil;ois Quesnay and
A.R. Jacques Turgot, who championed land taxation. They
accurately called it the
"co-proprietorship of land by the state."
</small></div>
<small>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
Since their time we have learned to measure land values,
and we have broadened
the meaning of "land" to comprise all natural resources.
</span>Agrarians will be relieved,
and may be surprised, that <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">farmland ranks
well down the
list in terms of total
market value. Thus, a land tax is not primarily a tax on
farms; only the very best
soils in the best locations yield much taxable
surplus.</span>&nbsp; <strong>...&nbsp;</strong> </small></div>
<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Another natural resource (hence
part of "land"), whose
nature and value the mass
of people are only slowly realizing, is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">radio
spectrum</span>. In this age of
communication its value is vaulting skywards even faster
than the rockets
launching the satellites that direct and relay signals
through the spectrum. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Each
satellite requires a spectrum assignment, or it is nothing
but space junk.</span> One
minor American entrepreneur, Craig McCaw, collected a
bundle of spectrum rights
for cell phones, and a few years ago sold them to AT&amp;T
for $12 billions. Then Mr.
McCaw went partners with Bill Gates, perhaps the richest
American, in a firm
called Teledesic, to launch hundreds of satellites and
amass radio spectrum
rights around the entire world, including your part of the
world, in the hope of
dominating worldwide communications. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radio
spectrum is a
natural resource, and
it belongs to the government, even in the capitalistic
U.S.A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When Teledesic
comes calling, </span>under the auspices of our Vice President Al
Gore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't sell
anything cheap! In fact, don't sell anything at all, but
lease it for a limited time, so
you may gain from future rises in value.</span> And don't stint
on the professional help
you should hire to protect your interests: these lease
contracts are complex, and
are worth Billions if you play your cards right.
</span></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Hydrocarbons are a third set
of valuable resources.</span> The
values involved are
gigantic. The recent merger of the Exxon and Mobil oil
firms was valued at $260
billions, several times greater than the Russian annual
budget. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should private
parties make off with all this natural value?... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> The American state of Alaska
holds down its other taxes by
socializing part of its
oil revenues, which otherwise would inure to a handful of
the major stockholders of
two corporations (ARCO and BP). Alaska not only holds down
other taxes, it pays
each resident - man, woman, and child - a social dividend
of over $1,000 per year.</span>
Go thou and do likewise. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Many third-world nations like
Venezuela or Nigeria have
fabulous mineral oil that
they fail to exploit for their own people, letting
sophisticated or ruthless foreign
corporations, in tandem with weak or corrupt insiders,
reap the gains.</span> The
question for Russia is whether to follow their bad example
and become a poor
resource-colony of the west, or whether to assert your own
sovereignty over your
own resources for the benefit of your own people. You need
look no further than
Norway for a model.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Other subsoil resources have
great value, too.</span>&nbsp; ...&nbsp; Russia is a treasure-house of
untapped mineral
wealth that you can and
should tax to alleviate the condition of the Russian
people.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> In arid lands, water is life,
and the most valuable
natural resource is water.&nbsp; </span><strong>... </strong></small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Another value from water is to
generate power.</span>&nbsp; ... Again,
California witlessly fails to
socialize this value, but Canada, our northern neighbor,
has shown the way.&nbsp;</small>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fisheries are another source of
value.</span>&nbsp; In the past most
nations have let this rent
be "dissipated" by overfishing. In recent years the U.S.
and Canada have in effect
"privatized" fishing in their offshore waters by limiting
the number of licenses and
boats. This limitation was needed and desirable, overall.
It created large rents,
where previously there were little or none, by preventing
overfishing and the great
waste of duplicate, triplicate, and even quintuplicate
fishing effort. That is a good
example of husbanding and guarding rent, which is
necessary before you can
collect it. It was not necessary or desirable, however, to
give away this net benefit
to private parties.
</small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The government did not sell
these licenses, but simply
gave them away to owners
of existing boats, and others with political influence.
Each license now sells for
something like a million dollars, creating a new class of
instant millionaires and
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">"parlor fishermen."</span> </span>This
giveaway to the few, and takeaway
from the many,
created an instant class society where before there were
equal access and equal
opportunities. </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">These
privileges are worth so much that there are now
documented cases off
Alaska where the parlor fisherman takes 70% of the total
catch. </span>The captain, the
crew, and the owner of the boat, who do the work and bear
the dangers and
discomforts and financial risks of fishing, must get by
with the other 30%.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Parlor
fishermen are simply leeches; these rents should be
socialized, relieving the
workers from taxes.
</span></small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Avoid "perverse subsidies." </span>These
are subsidies
that encourage
harmful things like </small><small></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>polluting air and water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>wasting
water, 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>cutting timber
whose value is less than the cost of logging, or 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>populating remote regions
whose costs exceed the benefits derived.</small> </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Cape Breton Island, the northern tip of Nova Scotia,
contains the most
polluted area in Canada thanks to years of subsidies
to sustain its
uneconomic, obsolescent coal and steel industries
that employ just a few
people by fouling one of the most scenic jewels in
North America.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<small>&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;</small><br>
<small> Perverse subsidies like those are unspeakably foolish
and wasteful. They
"dissipate rent" so there is none left to tax.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Gospels.html">The
Political Economy of the Gospels</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<p><small>The message of the Gospels is that our sins are forgivable,
that
death is not to be feared because our true lives are spiritual rather
than physical, and that participation in the kingdom of God -- a new
and better life in this world as well as the next -- is accessible to
all who orient themselves to God.</small></p>
<p><small>Drawing on the Old Testament, Jesus taught that our first
commandment is that we love God with all our heart, and all our soul,
and all our mind, and all our strength, and that our second
commandment is that we love our neighbor as
ourselves.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>1</i></b></small></font> When
asked who our
neighbor is, he replied with the parable of the good Samaritan,
implying that anyone we encounter is our neighbor.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font> Jesus taught an
ethic in which
there are no bounds on our obligations to others:&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ... 
</span></span></small></p>
<p><small>When asked by Peter, "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times?" Jesus replied, "I say not
unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."&nbsp; In
other words, we are to
forgive indefinitely.</small></p>
<p><small>This unbounded obligation to others is reconciled with the
need to
survive through the introduction of the idea that it is not through
our own anxious efforts, but through God's provision for us that we
survive: <strong>... 
</strong></small></p>
<p><small>The message of the Gospels denies the validity of concern for
material scarcity. This is made particularly clear in the accounts of
the feeding of the multitudes with just a few loaves and
fishes.</small></p>
<p><small>comprehending this counterintuitive idea, that material
scarcity
is not to concern us, is brought out by the accounts of how even
Jesus' disciples did not understand the message:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... 
</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p><small>Without a concept of material scarcity it is difficult to
construct an economic theory, as material scarcity is central to
economic theory. And yet, even without a concept of material scarcity
there is an allocation problem to be solved--the allocation of our
efforts.</small></p>
<p><small>In the parable of the talents we are told that we will be
expected
to accomplish something with the resources that are put into our
hands. <font size="-1"><small><b><i>8</i></b></small></font> This
parable is
followed in Matthew by a teaching that may be taken as an indication
of what constitutes accomplishment:
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>... 
</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<small>In other words, every person is a manifestation of God, and
anything that we can do to help anyone is to our credit.</small>
<small>There is thus an unlimited task for each of us. No one of us
will
ever be able to say, "I have done every last thing that might be
required of me. I have no further obligations." But neither are we to
be concerned that that which we have left undone might be held
against us. For if we refrain from judging others, we ourselves will
not be judged:&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<p><small>With this message of the Gospels in mind, turn now to the
problem
of political economy, the problem of what principles ought to govern
the organization of the production of goods and their
distribution.</small></p>
<p><small>One might first ask whether the requirement that we abandon
concern for scarcity would preclude production. The answer is no, it
is not production that we are cautioned to avoid, but anxiety. There
are any number of reasons why we might allocate some of our time to
production, without being anxious about our own material
requirements. We feel called to undertake a particular kind of work,
so we do it, trusting that any material needs we may have will be
satisfied. If we want to undertake our productive activities in
conjunction with others, that's fine, too. Associating with others
provides us with opportunities to be useful to them.</small></p>
<p><small>Among those who are close to us there is no need for prices
and
markets, because we can see easily enough how we can be of service to
them. But human discernment is limited, and prices and markets help
us to be aware of what is valued by people who are less close to
us. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<small>Refraining from the use of force is a recurring theme in the
political economy of the Gospels. We are called to refrain from the
use of force in defense of property. We are called to refrain from
the use of force in financing public activities. We are called to
refrain from the use of force in providing for those who might
otherwise lack. And we show our love for those who do not wish to
participate in our political economy by leaving for them the same per
capita value of land and natural resources that we claim for
ourselves.</small>
<p><small>Consider now how this framework bears on some traditional
questions of economic ethics. Take first the problem of the just
price. This simply is not an issue. If two people have the
opportunity to trade--to cooperate--on terms that are mutually
agreeable to the two of them, it is not for us to say that they ought
to be trading on other terms. Between people who love one another,
the problem of settling on the terms of trade is no more difficult
than the problem when friends eat lunch together of deciding who will
pick up the tab, or how it will be split.</small></p>
<small>That those outside a relationship are not called upon to
prescribe
its terms is supported by a passage from
Luke: <strong>... </strong><br>
<br>
Relations between employers and employees are a special case of
relations between traders. <strong>... </strong><br>
The problem of worker management is not a problem either. <strong>... </strong><br>
</small>
<p><small>Corporate responsibility may be more of an issue for a
Gospel-based political economy. The corporate form of organization
permits us to participate in the establishment and management of
firms while knowing very little about the other people with whom we
are involved or the actions that are taken on our behalf. If this
leads us to support implicitly actions of managers in their concern
for the bottom line that we could not in good conscience take
ourselves, then there is something troubling about our participation
in corporations. We need to find ways of managing the resources under
our control that do not lead us to endorse implicitly and to profit
from actions that we would not endorse directly or take ourselves.
</small></p>
<p><small>The grand question of economic ethics, the question of
whether
capitalism or socialism is the more appropriate form of political
economy, is another non-question from the perspective of the Gospels.
Everyone who wants to live under socialism should be free to live
under socialism, and everyone who wants to live under capitalism
should be free to live under capitalism. In whichever group we fall,
we will want to insure that those who want to organize their lives by
different principles of political economy have their share of land
and natural resources with which to do so.</small></p>
<p><small>A political economy based on the Gospels is a political
economy
based on love. As the First Epistle of John says, "There is no fear
in love; but perfect love casteth out
fear."<font size="-1"><small><b><i>17</i></b></small></font> To
construct a
political economy of the Gospels we must be free of fear: free of
fear that others may rob us; free of fear that others may not
contribute to the provision of public goods or to provision for those
who might otherwise lack; free of fear that our incomes will be too
low or the prices we face too high; free of fear that if we don't do
something, someone will be exploited. Only when love has replaced all
fear in our hearts will we be able to construct the political economy
of the Gospels.</small> <small><a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Tideman_Gospels.html"><span

Jeff Smith: <a href="file:///C|/aa%20W&W/docs/Smith_Left_Must.html">What the Left
Must Do: Share the Surplus</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What would you do if you could
work two days and take five off? Write?
Play soccer? Tend to the community garden? Time off is an option made
increasingly viable by our relentlessly rising rate of productivity.
French Marxist and media critic Jean Baudrillard, while still advancing
the interests of labor, implores the Left to move on from seeing humans
as workers to seeing workers as human beings, with more needs than
merely the material. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Enabling people
to live their lives more fully</span> is an issue made to order for
rescuing the Left from the doldrums that descended when &#8220;history ended&#8221;.</small><br>
<br>
<small>What would single mothers do with enough income to stay home?
What
would minorities do with the wherewithal to begin their own businesses?
What would communities do if they did not leak resources up to an upper
class and out to a distant lender or tax collector? What would the
elite do without our commonwealth? The means to these ends is an extra
income apart from labor or capital (savings), that is, a &#8220;social
salary&#8221; from society&#8217;s surplus, a &#8220;Citizens Dividend&#8221; from all the
rents, natural and governmental, that people pay for land and to the
privileged, redirected to everyone equally.&nbsp; Merely demanding a
fair sharing of the bounty from nature and modern society would raise
people&#8217;s self-esteem, a key component for political involvement.
Actually receiving an income supplement would transform our lives and
restructure society.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Unless humanity needs militarism, corporate welfare, and debt
service,
it&#8217;s fair to say most public revenue gets wasted. Demanding a dividend
&#8211; similar to Alaska paying residents a share from oil royalties &#8211;
forces a new dialog on spending priorities. Beyond arguing &#8220;bread not
bombs,&#8221; a dividend replaces expenditures by politicians (necessarily
influenced by donors) with spending by citizens, the people who
generate the
surplus in the first place. With a dividend, citizens get to see
themselves as direct beneficiaries from reigning in the wild spending
spree on imperial aggression, disloyal
multinationals, and on &#8220;borrowing&#8221; money that never existed until
&#8220;lent&#8221; by the Federal Reserve.<strong> ... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demanding
jobs rather than a fair
share of society&#8217;s surplus implies that there is no commonwealth or
that expropriating it by a few is OK. Neither is true. </span>Rents
are real, and they are ours. There is a free lunch (just ask the
privileged), as those downing it do get money for nothing. And since
society, not lone owners, generates these values, that flow of funds
belongs to everyone.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value of a parcel of land is
initially based on the natural
endowments of the location (&#8220;location, location, location&#8221;), created
not by an owner but by
whatever created all of us. Next, <span style="font-weight: bold;">land
value rises with the presence of society, and grows with the population
of society. It&#8217;s highest where society is densest, in the city centers,
typically 2000 times more </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">valuable
than sites in the boondocks.</span> Land values as economic values
disappear whenever society quits respecting one&#8217;s claim, as in a war
zone; there, real estate offices nimbly shut down. And while land
titles may be the holy grail of wannabe homeowners, they&#8217;re also the
ticket to pocket unearned rent by absentee landlords, such as Donald
Trump.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Making land public does not guarantee
that the public end up with the rent. The public&#8217;s steward, the state,
often lets public resources at &#8220;fire-sale&#8221; prices, unduly enriching
Chevron, Arco, Kerr-McGee, Weyerhauser, etc.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The state gifts enormously
valuable licenses for TV, radio, and cell phones to GE, Disney, Time
Warner, and Clear Channel. </span>The metaphor, &#8220;field of knowledge&#8221;,
lets us see patents and copyrights as flags; by excluding innovative
outsiders, they not only skew techno-progress (thus addicting
civilization to oil) but also enrich those few who can afford to corral
them: GM, DuPont, and Microsoft. Similarly, a utility franchise lets
AT&amp;T pay investors, and Enron insiders, handsomely.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>That&#8217;s how great fortunes are
made: by sloughing off private costs
(which become &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;) while soaking up public
benefits (some &#8220;positive externalities&#8221;). Land titles, corporate
charters, and other privileges &#8211; mere pieces of paper &#8211; are worth
trillions each year. The corporations &#8211; from the Federal Reserve to
Exxon (both founded by the &#8220;oiligarchy&#8221;) &#8211; that receive these
privileges make their owners rich or richer. Their wealth is not
compensation for the exertions of either labor or capital, not profit
in the market from output, but rent from present lobbying of
legislatures or past conquest of others&#8217; lands. Thus laws (&#8220;privilege&#8221;
means &#8220;private law&#8221;) funnel multi-trillions of dollars each year from
the many to the few. <br>
<br>
Rentiers become the elite or rise higher up among the upper echelon,
the puppeteers of our puppet state. Their ranks grow with every
techno-advance that spurs a new monopoly and pushes up locational
values.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Trillions are enough money that
the present beneficiaries spend
fortunes on <span style="font-weight: bold;">electing their water boys</span>
to Congress and state legislatures. Why do public servants agree to let
public assets go for peanuts? Partly out of habit, partly because the
recipients contribute mightily to their political campaigns, but also. <br>
<br>
Well, not exactly &#8220;always&#8221;. Once there was a powerful movement to shift
taxes off wages, onto rents. It was not Marxism, eventho&#8217; one of the
first demands in the Communist Manifesto was to tax land (acknowledging
the history of the enclosures
of farmland which forced surplus labor to work cheap in the then new
factories in
cities). It was the movement of the Single Tax on land, spearheaded by
Henry George.<br>
<br>
George, author of the classic, <a href="../George_P&P.html"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span></a>
(1879, in its day more popular than <span style="font-style: italic;">Das
Kapital</span>), was Labor&#8217;s candidate
for the mayoralty of New York in 1886, an election he won but a victory
he was denied by the machinations of Tammany Hall. Samuel Gompers
(1850-1924), union organizer who campaigned for George, said, 
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"I
believe in the Single Tax. I count it a great privilege to have been a
friend of Henry George and to have been one of those who helped to make
him understood in New York and elsewhere."</span> <br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whenever George&#8217;s followers
convinced society to shift taxes off
earnings, onto rents, that opened up opportunity. As collecting land
rent knocks down land price, and as speculators turn into developers,
and as formerly procrastinating governments become leasers, then the
use of land rises. Using land requires labor, raising the demand for
workers. More employment means higher wages. ...</small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
As taxing land spurs
employment, taxing labor and capital does just the opposite.</span>
Taxing salaries makes it more expensive to hire people. Taxing earned
profits makes it more expensive to invest in firms that hire people. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">If you want jobs, don&#8217;t tax them. </span>Demanding
jobs while taxing wages is irrational. When we tax (or in other ways
reduce) one&#8217;s efforts, most people naturally produce less.&nbsp; Less
output not only shrinks private assets but also the formation of public
assets downstream.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Unlike taxing earned incomes,
which
shrinks the pie, collecting rent grows the pie. </span>While taxes on
effort lessen the motivation to produce, charging people rent for
what&#8217;s already been provided, by definition, does not diminish the
motive to produce. Instead, recovering rent removes the private profit
from speculating in land and
resources. And once we redirect revenue from sweetheart deals (e.g.,
Pentagon contracts), tax breaks (e.g., depletion allowances), and
subsidies (e.g., agri-business
support) into a general dividend, then why bother currying favours from
the state? Finding rent-seeking from both nature and the legislature
less profitable, investors would turn to improving production: new
technology and worker re-training, providing society more from less. </small><br>
<br>
<small>In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Nation</span>, Robert
Fitch
('90 Oct 29), author of <span style="font-style: italic;">The
Assassination of New York</span></small><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span><small>(1993), stated</small>, </div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">"A
tax levied on land used for commercial purposes is the ideal tax. It
would fall on the richest families and institutions, it can't be
shifted to consumers and owners can't move their property to another
state. Almost invariably, if you tax something the capitalists will
produce less of it and charge you more for it. But land is
different.&nbsp; Most of it was produced once and for all by God."</span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Increasing taxes, fees, or dues upon land, resources, and
privileges
won&#8217;t force firms to raise prices; the ones who try to will lose
customers to those who don&#8217;t; in the end, all will have to settle for
smaller profits. On the other hand, de-taxing
labor and capital, by lowering overhead, lets firms lower the price of
their products, while competition drives them to. The resultant lower
cost of living &#8211; coupled with higher wages and the social salary &#8211; lets
those with enough stuff work less, so those without enough stuff can
work more.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Given the collateral damage by most taxes, the Left must make
clear
that the extra income is to come not from taxes upon people&#8217;s
legitimate earnings but from rent, making it a social salary from
society&#8217;s surplus.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> While opponents
will cry &#8220;redistribution&#8221;, the Left can point out that sharing the
commonwealth is actually &#8220;predistribution.&#8221; Acting like a REIT (Real
Estate Investment Trust) for the public</span>, government would merely
recover and disburse rents before the elite or their friendly
politicians have a chance to misspend society&#8217;s surplus.<a

Kris Feder: <a href="../HG/PP/Feder_intro.html">Progress and Poverty
Today </a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>...&nbsp; </small><small>Public
debate about economic policy revolves today, as it always
has, around a tension between two fundamental social goals.
Economists and policymakers lament a perennial "trade-off between
efficiency and equity." Policies intended to promote savings and
capital formation are held to widen inequality, while redistributive
policies (such as progressive income taxation) erode incentives to
produce and earn. The debates about welfare reform and health care
policy are the most recent versions of this enduring social debate.
And the trade-off is encountered far beyond the borders of the United
States. Citizens of formerly communist countries wonder whether the
efficiency gains of a market economy are worth the social costs.
Developed as well as developing countries agonize over the problem of
how to promote economic growth without also accelerating the
degradation of the environment.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most economists deem it their
business to evaluate the efficiency
of policy choices, but, claiming no special knowledge of ethics, they
leave it to philosophers and the political process to evaluate
questions of justice. Can it be true that society's arrangements to
provide for common needs must always confront a divisive choice
between equity and efficiency - between what is fair and what is
feasible?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Henry George not only denied it;
he asserted the reverse: <b>Full
recognition of economic rights and responsibilities would reveal the
goals of equity and efficiency to be mutually reinforcing. Neither
social justice nor a well-functioning free market system can long be
enjoyed without the other.</b> "The laws of the universe are
harmonious," George proclaimed. His analysis showed that the root
cause of widening inequality lies not in the laws of nature, but in
social maladjustments which ignore them. Moreover, the breach of
justice which underlies the problem of poverty is not merely
incidental to economic development; it impedes development, leading
to wider and wider inequality.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George emphasized that unequal
distribution is itself wasteful of
wealth.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unemployment and underemployment
of labor mean that energy and
intelligence go untapped. For those who find work, he said, high
wages stimulate creativity, invention, and improvement, while low
wages encourage carelessness. Inadequate education of the poor
multiplies the loss. There are the damages done by poverty-related
vice and crime, and the substantial costs of protecting society
against them. There is the burden upon the wealthy of providing
welfare support for the very poor - or risking social upheaval if
they do not. Moreover, said George, social institutions by which some
prosper at others' expense cause talent and resources to be diverted
from productive enterprise to unproductive conflict, as individuals
find that competing for political advantage can be more lucrative
than competing for market success.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In short, an unjust system of
privileges and entitlements tends to
cause misallocation of resources, macroeconomic instability and
stagnation, political corruption, and social conflict that ultimately
may threaten whole civilizations.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>George's central contribution
was to show that the distinction
between individual property and common property forms a rational
basis for distinguishing the domain of public activity from that of
the private.</b> This distinction leads him to a theory of public
finance that reconciles the competing insights of socialism and
laissez-faire capitalism. By a simple fiscal device, the revenue
arising from common property can be captured for the public treasury
and applied to the common benefit, so that government may assume
needed general functions without interfering with individual
incentives. </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>The benefits of sustained economic development would be
widely
shared. </small></li>
  <li><small>The limited resources of the earth would be managed for
the
benefit of all, including future generations. </small></li>
  <li><small>Government would become, not a repressive power, but "the
administration of a great cooperative society. </small></li>
  <li><small>It would become merely the agency by which the common
property
was administered for the common benefit."</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George's insights have wide
application to modern problems. Both
domestically and internationally, the distribution of wealth has
grown more unequal. Europe, North America, and Japan have surged
ahead while many poorer countries have stagnated or declined, many
burdened by debt.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Modern fiscal and monetary
policies have not resolved the problem
of macroeconomic fluctuations. Yet a <b>half century before Keynes,
George outlined a theory of boom and bust which explained the
underlying instability of the market economy under present fiscal
institutions.</b> The operation of a modern system of money and
credit merely serves to intensify that instability. His theory is
consistent with the circumstances of numerous episodes, recently
including Japan's recession and halting recovery, and the savings and
loan debacle in the United States.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Georgist (or "geoclassical")
economic analysis </small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>bears directly upon the current difficulties of Russia and
other
nations emerging from communism, upon the international debt crisis,
and upon the world-wide pressure on environmental and natural
resources. </small></li>
  <li><small>It is relevant to the common experience of chronic budget
deficits, both municipal and federal. </small></li>
  <li><small>It can be applied to the problems of corruption in
government,
and of the concentration of political power associated with
concentration of wealth. </small></li>
  <li><small>It provides an ideal framework for the analysis of
environmental
pollution and the design of environmental policy. </small></li>
  <li><small>Indeed, readers will notice that the modern environmental
movement in certain respects seems to be grappling toward a rediscovery
of Georgist proposals.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many American cities are plagued
by the twin problems of urban
decay and suburban sprawl. An expanding network of roads and highways
carries commuters ever farther to their jobs. Fleeing the problems of
the city, citizens build new homes in the quiet countryside only to
find that traffic congestion, pollution, noise and urban social
problems are flung outward with the movement of population.
Sociologists decry the loss of community, while environmentalists
warn of the potentially disastrous consequences of automobile
pollution, habitat loss, deforestation and ecosystem disruption.
Economists point to the billions of dollars worth of wasted physical
and human capital left behind in the crumbling central cities - where
the urban poor remain stranded to fend for themselves, with few jobs
and, as municipal tax revenues shrink, declining public services. Yet
several years before the automobile appeared, Henry George analyzed
the dynamics of urban growth and decay. He explained the basic
processes that yield an inappropriate geographic distribution of
population, inefficient land use, and urban blight. Enlightened urban
economists and transportation planners today advocate Georgist policy
reforms at the municipal level.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Thus, George's synthesis informs a
research program of remarkable
breadth. Some writers understand Georgism to constitute a distinct
paradigm of political economy, one which reconciles the
contradictions between the two competing paradigms dominant in the
world today - the mainstream neoclassical school, which tends to
focus on the impressive efficiency properties of free markets, and
Marxist socialism. Other Georgist writers believe that Georgism can
and should be explained in the modern language of neoclassical
economics. What is certain is that geoclassical thought bears
crucially on some of the foremost controversies in America and the
world today.&nbsp; </small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span

to Vee: using property tax assessments to monitor the economic landscape</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The &#8216;real world&#8217; in which human
society exists is not
confined to natural, physical phenomena. From earliest times, human
beings have interacted socially and economically. As they do so, they
have specialised and traded in goods and services which are the
products of combinations of labour, capital, enterprise and the
fourth &#8211; often forgotten but distinct &#8211; factor of all production:
land.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land comprises all natural
resources, not just &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">terra
firma</span>.&#8217; It is the universe minus man&#8217;s products. Even the
simplest of human activities, sleep, requires each of us to occupy
exclusively a space, a location, preferably a bed in a home of our
own. But that word &#8216;own&#8217; conjures emotions and political
postures.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Property taxes have always been a
major source of revenue for
governments, especially local governments. Their relative importance
declined around a hundred years ago, as classical economic theory was
eclipsed by the still ruling neo-liberal or Washington orthodoxy and
&#8211; for some seventy years &#8211; its formidable challenger
Marxist socialism. Both Marxist and neo-liberal economists share the
view that land is neither a factor distinct from capital nor
important in an industrial age.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land conjures up visions of
rolling prairies or Constable
landscapes, not skyscrapers or dark Satanic mills. Land reform was
indeed characterised during the latter half of the nineteenth and
early twentieth century in much of the now developed world by massive
increases in landless rural and urban poor, as economies switched
from subsistence agriculture to industrialised farming and then
manufacturing. It also invariably incorporated calls for
registration, sub-division and taxation of land. Henry George&#8217;s
book <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b> </a>massively
out-sold Marx&#8217;
<b><i>Das Capital</i></b> and policies based on his Single Tax (on
land values) achieved remarkable results as far apart as China,
Japan, Chile, Australia, Denmark and the USA (Andelson, 2000).
Between 1915 and 1975 the use of LVT was generally in steep decline,
although many local jurisdictions that were given the choice to adopt
it continued to do so. Taxes based on land-and-buildings, typically
like the British rating system, also declined in relative importance.
Nevertheless the vast majority of developed countries continue to
value property for tax purposes and many assess land/site values
separately from building values, even where they do not levy a land
tax at a separate rate. There is some evidence that, with the
collapse of Communism and the globalisation of capitalism, the
importance of land as a source of public revenue may be increasing.
This is because most other taxable entities are mobile and can with
increasing ease escape the grasp of national &#8211; let alone local
&#8211; treasuries. Location is local: it cannot be moved, hence a tax
on the economic rent of land and other fixed natural resources cannot
be evaded. Nor can it be passed on, as are taxes on wages and
profits, to the consumer via the supply chain, thus adding to
inflation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Rent will remain with the owner
unless and until recovered for
the community that created it, through taxation. On the other hand,
economies competing for the active agents of production &#8211;
capital and labour &#8211; are engaged in a &#8216;race to the
bottom&#8217; of lower tax rates on corporations and high-paid
individuals.</b> Governments wishing to invest in public services are
finding the most secure source of revenue is the property tax. And
within the range of possible property taxes, studies have shown that
cities which shift taxes off buildings onto land values out-compete
those who do not (Plassman &amp; Tideman, 1999; Hartzok, 1997)</small>.<span

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/WoL.htm">The Wages of
Labor
</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are many who, feeling
bitterly the monstrous wrongs of
the present distribution of wealth, are animated only by a blind hatred
of the rich and fierce desire to destroy existing social adjustments.
This class is indeed only less dangerous than those who proclaim that
no social improvement is needed or is possible.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Socialists, as I understand
them, and as the term has come
to apply to anything like a definite theory, do not seek the abolition
of all private property. Those who do this are properly called
Communists.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Socialists seek the assumption
by the State of capital (in
which they vaguely and erroneously include land), or, more properly
speaking, of large capitals, and State management and direction of at
least the larger operations of industry. In this way they hope to
abolish interest, which they regard as a wrong and an evil; to do away
with the gains of exchangers, speculators, contractors, and middlemen,
which they regard as waste; to do away with the wage system and secure
general cooperation; and to prevent competition, which they deem the
fundamental cause of the impoverishment of labor. The more moderate of
them, without going so far, go in the same direction, and seek some
remedy or palliation of the worst forms of poverty by Government
regulation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The essential character of
Socialism is that it looks to the
extension of the functions of the State for the remedy of social evils;
that it would substitute regulation and direction for competition, and
control by organised society for the free play of individual desire and
effort.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The vice of Socialism in all its
degrees is its want of
radicalism, of going to the root.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Its advocates generally teach the
preposterous and degrading
doctrine that slavery was the first condition of labor. It assumes
that the tendency of wages to a minimum is the natural law, and seeks
to abolish wages; it assumes that the natural result of competition is
to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish competition by
restrictions, prohibitions, and extensions of governing power. Thus,
mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the state for
hitting it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not
worse are futile. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As for through-going Socialism &#8211;
which is the more to be
honoured as having the courage of its convictions &#8211; it would carry
these vices to full expression <span style="font-weight: bold;">jumping
to conclusions without effort to
discover causes, </span></small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>it fails to see that oppression does not come from the
nature of capital, but from the wrong that robs labor by divorcing it
from land, and that creates a fictitious capital that is really
capitalised monopoly.</small></li>
  <li><small>It fails to see that it would be impossible for capital to
oppress labor were labor free to the natural material of production;
that the wage system itself springs from mutual convenience, being a
form of cooperation in which one of the parties prefers a certain to a
contingent result, and that what it calls the &#8220;iron law of wages&#8221; is
not the natural law of wages; but only the law of wages in that
unnatural condition in which men are made helpless by being deprived of
the materials for life and work.</small></li>
  <li><small>It fails to see that what it mistakes for the evils of
competition are really the evils of restricted competition are due to a
one-sided competition to which men are forced when deprived of land;
whilst its methods, the organisation of men into industrial armies, the
direction and control of all production and exchange by governmental or
semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried to full expression, mean
Egyptian despotism....</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From both Anarchists and
Socialists we fundamentally differ. We regard them as erring in
opposite directions &#8211; the one in ignoring the social nature of man, the
other in ignoring his individual nature. While we see that man is
primarily an individual, and that nothing but evil has come or can come
from the interference by the State with things that belong to
individual action, we also see that he is a social being, and that the
State is requisite to social advance, having an indispensable place in
the natural order.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Looking on the bodily organism as the analogue of the social
organism, the Anarchists seem to us like men who would try to get along
without heads, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">the Socialists
like men who would try to rule the wonderfully complex and delicate
internal relations of their frames by conscious will.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We differ from the Socialists in our diagnosis of the evil,
and we differ from them as to remedies. <strong>... </strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The fundamental difference is in
this: Socialism in all its
phases looks on the evils of our civilisation as springing from the
inadequacy or inharmony of natural relations, which must be
artificially organised or improved. In its idea there develops on the
State the necessity of organising the industrial relations of men, the
construction, as it were, of a great machine whose complicated parts
shall properly work together under the direction of human intelligence.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is the reason why
Socialism tends towards Atheism.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Royal libertarians are fond of
confusing the classical liberal
concept of common land ownership, particularly as espoused by land
value tax advocate Henry George, with socialism. Yet socialists have
always been contemptuous of George and of the distinction between
land monopoly and capital monopolies. However, Frank Chodorov and
Albert J. Nock (the original editors of The Freeman) were both
advocates of George's economic remedies as well as lovers of
individual liberty.</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>The only reformer
abroad in the world in my time who
interested me in the least was Henry George, because his project did
not contemplate prescription, but, on the contrary, would reduce it to
almost zero. He was the only one of the lot who believed in freedom, or
(as far as I could see) had any approximation to an intelligent idea of
what freedom is, and of the economic prerequisites to attaining
it....One is immensely tickled to see how things are coming out
nowadays with reference to his doctrine, for George was in fact the
best friend the capitalist ever had. He built up the most complete and
most impregnable defense of the rights of capital that was ever
constructed, and if the capitalists of his day had had sense enough to
dig in behind it, their successors would not now be squirming under the
merciless exactions which collectivism is laying on them, and which
George would have no scruples whatever about describing as sheer
highwaymanry.</i> --Albert J. Nock "Thoughts on Utopia"</small><small>...

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>During the late 19th century,
  the burden of various direct taxes was
  not so large that many common people felt their acute impact. It was,
  however, a time of extreme disparities between the poor and the
  wealthy, and the single tax was a means by which to redress some of
  those disparities. It would also foster the availability of employment
  by making labor more attractive relative to land and capital
  investment. In a word, people would more likely have to earn their
  money. The fruits of land wealth, distributed among people equally in
  the form of government services, would go far toward both enhancing
  economic opportunity and correcting inequality. </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Georgists today adhere to much the same points of view,
  although there
  are some significant differences. George himself was an ardent free
  trader, mainly because he believed that the single tax should supplant
  tariffs. After Ricardo, he accepted the idea of comparative advantage
  that arose from trade, but only after land (resource) rents were
  collected so as to preclude the raping of the natural environments of
  countries rich in such resources. He also believed that population
  growth was good &#8212; the more the better, and took special pains to refute
  Malthus. But one should also recall that he was living at a time when
  the expanse of the American continent was still open to any homesteader
  who chose to do so. Population growth was not a problem at that time.
  These elements of George&#8217;s thought are inconsequential to his
  followers today. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Yet it is important
  to note that Georgists are not socialists; they do not
  subscribe to the view that society should own the means of production.
  These should remain privately owned by and large (except perhaps as
  today&#8217;s economic theory would call for, i.e., natural monopolies,
  public goods, and other government instruments). They are, rather,
  free-marketers in the full sense of the world, even more ardently than
  many contemporary American conservatives.</span> He believed that
  removing the
  accretion of economic rent from landsites would restore self-regulating
  equilibrium of the marketplace, thus obviating the need for the heavy
  hand of government controls. <span style="font-weight: bold;">....</span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The justice in the Georgist tradition grows out of the premise
  that one
  is entitled to what one makes with one&#8217;s own hands or mind, but one is
  not personally entitled to the gains that grow out of communal efforts.
  Those are owed to and should be returned to the community. The justice
  inherent in ecological economics, to the extent that it has solidified,
  involves a recognition that preservation of natural capital is in the
  interest of everyone. Both recognize and value the preservation of a
  world commons in nature. Both appreciate the diversity preserved in
  local community institutions and cultures. Both accept models based on
  self-regulating assumptions &#8212; in one case using the phrase &#8220;steady
  state&#8221; economics, in the other case the recovery of land rent in the
  pursuit of open and stable markets over monopoly control. There is
  great promise in the confluence of the two perspectives: they offer a
  solution to the age-old challenge of resolving what in the world ought
  to be public and common, and what else ought to be individual and
  private. It remains now for proponents of each perspective to continue
  exploring commonalities.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Alternatives that have been tried in the past, both classic
  capitalism
  and socialism, suggest that neither has served the interests of
  humanity well in the long term. Ecological economics has no theory of
  property as such, and Georgism here offers a proven course of
  application. To Georgists, ownership is linked to use and not to
  freehold title. Holding individual property under license of the
  community, and under terms which the community stipulates, is an idea
  with a long tradition, well accepted, and needing only to be revived in
  contemporary political, legal and economic discourse. Combined with the
  pricing device of collecting land rent, ecological economics will have
  a tool by which to circumscribe and even reverse the centrifugal forces
  of a new economic imperialism. This is truly the beginning of a &#8220;Third
  Way&#8221; when other theories seem to be moribund. ... <a

<blockquote>
  <p>George held with Paine and Thomas Jefferson that government is at best a
    necessary evil, and the less of it the better. Hence the right thing was
    to decentralize
      it as far as possible, and reduce the functions and powers of the state
    to an absolute minimum, which, he said, the confiscation of rent would do
    automatically;
      whereas the collectivist proposal to confiscate and manage natural resources
      as a state enterprise would have precisely the opposite effect &#8212; it
      would tend to make the state everything and the individual nothing. ...<a href="../docs/Nock_HGUA.htm">read

  <p>Seventy-five years ago, Henry George spelled out his &quot;single tax&quot; program
      <em>Progress and Poverty</em>, one of the best-selling economic works of
      all time. According to E. R. Pease, socialist historian and long-time secretary
      of the Fabian Society, this volume &quot;beyond all question had more to do
      with
      the socialist revival of that period in England than any other book.&quot; ...</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
It becomes particularly remarkable, therefore, to reflect upon our
reluctance as a society to confront certain policy matters because
in the minds of some they would &#8220;open the doors&#8221; to other ethical
choices down the line. We do indeed have choices, both as individuals
and as corporate institutions. Yet rather than openly confront each
dilemma incrementally as mature and responsible adults, many would
close such matters from discussion entirely because it would &#8220;lead us
down the garden path&#8221; to some forbidden or dangerous realm or other.
