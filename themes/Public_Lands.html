Gas Leasing: a Study in Pseudo-Socialism</small></small></a><br>
</small></font></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another form of Managerial
Socialism is direct administration of public lands. Our National
Forests are an example. The track record is not good. The Forest
Service manages a national asset worth over $100 billions, from which
it generates no positive cash flow. Latent surpluses die a-borning. At
one time this was from an excess of ideological commitment to slow
cutting cycles and "community stability," as exemplified by Congressman
James Weaver's dedication to Roseburg, OR. More recently it is from
internalizing profits and plowing them into roading submarginal forests
for premature cutting. Either way it soaks in revenues from other
sources, yielding nothing back. Even if one likes the model, it could
not be universalized.</small><br>
<br>
<small>More commonly, public landlords lease lands to private firms,
limiting their managerial input to dirigisme expressed in regulations
and guidelines. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) thus administers
its vast empire as mainly a passive landlord. Its main task is just
collecting rents. To the extent The Bureau does a good job, or Congress
lets it do a good job, this evinces more of Distributive than
Managerial Socialism. To the extent it does a bad job it is
"Pseudo-Socialism," to be discussed presently.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Distributive Socialism also
means administering public lands
pro-actively, affirmatively, to maximize revenue, in the manner of
private landlords. Not to do so is to let private lessees keep and
privatize the surpluses generated by resources in the public domain.
The NDP in B.C. earned its Socialist stripes by raising rents on
Crown lands owned by the Province ("The Crown Provincial," in
Canadian terms). The Minister of Lands did this directly by
renegotiating timber and other leases, on a site-specific basis.&nbsp;<strong>
...<br>
</strong></small><br>
<small><b><i>Pseudo-Socialism is what happens when resources in the
public domain are leased below a market rental, <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">giving away part of
the public interest. </span></i></b>That has the effect of installing
the
lessee as though he were the owner. The BLM, leasing grazing
privileges on Federal lands in the west, has fallen into this pattern
conspicuously and notoriously, subject to pressure from western
Senators who have the power of many votes in the U.S. Senate relative
to their state populations. The dollar values are small, but the
object lesson is visible, depressing, and cautionary. </small>
<ul>
  <li><small>Some other bad examples are <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">school
section lands</span> in the middle
states. These originated as Federal land grants intended to support
local schools. Some of them are corruptly let to insiders in
"sweetheart deals" for token rents. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Another bad example is the County
of Los Angeles, which owns lands in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Marina del Rey district</span>. One
parcel lay idle for 25 years in the control of a politically
well-connected developer who finally went bankrupt and walked away
from it, leaving unpaid even the token rent charged. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>A third bad
example is ironic: Fairhope, AL, founded and chartered specifically
as a "single-tax colony," to exemplify the principles of Henry
George. The Fairhope Corporation owns the land and collects the
ground rent for public purposes. However, when a new generation arose
"that knew not Joseph" it proved politically impossible to keep
colony ground rents up to market.</small></li>

      III. ADMINISTERING PUBLIC
      LANDS FOR JUSTICE AND EFFICIENCY</b>
      Here are four corners of an effective policy for socializing rent
      from public lands: participate in revenues; control time of lease
      sales for the seller's best advantage; participate in exploration;
      and participate in marketing.</small><br>
      <small><b>A. Participating in
    revenues</b></small>    </div>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
1. Defer payments ...</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">
2. Vary payments according to what is on the site, as that is
disclosed by exploration and production. ...</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.
Give credits for lessee inputs, writing these off against
later royalties.</span> ...<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> 4. Leave a bid variable to soak up
any advantage of the
leasehold site that the lessor has overlooked in setting the
parameter charges, but sharp or sanguine bidders detect.&nbsp; ... </span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>B. Timing lease
sales</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>C. Participating
in exploration</b></small><br>
<small>Public landlords today generally know less about their own
property than do private firms. The firms have leave to range all
over unleased lands, taking seismic soundings, studying satellite
images, developing sophisticated, top-secret computerized models of
the geology, even doing a bit of exploratory, pre-leasing drilling.
When potential lessees know more than the public's agents, the
latter's bargaining power is deeply eroded. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The public may protect itself in
several ways. One is to do some
drilling of its own -- it may hire the same contractors used by
industry. Another is by checkerboarding followed by "drainage sales":
sales of parcels abutting proved producing leaseholds. A third is by
registering all well logs. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>D. Participating in
marketing<br>
</b>Royalties received by lessors are a percentage of wellhead price,
but who sets the price? Transfer pricing scams are all too common in
an industry whose dominant firms are vertically integrated. The
public landlord may well want to take its share of production in
kind, using its own marketing agency, to avoid being exploited. The
mere threat of such a yardstick would have a profound effect on
wellhead pricing.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>CONCLUSION</b>
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is there any chance that
Distributive Socialism will make headway
on the OCS, and other Federal lands? There is always a chance. The
lands, after all, are public, as a matter of history. However
conservative the administration, none would take pride in giving away
its assets. A business oriented administration need not call it any
kind of "Socialism." It prides itself on businesslike management of
public assets. It is our little secret that businesslike management
in this case is the essence of Distributive Socialism. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What about James Watt? He was the
most unpopular figure in
Reagan's Cabinet, just as Douglas McKay was in Eisenhower's, and
Albert Fall was in Harding's. The public does not find giveaways and
sweetheart deals attractive. On the other hand the public does not
always recognize giveaways when there is some subtlety involved. The
appearance of open bidding, and substantial bonus payments for
leaseholds, may be enough to appease the public, the moreso when the
appearance of true competition is reinforced by the endorsement of
many respected economists. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>What must be inculcated in
everyone's thinking is the essential
difference between competition with front money, and competition
where payments are deferred. 
</b></small></p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small><b>The first is limited competition, with
places reserved for an affluent few. <br>
      </b></small></li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The second is evenhanded,
democratic competition on a more level playing field, where
preferential access to credit confers no differential advantage.</b>
This is the condition under which Distributive Socialism can coexist
with, and reinforce, a free market economy. It is achieved on fee
simple lands by subjecting them to heavy land taxes, whereby
newcomers can buy in at low prices in return for paying more over
time. It is achieved on public lands by writing leases with high
lessor participation over time, and low bonuses required up front. <small

<blockquote>
  <p><small>The value of a parcel of land is
      initially based on the natural
      endowments of the location (&#8220;location, location, location&#8221;),
      created not by an owner but by
      whatever created all of us. Next, <span style="font-weight: bold;">land
      value rises with the presence of society, and grows with the population
      of society. It&#8217;s highest where society is densest, in the city centers,
      typically 2000 times more </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">valuable
      than sites in the boondocks.</span> Land values as economic values
      disappear whenever society quits respecting one&#8217;s claim, as in a war
      zone; there, real estate offices nimbly shut down. And while land
      titles may be the holy grail of wannabe homeowners, they&#8217;re also the
      ticket to pocket unearned rent by absentee landlords, such as Donald
    Trump.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Making land public does not
      guarantee
      that the public end up with the rent. The public&#8217;s steward, the state,

      Chevron, Arco, Kerr-McGee, Weyerhauser, etc.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The state gifts enormously

      Warner, and Clear Channel. </span>The metaphor, &#8220;field of knowledge&#8221;,
      lets us see patents and copyrights as flags; by excluding innovative
      outsiders, they not only skew techno-progress (thus addicting

      them: GM, DuPont, and Microsoft. Similarly, a utility franchise lets
      AT&amp;T pay investors, and Enron insiders, handsomely.&nbsp; ...<br>

      Distinctive Factor of Production</a>
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Much land remains untenured</span><br>
    Access to land is open by nature until and unless land is appropriated,
        defended, bounded and policed.&nbsp; No one claims land by right of
        production; no producer must be rewarded to evoke and maintain the
        supply; and submarginal land is not worth policing, unless to preempt
        it for its possible future values, or to preclude anticipated
        competition for markets or labor.&nbsp; Centuries of human customs have
        developed around regulating common use of lands with open access.<br>
    <br>
    Tenure control of some land tends to drive the excluded population to
        untenured land (the "commons"), creating an allocational bias unless
        all land is either tenured or common.&nbsp; Thomas N. Carver styled
        this the phenomenon of "The Congested Frontier", and he might have
        added backwoods.&nbsp; Land which is partly common today includes parks
        and public beaches, streets and highways, water surfaces, wild fish and
        game, and some at least of the "wide open spaces" in less hospitable
        regions.&nbsp; Today there are homeless people for whom life would
        literally be impossible without some form of access, however
        precarious, to untenured land.&nbsp; Some of it, ironically, is near
        the centers of large cities, where the price of land is highest.<br>
    <br>
    No great damage is done if submarginal land is untenured: it won't be
        used anyway.&nbsp; There may be damage, however, when rentable land is
        untenured.&nbsp; It attracts too many entrepreneurs with too much labor
        and capital, leading either to the use of private force to establish
        tenure - unjust, dangerous, and wasteful &#8211; or overcrowding and waste,
        called the "dissipation of rent," when the average cost of the average
        firm equals the average product of labor and capital.&nbsp; Fisheries
        and open range are classic cases.<br>
    <br>
    Some land of high value is untenured or underpriced because consumers
        resist paying for what they think of as "free" because it has no cost
        of production, and which nature continues to supply even though the
    price is too low to ration the land economically.&nbsp; Examples: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>water whose natural source is in southern California (it is
    tenured, but underpriced);</li>
    <li>city streets for movement and parking space, even in New York;</li>
    <li>air and water used for waste disposal in populated areas;</li>
    <li>housing that is subject to rent controls;</li>
    <li>popular beaches and trails;</li>
    <li>oil and gas subject to field price controls; and so on. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>When land is open to public access, so maybe the capital used to
    improve it, e.g. paving of rights-of-way.&nbsp; Such capital may also
    suffer the "tragedy of the commons" of excessive congestion.&nbsp; This
    open access to capital is mainly an incident to the lack of land tenure
    - a characteristic more of land than of capital as such. Remember,
    capital occupies space, but land is space.<br>
    <br>
    It is also possible to legislate and subsidize open access to some
    kinds of labor and capital services, e.g. public health measures, and
    education.&nbsp; These differ from common lands in that they are not
    open "by nature," but by art and public expenditure.
