for Taxing Land</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I.&nbsp; Taxing Land as Ethics
and Efficiency</small><br>
<small>II.&nbsp; What is Land?</small><br>

<small>V.&nbsp; Measuring the Economic Gains from Shifting Taxes to Land</small><br>
<small>VI. The Ethical Case for Taxing Land</small><br>
<small>VII. Answer to Arguments against Taxing Land</small><br>
<br>
<small>There is a case for taxing land based on ethical principles and
a case
for taxing land based on efficiency principles.&nbsp; As a matter of
logic, these two cases are separate.&nbsp; Ethical conclusions
follow from ethical premises and efficiency conclusions from efficiency
principles.&nbsp; However, it is natural for human minds to conflate
the two cases.&nbsp; It is easier to believe that something is good if
one knows that it is efficient, and it is easier to see that something
is efficient if one believes that it is good.&nbsp; Therefore it is
important for a discussion of land taxation to address both question of
efficiency and questions of ethics.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This monograph will first address the<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> efficiency case</span> for taxing land,
because that is the less controversial case.&nbsp; The efficiency case
for taxing land has two main parts. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>To estimate the magnitudes of the impacts that additional taxes
on land
would have on an economy, one must have a model of the economy.&nbsp; I
report on estimates of the magnitudes of impacts on the U.S. economy of
shifting taxes to land, based on a mathematical model that is outlined
in the Appendix.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">ethical case</span> for
taxing land is based on two ethical premises:&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>The ethical case for taxing land ends with a discussion of the
reasons
why recognition of the equal rights of all to land may be essential for
world peace.</small><br>
<br>
<small>After developing the efficiency argument and the ethical
argument for
taxing land, I consider a variety of counter-arguments that have been
offered against taxing land.&nbsp; For a given level of other taxes, a
rise in the rate at which land is taxed causes a fall in the selling
price of land.&nbsp; It is sometimes argued that only modest taxes on
land are therefore feasible, because as the rate of taxation on land
increases and the selling price of land falls, market transactions
become increasingly less reliable as indicators of the value of
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Another basis on which it is argued that greatly increased taxes
on
land are infeasible is that if land values were to fall precipitously,
the financial system would collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Apart from questions of feasibility, it is sometimes argued that
erosion of land values from taxing land would harm economic efficiency,
because it would reduce opportunities for entrepreneurs to use land as
collateral for loans to finance their ideas.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>.</small><br>
<small>Another ethical argument that is made against taxing land is
that the
return to unusual ability is &#8220;rent&#8221; just as the return to land is
rent.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>But before developing any of these arguments, I must discuss
what land
is.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>In addition to discouraging work, most tax systems discourage
saving by
taxing the proceeds of people&#8217;s savings.&nbsp; This results in less
saving and investment.&nbsp; With the passage of time, this can cause a
very large reduction in the amount of capital in an economy.&nbsp; And
a reduced stock of capital generally means that labor will be less
productive and wages will be lower.&nbsp; <strong>A tax system that taxed only
consumption and not saving would not have this component of excess
burden.</strong> However, raising a given amount of revenue in a tax system that
did not tax saving would require a greater distortion of the
labor/leisure decision than in a tax system that did tax saving ... <a

<p>Fred E. Foldvary &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">The
      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Impact on behavior</p>
  <p>Income taxes impose on the economy a large administrative cost by government
      and a cost to payers of filling out forms, paying lawyers and accountants,
      and trying to comprehend the complex requirements. The compliance cost of lost
      time in the U.S. is 5 billion hours per year, the equivalent of two million
      people working full time just to process the income tax. In dollar terms, the
      compliance cost is estimated to be more than $200 billion per year.29</p>
  <p>Reformers who want to impose a national retail sales tax are well aware of
      the substantial impact taxes have on human behavior. That, indeed, is often
      why such reforms are proposed: The reformer wishes to discourage borrowing,
      reduce consumption, or encourage savings, for example. But moving to a national
      retail sales tax results in little improvement.</p>
  <p>Most people use their wage income to pay for goods and services and sales
      taxes. Switching from an income to a sales tax is like taxing you when you
      leave a room instead of when you enter the room.</p>
  <p>Income taxes punish savings, but sales taxes punish borrowing. If you borrow
      $10,000 to buy a car and there is a 20 percent sales tax, you need to borrow
      an extra $2,000 to pay the tax. Some folks might decide to not buy the car,
      spending the $10,000 on something else, without borrowing $2,000.</p>
  <p>There is no good economic reason to tax-punish consumption or borrowing. The
      purpose of production is consumption! If we punish consumption, we punish production.
      Consumption is not an evil to be thwarted, but the very benefit we get from
      the economy. We may as well also tax fun and joy! Those seeking to tax consumption
      act as though they have a Puritan streak that considers enjoying goods to be
      evil and working and saving to be good for their own sake. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>
