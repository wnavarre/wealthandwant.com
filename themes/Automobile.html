 <p>Our country has a huge dependence on cars and therefore on oil. This leads
   to a range of ills. Special interests, in the form of the auto industry and
   the subsidies and privileges it has received over the years, have moved us
   away from public transportation to individual transportation. </p>
 <p>Now we face issues of environmental sustainability and increasingly expensive
   oil as we approach the point where we have competition for the world's finite
   oil resources. Yes, improvements in technology can make a big difference,
   but we also need to re-examine our incentives and our structures.</p>
 <p>Those who have visited Japan have seen an  alternative: an excellent system
   of trains, from local to national, which allow one to get around easily in
   a country whose urban areas and coasts are far more densely populated than
   ours.</p>
 <p>Many of our fellow Americans spend a disproportionate amount of their time
   and money commuting, to get from land where they can afford to live to active
   and specialized job markets. In the process, they produce pollution and use
   expensive fuel.</p>

Our Towns Got That Way</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1996 speech) <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Costs of Poor
Taxes</b></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Society pays a price for not
adopting taxes which follow the
principles developed over the centuries. Here I want only to show how
the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings, the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations, they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. This is because the population and improvement
densities needed to make public transit traffic economically viable
did not come about. Taking the long view of society, George Kennen
notes in one of his books that:</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>The railway. . . was
capable of accepting and disgorging
its loads, whether of passengers or freight, only at fixed points. This
being the case, it tended to gather together, and to concentrate around
its urban terminus and railhead, all activity that was in any way
related to movements of freight or passengers into or out of the city.
It was in this quality that it had made major and in some ways decisive
contributions to the development not only of the great railway
metropolises of the Victorian age particularly of such inland cities as
Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and Chicago but even certain of the great
maritime turnover ports, such as London and New York.</small></blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>The automobile,
on the other hand, had precisely the opposite
qualities. Incapable, in view of its own cumbersomeness and
requirements for space, of accepting or releasing large loads at any
concentrated points anywhere, but peculiarly capable of accepting and
releasing them at multitudes of unconcentrated points anywhere else,
the automobile tended to disintegrate and to explode all that the
railway had brought together. It was, in fact, the enemy of the
concentrated city. Thus it was destined to destroy the great densely
populated urban centers of the nineteenth century, with all the
glories of economic and cultural life that had flowed from their very
unity and compactness.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Failure to recapture
publicly-created land rents through the
tax mechanism provided the incentive to speculators to buy land, not
to use it in production but to hold it for the rise. In this way,
choice parcels remain undeveloped or underdeveloped relative to the
full extent that their values warrant and development occurs instead
in remote areas where opportunity for profit is more immediate. The
result was low density development what we know as sprawl.</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To some people this may be
counter-intuitive. It may not be
obvious that increasing taxes on a parcel of land will foster its
improvement. Consider, however, the possibility that there are two
parcels of land in roughly the same location and of equal size. You
own a vacant parcel and another next to it has a twenty-story
building. If only the land-value is taxed you will be paying the same
tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you likely to do with your
parcel? If you are rational, you will either build a twenty-story
building or else sell the land to someone who will. In this way
improvements tend to be clustered in high-land-value areas except
where it is prohibited, perhaps for a park. <strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Transportation planners know that
public transit typically takes a
density of at least 8-10 households per acre in order for it to be
economically viable. Because tax policies have been instituted that
have the effect of deliberately fostering low density suburban
sprawl, society has become dependent upon motor vehicle
transportation rather than transit service. Had taxes been imposed
heavily or solely upon land value, just the opposite would have
occurred: development would have been most intense on the high
land-value parcels, right by the transit services, making our society
less dependent upon motor vehicles.
</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We face a far greater problem
on account of the way in which
America has allowed its landscape to be configured than most people
today realize. Over-reliance upon the car causes inefficiencies in
transportation patterns and thereby disenfranchises the poor, the
disabled, the young and the old from their right to mobility. One
1993 study concludes that "when the full range of costs of
transportation are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the
American public a total of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. This is
equal to about one-quarter of the annual GNP and is greater than our
total national annual expenditure on either education or health."
Just the costs of motor vehicle accidents nothing else represents a
figure equal to 8 percent of the American Gross Domestic Product.
Conventional American land use configurations and the automobile
dependent lifestyle that goes with it sap our resources and what
effort could be used for other ventures and activities. Since so much
of this activity is consumption and not production, it weakens
America's world economic position and precludes reinvestment in more
productive areas. Because of the way in which we have encouraged
development, people who need jobs are frequently too poor to own the
cars necessary to get to them.... <a

long as drivers personally are able to pass off to others the true
costs of their travel, it guarantees, along with the failure to collect
land rent, that sprawl development will continue. One 1993 study
concluded that "when the full range of costs of transportation are

Japan, by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4% to satisfy all

reason we are spending so much on motor vehicle transportation is that

the whole agenda is a commitment beyond simple description
to sustainable development economics and to Daly&#8217;s &#8220;steady state&#8221;
economics. This entails the institution of environmental safeguards,
protection of cultural and biological diversity, minimal resource use,
and recycling. It further means protection of small countries and
localities &#8212; of both ecosystems and populations &#8212; against
all-encompassing economic units that preclude the possibility of their
being able to survive independently. It presumes also that not just
humans alive today have entitlements, especially privileged elements of
wealthy countries; it recognizes rather the justice and moral claims of
people and natural ecosystems yet to live to survive as intact and
integral units. It recognizes that governments must take a hand in the
preservation of such ecosystems, as&nbsp;markets forces
left to themselves will wreak destruction on the most vulnerable parts
of the earth and ultimately upon the earth itself. It accepts the fact
that the carrying capacity of the earth is&nbsp; limited, and that we
appear to have already exceeded that carrying capacity in our ignorance.<small><span

is that
of Peter Vitousek, et al, &#8220;Human Appropriation of the Products of Photosynthesis,&#8221; BioScience,
Vol. 36, No.6 (1986), pp. 368-373, available at
http://dieoff.org/page83.htm. It calculates that consumption of earth&#8217;s
resources is doubles at an ever increasing rate, and that humans have
already appropriated 40% of terrestrial biological productivity. The
most comprehensive collection of articles addressing this perspective
is created and maintained by retired Cornell Professor Jay Hanson, at
www.dieoff.org. The site name arises from his view that the world
economy&#8217;s dependence upon fossil fuels faces an imminent end, and the
earth will then be capable of supporting only about two billion people.
Hence a looming dieoff. </font></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The distinction between CAC approaches to environmental
challenges as
compared with pricing approaches is central to all this analysis.
Daly&#8217;s shows a strong preference for the latter. In what he calls
&#8220;graded ecozoning,&#8221; for example, potential atmospheric impacts are
divided into three areas. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, for emissions that do not cause significant damage
and do
not accumulate in significant concentrations, taxpayers would be
charged a general fee. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, in instances where incentives require altered
behavior to
address problems such as high ozone or carbon monoxide emissions in
certain local areas, more targeted taxes would apply. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Finally for those pollutants that have profoundly damaging
impacts, regulation and perhaps criminal liability would be called for
in cases of their release. These classes are labeled the &#8220;property
rights zone,&#8221; the &#8220;incentive zone,&#8221; and the &#8220;regulatory zone&#8221;
respectively. The model follows the growing interest and preference for
pricing approaches over more heavy-handed and administratively
inefficient CAC approaches.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Green taxes, sometimes also
called corrective taxes or Pigouvian taxes,
are their first candidates for consideration. This is because they can,
if priced right, recover the costs of externalities in ways that allow
individuals to use their own discretion about employing environmentally
damaging practices. But the authors extend their thinking to cover
goods and materials that may have negative ecological impacts although
not yet conclusively demonstrated by science. The answer there is to
rely upon a &#8220;precautionary polluter pays principle&#8221; based on the
present value of the forecast impact should the worst case scenarios be
borne out. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
annual cost of using a car in the early 1990s, for example, was $51,656
according to their calculations.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">120</span></small> This
would obviously entail an enormous imposition of taxes, far above the
less than $7,000 direct annual costs typically shouldered by drivers
now,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">121</span></small>
the rest of which are now passed on to society generally. Grave doubt
exists about the potential impact of various externalities of driving,
along with concern about the extent of damage which might possibly
occur to
the ecosystem; this warrants employment of the precautionary principle
and calls for policy solutions to curtail this travel mode. Complete
prohibition of certain materials and chemicals may be warranted in some
cases.... <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html"><span

<blockquote>
  <p>We do an awful lot of driving just to do what we need to do. This is because
      transportation engineers and land use planners have confused two fundamental
      concepts: access and mobility.</p>
  <p>By confusing these two principles, we spend an inordinate amount of money
      on transportation services, most of it on roads and highways. One 1993 study
      calculated that the total costs of motor vehicle transportation to our society
      equal approximately a fourth of our gross domestic product (GDP).<font size="-1"><strong><em>[3]</em></strong></font> The
      study concluded that &quot;when the full range of costs of transportation
      are tallied, passenger ground transportation costs the American public
      a total
      of $1.2 to $1.6 trillion each year. Just the costs of automobile crashes
      represents a figure equal to 8 percent of the American GDP.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[4]</em></strong></font> Japan,
      by way of comparison, spends an estimated 10.4 percent to satisfy all its transportation
      requirements, although the figure might be a bit low because not all externalities
      are included in the calculation.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[5] </em></strong></font>Road
      user fees in 1991 totaled only about $33 billion, whereas the true costs to
      society were ten times that;<font size="-1"><strong><em>[6]</em></strong></font> put
      another way, drivers pay only 10 percent of the true costs of their motor vehicle
      use.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[7] </em></strong></font>The balance is paid
      by society, effectively subsidizing highway use by paying for all but the marginal
      out-of-pocket operating costs.</p>
  <p>The relationship between transportation costs and land values can be made
      even clearer by empirical study of how land values increase as one moves toward
      the center of the city. In an investigation for the Urban Land Institute, the
      author concluded that, for Portland, Oregon, each additional mile [traveled]
      translated into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in locations
      command a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile difference, all
      other things being equal, would amount to about $56,000 in new home value.</p>
  <p> For a household in which one worker drives downtown (or at least to a more
      central location) to work, that ten-mile difference may amount to 4,600 miles
      annually, assuming 230 days of commuting and a round-trip of 20 miles each
      day. Moreover, if non-work trips to the central area and elsewhere doubled
      that amount, the tradeoff would be about 9,000 miles annually, which could
      mean a higher/lower driving cost of $3,000 annually, not counting the time
      saved/spent.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8]</em></strong></font></p>
  <p>Such are the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles. If
      the urban resident has to rely on a car nonetheless, subtracting some $3,000
      annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again that much (and likely
      more) to own a car. Author James Kunstler put the true costs along with other
      experts at about $6,100 annually seven years ago.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The
      American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000 miles in
      2001 cost 51 cents per mile, or $7,650.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[10]</em></strong></font> This
      figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not the additional costs passed
      on to society.</p>
  <p>The latter figures include externalities such as pollution and the costs of
      highway crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their engines
      so that they pollute less, to inflate tires properly, and to drive more safely
      are not likely to change the reality that people are forgetful and fallible.
      Pollution-free cars are not available; people must drive to participate in
      this society. The consequences of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and ozone
      are no longer a matter of debate; they are scientific fact. Despite frequent
      headlines about replacing the internal combustion engine, all the realistic
      substitutes also ultimately rely on fossil fuel power, solar-powered cars are
      far in the future, if at all, and also fail to deal with any transition. And
      every person driving his or her own car multiplies the probabilities of accidents.
      When people step into a car, they are seldom mindful of such odds. Yet if the
      direct pecuniary costs of driving increase in any substantial way, there will
      surely be significant changes in the trade-offs involved in housing/transportation
      choices. As will be made clear later, making costs visible and linking them
      to private personal behavior is one way to ensure that transportation pays
      its own way. ...</p>
  <p>Sooner than Americans are likely to bear the real burden of global warming's
      environmental consequences, they are likely to experience the onset of price
      rises for petroleum. Experts are divided, but among those best insulated from
      the pressures of bias, there is increasing consensus that the peak of oil extraction
      worldwide will come sometime around 2010 if not sooner.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[11]</em></strong></font> Rising
      prices will not induce greater supply; it will not change the fact that the
      world will have passed the point of most easily extracted oil and will enter
      a long and increasingly steep period of declining availability. It is rather
      a matter of physics: When it costs more in energy to bring oil from deep in
      the earth than what can be extracted, it is not worth the investment. Even
      the greater wealth of American society will not insulate it from world competition
      over what is a limited and fungible commodity. How this alters the calculations
      Americans make about where to live and work will increasingly depend on the
      price they are willing to pay for transportation service. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_SSFA.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">How the Railroads
Got Us On the Wrong Economic Track</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Costs of Poor
Taxes</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Society pays a price for not
adopting taxes which follow the
principles developed over the centuries. Here I want only to show how
the resulting distortions that arose in the use of land ultimately
caused the railroads to fail in being able to serve society. While in
the short term the railroads certainly saved themselves from having
to pay taxes on their vast land holdings the most valuable of which
were right around their own investment in tracks and stations they
ultimately lost the frequency of traffic which that tax structure
would have induced. This is because the population and improvement
densities needed to make public transit traffic economically viable
did not come about. Taking the long view of society, George Kennen
notes in one of his books that:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The railway</b>. . .
was capable of accepting and
disgorging its loads, whether of passengers or freight, only at fixed
points. This being the case, it tended to gather together, and to
concentrate around its urban terminus and railhead, all activity that
was in any way related to movements of freight or passengers into or
out of the city. It was in this quality that it had made major and in
some ways decisive contributions to the development not only of the
great railway metropolises of the Victorian age particularly of such
inland cities as Moscow, Berlin, Paris, and Chicago but even certain of
the great maritime turnover ports, such as London and New York.</small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The automobile</b>, on the
other hand, had precisely the
opposite qualities. Incapable, in view of its own cumbersomeness and
requirements for space, of accepting or releasing large loads at any
concentrated points anywhere, but peculiarly capable of accepting and
releasing them at multitudes of unconcentrated points anywhere else,
the automobile tended to disintegrate and to explode all that the
railway had brought together. It was, in fact, the enemy of the
concentrated city. Thus it was destined to destroy the great densely
populated urban centers of the nineteenth century, with all the
glories of economic and cultural life that had flowed from their very
unity and compactness.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Failure to recapture
publicly-created land rents through the
tax mechanism provided the incentive to speculators to buy land, not
to use it in production but to hold it for the rise</b>. In this way,
choice parcels remain undeveloped or underdeveloped relative to the
full extent that their values warrant and development occurs instead
in remote areas where opportunity for profit is more immediate. The
result was low density development what we know as sprawl.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To some people this may be
counter-intuitive. It may not be
obvious that increasing taxes on a parcel of land will foster its
improvement. Consider, however, the possibility that there are two
parcels of land in roughly the same location and of equal size. You
own a vacant parcel and another next to it has a twenty-story
building. If only the land-value is taxed you will be paying the same
tax revenue as your neighbor. What are you likely to do with your
parcel? If you are rational, you will either build a twenty-story
building or else sell the land to someone who will. In this way
improvements tend to be clustered in high-land-value areas except
where it is prohibited, perhaps for a park.&nbsp; ... <a

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_RLT&GLT.html">Red-Light Taxes
and Green-Light Taxes</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Likewise, there are at least two
kinds of containment policies for
urban sprawl.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>One says <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stop! Thou
shalt not </span>settle
outside the designated growth boundary, neither shalt thou build, nor
manufacture, nor trade, nor store goods, nor park vehicles, nor disport
thyself in other than traditional country-squire-like amusements. I
shall call this a "negative containment policy."</small></li>
  <li><small>The other policy says Go!, or rather <b>Come! Come into
my city
and rebuild it</b>. This is not "development" in the modern pejorative
sense of territorial expansion. Rather it is REdevelopment in the
manner of the phoenix - the mythical bird, that is, not the city
misnamed Phoenix, which is an awful example of mindless lateral
expansion without renewal.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Consider Philadelphia, once the
City of Brotherly Love founded
by an idealistic English Quaker. Today, after 3 centuries of
development, Philadelphia has 15,800 vacant lots, but that only
begins the story. It has 27,000 empty houses (i.e. junkers on usable
lots that might as well be vacant); 1500 acres of vacant land and
brownfields; and 700 vacant commercial bldgs.</b> A local journalist
names it BlightTown, U.S.A. If he travelled a bit he'd find it is
only one of many.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The result of decay without
renewal is to threaten the
countryside; settlers spill out, "like ghosts from an enchanter
fleeing." Yet, these are not ghosts, nor autumn leaves in the west
wind; these are live people. Destroy man's habitat here and he moves
it there, and takes habitat from other life forms. The solutions to
urban decay and disintegration are infilling and renewal. Here is
where the Green Light Tax is such a good management tool. It lets
cities rebuild themselves without tax penalties on new building, and
rise like the phoenix from their own ashes.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a reflex against growth
and development we must learn to
overcome. "Growth" should not be an issue to divide us: it depends on
the kind of growth. Resentment of growth and development stems in
large part from associating them with territorial expansion.
Infilling and renewal and rehab, however, UNCOUPLE growth from
sprawl: they let cities grow (or at least stop shrinking) without
sprawling. Ascending to a satellite view, let's look at the whole
system of settlement: focusing people where they should be keeps them
away from where they shouldn't be.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here is an aerial view of
Albuquerque, New Mexico, a state
dominated by owners of million-acre ranches, and therefore with about
the lowest property tax rate in the U.S. Albuquerque sprawls out
about 30 miles east-west, and another 30 miles north-south, giving a
density of about 300-400 people per square mile for its 330,000
residents. Many of its homes are slums.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Contrast that with the aerial view
of Sydney, Australia, a city
that raises a lot of its budget from "Green Light" taxes on site
value. Sydney and suburbs have nearly 3 million people, on less land
than Albuquerque, and with no slums.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>There is plenty of land to go
around.</b> The pleasant green
villages of Shorewood and Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin are upper-income
Milwaukee suburbs that feature detached homes on tree-lined streets,
with detached garages, laws against overnight curb parking, a number
of lakeshore mansions with parklike grounds, ample public parks, good
shopping, and a little industry. Their densities are 10,000 persons
per square mile. At this density, 250 million Americans would fit
nicely into less than half of Wisconsin, an average-sized one of 50
states. (They would occupy 0.7% of the United States.)</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the 10,000 density, Greater
Milwaukee would fit inside
Milwaukee County, yet it now sprawls out over several counties. It
sprawls farther yet if one counts the rural residents who float in
and out of town for seasonal work. Shorewood and Whitefish Bay have
high density because they are the only Milwaukee suburbs with no
vacant land; the others, and the central city itself, are full of
holes. <b>Result: sprawl, invasion of wildlands, loss of farmland,
forced automobilization of former pedestrians, water pollution from
new grading - the whole litany of green laments. High density is not
their cause, but their cure.&nbsp; </b>... <a

<p>  Bill Batt - <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html">The Nexus of
  Transportation, Economic Rent and Land Use</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This relationship has been demonstrated more empirically in a recent study
    by the Urban Land Institute. The author concluded that, for Portland Oregon,</p>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">each additional mile [traveled] translated
    into slightly more than $5,000 in housing costs; closer-in locations command
    a premium, those farther out save money. A ten-mile difference, all other
    things being equal, would amount to about $56,000 in new home value.</div>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">For a household in which one worker drives
    downtown (or at least to a more central location) to work, that ten-mile
    difference may amount to 4,600 miles annually, assuming 230 days of commuting
    and a round-trip of 20 miles each day. Moreover, if non-work trips to the
    central area and elsewhere doubled that amount, the tradeoff would be about
    9,000 miles annually, which could mean a higher/lower driving cost of $3,000
    annually, not counting the time saved/spent.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(7) </span></small></div>
  <br>
  That's the savings for living closer to the urban center by ten miles. If the
  urban resident has to rely upon a car nonetheless, subtracting some $3,000
  annual travel expenses will still leave him paying again that much, and likely
  more, to own a car. Seven years ago James Kunstler put the true costs along
  with other experts at about $6,100 annually.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(<small>8</small>)</span> The
  American Automobile Association calculated that a car driven 15,000 miles in
  2001 cost 51&cent; per mile or $7,650.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(9)</span></small> Even that
  figure reflects only direct costs to the driver, not those passed on to society.
  One study calculated that the total costs of motor vehicle transportation to
  our society equal approximately one-fourth of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP)<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">.(10)</span></small> In 1991
  road user fees totaled only about $33 billion whereas the true costs to society
  were ten times that;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(11)</span></small> put another
  way, drivers paid only 10% of the true costs of their motor vehicle use.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(12)</span></small><br>
    <br>
  The latter figures include externalities like pollution and the costs of highway
  crashes. Hortatory public pleas for people to tune up their engines so they
  pollute less, inflate their tires properly, and drive more safely are not likely
  to change the reality that people are forgetful and fallible. Regardless, pollution-free
  cars are not available; people must drive to participate in this society. The
  consequences of SO2, CO2, and ozone are no longer a matter of debate; they
  are scientific fact. Despite frequent headlines about replacing the internal
  combustion engine, all the realistic substitutes also rely upon fossil fuel
  power directly or indirectly; solar powered cars are far in the future, if
  at all, and also fail to deal with any transition. And every person driving
  his or her own car multiplies the probabilities of accidents. Those crashes
  alone, nothing else, represents a figure equal to 8 percent of the American
  GDP.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(13)</span></small> In human
  terms nationally, this is about 43,000 deaths and 2 million hospitalizations
  annually. When people step into a car they are seldom mindful of such odds.
  However, if the direct pecuniary costs of driving increase in any substantial
  way, such as for an increase in motor fuel as many experts forecast, there
  will surely be significant changes in the tradeoffs involved in housing/transportation
  choices.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(14)</span></small> And indeed
  a radical shift in the use of petroleum looms closely on the horizon. The consensus
  view of most oil geologists is that worldwide oil extraction will peak sometime
  in about 2009 or shortly thereafter, then to fall off rather quickly. That
  graphic record and projection of oil mining is shown in Figure 3.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(15)</span></small> Making costs
  visible and linked to private personal behavior is one way to ensure that transportation
  pays its own way -- if it isn't already too late to save us.&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Batt_Nexus_TERLU.html">Read

  Shapes Urban Space</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Like the rest of the universe, US cities
    keep expanding. Some time before the universe begins to contract, American
    metro regions may, too. What counterpart to gravity might suck suburbia back
    into the hole of our doughnut cities? One of the most fundamental forces
    in the world - money.&nbsp; </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>It was the lure of cold cash that drove urbanites out of downtown. The
  usual suspect, the car, was merely a convenient ride. Despite our present dependency
  on cars, the drive to profit is powerful enough to bring people back.&nbsp; </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>Local governments have begun to modify the profit motive. Rather than
  meekly pick up the ever-rising tab for expanding the infrastructure, some localities
  now charge developers a portion of this cost. While this move may stymie development
  at the edge, what&#8217;s needed is something to draw development into the
  urban core.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>... This property tax shift (PTS) "helps cities recover from auto-dependency," notes
  Gihring, author of The Journal of the American Planning Association&#8217;s
  first article on revenue reform (1999 Winter). The PTS turns lots for cars
  into structures for people. By densifying a city, it provides more riders for
  mass transit, justifying more routes and times. As riding becomes convenient
  while remaining a bargain, and parking grows inconvenient while rising in cost,
  more people switch from driving to riding. Less traffic lets cities transform
  streets for bikes, pedestrians, sidewalk cafes, and street performers. </small><br>
  <small>&nbsp; </small><br>
  <small> Architecture, too, could blossom. As car use wanes, so might those
  keep-out-snout houses. Frank Lloyd Wright, who&#8217;d design around a tree
  rather than ax it, advocated de-taxing structures while re-taxing sites. This
  idea peaked about a century ago with the popularity of American reformer<a href="About_HG.html"> Henry
  George</a>. Today, some Australian towns still do tax land alone; they have
  50% more built value per acre than those that don&#8217;t (Kenneth Lusht, Pennsylvania
  State University).&nbsp; ... &nbsp; <a href="../docs/Smith_Profit_Urban.html"><big><big><small><small><span

Jeff Smith: <a href="../docs/Smith_SS.html">Sharing Natural Rents
to Sustain Human Society </a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To get rich, or more likely to stay rich,
    some of us can develop land, especially sprawling shopping centers, and extract
    resources, especially oil. While sprawl and oil depletion are not necessary,
    they are more profitable than a car-free functionally integrated city. Under
    the current rules of doing business, waste returns more than efficiency.
    We let a few privatize rent -- ground rent and resource rent -- although
    rent is a social surplus. As if rent were not profit enough, winners of rent
    have also won further state favors -- tax breaks, liability limits, subsidies,
    and a host of others designed to impel growth (20 major ones follow herein). </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we are to sustain our selves, our civilization,
    and our eco-system, we must make some hard choices about property. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What we decide to do with rent, whether we let it
    reward our exploiting or our attaining eco-librium, matters. </span>Imagine
    society waking up to the public nature of rent. Then it would collect and
    share its surplus that manifests as the market value of sites, resources,
    the spectrum, and government-granted privileges. Then we could forego taxing
    labor and capital. On such a level playing field, this freed market would
    favor efficiency - the compact city - not waste - the mall and automobile. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Drawing their cue from the public, governments
    tolerate "rentention", the private retention of publicly-generated land values.
    Lacking this Rent, states turn to taxes. But to grow the economy, all governments
    -- left, right, or undecided -- hustle to stimulate development; they cut
    taxes and slop subsidies.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>Going beyond the call of duty, the state
    excuses producers' their routine pollution and limit liability, thereby cutting
    the cost of insurance. Companies that don't impose on nature, worker, or
    customer are not benefited at all but lose a competitive advantage. On this
    tilted playing field, one with the lumps of subsidies and the tilts of taxes,
    technologies lean and clean have a hard time competing as suppliers of materials,
    homes, food, rides, and energy. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small><b>Transportation - Cars vs. a Mix of Modes </b></small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b><i>Rent</i></b>. Not having to pay Rent to their community, urban
      owners awaiting a higher future return under-use prime sites, forcing development
      outward. Sprawl requires cars, displacing buses, bikes, and people. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>Taxes</i></b>. The tax on income makes capital less remunerative,
      so a blue chip stock, not quite so visionary, becomes more attractive than
      a risky new start-up trying to make money doing good. A hybrid electric
      car or a fuel-cell light enough to power buses and trucks begs for funds
      while a GM doesn't. Tariffs fall on imported vehicles, which tend to be
      more fuel-efficient than their domestic counterparts. Thus the market share
      of efficient cars is kept smaller than it otherwise would be. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>License</i></b>. The price of gasoline does not include all
      the costs from smog - damage to crops, lungs, buildings, etc - disadvantaging
      bikes and buses. </small></li>
  <li><small><b><i>Subsidy</i></b>. Freeways, overly wide streets, highway patrols,
      traffic courts, ambulances, and free military chastisement of overseas
      suppliers that everyone pays for, not just drivers, pave the way for car
      dependency, not an integrated use of bikes and buses. Gasoline ought to
      cost at least $7.00 per gallon figures the World Resources Institute (Green
      Fees, 1992). ...</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To sustain that which we love, we must
