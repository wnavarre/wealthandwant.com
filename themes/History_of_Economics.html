Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_HTRGUOTWET.html">How the Railroads
Got Us On the Wrong Economic Track</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Corruption of
Economics</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As I explained, classical
economics emerged from a school of
thinkers known as the Scottish moralists in the latter part of the
18th century. There ultimately evolved three major schools of
economic thought a century later,</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>one continuing tradition of Adam Smith through J.S. Mill,</small></li>
  <li><small>a second being the aggressive and emerging school of
Marxism, and</small></li>
  <li><small>the third a proposal for two-factor economics being
pressed
largely by interests in America.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marxism was never a major force in
United States; the primary
challenge to the classical tradition came from what has since come to
be known as neo-classical economics.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Professor Gaffney has for the
first time shown how powerful
economic interests in American society essentially bought the leading
figures of the newly-established American Economics Association with
all the blandishments that can be used to influence academicians.
Leading scholars were induced to change definitions of terms so that
special interests would be advantaged. What were those interests?
Primarily the railroad industry, which at the time was probably the
most powerful political force in America. By changing definitions and
conflating the land factor into capital, it was no longer essential
for land rent to be paid in taxes, and the railroads, holders of some
of the most valuable land in the nation, were thereby able to escape
their full duty. This is an astonishing story, one never fully
spelled out until now, and it explains both how the academic
community was beholden to powerful interests and how many of the
social problems we see today could have been avoided.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The classical tradition of
economic thought was ably synthesized
and represented by one dominant figure of the age: Henry George. All
but forgotten today, perhaps in good part due to the assiduous
disparagement of his economic foes, one should note that he was more
widely known in his time in America than anyone except Thomas Edison.
His 1879 book, <a href="../George_P&P.html"><b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b></a>,
sold more copies
throughout the world than any book till that time except the Bible.
Born in Philadelphia the son of a publisher of religious books, he
travelled to California as a young man to make his fortune as a
journalist. But what he saw in land speculation and the exploitation
of labor soon led him to study the classical economists and to write
his ideas down. Upon publication of his book he shortly became known
throughout the world, and travelled and lectured widely as a social
reformer for the rest of his life. By the time he died he had become
so famous that he almost won the mayoralty of the city of New York.
He ran twice, losing to Tammany Hall the first time in what was
probably a corrupt election (but beating the third-place finisher,
Theodore Roosevelt) in 1886, and died four days before a second
election he might have won in 1897. As a spellbinding orator and
lucid writer, he captivated the world with his vision of societies
made more just by a proper understanding of economics. Gaffney shows
that it was George, not Marx, that was the primary threat to dominant
interests in end-of-century United States. He had to be stopped, and
he was.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In classical economics, the
definition of capital grew out of
labor mixed with earlier capital. Land, by conventional definition,
was not capital, nor was it a component of wealth. Rather land was
its own category. Conflating land into capital allowed land rent to
be hidden and diluted in ways so that the unearned increment arising
from social improvements fell to speculators rather thabeing returned
to society in rent.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The failure of society to
recapture the appropriate level of land
rent from titleholders led also to depression of labor wages at the
margin, creating poverty and artificial scarcity of labor where
otherwise it could be relieved. Hence the title of George's book,
<b><i>Progress and Poverty</i></b>. George recognized that the value
of any land parcel arose out of its social activity, not from
anything which a titleholder might have done to it. He recognized
that many, perhaps most, titleholders in land were speculators,
reaping the benefit of others' investments, and selling out at last
when their price was met. Hence it made sense that society had a
right to a return on what it had brought about, as well as from the
fact that those titles could never be other than leaseholds. That
land rent, shortly confused by use of the words "single tax," was, to
George, the rightful return to society.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The railroad barons of the 19th
century were not just
coincidentally the land barons. They also had strong holds on the
founding and growth of the major American universities of the period,
some of which carry their names. Johns Hopkins, Andrew Dickson White,
Daniel Gilman, John D. Rockefeller, George Leland Stanford, Nicholas
Murray Butler were all as attached to various universities in the
country as they were to powerful railroad interests. They were able,
through their control of universities either as actual presidents or
as benefactors to influence the dominant figures responsible for
establishing the American Economic Association in 1885.</b> The
actual intrigue is too complex to be recounted here: who got
appointed and promoted, who was funded in research, which were given
endowed chairs, who got stock options, and so on. The preoccupation
with defeating Henry George, Gaffney shows, was a paramount
preoccupation of all of these figures. The central figures were:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Francis Walker, first president of the AEA, then President
of MIT
and Director of the Census Bureau.</small></li>
  <li><small>Richard Ely, also founder of the AEA, and professor of
economics
at University of Wisconsin and later Northwestern, there granted his
own Institute with railroad money.</small></li>
  <li><small>John Bates Clark, Professor of Economics at Columbia
University,
and whose patron was Julius Seelye, President of Amherst College and
then Smith College.</small></li>
  <li><small>E.R.A. Seligman, Chairman of the Economics Department at
Columbia
University and scion of a wealthy banking family.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These figures are even today the
honored founders of an esteemed
profession. So great was their victory over rival schools of thought
that they are a century later seen as paragons of clear thinking and
virtue. The intrigue and the inside deals are long forgotten. The
lineage to contemporary scholarship continues in a "chain unbroken
from Seelye to Clark to Johnson to Knight to Stigler, Friedman,
Harberger and now thousands of Chicago-oriented economists." Indeed,
when Henry George ran for mayor of New York in 1897, it was against
the wealthy patrician Seth Low, President of Columbia University, who
had recently recruited Clark to come to Columbia. To really
understand the academic tension of the period, one must look at the
published papers, the speeches and debates, the newspaper articles,
and the citations at the end of those articles. These, even more than
the interlocking directorates of faculty appointments, explain how
much George was opposed, perhaps more feared. Was it for the falsity
of his views? Clearly not, as few critics then or since then have
managed to strike a knock-out blow against his theories. Rather, it
was the threat George represented to powerful interests that required
him to be defeated, and in doing so they succeeded but only in the
short run, as they were within decades victims of their very
successes. Today we see that the railroads have failed in this
country for lack of traffic. It will soon be evident why.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There were many arguments to be
made for the classical tradition
the result of which would be to rely upon payment of rent of land
according to its value to society. George recognized that land value
is largely a function of how society has elected to invest in any
general neighborhood; there is no argument for any one titleholder to
reap the reward of what others have invested. Gaffney points out
that, from the standpoint of economic theory, the framework had the
following virtues:</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>It reconciled common land rights with private tenure, free
markets and modern capitalism, a growing and persistent problem as the
industrial society took hold.</small></li>
  <li><small>It enabled the lowering of taxes on labor without raising
taxes
on capital.</small></li>
  <li><small>It reconciled equity and efficiency. It constituted a
progressive
tax because land is concentrated so much among the wealthy and because
the tax cannot be shifted. It was efficient because it is neutral among
different land-use options.</small></li>
  <li><small>It constituted no disincentive to business location or
population
settlement. In this way it encouraged the most efficient land use and
discouraged sprawl.</small></li>
  <li><small>It created jobs without inflation, and raised government
revenue
without any penalty upon its base.</small></li>
  <li><small>It strengthened public revenues and at the same time
promotes
economy in government.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Those economists who today
still persistently hold to the view
that there is something special about land that make it unwise to
treat as a form of capital are known as Georgists</b>. They represent a
small
minority of the economics profession, but, little known as they are,
they are among its most esteemed members.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two-factor economics, however,
had advantages to influential
individuals and special interests. Land speculators who were
positioned to profit from knowing where locational values would
increase, or were in a position to cause those increases, could
quickly and easily reap a private gain. Simply by holding title to
parcels of real property, without doing anything at all to increase
their value, one could quickly turn a profit.</b> This is because the
increment of unearned increases resulting from social investments
were left for owners to reap rather than recovered by society. <b>In
three-factor economics, land rent reverted to society in an automatic
and efficient manner.</b> When a railroad magnate like George Leland
Stanford extended the Southern Pacific track to the east of Los
Angeles on land that he was granted by the government, all he then
needed to do was to sit back and wait for the land sales to give him
a return on that which was made more valuable by his investment in
the line. All across America, land speculators learned that capturing
monopoly titles to tracts of land allowed them to quickly and easily
turn a "profit" on their investment yet hardly raising a finger.<strong> ...</strong></small></p>

Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Intro_TCOE.html">Neo-classical
Economics as a Stratagem Against Henry George</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
Neoclassical economics is the idiom of most economic discourse
today. It is the paradigm that bends the twigs of young minds and
confines the florescence of older ones, like mesh wire around a
topiary. It took form a century ago, when Henry George and his reform
proposals were a clear and present political danger and challenge to
the landed and intellectual establishments of the world. Few people
realize to what a degree the founders of Neoclassical economics
changed the discipline for the express purpose of deflecting George,
discomfiting his followers, and frustrating future students seeking
to follow his arguments. The stratagem was semantic: to destroy the
very words in which he expressed himself. Simon Patten expounded it
succinctly. "Nothing pleases a ...
single taxer better than ... to use the well-known economic theories
... [therefore] economic doctrine must be recast" (Patten
1908, p.219; Collier, 1979, p.270).<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1 ... </span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Having taken shape in the
1880-1890s, <b>Neo-Classical Economics
(henceforth NCE)</b> remained remarkably static. Major texts by
Marshall, Seligman, and Richard T. Ely, written in the 1890s, went
through many reprintings each over a period of 40 years with few if
any changes. "It was for the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle (1884) that I wrote the first edition of my <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Outlines</span>, under
the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Introduction to Political
Economy</span>. In this first edition of
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Outlines </span>there is to be
found the general philosophy and
principles that have shaped all future editions, including that of
1937" (Ely, 1938, p.81).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Not until 1936 was there another
major "revolution," and that was
hived off into a separate compartment, macro-economics, and contained
there so as not to disturb basic tenets of NCE. Compartmentalization,
we will see in several instances, is the common NCE defense against
discordant data and reasoning. ... <a
