for Land Value Taxation</span><br>
</div>
<br>
Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Applications_LVT.html">Applications
of Land Value Taxation to Problems of
Environmental Protection, Congestion, Efficient Resource Use,
Population, and Economic Growth </a><b><a

</a><br>
</b>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>I. Justifications
of Land Value Taxation</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land value taxation is sometimes
justified on the ground that,
unlike almost all other sources of public revenue, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">a tax on land
value does not impose an excess burden on an economy.</span> This
argument
can be found in the writings of the <a href="Physiocrats.html">Physiocrats</a>,
Adam Smith, David
Ricardo, and numerous modern writers. It is based on the fact that,
with a properly administered tax on land value (unlike other taxes),<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
it is not possible for a person to lower the tax that is due by being
unproductive.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If people were concerned only with
efficiency, this would be a
fine reason to use land value taxation. But people are also concerned
with issues of justice, or fairness. And so the question arises of
whether taxing land values is fair. The fairness of taxing land
values is generally defended on the basis of the postulate that
natural opportunities are everyone's common heritage; collecting the
value of exclusive use of these opportunities and using the proceeds
for public purposes is a way of sharing the value of these
opportunities while retaining the efficiency of private control of
resources.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The idea that natural
opportunities are everyone's common heritage
is often defended with religious language. John Locke said:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>Whether we consider
natural reason, which tells us that men, being once born, have a right
to their preservation, and consequently to meat and drink, and such
other things as nature affords for their sustenance, or revelation,
which gives us an account of those grants God made of the world to
Adam, and to Noah, and his sons, 'tis very clear that God, as King
David says, Psal. CXV. xvi. has given the Earth to the children of men,
given it to mankind in common.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>2</i></b></small></font></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Locke did not advocate land
value taxation. Writing in about
1690, he said that there was so much unclaimed land in America that
no one could properly complain about the private appropriation of
land in Europe.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>3</i></b></small></font>
Writing nearly
200 year later, when it was becoming impossible for people to
appropriate good unclaimed land in America, Henry George said: </small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>If we are all here by the
equal permission of the creator, we are all here with an equal title to
the enjoyment of his bounty -- with an equal right to the use of all
that nature so impartially offers. This is a right which is natural and
inalienable; it is a right which vests in every human being as he
enters the world, and which during his continuance in the world can be
limited only by the equal rights of others. There is in nature no such
thing as a fee simple in land. There is on earth no power which can
rightfully make a grant of exclusive ownership in land. If all existing
men were to unite to grant away their equal rights, they could not
grant away the right of those who follow them.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>4</i></b></small></font></small></blockquote>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George preceded this argument with
a psychological and linguistic
one. He said that our conception of property, of a right of exclusive
possession, is based on the idea that each person has a right to his
or her productive powers, and therefore to what he or she produces.
Since no one produced land, no one can properly claim to own
it.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>5</i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This psychological and linguistic
argument is not entirely
convincing. It seems clear that humans, like other species, have an
impulse toward the appropriation and defense of territory. Natural
selection has worked in favor of those who are skilled in
appropriating natural opportunities and deterring others from
encroaching on them. It seems possible that, as a way of limiting
violence, humans have merged an idea of ownership based on production
with an idea of ownership based on the ability to appropriate
territory and deter encroachment.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this is the social and
biological reality, then there is a
different argument for treating natural opportunities as everyone's
common heritage. Realizing that we are participants in a game of
territorial appropriation and its extension into the politics of
special interest legislation and other manifestation of privilege, we
should also realize that substantial gains are possible from ending
the game of encroachment and appropriation. We might aspire to end
the waste of effort on all forms of rent-seeking and on defense
against rent-seeking. But our efforts to end the game have been based
primarily on enshrining the status quo: The last successful
appropriator gets to keep what has been appropriated. This deference
to power might be considered simply realistic. However, it has a high
cost. The practice of legitimating successful past appropriations --
as when the world declines to challenge Indonesia's 1976 annexation
of East Timor, or when any number of dictators become recognized as
the rightful heads of nations -- induces selfish egoists to calculate
that if they can grab something and hang on to it long enough for the
expected furor to subside, then it will be regarded as just as
legitimately theirs as North America is regarded as the legitimate
property of the descendants of European settlers rather than the
previously occupying natives. (And of course, in many cases those
previously occupying natives had forcibly displaced earlier
occupants.) A statement of the form, "No appropriation before year X
will be questioned, but all aggressive appropriations after year X
will be overturned," is not credible. Year X keeps getting moved, and
successful aggression pays.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Much more credible is a statement
of the form, "<b>We will share
equally the value of natural opportunities that might be
appropriated</b>." This is the potential of land value taxation: to
provide a framework in which the value of natural opportunities will
be shared equally, both as an expression of the idea that all persons
have equal rights to natural opportunities, and as a formula whose
potential to remove the motive for future aggression is greater than
that of enshrining the status quo of any particular year. And in
addition, land value taxation is one way of achieving allocative
efficiency with respect to a wide variety of public issues.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land value taxation is usually
thought of as a possible source of
revenue for local governments. But the ethical principle that
supports it is most coherent when the principal is applied on a
global basis: All persons in the world have equal rights to natural
opportunities. This does not mean that all persons in the world have
equal rights to all land rent. To the extent that the rent of land
arises as a result of the provision of infrastructure, that rent is
the natural income of the polity that provided the infrastructure,
and the logical source for financing it. What all persons in the
world have equal rights to is the "pre-development" rental value of
land, the rental value that land would have to the potential
developer of a new community if there were no community and no
infrastructure. To motivate the application of land value taxation to
other areas of economic life, I will assume that there is a global
agreement that, because all persons have equal rights to natural
opportunities, there will be transfers among nations to equalize per
capita pre-development rent. The principle behind this agreement is
then extended to other issues.</small><small><b> ... </b><span
