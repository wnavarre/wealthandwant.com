    <small>You can enjoy the benefits of a market economy without
    sacrificing your common rights to the land of Russia. There is no need
    to make a
    hard choice between the two. One of the great fallacies that western
    economists
    and bankers are foisting on you is that you have to give up one to
    enjoy the other.
    These counselors work through lending and granting agencies that seduce
    you with
    loans and grants to learn and accept their ideology, which they
    variously call
    Neo-Classical Economics, or "monetarism," or "liberalization." It is
    glitter to distract you and pave the way for aliens to acquire and
    control your
    resources. </small><br>
    <br style="font-weight: bold;">
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To keep land common
    while shifting to a market economy,
    you simply use the tax system. ...</small><br>
    <br>
    <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not only can you have both
    common land and free markets, you can't have one without the other.
    They go together, like love and marriage.</span> You need market prices
    to help identify land's taxable
    surplus, which is the net product of land after deducting the human
    costs of using it. <span style="font-weight: bold;">At
    the same time, you must support government from land revenues to have a
    truly free
    market, because otherwise you will raise taxes from production, trade,
    and
    capital formation, interfering with free markets.</span> If you learn
    this second
    point, and act on it, you will have a much freer market than any of the
    OECD nations that
    now presume to instruct you, and that are campaigning vigorously to
    make
    all nations in the world "harmonize" their taxes to conform with their
    own abysmal

      Reasons to Socialize Land Rent</b></small></div>
      <div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px;"><small>A.
                Financial Reasons to Reserve Rent as a Tax Source<br>
        </small>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. An entire nation cannot be
                  sold off quickly at other than fire-sale prices. Mass privatization
                  is a way of securing the worst possible bargain for the public selling
                  the land.</small><br>
          <small>2. In a massive general land sale, most land would be bid up by a
          small number of buyers with surpluses of "patient money," many of them looking
          toward use or resale in the distant future. These buyers are the kind stigmatized
          as "land speculators," for their traditional indifference to highest and
          best current use of land.</small><br>
          <small>3. A government selling land, even at fire-sale prices, would be swamped
          with cash flow</small><br>
          <small>4. Governments need revenues in perpetuity.</small><br>
          <small>5. Private wealth being scarce in most Soviet republics, wealthy aliens
          would prevail in bidding for much of the best land.</small><br>
          <small>6. The land market works better, on an ongoing basis, if land remains
          subject to regular taxes or other charges in perpetuity.</small><br>
          <small>7. Counterproductive rent-seeking behavior, in the most primal sense,
          is maximized when land is simply privatized without the state's reserving
          substantial servitudes, especially tax power.</small><br>
          <small>8. Local governments, traditionally undernourished and weak in much
          of the Soviet Union, also need revenues in perpetuity. </small><br>
          <small>9. A means is needed gently to pry loose surplus land from state agencies
          like ministries in charge of production. </small><br>
          <small>10. Public acquisition of lands for such uses as rights-of-way (r.o.w.),
          schools, reservoirs, air bases, parks, and watershed protection becomes much
        more costly when all land is privatized first.</small></div>
          <small>B.
              Functional Reasons for Taxing Land Rent <br>
        </small>
          <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>1. Taxing land allows us to avoid
                  taxing functional activities like production, exchange, work, saving,
                  and investment.</small><br>
          <small>2. Taxing land holds down its purchase price, thus easing and democratizing
          entry.</small><br>
          <small>3. Taxing land drains cash from sleeping owners of surplus land, arousing
          them in the most compelling way to the otherwise overlooked opportunity cost
          of their surpluses.</small><br>
          <small>4. Taxing land motivates sellers and moves the otherwise torpid land
          market.</small><br>
          <small>5. Taxing land promotes markets by pushing central urban land into
          commercial uses yielding high cash flows. </small><br>
          <small>6. Taxing land discourages the motives, currently powerful and dominant,
          to hold land mainly as a store of value and hedge against inflation. </small><br>
          <small>7. It is arguable that taxes on bases other than land are largely
        shifted to - that is, are drawn from - land rent anyway. </small></div>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>As formerly centralized economies move to adopt market practices, it will
          be very important for them to develop markets for land. People with good
          ideas for new businesses cannot implement their ideas unless there is some
          place where they can do so. It will not work to require every potential
          entrepreneur to convince a government official that his or her idea deserves
          an allocation of land. People who want to use land must be able to buy
          the right to use land from those who have that right. Land rights must
          be transferable to achieve a well-functioning market economy.</p>

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Of course, land will not be transferred by those who have the right to
          use it unless some payment is made. The possibility of payments for transferring
          the right to use land raises the specter of land speculators receiving
          large undeserved profits while holding economic development hostage. Is
          land speculation an unavoidable concomitant of a market economy?</div>

  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>This paper describes systems for assigning rental value to land through
          markets for the use of land that are created and managed by government
          officials. The central idea of the paper is that the full rent of land
          can be collected while achieving an efficient allocation of land if the
          rent for improved sites is revised annually, based on offers for the use
          of similar unimproved sites for the current year. The efficient allocation
          of land requires neither the sale of land nor leases of long duration at
        fixed rents.</p>

  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Two systems for assigning rental value to land are presented. <span

            many settings, they are particularly applicable to current conditions
            in the Soviet Union, where land is being transferred from public to private
            management. The new manager of each site will receive the profit or bear
            the loss from production on that site. The main question under consideration
            concerns the process to be used to determine how much must be paid for
            the use of each site. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">read

</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Constitutions must be amendable, to allow for the possibility of incorporating
          new moral insights into them. This impinges on the protection of expectations,
          including those regarded as property. Protection of property rights is
          achieved by constitutional restrictions on the ability of voters and legislators
          to reduce the value of property by regulation, taxation or expropriation.
          But such restrictions also prevent voters and legislatures from reflecting
          new moral insights in legislation, if those insights would reduce the value
          of property. There have been times in the past when moral development has
          compelled societies to change laws in ways that reduced the value of property
          (e.g., elimination of slavery). We cannot guarantee that there will be
          no future advances in our moral evolution that would require similar changes
          in laws, reducing or eliminating the value of what we now consider property.
          Looking forward to the possibility of such moral advances, we should design
          constitutions that permit amendments to reflect new moral insights, while
          prohibiting legislators (or voters in referenda) from passing laws that
        redistribute in ways not explicitly sanctioned by the constitution. ... </p>

        Possession as an Alternative to Rental and Private Ownership for Agricultural
        Land</a></p>
  </div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>One of the reasons that the debate is so fierce between the advocates
          of rental and the advocates of private ownership of agricultural land is
          that each position has important strengths as well as important weaknesses.
          This paper argues that there is a third possibility between rental and
          private ownership that retains the strengths of both while avoiding the
          weaknesses of both. The third
    possibility is private possession of land.<font size="+1"><strong> ... </strong></font></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Private possession of land is a form of land privatization that combines
          the attractive features of rental and private ownership without their disadvantages.
          The private possessors of land are entitled to possess and use as much
          land as they wish for as long as they wish and to transfer it to whomever
          they wish on whatever terms are mutually agreed. This provides incentives
          for efficient improvements to land. As a condition for continuing use of
          land, the private possessors are required to pay its assessed rental value
          in an unimproved condition to the local government. This keeps the price
          of titles of possession down to amounts approximating the sale value of
          improvements, eliminates the profit from land speculation, and provides
          a source of public revenue. The public collection of the rental value of
          land gives expression to the idea that land is the common heritage of all
          generations. The rental value of land would be determined by assessors,
          who would follow rental agreements and relate the value of each parcel
          to agreed rental prices of near-by, similar land, adjusted for the contribution
          of improvements to rental value. Before an effort is made to measure the
          rental value of agricultural land, there should be agricultural reforms
          to eliminate all restriction on what farmers grow, who they sell it to,
          or what prices they receive. And food should not be imported when it is
        available domestically at a lower price.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Payments for the use of land would be classified not as taxes, but rather
          as compensation for the use of common resources. Therefore these payments
          would not be affected by the law specifying that farmers are not required
          to pay taxes for five years. There could, however, be an exemption for
          a modest amount of rental value of land. <a href="docs/Tideman_Private%20Possession.html">read

  </div>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Both for reasons of social justice and for reasons of economic efficiency,
          site value rating deserves a continued place in the programme of the Liberal
        Party.</div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The case for site value rating in terms of
        social justice is founded on two understandings: first, that the value
        of land in the absence of economic
            development is the common heritage of humanity, and second, that
        increases in the rental value of land arising from economic development
        and government
            expenditures should be collected by governments to finance those
        activities. What is meant by "land" is the unimproved value of sites
        and the value of extractable natural resources such as North Sea oil. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">While there may someday be institutions capable
      of implementing a recognition of land as the heritage of all humanity on
      a worldwide basis, in the absence
          of such institutions each nation should implement a recognition that
      land within its boundaries is the common heritage of its citizens. This
      is accomplished
          not by making the nation a gigantic Common or by instituting government
          management of all land, but rather by requiring all persons and corporations
          that are granted the use of land to pay a fee or tax equal to what
      the rental value of the land they control would be if it were in an unimproved
          condition. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_SVR.html">read the whole article</a></div>

        <div style="text-align: left;">Urban growth is desired because it raises peoples' incomes. In a market
              economy, incomes can be divided into components derived from four factors
            of production: </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">the rent of land, </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">the wages of labor, </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">the interest received from owning capital, and </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;">the profits of entrepreneurship (the activity of choosing investments

      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">Thus a successful urban growth strategy in a market economy must either
          increase the amounts of land, labor, capital and entrepreneurship that
          are used in a city or increase the payments that are made per unit of each
          factor, or both. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_Urban_Growth.html">read the whole article</a></div>
