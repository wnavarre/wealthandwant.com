      <p>Our laws and traditions, if looked at closely, would reveal

            the private treasure of whomever has obtained title to it, either
        by war, by gift or by purchase. But if we stop to think about it, even

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to the right of ownership, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>Being created individuals, with individual wants and powers, men are individually
    entitled (subject of course to the moral obligations that arise from such
    relations as that of the family) to the use of their own powers and the enjoyment
    of the results. There thus arises, anterior to human law, and deriving its
    validity from the law of God, a right of private ownership in things produced
    by labor &#8212; a right that the possessor may transfer, but of which to
    deprive him without his will is theft.</p>
  <p>This right of property, originating in the right of the individual to himself,
    is the only full and complete right of property. It attaches to things produced
    by labor, but cannot attach to things created by God.</p>
  <p>Thus, if a man take a fish from the ocean he acquires a right of property
    in that fish, which exclusive right he may transfer by sale or gift. But
    he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the ocean, so that he may
    sell it or give it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he set up a windmill he acquires a right of property in the things
    such use of wind enables him to produce. But he cannot claim a right of property
    in the wind itself, so that he may sell it or forbid others to use it.</p>
  <p>Or, if he cultivate grain he acquires a right of property in the grain his
    labor brings forth. But he cannot obtain a similar right of property in the
    sun which ripened it or the soil on which it grew. For these things are of
    the continuing gifts of God to all generations of men, which all may use,
    but none may claim as his alone.</p>
  <p>To attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
    justly attaches to things produced by labor is to impair and deny the true
    rights of property. For a man who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
    to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
    which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of
    his rightful property and thus robbed.</p>
  <p>As to the use of land, we hold: That &#8212;</p>
  <p>While the right of ownership that justly attaches to things produced by
    labor cannot attach to land, there may attach to land a right of possession.
    As your Holiness says, &#8220;God has not granted the earth to mankind in
    general in the sense that all without distinction can deal with it as they
    please,&#8221; and regulations necessary for its best use may be fixed by
    human laws. But such regulations must conform to the moral law &#8212; must
    secure to all equal participation in the advantages of God&#8217;s general
    bounty. The principle is the same as where a human father leaves property
    equally to a number of children. Some of the things thus left may be incapable
    of common use or of specific division. Such things may properly be assigned
    to some of the children, but only under condition that the equality of benefit
    among them all be preserved.</p>
  <p>In the rudest social state, while industry consists in hunting, fishing,
    and gathering the spontaneous fruits of the earth, private possession of
    land is not necessary. But as men begin to cultivate the ground and expend
    their labor in permanent works, private possession of the land on which labor
    is thus expended is needed to secure the right of property in the products
    of labor. For who would sow if not assured of the exclusive possession needed
    to enable him to reap? who would attach costly works to the soil without
    such exclusive possession of the soil as would enable him to secure the benefit?</p>
  <p>This right of private possession in things created by God is however very
    different from the right of private ownership in things produced by labor.
    The one is limited, the other unlimited, save in cases when the dictate of
    self-preservation terminates all other rights. The purpose of the one, the
    exclusive possession of land, is merely to secure the other, the exclusive
    ownership of the products of labor; and it can never rightfully be carried
    so far as to impair or deny this. While any one may hold exclusive possession
    of land so far as it does not interfere with the equal rights of others,
    he can rightfully hold it no further.</p>
  <p>Thus Cain and Abel, were there only two men on earth, might by agreement
    divide the earth between them. Under this compact each might claim exclusive
    right to his share as against the other. But neither could rightfully continue
    such claim against the next man born. For since no one comes into the world
    without God&#8217;s permission, his presence attests his equal right to the
    use of God&#8217;s bounty. For them to refuse him any use of the earth which
    they had divided between them would therefore be for them to commit murder.
    And for them to refuse him any use of the earth, unless by laboring for them
    or by giving them part of the products of his labor he bought it of them,
    would be for them to commit theft. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read the whole letter</a></p>

Kingdom Come</a> (1889 speech)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Think of what Christianity
teaches us; think of the life and
death of Him who came to die for us! Think of His teachings, that we
are all the equal children of an Almighty Father, who is no respecter
of persons, and then think of this legalised injustice &#8212; this
denial of the most important, most fundamental rights of the children
of God, which so many of the very men who teach Christianity uphold;
nay, which they blasphemously assert is the design and the intent of
the Creator Himself. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Better to me, higher to me, is
the atheist, who says there is no
God, than the professed Christian who, prating of the goodness and
the Fatherhood of God, tells us in words as some do, or tells us
indirectly as others do, that millions and millions of human
creatures &#8212; [at this point a child was heard crying]
&#8212; don&#8217;t take the little thing out &#8212; that millions and
millions of human beings, like that little baby, are being brought
into the world daily by the creative fiat, and no place in this world
provided for them. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Aye! Tells us that, by the laws
of God, the poor are created in
order that the rich may have the unctuous satisfaction of dealing out
charity to them, and attributes to the laws of God the state of
things which exists in this city of Glasgow, as in other great cities
on both sides of the Atlantic, where little children are dying every
day, dying by hundreds of thousands, because having come into this
world &#8212; those children of God, with His fiat, by His decree
&#8212; they find that there is not space on the earth sufficient for
them to live; and are driven out of God&#8217;s world because they
cannot get room enough, cannot get air enough, cannot get sustenance
enough. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I believe in no such god. If I
did, though I might bend before
him in fear, I would hate him in my heart. Not room for the little
children here! Look around any country in the civilised world; is
there not room enough and to spare? Not food enough? Look at the
unemployed labour, look at the idle acres, look through every country
and see natural opportunities going to waste. Aye! That Christianity
puts on the Creator the evil, the injustice, the degradation that are
due to humanity&#8217;s injustice is worse, far worse, than atheism.
That is the blasphemy, and if there be a sin against the Holy Ghost,
that is the unpardonable sin! </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Why, consider: &#8220;Give us this day
our daily bread.&#8221; I
stopped in a hotel last week &#8212; a hydropathic establishment. A
hundred or more guests sat down to table together. Before they ate
anything, a man stood up, and, thanking God, asked Him to make us all
grateful for His bounty. And it is so at every mealtime &#8212; such
an acknowledgement is made over well-filled boards. What do we mean
by it? </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
If Adam, when he got out of Eden, had sat down and commenced to
pray, he might have prayed till this time without getting anything to
eat unless he went to work for it. Yet food is God&#8217;s bounty. He
does not bring meat and vegetables all prepared. What He gives are
the opportunities of producing these things &#8212; of bringing them
forth by labour. His mandate is &#8212; it is written in the Holy
Word, it is graven on every fact in nature &#8212; that by labour we
shall bring forth these things. Nature gives to labour and to nothing
else.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
What God gives are the natural elements that are indispensable
to labour. He gives them, not to one, not to some, not to one
generation, but to all. They are His gifts, His bounty to the whole
human race. And yet in all our civilised countries what do we see?
That a few people have appropriated these bounties, claiming them as
theirs alone, while the great majority have no legal right to apply
their labour to the reservoirs of Nature and draw from the
Creator&#8217;s bounty.</span> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Thus it happens that all over the
civilised world that class
that is called peculiarly &#8216;the labouring class&#8217; is the poor
class, and that people who do no labour, who pride themselves on
never having done honest labour, and on being descended from fathers
and grandfathers who never did a stroke of honest labour in their
lives, revel in a superabundance of the things that labour brings
forth. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

  <p>I begin the publication of this paper in response to many urgent requests,
      and because I believe that there is a field for a journal that shall serve
      as a focus for news and opinions relating to the great movement, now beginning,
      for the emancipation of labor by the restoration of natural rights.</p>
  <p>The generation that abolished chattel slavery is passing away, and the political
      distinctions that grew out of that contest are becoming meaningless. The work
      now before us is the abolition of industrial slavery.</p>
  <p>What God created for the use of all should be utilized for the benefit of
      all; what is produced by the individual belongs rightfully to the individual.
      The neglect of these simple principles has brought upon us the curse of widespread
      poverty and all the evils that flow from it. Their recognition will abolish
      poverty, will secure to the humblest independence and leisure, and will lay
      abroad and strong foundation on which all other reforms may be based. To secure
      the full recognition of these principles is the most important task to which
      any man can address himself today. It is in the hope of aiding in this work
      that I establish this paper.</p>
  <p>I believe that the Declaration of Independence is not a mere string of glittering
      generalities. I believe that all men are really created equal, and that the
      securing of those equal natural rights is the true purpose and test of government.
      And against whatever law, custom or device that restrains men in the exercise
      of their natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness I shall
      raise my voice. ... <a href="../HG/short/Salutatory_1887Std.htm">read the whole column</a></p>

<p>James Kiefer: <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">James Huntington and
    the ideas of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Henry George, author of <a href="../George_P&P.html">Progress and Poverty</a>,
    argued that, while some forms of wealth are produced by human activity, and
    are rightly the property of the producers (or those who have obtained them
    from the previous owners by voluntary gift or exchange), land and natural
    resources are bestowed by God on the human race, and that every one of the
    N inhabitants of the earth has a claim to 1/Nth of the coal beds, 1/Nth of
    the oil wells, 1/Nth of the mines, and 1/Nth of the fertile soil. God wills
    a society where everyone may sit in peace under his own vine and his own
    fig tree.</p>
  <p>The Law of Moses undertook to implement this by making the ownership of
    land hereditary, with a man's land divided among his sons (or, in the absence
    of sons, his daughters), and prohibiting the permanent sale of land. (See
    Leviticus 25:13-17,23.) The most a man might do with his land is sell the
    use of it until the next Jubilee year, an amnesty declared once every fifty
    years, when all debts were cancelled and all land returned to its hereditary
    owner.</p>
  <p>Henry George's proposed implementation is to tax all land at about 99.99%
    of its rental value, leaving the owner of record enough to cover his bookkeeping
    expenses. The resulting revenues would be divided equally among the natural
    owners of the land, viz. the people of the country, with everyone receiving
    a dividend check regularly for the use of his share of the earth (here I
    am anticipating what I think George would have suggested if he had written
    in the 1990's rather than the 1870's).</p>
  <p>This procedure would have the effect of making the sale price of a piece
    of land, not including the price of buildings and other improvements on it,
    practically zero. The cost of being a landholder would be, not the original
    sale price, but the tax, equivalent to rent. A man who chose to hold his &quot;fair
    share,&quot; or 1/Nth of all the land, would pay a land tax about equal to
    his dividend check, and so would break even. By 1/Nth of the land is meant
    land with a value equal to 1/Nth of the value of all the land in the country.</p>
  <p>Naturally, an acre in the business district of a great city would be worth
    as much as many square miles in the open country. Some would prefer to hold
    more than one N'th of the land and pay for the privilege. Some would prefer
    to hold less land, or no land at all, and get a small annual check representing
    the dividend on their inheritance from their father Adam.</p>
  <p>Note that, at least for the able-bodied, this solves the problem of poverty
    at a stroke. If the total land and total labor of the world are enough to
    feed and clothe the existing population, then 1/Nth of the land and 1/Nth
    of the labor are enough to feed and clothe 1/Nth of the population. A family
    of 4 occupying 4/Nths of the land (which is what their dividend checks will
    enable them to pay the tax on) will find that their labor applied to that
    land is enough to enable them to feed and clothe themselves. Of course, they
    may prefer to apply their labor elsewhere more profitably, but the situation
    from which we start is one in which everyone has his own plot of ground from
    which to wrest a living by the strength of his own back, and any deviation
    from this is the result of voluntary exchanges agreed to by the parties directly
    involved, who judge themselves to be better off as the result of the exchanges.</p>
  <p>Some readers may think this a very radical proposal. In fact, it is extremely
    conservative, in the sense of being in agreement with historic ideas about
    land ownership as opposed to ownership of, say, tools or vehicles or gold
    or domestic animals or other movables. The laws of English-speaking countries
    uniformly distinguish between real property (land) and personal property
    (everything else). In this context, &quot;real&quot; is not the opposite
    of &quot;imaginary.&quot; It is a form of the word &quot;royal,&quot; and
    means that the ultimate owner of the land is the king, as symbol of the people.
    Note that English-derived law does not recognize &quot;landowners.&quot; The
    term is &quot;landholders.&quot; The concept of eminent domain is that the
    landholder may be forced to surrender his landholdings to the government
    for a public purpose. Historically, eminent domain does not apply to property
    other than land, although complications arise when there are buildings on
    the land that is being seized.</p>
  <p>I will mention in passing that the proposals of Henry George have attracted
    support from persons as diverse as Felix Morley, <a href="../auth/Huxley.html">Aldous
    Huxley</a>, Woodrow Wilson, Helen Keller, <a href="../auth/Churchill.html">Winston
    Churchill</a>, <a href="../auth/Tolstoy.htm">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="../auth/Buckley.htm">William
    F Buckley Jr</a>, and Sun Yat-sen. To the Five Nobel Prizes authorized by
    Alfred Nobel himself there has been added a sixth, in Economics, and the
    Henry George Foundation claims <a href="quotable_nobels.htm">eight of the
    Economics Laureates</a> as supporters, in whole or in part, of the proposals
    of Henry George (Paul Samuelson, 1970; <a href="Friedman.html">Milton Friedman</a>,
    1976; Herbert A Simon, 1978; James Tobin, 1981; Franco Modigliani, 1985;
    James M Buchanan, 1986; Robert M Solow, 1987; <a href="../auth/Vickrey.html">William
    S Vickrey</a>, 1996).</p>
  <p>The immediate concrete proposal favored by most Georgists today is that
    cities shall tax land within their boundaries at a higher rate than they
    tax buildings and other improvements on the land. (In case anyone is about
    to ask, &quot;How can we possibly distinguish between the value of the land
    and the value of the buildings on it?&quot; let me assure you that real estate
    assessors do it all the time. It is standard practice to make the two assessments
    separately, and a parcel of land in the business district of a large city
    very often has a different owner from the building on it.) Many cities have
    moved to a system of taxing land more heavily than improvements, and most
    have been pleased with the results, finding that landholders are more likely
    to use their land productively -- to their own benefit and that of the public
    -- if their taxes do not automatically go up when they improve their land
    by constructing or maintaining buildings on it.</p>
  <p>An advantage of this proposal in the eyes of many is that it is a Fabian
    proposal, &quot;evolution, not revolution,&quot; that it is incremental and
    reversible. If a city or other jurisdiction does not like the results of
    a two-level tax system, it can repeal the arrangement or reduce the difference
    in levels with no great upheaval. It is not like some other proposals of
    the form, &quot;Distribute all wealth justly, and make me absolute dictator
    of the world so that I can supervise the distribution, and if it doesn't
    work, I promise to resign.&quot; The problem is that absolute dictators seldom
    resign. ... <a href="../docs/Kiefer_Huntington.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let us begin this study of the
likely causes of our troubles by
asking two questions: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are we over-populated? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are the earth's
resources inadequate for this population? 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our stage, of course, for
making this study will be this world of ours, for it is upon this
world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its joys
and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its
failures, with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Regardless of its size relative to
other planets, with its
circumference of about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal
who must walk to the station and back each day, it is huge. Roughly
ninety-six million miles separate the sun from the earth on the
latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this distance, the
earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it spins
on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are
distributed far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and
maximizing their benefits.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the complementarity of
nature in the case of the two
forms of life we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses
of the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, the waste product of
each serving as the life-giving force of the other. Any increase in
the one will encourage a like response in the other.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marvel at the manner in which
nature, with no help from man or
beast, delivers pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to
their elevation, thus affording us a free ride downstream and free
power as we desire it. Look with awe at the variety and quantity of
minerals with which this world is blessed, and finally at the
fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both animal and
vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's
crop; then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry
pit or the seeds of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or,
turning to the animal world, consider the hen who averages almost an
egg a day and the spawning fish as examples of the prolificacy that
is evident throughout the whole of the animal world, including
mankind.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this marvelous earth is as rich
in resources as portrayed in
the foregoing paragraph, then the problem must be one of
distribution:

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>how is the land distributed among the earth's
inhabitants, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>how are its products in turn distributed?</small></li>
</ul>

  either public property or private
  property. Wars are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
  property.

  <p><small>George has described this world as a "well-provisioned
    ship" and
    when one considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such
    provisions as coal and petroleum as have occurred say over the past
    one hundred years, one must but agree with this writer. But this is
    only a static view. Consider the suggestion of some ten years ago
    that it would require the conversion of less than 20% the of the
    current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
    then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture
    of the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that
    that characteristic has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how
    is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this world of
    ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on earth for vast
    numbers of people?</b>... <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><span

<p>Martin Luther King, Jr: <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">Where
Do We Go From Here?</a> (1967)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I want to say to you as I move to my conclusion, as we talk about &quot;Where
    do we go from here,&quot; that we honestly face the fact that the Movement
    must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American
    society. There are forty million poor people here. And one day we must ask
    the question, &quot;Why are there forty million poor people in America?&quot; And
    when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the
    economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth. When you ask that
    question,
    you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I'm simply saying that
    more and more, we've got to begin to ask questions about the whole society.
    We are called upon to help the discouraged beggars in life's market place.
    But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs
    restructuring. It means that questions must be raised. You see, my friends,
  when you deal with this,</p>
  <p> * you begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the oil?&quot;<br>
    * You begin to ask the question, &quot;Who owns the iron ore?&quot;<br>
    * You begin to ask the question, &quot;Why is it that people have to pay
    water bills in a world that is two thirds water?&quot;</p>
  <p>These are questions that must be asked. ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/King_Where.htm">read the book excerpt
    and whole speech</a> </p>
