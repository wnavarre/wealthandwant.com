Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a
 href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving Life to
the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>How long would it take for the PTS to take
effect? A clue comes from
Johannesburg, South Africa. That city taxes land, not buildings, and
has the fastest site recycling rate in the world, a little over 20
years. That means, within a few decades of shifting the property tax,
cities could be rebuilt by market-based incentives to human-scale,
becoming relatively car-free. At last civilization could realize its
promise to humanity.<br>
<br>
</small></font><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution
which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Wyn Achenbaum: <a
 href="../docs/Achenbaum_EmDo.html">Eminent
Domain and Government Giveaways<br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It seems to me that there are
better ways than eminent domain to
provide the incentives that will lead the private sector to develop
choice land. </small><span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
<small><a
 href="file:///C:/George/aa%20W&amp;W/docs/Achenbaum_Eminent_Domain.html">
</a></small><br>
<small>While at one time this area might have been an appropriate place
for a
neighborhood of single family homes, it appeared to me that that time
had passed a decade or so ago. It seemed to me that the path of
progress would -- if the incentives were logical and the market
responsive to signals -- have caused the private sector to have
redeveloped that site. Such re-development might have been painful to
the residents of the neighborhood, but would have put now-choice land
to a higher and better use than single-family homes.</small><br>
<br>
<small>But our system wasn't designed to send signals all that well --
Connecticut law required properties to be reassessed once every decade
(and I've heard that once in early '70s and once in the late 80's was
construed to satisfy that requirement).</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ... </span><br>
<br>
<small>But if the properties had been reassessed on a regular basis,
with
market-based values assigned first to the land and the residual being
assigned to the existing buildings, the homeowners themselves would
have been in a position to make their own rational decisions on whether
it was worth it to them to continue to occupy extremely valuable land
(and pay the taxes on it), or more to their advantage to accept an
offer from someone who was prepared to put it to a higher and better
use, and take that equity and buy elsewhere. </small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
<br>
<small>Most of us know of an older home, or perhaps a diner, or
something else
that was a highly appropriate use for its site -- and typical of the
neighborhood -- 50 years ago, which stubbornly remains in the middle of
a neighborhood which has been redeveloped with taller commercial
buildings. The home or diner is something everyone else has to walk
around, drive around. If that site were well developed, it could
prevent the premature development of far less desirable sites on the
fringe of town -- an acre downtown well developed, can save 10 or so
acres on the fringe.</small><span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
<br>
<small>But unless the properties are regularly and correctly assessed,
land
first and buildings as the residual, we won't have the signals which
tell us when it might be time to move on.</small><br>
<br>
<small>
In the absence of such a system of regular revaluations and a property
tax which is concentrated on land values rather than equally on land
and buildings, New London turned to eminent domain. But eminent domain
is not the problem here. Lack of appropriate signals is the problem. </small>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><br>
<br>
<small>Our land, particularly the best-located land, is a common asset
on
which we are all dependent. Allowing individuals or corporations to
occupy it without compensating the rest of us for its value is the
underlying problem, and solving that problem through good assessment
and rational (that is, land value) taxes is the way to solve it. When
we do that, a lot of problems will begin to fall away.&nbsp; <a
