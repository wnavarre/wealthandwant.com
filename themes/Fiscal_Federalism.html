Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_Cannan.html">Cannan's Law</a><br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One way to act globally (or at
least nationally) is through a
national land tax, or some reasonable facsimile thereof, coupled with
a national citizens' dividend. The income tax act of 1894 did
include land income in the tax base, thanks to the persistence of a
handful of single-tax Congressmen -- yes, really, there once were such
men. The U.S.S.C. struck it down for that reason,
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(22)</i></b></small></font> but Congress
and the voters
came back with the 16th Amendment, adopted in 1913, that did include
land income in the tax base. When Congress, led by single-taxer
Warren Worth Bailey, first implemented the amendment it virtually
exempted wages and salaries by exempting incomes below a high cutoff
point.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(23)</i></b></small></font> The
brunt of federal
taxation fell on property income, much of it land income, and it was
enough to finance World War I.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since then the income tax has
evolved, step by step, into its
present anti-labor form, with most property income exempt <i>de
facto</i>, and high rates on earned income.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(24)</i></b></small></font> It is legal to
reverse
that trend, and would be good, but here we will focus on the cognate
matter of "fiscal federalism."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To enable basic tax reform at the
local level we must deal with
local particularism. To do that, in turn, we must deal with "fiscal
federalism." How are central governments to distribute funds from
their so-called "surplus": to people (social dividend), or to local
governments representing landowners? When we wake up to smell this
coffee, we will find that a lot of economists have gotten up first.
Many of these deal with LAND RENT, defined as Ricardo would.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(25) </i></b></small></font></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The reason it is so hard to sell
growth policies -- like land-value
taxation -- at the local level today is that fiscal federalism, as
practiced today, is perverse. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Central
governments, imbued with the
anti-personnel spirit of Austen Chamberlain, tax people as people,
while handing out subventions to landowners as such, and to local
governments as such. The landowners can get the subventions without
having people, so who needs people?</span> That's our problem in a
nutshell. Persons as such become fiscal pollutants, from the local
view. After the T-Men have plucked their feathers, working persons
are less able to pay local taxes; while Federal grants relieve local
landowners from needing population to share public
costs.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(26)</i></b></small></font> </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Perverse fiscal federalism is
DEsocialization of rent -- creating
new private rents using public monies wrung from workers. This is
inherent in grants for capital spending, e.g. for sewerage; and tax
exemption of muni bonds. These are given to municipalities as such.
That is only a step away from returning dollars to landowners as
such, because municipalities are defined as areas of land, a group of
local landowners. Desocialization is inherent in farm subsidies,
e.g. payments to fallow land, using tax money from workers. It is
inherent in preferential assessment of farmland, e.g. California's
Williamson Act, where the state pays localities for their lost tax
revenues from underutilizing lands. It is inherent in the use of
property-tax exemptions to subsidize many underutilizations of land
and hobbies of the rich, like redundant airports for private jets,
cemeteries, golf courses, campuses, church parking lots, conservation
easements, timber, etc. Some of these may foster socially defensible
uses, but note it is the lands, not the personnel, that are
tax-exempted.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Canada's classic Carter Commission
Report
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(27)</i></b></small></font> led the right
way, but
Canada's actual equalization program leads the wrong
way.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(28) </i></b></small></font>
Equalization grants
from Ottawa to the provinces are lower to provinces whose taxable
capacity per head is higher, and of course vice versa, according to a
detailed formula. So far, so good, but the devil is in the
definition of "taxable capacity." Canada specifically excludes land
value from measures of taxable capacity.
<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(29)</i></b></small></font> Buildings are
included as
part of the potential tax base; a hardworking productive population
is included; a thriving commerce is included; but land value is
quietly excluded. Thus a province wherein vast and valuable lands
are underused is considered a charity case, eligible for alms from
Ottawa; while another province that makes productive use of meager
lands is liable to pay more taxes, but will get less relief. That
helps explain why Ontario and Quebec, despite their great urban and
locational advantages, still rank below the provincial average in
measured taxable capacity.<font size="-1"><small><b><i>(30)</i></b></small></font>
It
is not the capacity that is lacking, but the measurement of it. The
tilt is patent; it could hardly be an accident. If any of the
many brilliant economists, politicians, and bureaucrats who publish
on equalization payments, horizontal fiscal federalism, and Canada's
Representative Tax System (RTS) have even peeped on this vital
matter, I am not aware of it. Their consciousness has fallen below
the threshold of perception, and needs desperately to rise.&nbsp; ... <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>It seems to me therefore that
  we need to face up to the question
  that is known in my trade as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fiscal
  Federalism, that is, how is money
  going to be distributed by the federal government out of its
  so-called surplus, either to people or the States, or localities? </span></small>  </p>
  <p><small>When we look at this issue, which is definitely a Georgist
    issue,
    we'll find interestingly enough that a lot of economists have gotten
    there first. Many of these are Canadian economists, and without
    exception they talk about rent. They talk about rich provinces and
    poor provinces., and the rich provinces are those that have resource
    rents. And when they say rent they are not talking about Frank
    Sinatra's voice, or Bridget Bardot's figure. They're talking about
    the income of natural resources. Now it's not just a question of
    distribution here&#8230; but a whole question of whether a growth
    oriented policy will sell at the local level.
