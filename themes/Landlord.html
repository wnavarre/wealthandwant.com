  <p>We pay rent to the landlord.&nbsp; In small towns, most of the rent is for
    the value of the improvement.&nbsp; But the same improvement (a house, a
    fast food restaurant, a grocery store of a certain size) rents for considerably
    more in a larger town, more yet in a small city, and yet more &#8212; significantly
    more &#8212; in a large city.&nbsp; It isn't the building or its contents whose
    value is many times higher: it is the site on which it sits.&nbsp; To some
    extent, you'll see this reflected in retail prices: a burger or a submarine
    sandwich may cost a lot less in a small town than the identical item does
    in a large city.&nbsp; Some of that is a result of higher wages paid in the
    city, but most of it relates to the higher value of the land, the site, where
    many times the number of customers are available.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the landlord
    didn't create the land, nor did the previous owner of the site. So why should
    he collect for his own purse so much more than his small-town counterpart
    does?&nbsp; The difference between the big city and the small town is not
    of his making, and therefore a system which enriches him makes little sense.
    It leaves the entrepreneur with far less money for wages and for return on
    capital.&nbsp;&nbsp; Labor and capital are entitled to a decent return; the
    landlord shouldn't be pocketing that.&nbsp; Declare him a <strong>buildinglord</strong>, and
    let him have the return on what he <em>did</em> create<em>.</em></p>

        <div style="text-align: left;">When it is first proposed to put all taxes upon the value of land, all landholders
              are likely to take the alarm, and there will not be wanting appeals to the
              fears of small farm and homestead owners, who will be told that this is a
              proposition to rob them of their hard-earned property. But a moment's reflection
              will show that this proposition should commend itself to all whose interests
              as landholders do not largely exceed their interests as laborers or capitalists,
              or both. And further consideration will show that though the large landholders
              may lose relatively, yet even in their case there will be an absolute gain.
              For, the increase in production will be so great that labor and capital will
              gain very much more than will be lost to private landownership, while in
              these gains, and in the greater ones involved in a more healthy social condition,
              the whole community, including the landowners themselves, will share.</div>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"> It is manifest, of course, that the change I propose will greatly benefit
                all those who live by wages, whether of hand or of head -- laborers, operatives,
                mechanics, clerks, professional men of all sorts.</div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <div style="text-align: left;"> It is manifest, also, that it will benefit all those who live partly
                by wages and partly by the earnings of their capital -- storekeepers, merchants,
                manufacturers, employing or undertaking producers and exchangers of all
                sorts from the peddler or drayman to the railroad or steamship owner --

          cannot be ejected in case of his death. He will not be injured; on the contrary,
          he will be the gainer. ... <a href="HG/PP/SP/12_Effect_upon_Classes.htm">read

        <p>&#8220;Christ knew better than we that 'No man having put his hand
          to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God;' nor is
          many man doing his duty who shrinks and is faithless to his fellow-men.
          Now a word more about Abolitionists and new ideas in Government, whatever
          they may be: We are all called Abolitionists now who desire any restriction
          of slavery or believe that the system is wrong, as I have declared
          for years. We are called so, not to help out a peaceful solution, but
          in derision, to abase us, and enable the defamers to make successful
          combinations against us. I never was much annoyed by these, less now
          than ever. I favor the best plan to restrict the extension of slavery
          peacefully, and fully believe that we must reach some plan that will
          do it, and provide for some method of final extinction of the evil,
          before we can have permanent peace on the subject. On other questions
          there is ample room for reform when the time comes; but now it would
          be folly to think that we could undertake more than we have on hand.
          But when slavery is over with and settled, men should never rest content
          while oppressions, wrongs, and iniquities are in force against them.</p>
        <p>&#8220;The land, the earth that God gave to man for his home,
            his sustenance, and support, should never be the possession of any
            man, corporation, society, or unfriendly Government, any more than
            the air or the water, if as much. An individual company or enterprise
            requiring land should hold no more in their own right than is needed
            for their home and sustenance, and never more than they have in actual
            use in the prudent management of their legitimate business, and this
            much should not be permitted when it creates an exclusive monopoly.
            All that is not so used should be held for the free use of every
            family to make homesteads, and to hold them as long as they are so
            occupied.</p>
        <p><strong>&#8220;A reform like this will be worked out some time in
            the future. The idle talk of foolish men, that is so common now,
            on 'Abolitionists, agitators, and disturbers of the peace,' will
            find its way against it, with whatever force it may possess, and
            as strongly promoted and carried on as it can be by land monopolists,
            grasping landlords, and the titled and untitled senseless enemies

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The best measure of rent is, of
      course, its proportion to the
      produce. The only estimate of Irish rent as a proportion of which I
      know is that of Buckle, who puts it at one-fourth of the produce. In
      this country I am inclined to think one-fourth would generally be
      considered a moderate rent. Even in California there is considerable
      land rented for one-third the crop, and some that rents for one-half
      the crop; while, according to a writer in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>, the
      common rent in that great wheat-growing section of the New Northwest
      now being opened up is one-half the crop!</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>In New York, in San Francisco, in Washington, Boston, Chicago,
      and
      St. Louis, live men who own large tracts of land which they seldom or
      never see. A resident of Rochester is said to own no less than four
      hundred farms in different States, one of which (I believe in Kentucky)
      comprises thirty-five thousand acres. Under the plantation system of
      farming and that of stock-raising on a grand scale, which are
      developing so rapidly in our new States, very much of the profits go to
      professional men and capitalists who live in distant cities.
      Corporations whose stock is held in the East or in Europe own much
      greater bodies of land, at much greater distances, than do the London
      corporations possessing landed estates in Ireland. To say nothing of
      the great land-grant railroad companies, the Standard Oil Company
      probably owns more acres of Western land than all the London companies
      put together own of Irish land. And, although landlordism in its
      grosser forms is only beginning in the United States, there is probably
      no American, wherever he may live, who cannot in his immediate vicinity
      see some instance of absentee landlordism. The tendency to
      concentration born of the new era ushered in by the application of
      steam shows itself in this way as in many others. To those who can live
      where they please, the great cities are becoming more and more
      attractive. ...</small></div>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Either
      the land of Ireland
      rightfully belongs to the Irish
      landlords, or it rightfully belongs to the Irish people; there can be
      no middle ground. </span>If it rightfully belongs to the landlords,
      then is
      the whole agitation wrong, and every scheme for interfering in any
      way with the landlords is condemned.

      money they draw from it, and whoever does not want to live upon it on
      the landlords' terms is at perfect liberty to starve or emigrate. 
          </small></li>
        <small> </small><li><small>But
      if, on the contrary, the land of Ireland rightfully belongs to the
      Irish people, then the only logical demand is, not that the tenants

      from a smaller class and sold to a larger class, but that it be
      resumed by the whole people.

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To propose to pay the landlords

      is to deny the right of the people to it. The real fight for Irish
      rights must he made outside of Ireland; and, above all things, the
      Irish agitators ought to take a logical position, based upon a broad,
      clear principle which can be everywhere understood and appreciated.
      To ask for tenant-right or peasant proprietorship is not to take such
      a position; to concede that the landlords ought to be paid is utterly
      to abandon the principle that the land belongs rightfully to the

      Henry George: <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The Crime
    of Poverty</a>&nbsp; (1885 speech)<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> As I say, the man that owns
      the land is the master of those
      who must live on it.</b> Here is a modern instance: you who are
      familiar with the history of the Scottish Church know that in the
      forties there was a disruption in the church. You who have read Hugh
      Miller's work on "<b><i>The Cruise of the Betsey</i></b>"
      know something about it; how a great body, led by Dr. Chalmers, came
      out from the Established Church and said they would set up a Free
      Church. In the Established Church were a great many of the
      landowners. Some of them, like the Duke of Buccleugh, owning miles
      and miles of land on which no common Scotsman had a right to put his
      foot, save by the Duke of Buccleugh's permission. These landowners
      refused not only to allow these Free Churchmen to have ground upon
      which to erect a church, but they would not let them stand on their
      land and worship God. You who have read "<b><i>The Cruise of the
      Betsey</i></b>" know that it is the story of a clergyman who was
      obliged to make his home in a boat on that wild sea because he was
      not allowed to have land enough to live on. In many places the people
      had to take the sacrament with the tide coming to their
      knees &#8212; many a man lost his life worshipping on the roads in rain
      and snow. They were not permitted to go on Mr. Landlord's land and
      worship God, and had to take to the roads. The Duke of Buccleugh
      stood out for seven years compelling people to worship in the roads,
      until finally relenting a little, he allowed them to worship God in a
      gravel pit; whereupon they passed a resolution of thanks to His
      Grace. </small></div>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that is not what I wanted to
      tell you. The thing that struck
      me was this significant fact: As soon as the disruption occurred, the
      Free Church, composed of a great many able men, at once sent a
      delegation to the landlords to ask permission for Scotsmen to worship
      God in Scotland and in their own way. This delegation set out for
      London &#8212; they had to go to London, England, to get permission for
      Scotsmen to worship God in Scotland, and in their own native home!
    </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> But that is not the most absurd
      thing. In one place where they
      were refused land upon which to stand and worship God, the late
      landowner had died and his estate was in the hands of the trustees,
      and the answer of the trustees was, that so far as they were
      concerned they would exceedingly like to allow them to have a place
      to put up a church to worship God, but they could not conscientiously
      do it because they knew that such a course would be very displeasing
      to the late Mr. Monaltie! Now this dead man had gone to heaven, let
      us hope; at any rate he had gone away from this world, but lest it
      might displease him men yet living could not worship God. Is it
      possible for absurdity to go any further? </small></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> You may say that those Scotch
      people are very absurd people, but
      they are not a whit more so than we are. I read only a little while
      ago of some Long Island fishermen who had been paying as rent for the
      privilege of fishing there, a certain part of the catch. They paid it
      because they believed that James II, a dead man centuries ago, a man
      who never put his foot in America, a king who was kicked off the
      English throne, had said they had to pay it, and they got up a
      committee, went to the county town and searched the records. They
      could not find anything in the records to show that James II had ever
      ordered that they should give any of their fish to anybody, and so
      they refused to pay any longer. But if they had found that James II
      had really said they should they would have gone on paying. Can
      anything be more absurd? </small></p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a square in New
      York&#8212;Stuyvesant Square that is
      locked up at six o'clock every evening, even on the long summer
      evenings. Why is it locked up? Why are the children not allowed to
      play there? Why because old Mr. Stuyvesant, dead and gone I don't
      know how many years ago, so willed it. Now can anything be more
      absurd?* </small></div>

      <small>... Poverty! Can there be any doubt of its cause? Go, into the
      old countries &#8212; go into western Ireland, into the highlands of Scotland
&#8212; these are purely primitive communities. There you will find people as
      poor as poor can be &#8212; living year after year on oatmeal or on potatoes,
      and often going hungry. I could tell you many a pathetic story.
      Speaking to a Scottish physician who was telling me how this diet was
      inducing among these people a disease similar to that which from the
      same cause is ravaging Italy (the Pellagra), I said to him: "There is
      plenty of fish; why don't they catch fish? There is plenty of game; I
      know the laws are against it, but cannot they take it on the sly?"
"That," he said, "never enters their heads. Why, if a man was even
      suspected of having a taste for trout or grouse he would have to leave
      at once."</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>There is no difficulty in discovering what makes those people
      poor. They have no right to anything that nature gives them. All they
      can make above a living they must pay to the landlord. They not only
      have to pay for the land that they use, but they have to pay for the
      seaweed that comes ashore and for the turf they dig from the bogs. They
      dare not improve, for any improvements they make are made an excuse for
      putting up the rent. <span style="font-weight: bold;">These people who
      work hard live in hovels, and the landlords, who do not work at all &#8212;
      oh! they live in luxury in London or Paris. If they have hunting boxes
      there, why they are magnificent castles as compared with the hovels in
      which the men live who do the work. Is there any question as to the
      cause of poverty there?</span>... <a

    Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html">Thou Shalt Not Steal</a>&nbsp; (1887
    speech)<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We are selling land now in large
      quantities to certain English lords, who are coming over here and
      buying greater estates than the greatest in Great Britain or Ireland.
      We are selling them land; they are buying land. Did it ever occur to
      you that they do not want that land? They have no use whatever for
      American land; they do not propose to come over here and live on it.
      They cannot carry it over there to where they do live.</small><br>
      <br>
      <small>It is not the land that they want. What they want is the income
      from it. They are buying it not because they themselves want to use it,
      but because by and by, as population increases, numbers of American
      citizens will want to use it, and then they can say to these American
      citizens: "You can use this land provided you pay us one-half of all
      you make upon it." <span style="font-weight: bold;">What we are
      selling those foreign lords is not really land; we are selling them the
      labor of American citizens; we are selling them the privilege of
      taking, without any return for it, the proceeds of the toil of our
      children.</span></small><br>
      <br>
      <small>So, here in New York, you will read in the papers every day that
      the price of land is going up. John Jones or Robert Brown has made a
      hundred thousand dollars within a year in the increase in the value of
      land in New York. What does that mean? It means he has the power of
      getting many more coats, many more cigars, dry goods, horses and
      carriages, houses or much more food and wine. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">He has gained the power of taking for his
      own a great number of these products of human labor.</span></small><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <small>But what has he done? He has not done anything. He may have been
      off in Europe or out west, or he may have been sitting at home taking
      it easy. If he has done nothing to get this increased income, where
      does it come from? The things I speak of are all products of human
      labor &#8212; someone has to work for them. <span style="font-weight: bold;">When
      a man who does no work can get them, necessarily the people who do work
      to produce them must have less of the products of human labor than they
      ought to have. </span>...&nbsp;<a href="../HG/George_TSNS.html"> <span

    <blockquote>
      <p>NATURE acknowledges no ownership or control in man save as the result
        of exertion. In no other way can her treasures be drawn forth, her powers
        directed, or her forces utilized or controlled. She makes no discriminations
        among men, but is to all absolutely impartial. She knows no distinction
        between master and slave, king and subject, saint and sinner. All men
        to her stand upon an equal footing and have equal rights. She recognizes
        no claim but that of labor, and recognizes that without respect to the
        claimant. If a pirate spread his sails, the wind will fill them as well
        as it will fill those of a peaceful merchantman or missionary bark; if
        a king and a common man be thrown overboard, neither can keep his head
        above the water except by swimming; birds will not come to be shot by
        the proprietor of the soil any quicker than they will come to be shot
        by the poacher; fish will bite or will not bite at a hook in utter disregard
        as to whether it is offered them by a good little boy who goes to Sunday
        school, or a bad little boy who plays truant; grain will grow only as
        the ground is prepared and the seed is sown; it is only at the call of
        labor that ore can be raised from the mine; the sun shines and the rain
        falls alike upon just and unjust. The laws of nature are the decrees
        of the Creator. There is written in them no recognition of any right
        save that of labor; and in them is written broadly and clearly the equal
        right of all men to the use and enjoyment of nature; to apply to her
        by their exertions, and to receive and possess her reward. Hence, as
        nature gives only to labor, the exertion of labor in production is the
        only title to exclusive possession. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp071.html"> &#8212; Book

        in land</a></p>
      <p>PRIVATE property is not of one species, and moral sanction can no more
        be asserted universally of it than of marriage. That proper marriage
        conforms to the law of God does not justify the polygamic or polyandric
        or incestuous marriages that are in some countries permitted by the civil
        law. And as there may be immoral marriage, so may there be immoral private
        property. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition
        of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII</a>&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
  THAT any species of property is permitted by the State, does not of itself
  give it moral sanction. The State has often made things property that are not
  justly property but involve violence and robbery. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The
  Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII</a><br>
    <br>
  TO attach to things created by God the same right of private ownership that
  justly attaches to things produced by labor, is to impair and deny the true
  rights of property. For a man, who out of the proceeds of his labor is obliged
  to pay another man for the use of ocean or air or sunshine or soil, all of
  which are to men involved in the single term land, is in this deprived of his
  rightful property, and thus robbed. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The
  Condition of Labor, an Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII</a>&nbsp;<br>

  HOW then is it that we are called deniers of the right of property? It is for
  the same reason that caused nine-tenths of the good people in the United
  States, north as well as south, to regard abolitionists as deniers of the right
  of property; the same reason that made even John Wesley look on a smuggler
  as a kind of robber, and on a custom-house seizer of other men's goods as a
  defender of law and order.&nbsp; Where violations of the right of property
  have been long&nbsp; sanctioned by custom and law, it is inevitable that those
  who really assert the right of property will at first be thought to deny it.&nbsp; For
  under such circumstances the idea of property becomes confused, and that is
  thought to be property which is in reality a violation of property. &#8212; <em><a href="APP/PIII_C10_The_Right_of_Property_and_the_Right_of_Taxation.htm">A

  LANDLORDS must elect to try their case either by human law or by moral law.&nbsp; If
  they say that land is rightly property because made so by human law, they cannot

      <p>PRIVATE property in land, no less than private property in slaves, is
        the violation of the true rights of property. They are different forms
        of the same robbery &#8212; twin devices, by which the perverted ingenuity
        of man has sought to enable the strong and the cunning to escape God's
        requirement of labor by forcing it on others. &#8212; <a href="the_condition_of_labor.htm">The

ROBINSON CRUSOE, as we all know, took Friday as his slave. Suppose, however,
that instead of taking Friday as his slave, Robinson Crusoe had welcomed him
as a man and a brother; had read him a Declaration of Independence, an Emancipation
Proclamation and a Fifteenth Amendment, and informed him that he was a free and
independent citizen, entitled to vote and hold office; but had at the same time
also informed him that that particular island was his (Robinson Crusoe's) private
and exclusive property. What would have been the difference? Since Friday could
not fly up into the air nor swim off through the sea, since if he lived at all
he must live on the island, he would have been in one case as much a slave as
in the other. Crusoe's ownership of the island would be equivalent of his ownership
of Friday. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

THEY no longer have to drive their slaves to work; want and the fear of want
do that more effectually than the lash. They no longer have the trouble of looking
out for their employment or hiring out their labor, or the expense of keeping
them when they cannot work. That is thrown upon the slaves. The tribute that
they still wring from labor seems like voluntary payment. In fact, they take
it as their honest share of the rewards of production &#8212; since they furnish
the land! And they find so-called political economists, to say nothing of so-called
preachers of Christianity, to tell them so. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

IF the two young Englishmen I have spoken of had come over here and bought so
many American citizens, they could not have got from them so much of the produce
of labor as they now get by having bought land which American citizens are glad
to be allowed to till for half the crop. And so, even if our laws permitted,
it would be foolish for an English duke or marquis to come over here and contract
for ten thousand American babies, born or to be born, in the expectation that
when able to work he could get out of them a large return. For by purchasing
or fencing in a million acres of land that cannot run away and do not need to
be fed, clothed or educated, he can, in twenty or thirty years, have ten thousand
full-grown Americans, ready to give him half of all that their labor can produce
on his land for the privilege of supporting themselves and their families out
of the other half. This gives him more of the produce of labor than he could
exact from so many chattel slaves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

  <br>
OF the two systems of slavery, I think there can be no doubt that upon the same
moral level, that which makes property of persons is more humane than that which
results from making private property of land. The cruelties which are perpetrated
under the system of chattel slavery are more striking and arouse more indignation
because they are the conscious acts of individuals. But for the suffering of
the poor under the more refined system no one in particular seems responsible.
. . . But this very fact permits cruelties that would not be tolerated under
the one system to pass almost unnoticed under the other. Human beings are overworked,
are starved, are robbed of all the light and sweetness of life, are condemned
to ignorance and brutishness, and to the infection of physical and moral disease;
are driven to crime and suicide, not by other individuals, but by iron necessities
for which it seems that no one in particular is responsible. <br>
  <br>
To match from the annals of chattel slavery the horrors that day after day transpire
unnoticed in the heart of Christian civilization, it would be necessary to go
back to ancient slavery, to the chronicles of Spanish conquest in the New World,
or to stories of the Middle passage. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/sp15.html">Social

      <p>IN the Old Testament we are told that, when the Israelites journeyed
        through the desert, they were hungered, and that God sent down out of
        the heavens &#8212; manna. There was enough for all of them, and they
        all took it and were relieved. But, supposing that desert had been held
        as private property, as the soil of Great Britain is held; as the soil
        even of our new states is being held. Supposing that one of the Israelites
        had a square mile, and another one had twenty square miles, and another
        one had a hundred square miles, and the great majority of the Israelites
        did not have enough to set the soles of their feet upon, which they could
        call their own &#8212; what would become of the manna? What good would
        it have done to the majority? Not a whit. Though God had sent down manna
        enough for all, that manna would have been the property of the landholders;
        they would have employed some of the others, perhaps, to gather it up
        in heaps for them, and would have sold it to the hungry brethren. Consider
        it: this purchase and sale of manna might have gone on until the majority
        of the Israelites had given up all they had, even to the clothes off
        their backs. What then? Well, then they would not have had anything left
        with which to buy manna, and the consequence would have been that while
        they went hungry the manna would be lying in great heaps, and the landowners
        would be complaining about the over-production of manna. There would
        have been a great harvest of manna and hungry people, just precisely
        the Phenomenon that we see today. &#8212; <a href="../HG/crime_of_poverty.html">The

PROPERTY in land, like property in slaves, is essentially different from property
in things that are the result of labor. Rob a man or a people of money, or goods,
or cattle, and the robbery is finished there and then. The lapse of time does
not, indeed, change wrong into right, but it obliterates the effects of the deed.
That is done; it is over; and, unless it be very soon righted, it glides away
into the past, with the men who were parties to it, so swiftly that nothing save
omniscience can trace its effects; and in attempting to right it we would be
in danger of doing fresh wrong. The past is forever beyond us. We can neither
punish nor recompense the dead. But rob a people of the land on which they must
live, and the robbery is continuous. It is a fresh robbery of every succeeding
generation &#8212; a new robbery every year and every day; it is like the robbery
which condemns to slavery the children of the slave.&nbsp; To apply to it the
statute of limitations, to acknowledge for it the title of prescription, is not
to condone the past; it is to legalese robbery in the present, to justify it
in the future. &#8212; <a href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The (Irish) Land Question</a> <br>

            what it cost them to pay the owners of the land of Boston for the
            use of the land, being the net ground rent, which I estimate at four

            values for that year, being $12.90 per $1000, or 1.29 per cent added

        <p><font size="-1">This, however, is not a complete contrast between
            the present system and the single tax, for large amounts of real
            estate are exempt from taxation, being held by the United States,
            the Commonwealth, by the city itself, by religious societies and
            corporations, and by charitable, literary, and scientific institutions.
            The total amount of the value of land so held as returned by the

        <p><font size="-1">Reasons can be given why all lands within the city
            should be assessed for taxation to secure a just distribution of
            the public burdens, which I cannot take the space to enter into here.
            There is good reason to believe also that lands in the city of Boston
            are assessed to quite an appreciable extent below their fair market
            value. As an indication of this see an editorial in the Boston <em>Daily
            Advertiser</em> for October 3, 1893, under the title, &quot;Their
            Own Figures.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">The vacant lands, marsh lands, and flats in Boston
            were valued by the assessors in 1892 (page 3 of their annual report)
            at $52,712,600. I believe that this represents not more than fifty
            per cent of their true market value.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Taking this and the undervaluation of improved property
            and the exemptions above mentioned into consideration, I think $500,000,000
            to be a fair estimate of the land values of Boston. Making this the

  3. THE SINGLE TAX FALLS IN PROPORTION TO BENEFITS</strong><br />
  <br />
  To perceive that the single tax would justly measure the value of government
  service we have only to realize that the mass of individuals everywhere and
  now, in paying for the land they use, actually pay for government service in
  proportion to what they receive. He who would enjoy the benefits of a government
  must use land within its jurisdiction. He cannot carry land from where government
  is poor to where it is good; neither can he carry it from where the benefits
  of good government are few or enjoyed with difficulty to where they are many
  and fully enjoyed. He must rent or buy land where the benefits of government
  are available, or forego them. And unless he buys or rents where they are greatest
  and most available he must forego them in degree. Consequently, if he would
  work or live where the benefits of government are available, and does not already
  own land there, he will be compelled to rent or buy at a valuation which, other
  things being equal, will depend upon the value of the government service that
  the site he selects enables him to enjoy. 14 Thus does he pay for the service
  of government in proportion to its value to him. But he does not pay the public
  which provides the service; he is required to pay land-owners.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">14. Land values are lower in all countries of poor
            government than in any country of better government, other things
            being equal. They are lower in cities of poor government, other things
            being equal, than in cities of better government. Land values are
            lower, for example, in Juarez, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande,
            where government is bad, than in El Paso, the neighboring city on
            the American side, where government is better. They are lower in
            the same city under bad government than under improved government.
            When Seth Low, after a reform campaign, was elected mayor of Brooklyn,
            N.Y., rents advanced before he took the oath of office, upon the
            bare expectation that he would eradicate municipal abuses. Let the
            city authorities anywhere pave a street, put water through it and
            sewer it, or do any of these things, and lots in the neighborhood
            rise in value. Everywhere that the &quot;good roads&quot; agitation
            of wheel men has borne fruit in better highways, the value of adjacent
            land has increased. Instances of this effect as results of public
            improvements might be collected in abundance. Every man must be able
            to recall some within his own experience.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> And it is perfectly reasonable that it should be
            so. Land and not other property must rise in value with desired improvements
            in government, because, while any tendency on the part of other kinds
            of property to rise in value is checked by greater production, land
            can not be reproduced.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Imagine an utterly lawless place, where life and property
            are constantly threatened by desperadoes. He must be either a very
            bold man or a very avaricious one who will build a store in such
            a community and stock it with goods; but suppose such a man should
            appear. His store costs him more than the same building would cost
            in a civilized community; mechanics are not plentiful in such a place,
            and materials are hard to get. The building is finally erected, however,
            and stocked. And now what about this merchant's prices for goods?
            Competition is weak, because there are few men who will take the
            chances he has taken, and he charges all that his customers will
            pay. A hundred per cent, five hundred per cent, perhaps one or two
            thousand per cent profit rewards him for his pains and risk. His
            goods are dear, enormously dear &#8212; dear enough to satisfy the
            most contemptuous enemy of cheapness; and if any one should wish
            to buy his store that would be dear too, for the difficulties in
            the way of building continue. <em>But land is cheap!</em> This is
            the type of community in which may be found that land, so often mentioned
            and so seldom seen, which &quot;the owners actually can't give away,
            you know!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> But suppose that government improves. An efficient
            administration of justice rids the place of desperadoes, and life
            and property are safe. What about prices then? It would no longer
            require a bold or desperately avaricious man to engage in selling
            goods in that community, and competition would set in. High profits
            would soon come down. Goods would be cheap &#8212; as cheap as anywhere
            in the world, the cost of transportation considered. Builders and
            building materials could be had without difficulty, and stores would
            be cheap, too. <em>But land would be dear!</em> Improvement in government
            increases the value of that, and of that alone.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now, the economic principle pursuant to which land-owners are thus able
        to charge their fellow-citizens for the common benefits of their common
        government points to the true method of taxation. With the exception
        of such other monopoly property as is analogous to land titles, and which
        in the purview of the single tax is included with land for purposes of
        taxation, 15 land is the only kind of property that is increased in value
        by government; and the increase of value is in proportion, other influences
        aside, to the public service which its possession secures to the occupant.
        Therefore, by taxing land in proportion to its value, and exempting all
        other property, kindred monopolies excepted &#8212; that is to say, by
        adopting the single tax &#8212; we should be levying taxes according
        to benefits.16</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">15. Railroad franchises, for example, are not usually
            thought of as land titles, but that is what they are. By an act of
            sovereign authority they confer rights of control for transportation
            purposes over narrow strips of land between terminals and along trading
            points. The value of this right of way is a land value.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">16. Each occupant would pay to his landlord the value
            of the public benefits in the way of highways, schools, courts, police
            and fire protection, etc., that his site enabled him to enjoy. The
            landlord would pay a tax proportioned to the pecuniary benefits conferred
            upon him by the public in raising and maintaining the value of his
            holding. And if occupant and owner were the same, he would pay directly
            according to the value of his land for all the public benefits he
            enjoyed, both intangible and pecuniary.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> And in no sense would this be class taxation. Indeed, the cry of class
        taxation is a rather impudent one for owners of valuable land to raise
        against the single tax, when it is considered that under existing systems
        of taxation they are exempt. 17 Even the poorest and the most degraded
        classes in the community, besides paying land-owners for such public
        benefits as come their way, are compelled by indirect taxation to contribute
        to the support of government.<strong> But landowners as a class go free.
        They enjoy the protection of the courts, and of police and fire departments,
        and they have the use of schools and the benefit of highways and other
        public improvements, all in common with the most favored, and upon the
        same specific terms; yet, though they go through the form of paying taxes,
        and if their holdings are of considerable value pose as &quot;<em>the</em> tax-payers&quot; on
        all important occasions, they, in effect and considered as a class, pay
        no taxes, because government, by increasing the value of their land,
        enables them to recover back in higher rents and higher prices more than
        their taxes amount to. Enjoying the same tangible benefits of government
        that others do, many of them as individuals and all of them as a class
        receive in addition a tangible pecuniary benefit which government confers
        upon no other property-owners. The value of their property is enhanced
        in proportion to the benefits of government which its occupants enjoy.
        To tax them alone, therefore, is not to discriminate against them; it
        is to charge them for what they get.</strong>18</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> <font size="-1">17. While the landholders of the City of Washington
            were paying something less than two per cent annually in taxes, a
            Congressional Committee <em>(Report of the Select Committee to Investigate
            Tax Assessments in the District of Columbia, composed of Messrs.
            Johnson, of Ohio, Chairman, Wadsworth, of New York, and Washington,
            of Tennessee. Made to the House of Representatives, May 24, 1892.
            Report No. 1469</em>), brought out the fact that the value of their
            land had been increasing at a minimum rate of ten per cent per annum.
            The Washington land-owners as a class thus appear to have received
            back in higher land values, actually and potentially, about ten dollars
            for every two dollars that as land-owners they paid in taxes. If
            any one supposes that this condition is peculiar to Washington let
            him make similar estimates for any progressive locality, and see
            if the land-owners there are not favored in like manner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> But the point is not dependent upon increase in the
            capitalized value of land. If the land yields or will yield to its
            owner an income in the nature of actual or potential ground rent,
            then to the extent that this actual or possible income is dependent
            upon government the landlord is in effect exempt from taxation. No
            matter what tax he pays on account of his ownership of land, the
            public gives it back to him to that extent.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> 18. Take for illustration two towns, one of excellent
            government and the other of inefficient government, but in all other
            respects alike. Suppose you are hunting for a place of residence
            and find a suitable site in the town of good government. For simplicity
            of illustration let us suppose that the land there is not sold outright
            but is let upon ground rent. You meet the owner of the lot you have
            selected and ask him his terms. He replies:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Two hundred and fifty dollars a year!&quot; you
            exclaim. &quot;Why, I can get just as good a site in that other town
            for a hundred dollars a year.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Certainly you can,&quot; he will say. &quot;But
            if you build a house there and it catches fire it will burn down;
            they have no fire department. If you go out after dark you will be
            'held up' and robbed; they have no police force. If you ride out
            in the spring, your carriage will stick in the mud up to the hubs,
            and if you walk you may break your legs and will be lucky if you
            don t break your neck; they have no street pavements and their sidewalks
            are dangerously out of repair. When the moon doesn't shine the streets
            are in darkness, for they have no street lights. The water you need
            for your house you must get from a well; there is no water supply
            there. Now in our town it is different. We have a splendid fire department,
            and the best police force in the world. Our streets are macadamized,
            and lighted with electricity; our sidewalks are always in first class
            repair; we have a water system that equals that of New York; and
            in every way the public benefits in this town are unsurpassed. It
            is the best governed town in all this region. Isn't it worth a hundred
            and fifty dollars a year more for a building site here than over
            in that poorly governed town?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"> You recognize the advantages and agree to the terms.
            But when your house is built and the assessor visits you officially,
            what would be the conversation if your sense of the fitness of things
            were not warped by familiarity with false systems of taxation? Would
            it not be something like what follows?</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;How much do you regard this house as worth? &quot; asks
            the assessor. </font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;What is that to you?&quot; you inquire.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;I am the town assessor and am about to appraise
            your property for taxation.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;Am I to be taxed by this town? What for?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">&quot;What for?&quot; echoes the assessor in surprise. &quot;What
            for? Is not your house protected from fire by our magnificent fire
            department? Are not you protected from robbery by the best police
            force in the world? Do not you have the use of macadamized pavements,
            and good sidewalks, and electric street lights, and a first class
            water supply? Don't you suppose these things cost something? And
            don't you think you ought to pay your share?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1"><strong>&quot;Yes,&quot; you answer, with more or less calmness; &quot;I
            do have the benefit of these things, and I do think that I ought
            to pay my share toward supporting them. But I have already paid my
            share for this year. I have paid it to the owner of this lot. He
            charges me two hundred and fifty dollars a year -- one hundred and
            fifty dollars more than I should pay or he could get but for those
            very benefits. <em>He</em> has collected my share of this year's
            expense of maintaining town improvements; you go and collect from
            him. If you do not, but insist upon collecting from me, I shall be
            paying twice for these things, once to him and once to you; and he
            won't be paying at all, but will be making money out of them, although

      himself, and everywhere today the man or the public body who wishes to
      put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land
      values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some
      cases to no use at all. All comes back to the land value, and its owner
      for the time being is able to levy his toll upon all other forms of
      wealth and upon every form of industry. A portion, in some cases the
      whole, of
      every benefit which is laboriously acquired by the community is
      represented in the land value, and finds its way automatically into the
      landlord's pocket. If there is a rise in wages, rents are able
      to move forward, because the workers can afford to pay a little more.

      retaining and exercising, as they do, a right whose foundations have
      not been inquired into, and whose extent no one has ever yet

      dare not consider steadily, from what cause their grievances take their
      rise. The oppressive rights of the one order, and the patient
      submission of the other, have grown up together insensibly from remote
      ages, in which the present state of human affairs could not have been
      foreseen. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

    <p>Henry George:&nbsp; <a
 href="../HG/irish_land_question.html">The
       Land Question</a> (1881)</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What I want to impress upon those who
          may read this book is this:</small><br>
            <br>
            <small>The land question is nowhere a mere local question; it is a universal
            question. It involves the great problem of the distribution of wealth,
            which is everywhere forcing itself upon attention.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>It cannot be settled by measures which in their nature can have but
          local application. It can be settled only by measures which in their nature
          will apply everywhere.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>It cannot be settled by half-way measures. It can be settled only
          by the acknowledgment of equal rights to land. Upon this basis it can be
          settled easily and permanently.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>If the Irish reformers take this ground, they will make their fight
          the common fight of all the peoples; they will concentrate strength and divide
          opposition. They will turn the flank of the system that oppresses them, and
          awake the struggle in its very intrenchments. They will rouse against it
          a force that is like the force of rising tides.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>What I urge the men of Ireland to do is to proclaim, without limitation
          or evasion, that the land, of natural right, is the common property of the
          whole people, and to propose practical measures which will recognize this
          right in all countries as well as in Ireland.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>What I urge the Land Leagues of the United States to do is to announce
          this great principle as of universal application; to give their movement
          a reference to America as well as to Ireland; to broaden and deepen and strengthen
          it by making it a movement for the regeneration of the world &#8211; a movement
          which shall concentrate and give shape to aspirations that are stirring among
          all nations.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Ask not for Ireland mere charity or sympathy. Let her call be the
          call of <strong>fraternity</strong>: "For yourselves, O brothers, as well
          as for us!" Let her rallying cry awake all who slumber, and rouse to a common
          struggle all who are oppressed. Let it breathe not old hates; let it ring
          and echo with the new hope!</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>In many lands her sons are true to her; under many skies her daughters
          burn with the love of her. Lo! the ages bring their opportunity. Let those
          who would honor her bear her banner to the front!</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>The harp and the shamrock, the golden sunburst on the field of living
          green! emblems of a country without nationality; standard of a people downtrodden
          and oppressed! The hour has come when they may lead the van of the great
          world-struggle. Types of harmony and of ever-springing hope, of light and
          of life! The hour has come when they may stand for something higher than
          local patriotism; something grander than national independence. The hour
          has come when they may stand forth to speak the world's hope, to lead the
          world's advance!</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>Torn away by pirates, tending in a strange land a heathen master's
          swine, the slave boy, with the spirit of Christ in his heart, praying in
          the snow for those who had enslaved him, and returning to bring to his oppressors
          the message of the gospel, returning with good to give where evil had been
          received, to kindle in the darkness a great light&#8211;this is Ireland's
          patron saint. In his spirit let Ireland's struggle be. Not merely through
          Irish vales and hamlets, but into England, into Scotland, into Wales, wherever
          our common tongue is spoken, let the torch be carried and the word be preached.
          And beyond! The brotherhood of man stops not with differences of speech any
          more than with seas or mountain-chains. A century ago it was ours to speak
          the ringing word. Then it was France's. Now it may be Ireland's, if her sons
          be true.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>But wherever, or by whom, the word must be spoken, the standard will
          be raised. No matter what the Irish leaders do or do not do, it is too late
          to settle permanently the question on any basis short of the recognition
          of equal natural right. And, whether the Land Leagues move forward or slink
          back, the agitation must spread to this side of the Atlantic. The Republic,
          the true Republic, is not yet here. But her birth-struggle must soon begin.
          Already, with the hope of her, men's thoughts are stirring.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small><strong>Not a republic of landlords and peasants</strong>; not a republic of millionaires
          and tramps; not a republic in which some are masters and some serve. But
          a republic of equal citizens, where competition becomes cooperation, and
          the interdependence of all gives true independence to each; where moral progress
          goes hand in hand with intellectual progress, and material progress elevates
          and enfranchises even the poorest and weakest and lowliest.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small>And the gospel of deliverance, let us not forget it: it is the gospel
          of love, not of hate. He whom it emancipates will know neither Jew nor Gentile,
          nor Irishman nor Englishman, nor German nor Frenchman, nor European nor American,
          nor difference of color or of race, nor animosities of class or condition.
          Let us set our feet on old prejudices, let us bury the old hates. There have
          been "Holy Alliances" of kings. Let us strive for the Holy Alliance of the
          people.</small><br>
          <br>
          <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Liberty, equality, fraternity! Write
          them on the banners. Let them be for sign and countersign. Without equality,
          liberty cannot be; without fraternity, neither equality nor liberty can be
          achieved.</span></small></div>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

            of all natural opportunities, to all the essentials of happy, healthful,

        <li><small>Fraternity&#8211;that sympathy which links together those who struggle
            in a noble cause; that would live and let live; that would help as well

            of each!</small></li>

            created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
            rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness!"</small><br>
              <br>
              <small>It is over a century since these words rang out. It is time
                to give them their full, true meaning. Let the standard be lifted that
                all may see it; let the advance be sounded that all may hear it. Let
                those who would fall back, fall back. Let those who would oppose, oppose.

<blockquote>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>I know of a woman &#8212; I have never had
        the pleasure of making her acquaintance, because she lives in a lunatic
        asylum, which does not happen
              to be on my visiting list. This woman has been mentally incompetent
        from birth. She is well taken care of, because her father left her when
        he died
              the income of a large farm on the outskirts of a city. The city
        has since grown and the land is now worth, at conservative estimate,
        about
        twenty
              million dollars. It is covered with office buildings, and the greater
        part of the income, which cannot be spent by the woman, is piling up
        at compound
              interest. The woman enjoys good health, so she may be worth a hundred
        million dollars before she dies.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>I choose this case because it is one about which there can be no disputing;
              this woman has never been able to do anything to earn that twenty million
              dollars. And if a visitor from Mars should come down to study the situation,
              which would he think was most insane, the unfortunate woman, or the society
              which compels thousands of people to wear themselves to death in order
              to pay her the income of twenty million dollars?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The fact that this woman is insane makes it
        easy to see that she is not entitled to the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of the land she owns. But
              how about all the other people who have bought up and are holding for speculation
              the most desirable land? The value of this land increases, not because
              of anything these owners do &#8212; not because of any useful service they
              render to the community &#8212; but purely because the community
              as a whole is crowding into that neighborhood and must have use
              of the land.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>The speculator who bought this land thinks that he deserves the increase,
              because he guessed the fact that the city was going to grow that way. But
              it seems clear enough that his skill in guessing which way the community
              was going to grow, however useful that skill may be to himself, is not
              in any way useful to the community. The man may have planted trees, or
              built roads, and put in sidewalks and sewers; all that is useful work,
              and for that he should be paid. But should he be paid for guessing what
              the rest of us were going to need?</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>Before you answer, consider the consequences
        of this guessing game. The consequences of land speculation are tenantry
        and debt on the farms, and
              slums and luxury in the cities. A great part of the necessary land
        is held out of use, and so the value of all land continually increases,
        until the
              poor man can no longer own a home. The value of farm land also
        increases; so year by year more independent farmers are dispossessed,
        because
        they cannot pay interest on their mortgages. So the land becomes a place
        of
              serfdom, that land described by the poet, &quot;where wealth accumulates
              and men decay.&quot; The great cities fill up with festering slums,
              and a small class of idle parasites are provided with enormous
              fortunes, which
              they do not have to earn, and which they cannot intelligently spend.
              ... </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <p>In Philadelphia, as in all our great cities,
        are enormously wealthy families, living on hereditary incomes derived
        from crowded slums. Here and there
              among these rich men is one who realizes that he has not earned
        what he is consuming, and that it has not brought him happiness, and
        is bringing
              still less to his children. Such men are casting about for ways
        to invest
              their money without breeding idleness and parasitism. Some of them
        might be grateful to learn about this enclave plan, and to visit the
        lovely village
              of Arden, and see what its people are doing to make possible a
        peaceful and joyous life, even in this land of bootleggers and jazz orchestras.

A. J. O. <a href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html">Slavery</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose I am the owner of an
estate and 100 slaves, all the land
about being held in the same way by people of the same class as
myself. It is a profitable business, but there are many expenses and
annoyances attached to it. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that there is no
unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were
free they would still have to look to me for work somehow. So one day
I announce to them that they are all free, intimating at the same
time I will be ready to employ as many as I may require on such terms
as we may mutually and independently agree. What could be fairer?
They are overjoyed, and falling on their knees, bless me as their
benefactor. Then they go away and have a jollification, and next day
come back to me to arrange the new terms.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Most of them think they would like to have a piece of land and
work it for themselves, and be their own masters. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>"But," softly I observe, "you are going too fast. Your proposals
about the tools and seed and your maintenance are all right enough,
but the land, you remember, belongs to me. You cannot expect me to
give you your liberty and my own land for nothing. That would not be
reasonable, would it?"&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Still I am ready to do what I promised &#8212; "to employ as many
as I may require, on such terms as we may mutually and independently
agree."&nbsp; ... </small><br>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So they all set to at the old work
at the old place, and on the
old terms, only a little differently administered; that is, that
whereas I formerly supplied them with food, clothes, etc., direct
from my stores, I now give them a weekly wage representing the value
of those articles, which they will henceforth have to buy for
themselves.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a difference, too, in
some other respects, indicating a
moral improvement in our relations. I can no longer curse and flog
them. But then I don't want to; it's no longer necessary; the threat
of dismissal is quite as effective, even more so; and much pleasanter
for me.&nbsp; ...
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When the man is
worn out with long service I can turn him out with a clear business
conscience, knowing that the State will see that he does not
starve.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Instead of being forced to keep my
men in brutish ignorance, I
find public schools established at other people's expense to
stimulate their intelligence and improve their minds, to my great
advantage, and their children compelled to attend these schools. The
service I get, too, being now voluntarily rendered (or apparently so)
is much improved in quality. In short, the arrangement pays me better
in many ways.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I gain in other ways besides
pecuniary benefit. I have lost
the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
benevolence. I am a "large employer of labour," to whom the whole
country, and the labourer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, "See the power of capital! These poor labourers, having no
capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
country, and his own fortune together." <br>
<br>
Whereas it is not my capital that does any of these things. It is
not my capital but the labourer&#8217;s toil that builds up my fortune
and the wealth of the country. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is
not my employment that keeps him
from pauperism, but my monopoly of the land forcing him into my
employment that keeps him on the brink of it. It is not want of
capital that keeps the labourer from using the land, but my refusing
him the use of the land that prevents him from acquiring capital. </span>All
the capital he wants to begin with is an axe and a spade, which a
week&#8217;s earnings would buy him, and for his maintenance during
the first year, and at any subsequent time, he could work for me or
for others, turnabout, with his work on his own land. Henceforth with
every year his capital would grow of itself, and his independence
with it, and that this is no fancy sketch, anyone can see for himself
by taking a trip into the country, where he will find well-to-do
farmers who began with nothing but a spade and an axe (so to speak)
and worked their way up in the manner described. </small><small><br>
</small><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>ENTER THE LANDLORD ....</small></center>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But now another thought strikes
me. Instead of paying an overseer
to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8212; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
yearly pay. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>For a moderate reduction in my profits, then &#8212; a reduction
equal to the tenant's narrow margin of profit &#8212; I have all the
toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk too,
for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be forthcoming,
and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the full amount,
no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence of all other
debts. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>If wages are forced down it is not I that do it; it is that
greedy
and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor labourers,
not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; I only want my rent-and
get it. <b>Like the lillies of the field, I toil not, neither do I
spin, and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered)
comes to me of itself. </b>Nay, people bid against each other for the
privilege of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the labourers' toil. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It
is the fruit of their labour which they ought to have; which they
would have if I did not take it from them.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This sketch illustrates the fact
that chattel slavery is not the
only nor even the worst form of bondage. When the use of the earth
&#8212; the sole source of our daily bread &#8212; is denied unless one
pays a fellow creature for permission to use it, people are bereft of
economic freedom. The only way to regain that freedom is to collect
the rent of land instead of taxes for the public domain.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, labour leaders
in the USA, the UK and Australia
understood these facts. The labour movements of those countries were
filled with people who fought for the principles of 'the single tax'
on land at the turn of the twentieth century. But since then, it has
been ridiculed, and they have gradually yielded to the forces of

    Unfair Taxation</a> (1913)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No man created the earth, but to a large extent all take from the earth
    a portion of it and mould it into useful things for the use of man. Without
    land
      man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor. First of all, he
    must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to until the single tax
    is applied.
      It has been proven by the history of the human race that the single tax
    does work, and that it will work as its advocates claim. For instance, man
    turned
      from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and discovered the great
      continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable employment,
    he went on the free land and worked for himself, and in those early days
    there
      were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and no extremely poor &#8212; because
      there was cheap land. Men could go to work for themselves, and thus take the
      surplus off the labor market. There were no beggars in the early days. It was
      only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when the earth monopoly was
      complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to look to a boss for a
      job.</p>
  <p>All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely help the poor when the earth
    is monopolized. Men must live from the earth, they must till the soil, dig
    the
      coal and iron and cut down the forest. Wise men know it, and cunning men
    know it, and so a few have reached out their hands and grasped the earth;
    and they
      say, &quot;These mines of coal and iron, which it took nature ages and ages
      to store, belong to me; and no man can touch them until he sees fit to pay
      the tribute I demand&quot;. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">read the whole speech</a></p>

</span>Walter Rybeck: <a href="../docs/RybeckW_Metropolis.html">The
Uncertain Future of the Metropolis</a><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The single element that makes me
apprehensive about the future of our cities is our land system.
Tentacles
of our misguided land policies are choking almost every vital aspect of
metropolitan life. This is doubly worrisome, because the full
dimensions of the land problem have barely surfaced in the public
consciousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">To put it in the
vernacular, most of us don't know what's eating us. </span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We have scarcely begun to identify the causes of today's city
land
problems. This is not to denigrate the legions of good folk --
officials and citizens alike -- who are trying desperately to cope with
the daily disasters. But without a better notion of what is producing
these disasters, we are unlikely to stem the flood.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A major problem, certainly, is
our
distorted land system that operates around the clock and around the
calendar, and under the full sanction of the law. It rips off the poor,
saps small business, and deprives municipalities of their rightful
revenue.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The people as a whole create
land
values, not only by their presence, but also through participation in
government, as taxpayers.</span> Schools, firehouses, streets, police,
water lines -- the whole gamut of public works and services that
enhance a neighborhood are converted into higher land values. The
taxpayers of the entire country, through federal aid for our
multi-billion-dollar Metrorail project, have been boosting Washington,
D.C. land values mightily.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not all land values are
manmade. Inherent qualities also give land special advantages:</span>
fertile soils in farming districts, scenic views in residential areas,
subsurface riches of coal, oil, and minerals. None of us, as landlords,
tenants, or governments, can lay claim to having created these values.
The people who have been drawing up an international law of the Seas
have <span style="font-weight: bold;">characterized these natural
endowments as "the common heritage of mankind", where no people,
individually or collectively, produce these land values,<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"> it is difficult to argue with the
conclusion that they belong to all people equally.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>If the institution of private property
has a sound foundation, and I believe it does, then it rests on the
principle that people have a right to reap what they sow, to retain for
themselves what they themselves produce or earn. Land values, produced
by all of society, and by nature, do not conform to this prescription.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Decade after decade, billions of
dollars in urban land values are being siphoned off by a narrowing
class that has no ethical or economic claim to them. To be outraged
when a few ghetto dwellers, in an occasional frenzy of despair, engage
in looting on a relatively miniscule scale, but to remain indifferent
to this massive, wholesale looting, is worse than hypocritical. It is
to ignore a catastrophic social maladjustment, more severe, I believe,
than anything the U.S. has experienced since slavery. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>But I sense that we are drifting rapidly towards a
landlord-dominated society. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Before that happens, the opportunity
awaits to see whether a reasonably free economy can still be made to
work. Unless we tackle the land question, and the looting of America,
that game may be forfeited. </small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The future of the
metropolis is uncertain. The choice is ours. We can
intervene in the way society is now headed, to preserve the American
dream. Or, we can continue along the present path and await the
American nightmare.&nbsp;</small>

the Revenue Potential of Land: Fifteen Lost Elements</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many
economists rely on data generated by the IRS, taken from tax returns,
to tell them the sources of income in the U.S. This is an exercise in
crediting bad data. The standard tax procedure of landlords is to
deduct alleged &#8220;depreciation&#8221; from their net operating rents (&#8220;cash
flow&#8221;) to arrive at taxable rents. They accelerate depreciation enough,
usually, to report little or no taxable rent. This is what the IRS then
aggregates and reports as the sum of all rents. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">To accept such fiction
as fact is inexcusable, but economists do it anyway. </span>Their
credulity
lends their authority to the IRS, while the IRS &#8220;official&#8221; status helps
legitimize the economists -- mutual validation of mutual error, the
curse of science.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
owner A has exhausted his tax &#8220;basis&#8221; by overdepreciating, he sells to
B for a price well above the remaining basis. B then depreciates the
same building all over again, then sells to C, who sells to D, and so
on, so each building is tax-depreciated several times during its
economic life. In any given year, most income properties in the U.S.A.
are being tax-depreciated, even though most have already been
depreciated once or more.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
addition, all owners after the original builder are in a position to
depreciate some of the land value, as well. This is because the owners
control the &#8220;allocation of basis&#8221; between depreciable building and
non-depreciable land. The IRS has no defense against secondary owners
who overallocate value to the depreciable building. Congress has never
authorized the IRS to develop any in-house capacity to value land. The
most the agency does, if it will not accept the word of the tax filer,
is to look at allocations used by local assessors. These parties, in
turn (with a few notable exceptions), underassess land relative to
buildings, by using the erroneous &#8220;land-residual&#8221; method of dividing
land from building value. This is partly to accommodate their local
constituents - assessors are locally elected or appointed, and do not
report to the IRS. A little math will tell you that to depreciate land
just once is to achieve perpetual tax exemption. To depreciate it again
and again is a continuing subsidy for holding land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When
A sells to B there is a large excess of the sales price over the
remaining or &#8220;undepreciated&#8221; basis. This excess is, to be sure, taxable
income. However, Congress has defined this kind of income as a &#8220;capital
gain.&#8221; Most rents, therefore, show up as capital gains. These, in turn,
are subject to lower tax rates, deferral of tax, forgiveness at time of
death, constant pressure to lower rates to zero, and a dozen additional
avoidance devices. These are known to every lawyer and accountant and
Congressman, but not, apparently, to most economists, who lazily report
from &#8220;official&#8221; data that rents are a low fraction of national income. <a

It Over Us</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Geoism holds that there&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with being rich &#8211;
indeed, an economic system exists whereby we could ALL be rich (in
wealth, education or leisure time). The justification for riches all
depends on whether a wealthy person has become so through creating
wealth (in the form of goods and services that people willingly buy in
a free and fair market) or through living off the wealth really created
by others. Earned wealth might arise through talented or arduous
inventing, writing, sports ability,
entertaining, entrepreneurialship or whatever. Such examples of fairly
earned wealth should not be subject to any (confiscatory) taxation,
which would be legalised robbery. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Geoism seeks to expose the many forms of unearned wealth, or
privilege,
that exist in our monstrous economic system. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Monopoly rights are the more obvious
examples of economic privilege, but less noticeable is the massive
wealth to be gained by using the Global Commons (especially land)
without reimbursing the rest of us. </span>Where such wealth is purely
misappropriated (as opposed to created), Geoism maintains that the
whole lot be given over to community coffers through natural resource
charges (such as land value taxation or eco-taxes). </small><br>
<br>
<small>Here we&#8217;re going to look at one of the most obvious examples of
unearned wealth &#8211; the massive riches accumulated by the great
landowners of Britain. Remember, it&#8217;s not the acreage of land that is
important, but the value of the land.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>But the rewards of land go far beyond status, evidenced by how,
over
the centuries, the land-owning elite has pulled the levers of power in
society, politics and the world of commerce. The Earl of Derby&#8217;s 1881
candid analysis of the benefits of owning land perhaps says it best, </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>&#8220;One, political influence; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>two, social importance; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>three, power exercised over tenantry;</small></li>
  <li><small>four, residential enjoyment including what is called
sport; 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>five, the money return &#8211; the rent.&#8221;</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Since then, the reform of the
House of Lords has dented the political
influence that was previously wielded by the landowning class (titles
and land were once synonymous). But who needs status? &#8211; let&#8217;s get crass
and just go for the cash. The great windfall profits which are dropped
into landowners&#8217; laps (which rightly belongs to the community) occurs
with rezoning and the growth in residential/industrial values. In the
UK between 1991 and 2001, the total return by this measure (including
capital growth and rental income) averaged a healthy 12.6% per year.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The gross injustice of handing over community-created values to
landowners is revealed by cold, hard figures. According to Yolande
Barnes, head of research at FPD Savills, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the average UK building plot &#8211;
at &pound;709,650 for a greenfield acre &#8211; is worth around 403 times the
equivalent agricultural land. </span>Nationwide, through this form of
rezoning, around &pound;5bn. windfall profit is handed over to UK
landowners each year.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Barnes explains further, &#8220;In many parts of the South and
Southeast, it
is certainly true that prices are paid for agricultural land that
wouldn&#8217;t be justified by its agricultural value.&#8221; ...&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">farmers buy around
towns because they can&#8217;t lose. They&#8217;ll farm the land anyway, and if
permission is given to build, they&#8217;ve won the lottery. </span></small><br

Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a
 href="../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real Estate and the Capital
Gains Debate</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> To
bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 --&nbsp; and that most
of the
direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.
...</small><br>
<br>
<small>The most frequently heard arguments for reducing capital gains
taxes are: </small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>(1) to reduce the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;lock-in&#8221; effect</span>, by which high tax
rates at
realization deter asset sales;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span> </small><br>
(2) to relieve a disproportionate burden on homeowners; <br>
(3) to compensate for the erosion of capital gains by inflation, as an
alternative to indexing;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span> </small><br>
(4) to end alleged double taxation of both capital stocks and income
flows; <br>
(5) to spur productive enterprise and investment; and <br>
(6) to generate more tax revenue from the consequent growth in asset
sales and productivity.<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><small><small><font size="-1">14 Some argue that
eliminating
step-up of basis at death would do more to reduce lock-in than a rate
cut. See Joint Committee on Taxation (1990), p. 2 1; Gaffney (1991).<br>

<small>This report calls attention to a neglected aspect of the capital
gains
issue --&nbsp; one which bears importantly on the fifth- and
sixth-named
consequences. ... <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>What is missing
from the discussion is a sense of
proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
the stock market -- much less in new offerings -- but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate. ...</span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>This policy
brief seeks to elucidate the role of real estate in the
capital gains issue, indicating the quantitative orders of magnitude
involved.. We offer two main observations. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">generous </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">capital
consumption allowances (CCAs) </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">greatly
magnify the proportion of real estate income taken as taxable capital
gains.</span> Capital gains accrue not only on newly constructed
buildings, of course, but also on land and old buildings being sold and
resold. Our tax code allows for properties to be re-depreciated by
their new owners after a sale or swap, permitting real estate investors
to recapture principal again and again on the same structure. When CCAs
have been excessive relative to true economic depreciation, as they
were during the 1980s, capital gains have been commensurately larger
than the actual increase in property prices. As Charts la and lb
illustrate, capital consumption allowances in real estate dwarf those
in other industries.</small>  </li>
</ul>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold;">very little of
real
estate cash flow is taxable as ordinary income, so the capital gains
tax is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate
industry.</span> CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments
combine to exempt most of real estate cash flow from the income tax.
This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public
finance onto other taxpayers.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
central conclusion of our study is
that better statistics on asset
values and capital gains are needed -- or, more to the point, a better
accounting format. The economic effects of a capital gains tax depend
upon how the gains are made. ... </span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Our second major conclusion is
that, at least until
re-depreciation of second-hand buildings is disallowed, a capital gains
tax cut would be unlikely to stimulate much new investment and
employment from its largest beneficiary, the real estate industry.
</span>Depreciation allowances and mortgage interest absorb so much of
the
ongoing cash flow as to leave little taxable income. Mortgage interest
payments, which now consume the lion&#8217;s share of cash flow, are
tax-deductible, while CCAs offset much of what remains of rental
income. On an industry-wide basis, in fact, NIPA statistics reveal that
depreciation offsets <span style="font-style: italic;">more </span>than
the total reported income. As Charts 2a, 2b, and 2c illustrate, real
estate corporations and partnerships have recently reported net losses
year after year. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>The result is that real estate corporations pay minimal income
taxes -- some $1.3 billion in 1988, just one percent of the $137
billion
paid by corporate America as a whole.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small>
Comparable figures are not available on non-corporate income tax
liability, but the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, and real estate)
reported negative income of $3.4 billion in 1988, out of a total $267
billion of non-farm proprietors&#8217; income.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small> These
three symbiotically linked sectors thus were left with only capital
gains
taxes to pay on their cash flow.</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The central point for capital gains tax policy is that taxable
capital
gains in real estate consist of more than just the increase in land and
building prices. They represent the widening margin of sales price over
the property&#8217;s depreciated value. The tax accountant&#8217;s book-value gains
result from charging off capital
consumption allowances as a tax credit against cash flow. The more
generous are the capital consumption write-offs for real estate, the
more rapidly a property&#8217;s book value is written down. The fiction of
fast write-off is eventually &#8220;caught&#8221; as a capital gain when the real
estate is either sold or refinanced.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Excessive
depreciation allowances thus convert ordinary income into capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains. Moreover,
capital gains are the only point at which most real estate income is </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">taxed </span>To
abolish the capital gains tax would annul the entire accumulated income
tax liability which real estate owners have converted into a capital
gains obligation. The income written off over the years as
over-depreciation would not be caught at all. The economy's largest
industry would have its income rendered tax-free.&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><small><big style="font-weight: bold;">Depreciation and
Capital Gains</big></small></small><br>
<small><small><big style="font-weight: bold;"></big></small></small><br>
<small><small><big style="font-weight: bold;"></big></small>Much of the
statistical measurement problem derives from
the fact that capital gains in real estate differ from those in other
industries. While all investors presumably would prefer to take their
income in non-taxable forms and to defer whatever tax obligation is
due, the tax benefits to the real estate industry have no analog in
manufacturing, agriculture, power generation, transportation, wholesale
and retail trade, or other services. Corporations in these sectors pay
taxes on their net incomes. Out of their after-tax earnings they then
pay dividends, on which stockholders in turn must pay income tax. By
contrast, little or none of the rental cash flow received by real
estate investors is taxable, because generous capital consumption
allowances are treated as costs and deducted from the net income
reported to the IRS.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The effect of calculating capital gains for real estate on the
basis of
depreciated book values may be illustrated by the following example. A
building bought in 1985 has probably been fully written off today,
thanks to the generous CCAs enacted by the 1981 tax code that remained
in place through 1986. For a parcel bought in 1985 for $100 million and
sold today for $110 million, the recorded gain is not merely the 10
percent increase in market price, but <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the entire value of the
building</span>, perhaps $65 million based on the real estate
industry&#8217;s average land-to-building assessment ratios. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Thus the
putative
beneficiaries of cutting capital gains taxes -- direct investors&nbsp;
-- suffer
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">less from
high capital
gains tax rates than from the treatment of much of their </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">capital gain as
ordinary income, which is taxed at higher rates. In real estate, on the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">other hand,
depreciation effectively converts much of ordinary income to capital
gains. </span>Whereas industrial investors pay tax on rising
investment in unsold inventories, even when no sales revenue is
received, real estate investors pay tax neither on rental income nor on
increases in property values as they accrue. The industry actually
receives cash income, but for tax purposes reports a cash loss. Because
real estate and manufacturing face such different cash flow tax
treatment, it is misleading to take the manufacturing industry as a
proxy for real estate in discussing the effect of cutting capital gains
tax rates.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The greatest accounting distortion for the real estate industry
occurs
in the case of re-depreciation of buildings that already have been
depreciated at least once. This redepreciation occurs following
ownership transfers; the CCA is attached not to the physical asset, but
to the change of ownership. As the building is resold at rising prices,
investors are allowed to re-depreciate them again and again -- and to
write off these CCAs against their income, as if they were suffering an
erosion of wealth. Thus, most capital gains in real estate represent
&#8220;repeat gains&#8221; over unrealistically written-down book values. This
accounting fiction enables real estate investors to continue
indefinitely to take their income in the lightly taxed form of capital
gains.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">26</span></small></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small>26 Another kind of
subsidy
occurs in the sphere of farm real estate. Speculation in farmland is
reflected in the high ratio of farm prices to gross receipts. This
suggests that, on the one hand, &#8220;<strong>gentleman fanning</strong>&#8221; occurs in
near-suburban areas as a means of minimizing property taxes (thanks to
the lower appraisals of land zoned for agricultural use), and on the
other hand, speculation in anticipation that the land&nbsp;
subsequently will be rezoned for commercial and residential
development. 
</small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Landlords already deduct from earnings as normal business
expenses
their maintenance and repair expenditures, undertaken to counteract the
wear and tear of buildings.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> A rule of
thumb in the real estate industry
is that such expenditures typically consume about ten percent of rental
revenue.</span> More importantly, although nearly all&nbsp;land
gains are made fully taxable, there is little reason to assume that
physical deterioration should be compensated by a special allowance to
enable the landlord to
recover his capital investment within a given number of years.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Even when <span style="font-style: italic;">overall </span>real
estate values fell in the early 1990s, the IRS nonetheless recorded
capital gains taken on properties built before the frantic price run-up
of the late 1980s. Over a fifteen year period, the value of the
building in our example might have been written down to near zero. If
it were sold for just its original purchase price, the entire sales
price of the building would be reported as a capital gain.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Although the 1981 depreciation giveaway was replaced by the 1986
revision of the tax code, buildings already under construction and
about to come onto the rental market were grandfathered into the old
code. Significantly, today these buildings have been fully depreciated
and therefore are probably about to be sold, at least for book-keeping
purposes -- owners may buy their own buildings under different
partnerships, or swap them for similar buildings with other owners.
Their new owners can begin to depreciate them all over again, after
duly paying capital gains taxes on the buildings&#8217; increase over their
near-zero book value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">If they do not sell and
re-depreciate their buildings, the owners will have to begin paying
income taxes on their operating cash flow that hitherto was sheltered
by depreciation allowances that have now run out. This lends a renewed
note of urgency to the persistent campaign to cut capital gains tax
rates.</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>Because excessive depreciation allowances favor real estate
speculation
relative to industrial production, they discourage new direct
investment and employment. To reduce the capital gains tax -- the only
significant remaining source of federal revenue from real estate --
would divert even more savings into the purchase and sale of existing
buildings.&nbsp; ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">How Mortgage
Debt Converts Rent into Interest</span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Depreciation rules are
not the only reason why the real estate
sector declares little taxable income. Out of their gross rental
income, landlords pay state and local property taxes, a tiny modicum of
income tax, and interest on their mortgage debt. A large proportion of
cash flow is turned over to lenders as mortgage payments. Since the
early 1970s, interest paid by the real estate industry has been much
larger than the figures reported for net rental income. As Charts 3a,
3b, 3c, and 3d illustrate, real estate investors and homeowners have
become the financial sector&#8217;s prime customers. According to the Federal
Reserve Board, 1994 mortgage debt of $4.3 trillion represented some 46
percent of the economy's $9.3 trillion private nonfinancial debt, and a
third of the total $12.8 trillion U.S. debt.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> NIPA
statistics indicate that about 70 percent of loans to business
borrowers currently are made to the real estate sector, making it the
major absorber of savings and payer of interest. ... <small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></small><br>
<br>
<small>Most cash flow now ends up neither with developers nor with the
tax
authorities, but as interest paid to banks, insurance companies and
other mortgage lenders. In fact, <span style="font-weight: bold;">mortgage
interest now absorbs seven
percent of national income, up from just one percent in the late 1940s</span>.
In 1993 (the most recent year for which NIPA statistics are available)
the real estate sector generated some $326 billion in interest
payments, more than it contributed in income taxes and state and local
property taxes together. Meanwhile, over the past half century, net
declarable income plus capital consumption allowances and property
taxes have been cut in half as a proportion of national income, from
over ten percent to less than five percent. Thus interest is the real
estate industry&#8217;s major cost, and as such, has helped to minimize the
real estate industry&#8217;s income tax liability.</small><br>
<br>
<small>One effect of favorable depreciation and capital gains tax
treatment is
to spur debt pyramiding for the real estate industry. The tax structure
provides a distortionary incentive for real estate holders to borrow
excessively, converting rental income into a nontaxable mortgage
interest cost while waiting for capital gains to accrue. This,
alongside financial deregulation of the nation&#8217;s S&amp;Ls, was a major
factor in the over-building spree of the 80's. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Real estate is pledged to mortgage lenders as collateral in case
the
promised interest payments fail to materialize. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Capital gains have been
collateralized into new and larger loans decade after decade,
increasing the mortgage burden that transforms rental income and
depreciation allowances into interest payments. Ultimately, the
financial rentiers end up with most of the cash flow which landlords --
and government tax collectors -- relinquish.</span> ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>No capital gains duties are levied on estates passing to heirs.
Indeed,
inheritors of real estate may begin re-depreciating their
income-yielding buildings afresh at the new (typically higher) transfer
price. The estates bequeathed by the richest one percent of the
population (over $600,000
in value) are now taxed at a 55 percent rate if not sheltered, but of
course these are the estates most likely to shelter inheritance and
gift bequests. For instance, assets given as gifts are taxed only at
the time they come to be sold.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">30</span></small> If
the capital gains tax were reduced or abolished, the deferral would
become
permanent.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Most capital gains reaped by business partnerships accrue to
real
estate firms, which shelter personal income by avoiding incorporation.
IRS statistics ranking capital gains in terms of how long the assets
were held show that many of these gains represent quick &#8220;flips." Often
these are land that has been rezoned from a low-value to a high-value
use. Retaining the capital gains tax would have little effect on
deterring such speculation.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Properties held for longer periods of time by these partnerships
typically are sold or swapped after having been fully depreciated.
Swaps&#8217; have long been permitted to the real, many almost perpetually
free of income taxation. The logic for this
loophole seems at first glance to be much like that for personal
homeowners&#8217; exemptions in selling a home to move somewhere else,
without having to pay a capital gain tax in the process; but the
analogy is specious. Homeowners cannot take a depreciation tax credit
unless their property generates rental income, and most do not generate
any income against which to claim CCAs<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">31</span></small>. In
contrast, the capital gains which commercial real estate investors
record for income-tax purposes are calculated, not merely on the gain
in the property&#8217;s market price (as with owner-occupied homes), but on
the excess of selling price over depreciated book value. </small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 120px;"><font size="-1"><small><small>31 Homeowners do receive
imputed
rental income, which is not subject to the income tax.<br>
</small></small></font></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Major commercial real estate
investors such as pension funds, insurance
companies and other large institutions are exempt from capital gains
taxes, as are foreign investors. In addition to playing a dominant role
in real estate, these institutional investors own nearly half of all
U.S. equities. ...</small> <a

The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land Rent for the Community a
Design of Divine
Providence.</b>
</small><br>
<small>I think, therefore, that I may fairly infer, on the strength of
authority as well as of reason, that the people are and always must
be the real owners of the land of their country.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This great social fact appears to
me to be of incalculable
importance, and it is fortunate indeed that on the strictest
principles of justice it is not clouded even by a shadow of
uncertainty or doubt. There is, moreover, a charm and a peculiar
beauty in the clearness with which it reveals the wisdom and the
benevolence of the designs of Providence in the admirable provision
He has made for the wants and the necessities of that state of social
existence of which He is the author, and in which the very instincts
of nature tell us we are to spend our lives.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A vast public property, a great
national fund, has been placed
under the dominion and at the disposal of the nation to supply itself
abundantly with resources necessary to liquidate the expenses of its
government, the administration of its laws and the education of its
youth, and to enable it to provide for the suitable sustentation and
support of its criminal and pauper population. <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">One of the most
interesting peculiarities of this property is that its value is never
stationary; It is constantly progressive and increasing in a direct
ratio to the growth of the population; and the very causes that
increase and multiply the demands made on it increase proportionately
its ability to meet them.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landlordism Takes the
Patrimony of the People.</b>
</small><br>
<small>Let the democracy of England as well as of Ireland, learn the
melancholy fate that has overtaken this splendid inheritance which
God has placed in their hands, and which would have saved them eighty
millions sterling which they now annually pay by direct and indirect
taxation for the government of the country. That patrimony was once
theirs by right, and by right it is theirs still; but, in fact, it is
theirs no longer: a class has wrested the land from the people of the
country and now hold a strict monopoly in it. They sell it out to the
people as if it were an ordinary article of private property and
solely the result of their own capital and labour.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rents which the landlords draw
from their lands is an income
which they derive from the sale of what are avowedly God's gifts,
which "no man made." If they had only claimed the right of selling
the use of the permanent improvements they had made in the soil, by
the capital and labour they had expended on it, no one could dispute
the Justice of their demand; but any element of income that might
possibly be derived from this source is called in the language of
political economy, not Rent, but Profit.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Political economists who have
written with scientific precision on
the nature and properties of Rent, confine it exclusively to the
moneys which the landlord receives for allowing the tenant the use of
the original and natural productiveness of the soil. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>The Landlord the Greatest
Burden on the Land.</b>
</small><br>
<small>The land is a commodity that strictly belongs to this class. It
is
limited in extent, and no human power can enlarge or extend its area.
The competition for it is excessive, the competitors struggling for
its attainment -- not for the purpose of satisfying a taste for the
fine arts, or to gratify a passion for the rare or beautiful, but to
secure a necessary means of existence: for they must live on and by
the land, or they cannot live at all. The owner, therefore, of that
land can put on it any rent he pleases, and the poor people competing
for it have no choice but to accept his terms or die in a ditch or a
poorhouse. Under the present system of Land Tenure, the owners are
not only enabled, but actually exact for the use of the land the last
shilling the tenant is able to pay, leaving him only what is barely
sufficient to keep him from dying. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The essential and immutable
principles of justice used certainly
to be: -- </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>That everyone had a right of
property in the hard-earned fruits of
his labour; that whatever property a man had made by the expenditure
of his capital, his industry and his toil, was really his own; that
he, and he alone, had a right to all the benefits, the advantages and
enjoyments that that property yielded; and that if anyone else
meddled with that property against his will, or interfered with him
in its enjoyment, he was thereby guilty of the crimes of theft and of
robbery, which the eternal law of God, as well as the laws of all
nations, reprobated and punished with such severity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the principles which underlie
the existing system of Land
Tenure, and which impart to it its specific and distinctive
character, are exactly the reverse of these. The principles on which
that system is based are: -- </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>That one privileged class do not
require to labour for their
livelihood at all: that they have an exclusive right to all the
advantages, comforts and enjoyments that can be derived from a
splendid property, which exacted no patient, painful or self-denying
efforts of labour to create it or acquire it, and which, in fact,
they inherited without any sacrifice at all: that, being a singularly
favoured race, and being all God's eldest sons, the rest of the world
must humbly acknowledge themselves to be their inferiors in rank,
lineage, condition and dignity: that this superiority of rank gives
them a right to sell out God's gifts as if they were purely the
products of their own labour and industry, and that they can exact in
exchange for them famine or scarcity prices. Finally, that they enjoy
the enviable privilege of appropriating the hard-earned property of
others against their wills, and do them no wrong even if they charge
them a rent for the use of what would really appear to be their
own.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landlordism Robs All Classes.</b>
</small><br>
<small>Hitherto we have confined ourselves almost exclusively to the
consideration of the various forms of injustice, and the spoliation
of private property which the existing system of Land Tenure enables
the proprietors of the soil to inflict on the tenant farmers of
Ireland.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But the tenant farmers, though a
numerous, influential and
important section of the nation, are, after all not the nation.
Despite our cruel misgovernment in the past, some few of our national
industries still survive, as well as that of cultivation of the soil.
Then there are, moreover, certain trades and professions whose
services are indispensable to any nation that has any claims to be
considered civilised. The vast numbers who are engaged and live by
their labour, industry and skill in the various trades and
professions form an important and an influential section of every
civilised community.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Now, any form of injustice,
oppression or wrong that can possibly
exist in any of the great trades or industries of a nation is only
felt by the individuals who belong to that industry or trade, and who
earn their livelihood by their labour and skill in it. Outside, in
the other greater or lesser of the national industries, it is hardly
felt at all. But the Irish system of Land Tenure wrongs and
impoverishes not only those who live by and of the land, but all
other classes in the community as well! It robs not only the
cultivators of the soil, but every man in the community, of a
substantial portion of the hard-earned fruits of his labour, no
matter in what trade or profession he may labour for his living. It
is, therefore, not a local or a particular grievance, but a great
national injustice, and that, I think, is its most objectionable
peculiarity.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have already shown that the land
of every country is the public
property of the people of that country, and consequently, that its
exclusive appropriation by a class is a substantial injustice and
wrong done to every man in that country", whom it robs of his fair
share of the common inheritance. The injustice of this appropriation
is enormously enhanced by the fact that it further enables the
landlords, without any risk or trouble, and in fact makes it a matter
of course for them, to appropriate a vast share of the earnings of
the nation besides. They plundered the people first of God's gifts in
the land, and that act of spoliation puts them under a sort of
necessity of plundering them again of an enormous amount of their
direct earnings and wages. The line of argument that leads directly
to this conclusion seems abundantly clear.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Land Values intended by
Providence for Public Purposes.</b>
</small><br>
<small>I have already observed that the chief peculiarity of the land
of
a country was that its value was never stationary, that it was always
progressive and rising, that in fact it increased in a direct ratio
with the growth of the population and the advancing progress of the
industry of the nation.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would seem as if Providence had
destined the land to serve as a
large economical reservoir, to catch, to collect and preserve the
overflowing streams of wealth that are constantly escaping from the
great public industrial works that are always going on in communities
that are progressive and prosperous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Besides the permanent improvements
that are made in the land
itself, and which increase its productiveness and value, there are
other industrial works not carried out on the land itself, but on its
surroundings and in its vicinity, and which enhance its value very
considerably. A new road is made for the accommodation of a district;
a new bridge is thrown across a river or a stream to make two
important localities accessible to each other; a new railway passes
close by and connects it with certain large and important centres of
industry; a new factory or a new mill is erected, or a new town is
built in the neighbourhood.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Industrial works like these add
very materially to the value of
all the land in their vicinity. It is a well-known fact that a new
railway has in several instances doubled the value of the land
through which it passed, in consequence of the increased facilities
it had afforded for the sale of its agricultural products.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In every state of society, which
is progressive and improving,
such industrial works are continually going on, and hence the value
of the land is rising also everywhere. But its value rises enormously
with the enlarged growth of the population of a nation, and with the
increased productiveness of its industry. </small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Wages Do Not Keep Pace.</b>
</small><br>
<small>The United Kingdom furnishes an example that is singularly
illustrative of this fact. Says Mr. Cairnes: "A given exertion of
British labour and capital will now produce in a great many
directions five, ten or twenty times, in some instances perhaps a
hundred times the result which an equal exertion would have produced
a hundred years ago. It is not probable that industry is, in any
direction whatever, less productive now than it was then; yet the
rate of wages, as measured by the real well-being of the labourer,
has certainly not advanced in anything like a corresponding degree;
while it may be doubted if the rate of profit has advanced at all." A
given amount, then, of British capital and labour is now ten or
twenty times more effective than a hundred years ago, while, on the
other hand, the quantity of such effective labour and capital now
engaged in British industrial production is perhaps twenty times
larger now than formerly. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Landlords Sow Not, But They
Reap. ... 
</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small>If the land had not been
  appropriated by individuals and diverted
  from the original purpose for which Providence had intended it, the
  high prices which the nation thus imposes on itself by the vastness
  of its numbers and the abundance of its wealth, in the purchase of
  the raw products of the soil, should be regarded as a most just and
  natural tax, which it instinctively levies on itself to realise the
  large sums that are necessary for the support of its public
  burdens.
  </small></p>
  <p><small><b>The Great National Property Which Landlords Are Permitted to
    Appropriate.</b>
        </small><br>
    <small>But now the great national property which Providence has
    destined
    for the support of the public burdens of society has been diverted
    from its original purpose to minister to the wants, the necessities,
    and perhaps the extravagance of a class. The explanation of this
    extraordinary act of national spoliation will be found in the fact
    that hitherto this class could just do as it pleased; the government
    of the country lay for centuries exclusively in its hands, and
    despite the combined influence of "English radicalism" and "Irish
    obstructionism" it is practically in its hands still. The enormous
    value, then, thus superadded to the land from the two sources just
    indicated passes directly with the land itself into the hands of
    those who own it.</small></p>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Those who hold the ownership of
the land hold also the ownership
of all the accessions of value it receives from all quarters. This
increase in the value of their property cost no sacrifice, demanded
no painful effort of labour. Even while they slept their rent rolls
went on increasing and multiplying.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The value continually imparted to
the land by the industrial
exertions of the community, in the construction of harbours and
bridges, in the making of new roads and railways, in the erection of
new factories, mills and houses, etc., has all gone with the land,
has all been confiscated and appropriated by the owners of the
soil. ... <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Read the whole letter</a></small></p>

  Wasteland to Promised land:
Liberation Theology for a Post-Marxist World</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To recognize that "the earth is
the Lord's" is to see that the same God who established communities has
also in his providence ordained for them, through the land itself, a
just source of revenue. Yet, in the Wasteland in which we live, this
revenue goes mainly into the pockets of monopolists, while communities
meet their needs by extorting individuals the fruits of their honest
toil. If ever there were any doubt that structural sin exists, our
present system of taxation is the proof. Everywhere we see governments
penalizing individuals for their industry and creativity, while the
socially produced value of land is reaped by speculators in exact
proportion to the land which they withhold. The greater the Wasteland,
the greater the reward. Does this comport with any divine plan, or
notion of justice and human rights? Or does it not, rather, perpetuate
the Wasteland and prevent the realization of the Promised Land?</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This not meant to suggest that
land monopolists and speculators have a corner on acquisitiveness or
the "profit motive," which is a well-nigh universal fact of human
nature. As a group, they are no more sinful than are people at large,
except to the degree that they knowingly obstruct reforms aimed at
removing the basis of exploitation. Many abide by the dictum: "If one
has to live under a corrupt system, it is better to be a beneficiary
than a victim of it."</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>But they do not have to live under a corrupt system; no one
does. The profit motive can be channeled in ways that are socially
desirable as well as in ways that are socially destructive. Let us give

<p>Thomas Flavin, writing in <a href="http://www.knowledgerush.com/pg/etext96/bti1010.txt">The
    Iconoclast, 1897</a> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, it is quite true that all taxes of whatever nature are paid out of
    the products of labor. But must they be for that reason a tax on labor products.
    Let us see. </p>
  <p>I suppose you won't deny that a unit of labor applies to different kinds
    of land will give very different results. Suppose that a unit of labor produces
    on A's land 4, on B's 3, on C's 2 and on D's 1. A's land is the most, and
    D's is the least, productive land in use in the community to which they belong.
    B's and C's represent intermediate grades. Suppose each occupies the best
    land that was open to him when he entered into possession. Now, B, and C,
    and D have just as good a right to the use of the best land as A had. </p>
  <p>Manifestly then, if this be the whole story, there cannot be equality of
    opportunity where a unit of labor produces such different results, all other
    things being equal except the land. </p>
  <p>How is this equality to be secured? There is but one possible way. Each
    must surrender for the common use of all, himself included, whatever advantages
    accrues to him from the possession of land superior to that which falls to
    the lot of him who occupies the poorest. </p>
  <p>In the case stated, what the unit of labor produces for D, is what it should
    produce for A, B and C, if these are not to have an advantage of natural
    opportunity over D. </p>
  <p>Hence equity is secured when A pays 3, D, 2 and C, 1 into a common fund
    for the common use of all--to be expended, say in digging a well, making
    a road or bridge, building a school, or other public utility. </p>
  <p>Is it not manifest that here the tax which A, B and C pay into a common
    fund, and from which D is exempt, is not a tax on their labor products (though
    paid out of them) but a tax on the superior advantage which they enjoy over
    D, and to which D has just as good a right as any of them. </p>
  <p>The result of this arrangement is that each takes up as much of the best
    land open to him as he can put to gainful use, and what he cannot so use
    he leaves open for the next. Moreover, he is at no disadvantage with the
    rest who have come in ahead of him, for they provide for him, in proportion
    to their respective advantages, those public utilities which invariably arise
    wherever men live in communities. Of course he will in turn hold to those
    who come later the same relation that those who came earlier held to him. </p>
  <p>Suppose now that taxes had been levied on labor products instead of land;
    all that any land-holder would have to do to avoid the tax is to produce
    little or nothing. He could just squat on his land, neither using it himself
    nor letting others use it, but he would not stop at this, for he would grab
    to the last acre all that he could possibly get hold of. Each of the others
    would do the same in turn, with the sure result that by and by, E, F and
    G would find no land left for them on which they might make a living. </p>
  <p>So they would have to hire their labor to those who had already monopolized
    the land, or else buy or rent a piece of land from them. Behold now the devil
    of landlordism getting his hoof on God's handiwork! Exit justice, freedom,
    social peace and plenty. Enter robbery, slavery, social discontent, consuming
    grief, riotous but unearned wealth, degrading pauperism, crime breeding,
    want, the beggar's whine, and the tyrant's iron heel. </p>
  <p>And how did it all come about? By the simple expedient of taxing labor products
    in order that precious landlordism might laugh and grow fat on the bovine
    stupidity of the community that contributes its own land values toward its
    own enslavement! </p>
  <p>And yet men vacuously ask, &quot;What difference does it make?&quot; </p>
  <p>O tempora! O mores! To be as plain as is necessary, it makes this four-fold
    difference. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, it robs the community of its land values; </li>
    <li>second, it robs labor of its wages in the name of taxation; </li>
    <li>third, it sustains and fosters landlordism, a most conspicuously damnable
      difference; </li>
    <li>fourth, it exhibits willing workers in enforced idleness; beholding their
      families in want on the one hand, and unused land that would yield them
      abundance on the other. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This last is a difference that cries to heaven for vengeance, and if it
    does not always cry in vain, will W. C. Brann be able to draw his robe close
    around him and with a good conscience exclaim, &quot;It's none of my fault;
    I am not my brother's keeper.&quot;</p>

<p>Joseph Fels: &nbsp; <a href="../docs/Fels.html">True Christianity and
      My Own Religious Beliefs</a><br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I believe that the Creator
freely gave the earth to all of His
children, that all may have equal rights to its use. Do you agree to
that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that the injunction, "In the sweat of thy brow shalt
thou eat
bread," necessarily implies, "Thou shalt not eat bread in the sweat of
thy brother's brow." Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that all are violating the divine law who live in
idleness on
wealth produced by others, since they eat bread in the sweat of their
brothers' brows. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that no man should have power to take wealth he has
not
produced or earned unless freely given to him by the producer. Do you
agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that brotherhood requires giving an equivalent for
every
service received from a brother. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe it is blasphemous to assert or insinuate that God has
condemned some of His children to hopeless poverty, and to the Crimea,
want, and misery resulting therefrom, and has, at the same time,
awarded to others lives of ease and luxury, without labor. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe that involuntary poverty and involuntary idleness are
unnatural, and are due to the denial by some of the right of others to
use freely the gift of God to all. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Since labor products are needed to sustain life, and since labor
must
be applied to land in order to produce, I believe that every child
comes into life with divine permission to use land without the consent
of any other child of God. Do you agree?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where men congregate in organized society, land has a value
apart from
the value of things produced by labor; as population and industry
increase, the value of land increases, but the value of labor products
does not. That increase in land value is community-made value. Inasmuch
as your power to labor is a gift of God, all the wealth produced by
your labor is yours, and no man nor collection of men has a right to
take any of it from you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>I believe the community-made value of land belongs to the
community,
just as the wealth produced by you belongs to you. Do you agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Therefore, I believe that the fundamental evil, the great
God-denying
crime of society, is the iniquitous system under which men are
permitted to put into their pocket, confiscate, in fact, the
community-made values of land, while organized society confiscates for
public purposes a part of the wealth created by individuals. Do you
agree to that?</small><br>
<br>
<small>Using a concrete illustration: I own in the city of Philadelphia
11-1/2
acres of land, for which I paid 32,500 dollars a few years ago. On
account of increase of population and industry in Philadelphia, that
land is now worth about 125,000 dollars. I have expended no labor or
money upon it. So I have done nothing to cause that increase of 92,500
dollars in a few years. <span style="font-weight: bold;">My
fellow-citizens in Philadelphia created it,
and I believe it therefore belongs to them, not to me. I believe that
the man-made law which gives to me and other landlords values we have
not created is a violation of the divine law.</span> I believe that
Justice
demands that these community-made values be taken by the community for
common purposes instead of taxing enterprise and industry. Do you agree?...
