      Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Land value taxation taps the geo-rent. Like today&#8217;s real property
    tax, a land value tax would have some tax rate that would tap some percentage
    of
      the land value or rent. I suggest 80 percent of the geo-rent be used for
    public revenue. The landowner would pay it from the rental he collects from
    the tenant,
      or if owner-occupied, from the implicit rental value he obtains from the
    site. The 80 percent rate would leave some of the land rent with the landowner
    to
      have a margin for assessment error and also to maintain a positive price
    for the land to facilitate its sale.</p>
  <p>There are several methods of assessing land value or rent. One way is to calculate
      the replacement value of the existing improvements (unless they are historic),
      and then subtract the depreciation of the buildings. Then subtract the building
      value from the total property value. What is left is land value. For commercial
      property, one also can take the net income and subtract the return on the improvements
      (using some interest rate), the remainder being land rent. In some places there
      is vacant or bare land that has a market price, and sometimes there are separate
      owners for the land and the improvements, for which data can be derived from
      leases and sales.<strong> The assessors then smooth out the neighborhood land values,
      using computerized maps. It is not necessary to individually assess the values
      of most of the buildings in a neighborhood, since most lots in a locality will
      have a similar value per lot.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Assessors enter this data into computers, which generate neighborhood
      maps. The assessors interpolate or smooth out the prices of lots between
      those for
      which they have recent sales or rental data, since land values tend to
      be similar in a neighborhood unless there is some special feature such
      as corner lots
      or odd-sized lots.</strong> ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

  <p> <strong><em>d. Effect of Confiscating Rent to Private Use. </em></strong> </p>
  <p>By giving Rent to individuals society ignores this most just law, 99 thereby
    creating social disorder and inviting social disease. Upon society alone,
    therefore, and not upon divine Providence which has provided bountifully,
    nor upon the disinherited poor, rests the responsibility for poverty and
    fear of poverty.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">99. &quot;Whatever dispute arouses the passions of men,
        the conflict is sure to rage, not so much as to the question 'Is it wise?'
        as to the question 'Is it right?'</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;This tendency of popular discussions to take an
        ethical form has a cause. It springs from a law of the human mind; it
        rests upon a vague and instinctive recognition of what is probably the
        deepest truth we can grasp. That alone is wise which is just; that alone
        is enduring which is right. In the narrow scale of individual actions
        and individual life this truth may be often obscured, but in the wider
        field of national life it everywhere stands out.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;I bow to this arbitrament, and accept this test.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book vii, ch. i.</font></p>

        George's proposition is in any respect unjust, will find profit in a

  </blockquote>
  <p>Let us try to trace the connection by means of a chart, beginning with the
    white spaces on page 68. As before, the first-comers take possession of the
    best land. But instead of leaving for others what they do not themselves
    need for use, as in the previous illustrations, they appropriate the whole
    space, using only part, but claiming ownership of the rest. We may distinguish
    the used part with red color, and that which is appropriated without use
    with blue. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <p>But what motive is there for appropriating more of the space than is used?
    Simply that the appropriators may secure the pecuniary benefit of future
    social growth. What will enable them to secure that? Our system of confiscating
    Rent from the community that earns it, and giving it to land-owners who,
    as such, earn nothing.100</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">100. It is reported from Iowa that a few years ago a workman
        in that State saw a meteorite fall, and. securing possession of it after
        much digging, he was offered $105 by a college for his &quot;find.&quot; But
        the owner of the land on which the meteorite fell claimed the money,
        and the two went to law about it. After an appeal to the highest court
        of the State, it was finally decided that neither by right of discovery,
        nor by right of labor, could the workman have the money, because the
        title to the meteorite was in the man who owned the land upon which it
        fell.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Observe the effect now upon Rent and Wages. When other men come, instead
    of finding half of the best land still common and free, as in the corresponding
    chart on page 68, they find all of it owned, and are obliged either to go
    upon poorer land or to buy or rent from owners of the best. How much will
    they pay for the best? Not more than 1, if they want it for use and not to
    hold for a higher price in the future, for that represents the full difference
    between its productiveness and the productiveness of the next best. But if
    the first-comers, reasoning that the next best land will soon be scarce and
    theirs will then rise in value, refuse to sell or to rent at that valuation,
    the newcomers must resort to land of the second grade, though the best be
    as yet only partly used. Consequently land of the first grade commands Rent
    before it otherwise would.</p>
  <p>As the sellers' price, under these circumstances, is arbitrary it cannot
    be stated in the chart; but the buyers' price is limited by the superiority
    of the best land over that which can be had for nothing, and the chart may
    be made to show it: [chart]</p>
  <p>And now, owing to the success of the appropriators of the best land in securing
    more than their fellows for the same expenditure of labor force, a rush is
    made for unappropriated land. It is not to use it that it is wanted, but
    to enable its appropriators to put Rent into their own pockets as soon as
    growing demand for land makes it valuable.101 We may, for illustration, suppose
    that all the remainder of the second space and the whole of the third are
    thus appropriated, and note the effect: [chart]</p>
  <p>At this point Rent does not increase nor Wages fall, because there is no
    increased demand for land for use. The holding of inferior land for higher
    prices, when demand for use is at a standstill, is like owning lots in the
    moon &#8212; entertaining, perhaps, but not profitable. But let more land
    be needed for use, and matters promptly assume a different appearance. The
    new labor must either go to the space that yields but 1, or buy or rent from
    owners of better grades, or hire out. The effect would be the same in any
    case. Nobody for the given expenditure of labor force would get more than
    1; the surplus of products would go to landowners as Rent, either directly
    in rent payments, or indirectly through lower Wages. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">101. The text speaks of Rent only as a periodical or continuous
        payment &#8212; what would be called &quot;ground rent.&quot; But actual
        or potential Rent may always be, and frequently is, capitalized for the
        purpose of selling the right to enjoy it, and it is to selling value
        that we usually refer when dealing in land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Land which has the power of yielding Rent to its owner
        will have a selling value, whether it be used or not, and whether Rent
        is actually derived from it or not. This selling value will be the capitalization
        of its present or prospective power of producing Rent. In fact, much
        the larger proportion of laud that has a selling value is wholly or partly
        unused, producing no Rent at all, or less than it would if fully used.
        This condition is expressed in the chart by the blue color.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The capitalized value of land is the actuarial 'discounted'
        value of all the net incomes which it is likely to afford, allowance
        being made on the one hand for all incidental expenses, including those
        of collecting the rents, and on the other for its mineral wealth, its
        capabilities of development for any kind of business, and its advantages,
        material, social, and aesthetic, for the purposes of residence.&quot; &#8212; Marshall's
        Prin., book vi, ch. ix, sec. 9.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;The value of land is commonly expressed as a certain
        number of times the current money rental, or in other words, a certain
        'number of years' purchase' of that rental; and other things being equal,
        it will be the higher the more important these direct gratifications
        are, as well as the greater the chance that they and the money income
        afforded by the land will rise.&quot; &#8212; Id., note.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">&quot;Value . . . means not utility, not any quality inhering
        in the thing itself, but a quality which gives to the possession of a
        thing the power of obtaining other things, in return for it or for its
        use. . . Value in this sense &#8212; the usual sense &#8212; is purely
        relative. It exists from and is measured by the power of obtaining things
        for things by exchanging them. . . Utility is necessary to value, for
        nothing can be valuable unless it has the quality of gratifying some
        physical or mental desire of man, though it be but a fancy or whim. But
        utility of itself does not give value. . . If we ask ourselves the reason
        of . . . variations in . . . value . . . we see that things having some
        form of utility or desirability, are valuable or not valuable, as they
        are hard or easy to get. And if we ask further, we may see that with
        most of the things that have value this difficulty or ease of getting
        them, which determines value, depends on the amount of labor which must
        be expended in producing them ; i.e., bringing them into the place, form
        and condition in which they are desired. . . Value is simply an expression
        of the labor required for the production of such a thing. But there are
        some things as to which this is not so clear. Land is not produced by
        labor, yet land, irrespective of any improvements that labor has made
        on it, often has value. . . Yet a little examination will show that such
        facts are but exemplifications of the general principle, just as the
        rise of a balloon and the fall of a stone both exemplify the universal
        law of gravitation. . . The value of everything produced by labor, from
        a pound of chalk or a paper of pins to the elaborate structure and appurtenances
        of a first-class ocean steamer, is resolvable on analysis into an equivalent
        of the labor required to produce such a thing in form and place; while
        the value of things not produced by labor, but nevertheless susceptible
        of ownership, is in the same way resolvable into an equivalent of the
        labor which the ownership of such a thing enables the owner to obtain
        or save.&quot; &#8212; <a href="../HG/APP/PI_C5_Mr_Spencer%27s_Confusion_as_to_Value.htm">Perplexed Philosopher, ch. v.</a></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The figure 1 in parenthesis, as an item of Rent, indicates potential Rent.
    Labor would give that much for the privilege of using the space, but the
    owners hold out for better terms; therefore neither Rent nor Wages is actually
    produced, though but for this both might be.</p>
  <p>In this chart, notwithstanding that but little space is used, indicated
    with red, Wages are reduced to the same low point by the mere appropriation
    of space, indicated with blue, that they would reach if all the space above
    the poorest were fully used. It thereby appears that under a system which
    confiscates Rent to private uses, the demand for land for speculative purposes
    becomes so great that Wages fall to a minimum long before they would if land
    were appropriated only for use.</p>
  <p>In illustrating the effect of confiscating Rent to private use we have as
    yet ignored the element of social growth. Let us now assume as before (page
    73), that social growth increases the productive power of the given expenditure
    of labor force to 100 when applied to the best land, 50 when applied to the
    next best, 10 to the next, 3 to the next, and 1 to the poorest. Labor would
    not be benefited now, as it appeared to be when on page 73 we illustrated
    the appropriation of land for use only, although much less land is actually
    used. The prizes which expectation of future social growth dangles before
    men as the rewards of owning land, would raise demand so as to make it more
    than ever difficult to get land. All of the fourth grade would be taken up
    in expectation of future demand; and &quot;surplus labor&quot; would be crowded
    out to the open space that originally yielded nothing, but which in consequence
    of increased labor power now yields as much as the poorest closed space originally
    yielded, namely, 1 to the given expenditure of labor force.102 Wages would
    then be reduced to the present productiveness of the open space. Thus: [chart]</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">102. The paradise to which the youth of our country have
        so long been directed in the advice, &quot;Go West, young man, go West,&quot; is
        truthfully described in &quot;Progress and Poverty,&quot; book iv, ch.
        iv, as follows :</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">&quot;The man who sets out from the eastern seaboard
          in search of the margin of cultivation, where he may obtain land without
          paying rent, must, like the man who swam the river to get a drink,
          pass for long distances through half-titled farms, and traverse vast
          areas of virgin soil, before he reaches the point where land can be
          had free of rent &#8212; i.e., by homestead entry or preemption.&quot;</font></p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If we assume that 1 for the given expenditure of labor force is the least
    that labor can take while exerting the same force, the downward movement
    of Wages will be here held in equilibrium. They cannot fall below 1; but
    neither can they rise above it, no matter how much productive power may increase,
    so long as it pays to hold land for higher values. Some laborers would continually
    be pushed back to land which increased productive power would have brought
    up in productiveness from 0 to 1, and by perpetual competition for work would
    so regulate the labor market that the given expenditure of labor force, however
    much it produced, could nowhere secure more than 1 in Wages.103 And this
    tendency would persist until some labor was forced upon land which, despite
    increase in productive power, would not yield the accustomed living without
    increase of labor force. Competition for work would then compel all laborers
    to increase their expenditure of labor force, and to do it over and over
    again as progress went on and lower and lower grades of land were monopolized,
    until human endurance could go no further.104 Either that, or they would
    be obliged to adapt themselves to a lower scale of living.105</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">103. Henry Fawcett, in his work on &quot;Political Economy,&quot; book
        ii, ch. iii, observes with reference to improvements in agricultural
        implements which diminish the expense of cultivation, that they do not
        increase the profits of the farmer or the wages of his laborers, but
        that &quot;the landlord will receive in addition to the rent already
        paid to him, all that is saved in the expense of cultivation.&quot; This
        is true not alone of improvements in agriculture, but also of improvements
        in all other branches of industry.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">104. &quot;The cause which limits speculation in commodities,
        the tendency of increasing price to draw forth additional supplies, cannot
        limit the speculative advance in land values, as land is a fixed quantity,
        which human agency can neither increase nor diminish; but there is nevertheless
        a limit to the price of land, in the minimum required by labor and capital
        as the condition of engaging in production. If it were possible to continuously
        reduce wages until zero were reached, it would be possible to continuously
        increase rent until it swallowed up the whole produce. But as wages cannot
        be permanently reduced below the point at which laborers will consent
        to work and reproduce, nor interest below the point at which capital
        will be devoted to production, there is a limit which restrains the speculative
        advance of rent. Hence, speculation cannot have the same scope to advance
        rent in countries where wages and interest are already near the minimum,
        as in countries where they are considerably above it. Yet that there
        is in all progressive countries a constant tendency in the speculative
        advance of rent to overpass the limit where production would cease, is,
        I think, shown by recurring seasons of industrial paralysis.&quot; &#8212; Progress
        and Poverty, book iv, ch. iv.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">105. As Puck once put it, &quot;the man who makes two
        blades of grass to grow where but one grew before, must not be surprised
        when ordered to 'keep off the grass.' &quot;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>They in fact do both, and the incidental disturbances of general readjustment
    are what we call &quot;hard times.&quot; 106 These culminate in forcing unused
    land into the market, thereby reducing Rent and reviving industry. Thus increase
    of labor force, a lowering of the scale of living, and depression of Rent,
    co-operate to bring on what we call &quot;good times.&quot; But no sooner
    do &quot;good times&quot; return than renewed demands for land set in, Rent
    rises again, Wages fall again, and &quot;hard times&quot; duly reappear.
    The end of every period of &quot;hard times&quot; finds Rent higher and Wages
    lower than at the end of the previous period.107</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">106. &quot;That a speculative advance in rent or land
        values invariably precedes each of these seasons of industrial depression
        is everywhere clear. That they bear to each other the relation of cause
        and effect, is obvious to whoever considers the necessary relation between
        land and labor.&quot; &#8212; Progress and Poverty, book v, ch. i.</font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">107. What are called &quot;good times&quot; reach a point
        at which an upward land market sets in. From that point there is a downward
        tendency of wages (or a rise in the cost of living, which is the same
        thing) in all departments of labor and with all grades of laborers. This
        tendency continues until the fictitious values of land give way. So long
        as the tendency is felt only by that class which is hired for wages,
        it is poverty merely; when the same tendency is felt by the class of
        labor that is distinguished as &quot;the business interests of the country,&quot; it
        is &quot;hard times.&quot; And &quot;hard times&quot; are periodical
        because land values, by falling, allow &quot;good times&quot; to set
        it, and by rising with &quot;good times&quot; bring &quot;hard times&quot; on
        again. The effect of &quot;hard times&quot; may be overcome, without
        much, if any, fall in land values, by sufficient increase in productive
        power to overtake the fictitious value of land.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The dishonest and disorderly system under which society confiscates Rent
    from common to individual uses, produces this result. That maladjustment
    is the fundamental cause of poverty. And progress, so long as the maladjustment
    continues, instead of tending to remove poverty as naturally it should, actually
    generates and intensifies it. Poverty persists with increase of productive
    power because land values, when Rent is privately appropriated, tend to even
    greater increase. There can be but one outcome if this continues: for individuals
    suffering and degradation, and for society destruction.</p>

</div>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Two appraisal
methods</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>PROPERTY IS APPRAISED in two ways.
Both start by estimating its
market value.</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small><b>The land-residual approach </b>subtracts the value of
buildings from this overall value, designating the remainder as the
value of land. Building values may be estimated in terms of their
replacement cost (which usually produces a very high estimate, leaving
little land value) or their depreciated value (which gives an
unrealistically low building estimate, inasmuch as maintenance and
repairs save most buildings from deteriorating through wear and tear).
Using the depreciated value method leaves a higher residual land value.
The Federal Reserve Board recently has experimented with a hybrid
intermediate method that values buildings on the basis of their
"historical costs".</small></li>
  <li><small><b>The building-residual approach</b> starts by valuing
the land, and treats the difference as representing the building's
value. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
first step in this approach is to construct a land-value map for the
district or city. </span>This displays fairly smooth contours for land
values. Overlays would show zoning variations. Most of the variations
in property prices around this normalized map will be for structures,
along with a sizable component of "errors and omissions." This approach
rarely is used, and most assessed land values vary drastically from one
parcel to the next. The problem is especially apparent in the case of
parking lots or one-story "taxpayers," that is, inexpensive buildings
in neighbourhoods that are heavily built up. Their purpose is simply to
be rented out at enough to carry the property's tax bill, not to
maximise the site's current economic value.</small></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Note that the Fed's land-residual
appraisal methods do not
acknowledge the possibility that the land itself may be rising in
price. Site values appear as the passive derivative, not as the
driving force. Yet low-rise or vacant land sites tend to appreciate
as much as (or in many cases, even more than) the improved properties
around them. Hence this price appreciation cannot be attributed to
rising construction costs. If every property in the country were
built last year, the problem would be simple enough. The land
acquisition prices and construction costs would be recorded, adding
up to the property's value. But many structures were erected as long
ago as the 19th century. How do we decide how much their value has
changed in comparison to the property's overall value?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Federal Reserve multiplies the
building's original cost by the
rise in the construction price index since its completion. The
implication is that when a property is sold at a higher price (which
usually happens), it is because the building itself has risen in
value, not the land site. However, if the property must be sold at a
lower price, falling land prices are blamed.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-weight: bold;"><small>If it is agreed
that any explanation of land/building relations
should be symmetrical through boom and bust periods alike, then the
same appraisal methodology should be able to explain the decline of
property values as well as their rise. The methodology should be as
<i>uniform</i> and <i>homogeneous</i> as possible. By
that, I mean that similar land should be valued at a homogeneous
price, and buildings of equivalent worth should be valued
accordingly.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If these two criteria are
accepted, then I believe that economists
would treat buildings as the residual, not the land. Yet just the
opposite usually is done. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One clear sign of land-price
inflation is that one category of
land rises or falls much more rapidly than others. A widening
disparity usually reflects a financial inflation. In Japan, for
instance, high rates of saving were recycled to a remarkable extent
into construction and real estate acquisition. Japanese authorities
produced detailed land-value statistics for each category of land,
showing property values during the Bubble years 1985-90 rising at an
accelerating pace until 1991, and then turning downward. The A-shaped
rise and fall was steepest for the most expensive land surrounding
the Tokyo palace, while land for single-story wooden residential
housing rose and fell least steeply. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A
land-value map placing the
highest values at the center and the lowest values in the outlying
areas would tend to reflect a land-price bubble when price ratios
steepened.</span> On the other hand, a fairly level set of land values
between the central city and its outskirts would indicate relatively
less rent of location, and hence less land-value disparities. Using
this analogy to examine New York City's midtown area, the steep
land-value curve has been fed by credit as affluent buyers sought the
most prestigious locations. Land sites have become the receptacle of
the economy's surplus savings. ...&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <a

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... <br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>The failed policy that the PTS would replace
is the present property tax. This is actually two taxes in one, one on
land and another on improvements. The tax on improvements penalizes
owners for improving. This negative incentive does its greatest damage
at the margin, where profit is slim. There, rather than pay a higher
tax, owners let buildings dilapidate into slums. The lack of much tax
on land keeps overhead on speculators affordable. This negative
incentive lets owners under-utilize prime sites, even withhold them
from use entirely. Kept from prime sites, development sprawls outward.<br>
<br>
Sprawl inflates the values of suburban and rural land.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> Leap-frog
development raises a few spikes in a land value map that soon pull up
values everywhere, increasing the property tax burden of owners of
previously developed sites, unless the tax is capped. </span>The
resultant
sprawl also raises enormously the cost of extending infrastructure and
makes auto-dependency a given.<br>
<br>
The PTS reverses all these negative consequences. 
</small></font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than burden
construction, taxing only land spares it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than spread
development (hooking us on cars), taxing land concentrates it
(providing a market for mass transit). 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than inflate land price,
a land tax squashes it. 
    </small></font></small></li>
  <li><small><font size="3"><small>Rather than enrich the owners of
prime sites or
itself, a land-taxing government could rebate some collected site rent
as a dividend, perhaps in the form of a Housing Voucher, making home
ownership inflation-proof.</small></font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which
in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

using property tax assessments to monitor the economic landscape</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The &#8216;real world&#8217; in which human
society exists is not
confined to natural, physical phenomena. From earliest times, human
beings have interacted socially and economically. As they do so, they
have specialised and traded in goods and services which are the
products of combinations of labour, capital, enterprise and the
fourth &#8211; often forgotten but distinct &#8211; factor of all production:
land.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land comprises all natural
resources, not just &#8216;<span style="font-style: italic;">terra
firma</span>.&#8217; It is the universe minus man&#8217;s products. Even the
simplest of human activities, sleep, requires each of us to occupy
exclusively a space, a location, preferably a bed in a home of our
own. But that word &#8216;own&#8217; conjures emotions and political
postures.
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As everyone who deals in real
estate knows, there are three most
important things about their stock in trade: location, location and
location! Because the market value attached to locations varies over
space and time, our real world conceals a shifting and invisible
&#8216;land-value-scape&#8217;. We can see the roof-tops and admire (or
deplore) the physical view. We can measure the bricks and timber in
three dimensions. We cannot see the fourth dimension, the fourth
factor that comprises 20% to 60% of the market value of our homes:
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8216;v&#8217; or value of land per unit area</span>.
But we know it is
there.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Just as every point on the surface
of planet Earth has a
&#8216;z&#8217; that defines its place in the landscape, so every
location has a value in the global economy. This value is a function
of three things: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>content (soil, air or water quality; metallic
composition of rock);
    </small></li>
  <li><small>accessibility (position in relation to human
society); and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>the wealth of that particular community.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Unlike other, natural, phenomena
in the real world, the
landvaluescape changes over time and space at a fairly rapid and
often unpredictable rate. Value only has meaning where there is both
human knowledge of the existence of a place and its natural wealth
potential <b>and</b> the possibility of converting that potential
into products that others will wish to buy. Knowledge of places and
utility of resources vary with time, as do the workings of markets:
physical means of exchange of goods.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>For example, the discovery of a
new continent immediately gives
value to the place in the minds of the crew of the ship that
discovers it &#8211; as does the discovery of the mysteries of the
genetic code in a plant species or the broadcast spectrum. Unless the
ship&#8217;s captain charts the discovery and brings the chart safely
back to port &#8211; with the plants of the continent &#8211; or
transmits the information about it through the air-waves,
&#8216;discovery&#8217; has no value in any market place. Whether we
talk about value in exchange or value in use, the measure of
&#8216;v&#8217; given to a location depends on social context.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The most important difference
between measuring &#8216;v&#8217; and
measuring &#8216;z&#8217; is that there is no single objective value of
any location, other than at those somewhat rare points in time when
real estate is traded, when market price is the surrogate for market
value. Even then, transactions that are to form the basis of market
valuations need, in theory, to be made in certain idealised
conditions, such as open competition between buyers and sellers. All
potential parties to the transaction should have perfect information
about other similar contemporaneous transactions &#8211; and be in an
&#8216;arms length&#8217; relationship. Contracting parties are assumed
to be of sound mind! No two transactions in real estate are ever
identical in every respect and the number of factors than can affect
price or value is enormous.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Valuation of real estate is
tricky. Separation of the value of
land/location from the value of land-and-buildings combined is even
more tricky. So is it worth the effort involved in replacing
&#8216;z&#8217; with &#8216;v&#8217; in a three-dimensional model of
landvaluescape, in order to visualise what is going on in economies
in the geo-spatial sense? Are value maps valuable?</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The unavoidable subjectivity in
assigning value to land or
locations is what many geographers, more used to mapping physical
features, find discomforting about value mapping (Dale, 2002).
Mapping things of less importance that can be measured more precisely
and objectively, is preferred to mapping property values (accounting
for at least twenty percent of the global economy) that cannot
objectively be measured at all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Yet value maps have been attempted
for various reasons for about
one hundred years and are becoming a fairly common feature of the
property industry in some advanced countries. The last known
comprehensive survey of global practice in value mapping was over
twenty years ago, before the widespread use of the personal computer
(PC), computer aided mass assessment (CAMA) of property values and
geographic information systems (GIS). The author concluded:-</small></p>

Kingsfield in the long-running TV series, The Paper Chase, later became

"We make money the old-fashioned way -- we earn it."</small><br>
<br>
<small>That we should earn our money rather than live off the efforts

others seems a simple enough moral tenet. But it seems to have lost its
cogency in contemporary economic thought. More than a century ago John
Stuart Mill noted that</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-style: italic;">Landlords
grow richer in their sleep
without working, risking or economizing. The increase in the value of
land, arising as it does from the efforts of an entire community,
should belong to the community and not to the individual who might hold
title.</span><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(1)
</span></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>Today, on the other hand, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
unearned surplus which classical
economists called rent</span> attaches to monopoly titles -- largely
the
scarce goods and services of nature like locational sites, and has
totally disappeared from economic calculus. Yet this is the primary
vehicle by which wealth is captured by economic elites. If government
recaptured the socially-created economic rent from land sites that
comes from the investment of the collective community, we could
eliminate other taxes that are both more onerous and create a drag on
the economy that makes us all poorer. There are many websites that
explain how this can be done, ways that not only beget greater economic
efficiency but also bring about economic justice.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(2)</span></small> The
surplus economic rent that derives from community effort is its
rightful entitlement.</small><br>
<br>
<small>Where does economic rent most tend to lodge? In the center of
cities
where people are. And also proximate to heavy social investments --
such as railroad and metro stations, public and office buildings,
hotels and conference centers, and anywhere there is high traffic in
personal or market exchanges. The land value in New York City is higher
than all the rest of the New York state combined, even though it is
only a minute fraction of the area. One 9-acre site south of the United
Nations Building was recently sold to a developer intent on building
luxury condominiums facing the East River. That site sold for $680
million, and would have been higher had the existing structure, an
obsolete power plant, not have to be razed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">(3)</span></small> <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Land
values in any given area tend to rise and fall together, and tend also
to form a contour somewhat comparable to a topographical survey map. In
a city's center are the highest value locations, analogous to a
mountain peak. Once one departs from that center, land values fall in
direct proportion to the value of their use, made more or less
attractive by whatever social attributes are provided in the proximate
areas. </span>Two illustrations from small and medium sized cities in
the
United States illustrate the point.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Case
1: Ithaca, New York:</span>
Tompkins County, where the city of Ithaca sits at the center, has land
values many times those within a short walk. Dividing the county land
parcels into quintiles, the highest fifth have values of $56,000 per
acre and above. The lowest fifth have a value of less than $3,000 per
acre. The high value area collectively constitutes only a minute
proportion of the total number of square miles because most of it is
farm or forest land. [see map]</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Case
2: Des Moines, Iowa:</span> Polk
County, where Des Moines sits near the center, has land values even
more disparate between urban and rural locations. The highest quartile
there are those $97,400 per acre and above, the single highest parcel
of all worth an astonishing $31.4 million per acre. Yet, the lowest
quartile, a roughly equal number of far larger parcels, all have a
value of less than $30,000 per acre. [see map]</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>... The failure to collect site
rent leads to a distortion in land use
configurations. If patterns unfolded along the lines of both social
preference and economic efficiency, high value landsites would tend to
have high value buildings, and low value landsites would tend to be
vacant or have very modest buildings. Consistent with this, urban
centers sites would tend to have office and commercial use, surrounded
by lower-value residential land uses, and still further out would be
farms and forests. The ratio of building to land value, land to total
value (or for that matter any other ratio between buildings, land, and
total values) would be relatively constant throughout a region.
Instead, the ratio of land value to total value consistently tends to
reveal a patchwork of random development. This inefficient settlement
of land sites is what we know as sprawl.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Land Rent</strong></p>
  <p> From the standpoint of an economic geographer and for some land economists,
      land rent is simply capitalized transportation cost. Land rent is the surplus
      generated by social activity on or in the vicinity of locational sites that
      accrues to titleholders of those parcels. Whether or not it is recaptured by
      public policy, rent is a natural factor deriving from the intensive use of
      natural capital. One must return to nineteenth-century classical economics
      to appreciate the importance of economic rent or land rent; neoclassical economic
      frameworks have largely discarded it.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[13]</em></strong></font> More
      intensive use of high-value land sites leads to site configurations that
      are less dependent on transportation services. Land rent is highest where
      the greatest
      traffic and market exchanges occur, that being at the center of large conurbations.
      Comparing land values of urban property parcels, the highest land rent
      in the urban cores and traffic junctures are analogous to the contours
      of land elevations.
      Mountain peaks gradually slope down to valleys and flatland regions and
      continue outward until at distant points &#8212; perhaps at the poles of the earth &#8212; land
      sites have no market value at all.</p>
  <p>The differentials in land values are profound, even more than most people
      realize. In 1995, in the small city of Ithaca, New York, the highest quintile
      of land had a value of over $56,000 per acre in the downtown center, whereas
      the lowest quintile only a mile away falls to less than $3,000.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[14]</em></strong></font> Large
      city centers have far higher site prices. Even in Polk County, Iowa (which
      includes Des Moines), in the middle of cornfields where I did a study two years
      ago, the highest urban value land site was $31.3 million per acre, which quickly
      declined to about $20,000 per acre only about a mile away. In the spring of
      1998, one land parcel (the building was to be razed) of less than an acre in
      New York City's Times Square and split in two pieces by Broadway was sold by
      Prudential Life to Disney for roughly $240 million.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[15]</em></strong></font> To
      take another instance, a nine-acre tract on the East River in New York City
      occupied by an obsolete power plant was purchased by Mort Zuckerman to build
      high-rise condominiums two years ago. The sale price was in the neighborhood
      of $680 million and would have been higher were it not for some enormous costs
      associated with the demolition of the old structures.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[16]</em></strong></font> It
      should be noted that the overwhelming proportion of land value is in cities;
      relatively speaking, the site values of peripheral lands, typically used for
      agriculture and timber growth, are negligible. Land values are high in urban
      areas because, over time, rent accrues to a site. Each improvement in proximity
      to a property parcel enhances the value of all other parcels. This makes even
      unimproved sites attractive objects for speculation, particularly when land
      sites surrounding it are to be improved by adding either transportation service
      or new structures. One nine-mile stretch of interstate highway in Albany, New
      York, costing $125 million to construct, has yielded $3.8 billion in increased
      land values (constant dollars) within just two miles of its corridor in the
      forty years of its existence.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[17]</em></strong></font> This
      is a thirty-fold return in a time span typically used for bond repayment! The
      Washington Metro created increments in land value along much of the 101-mile
      system completed by 1980 that easily exceeded $3.5 billion, compared with the
      $2.7 billion of federal funds invested in Metro up until that time.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[18]</em></strong></font> Any
      major building construction project, private or public, will have a similar
      effect on adjacent land sites. Differentials in land value can have a profound
      effect on decisions made by titleholders, either positively by inducing appropriate
      development in urban cores or negatively by giving monopoly titleholders power
      to hold sites out of use for long-term speculative gain. Such decisions of
      course determine the character of urban configurations and society as well.

<blockquote>
  <p>This is relatively easy to understand by considering a vacant expanse of
    land that has imposed upon it a grid of roads like a tic-tac-toe board. Suppose
      each of the squares were privately owned, and development of those sites
    were
      to ensue, the economic surplus generated by that market activity would
    raise the value of each of those locations. Let's further suppose that every
    site
      were developed except the center square, that titleholder choosing instead
      to just hold his title vacant. Which land site, discounting the building
    values, would command the greatest market price after a short time? The center
    square,
      of course &#8212; even though that owner made no effort to earn that increase
      in price. The center square would see the greatest accretion of economic
      rent because of its strategic access. It would be the passive beneficiary
      of the
      surplus generated by the common enterprise of all the market exchanges
      resulting from the other locations. In just this way rent becomes the social
      creation
      of the community and not the result of any private individual's enterprise.
      The more the economic activity, the more the surplus generated comes to
      settle on land in the form of rent. Rent accretes to land sites and raises
      their market
      value, directly reflecting the varying levels of productive economic surplus
      generated over time throughout a community. High economic productivity
      yields high surplus rent.</p>
  <p>If one plots the land value per unit area, whether by square foot, acre,
    hectare, or square mile, as is now possible to easily do using modern computer
    programs,
      the differential land values are easy to approximate. Typically the center
      of a city experiences the peak land value, with a precipitous decline as
    one leaves the center and departs to its outer edge. The highest value locations
      are the commercial cores, falling quickly as one travels out to residential
      locations, and with agricultural and forest lands having only a small fraction
      of the value commanded at the center. In areas of New York City, the market
      price of locations has been shown to be in the vicinity of $500 million
    per
      acre. Even in smaller cities, there is little realization of the enormous
    cost of sites in core areas: in downtown Des Moines, the price per acre was
    $31.5
      million. Other illustrations are easily available, particularly in urban
    areas on the east and west coasts of the US. Taking another perspective,
    the urbanized
      center of Tompkins County, New York (Ithaca) is five percent of the land
    area but contains ninety-five percent of the land value.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[8] </em></strong></font>To
      see where the land values are highest, it is easiest to look at a city's
    skyline.<font size="-1"><strong><em>[9]</em></strong></font> The
      tallest buildings sit on the most expensive land parcels. Typically the
    aggregate land value of a city is about 40 percent of the combined market
    value of land
      and improvements. The proportion of overall land value to building value
    is revealed by that profile, known as a landvaluescape<font size="-1"><strong><em>.[10]</em></strong></font> Some
      buildings will exceed that proportion &#8212; a large investment on a small
      footprint; other sites may be vacant or depreciated buildings with a far
      smaller land to building ratio. The dynamic at work here is easily understood:
      the
      greater a land site's value the greater the incentive to take advantage
      of its location; following the same logic, the more intensive the investments
      in particular neighborhoods the greater market value of remaining or underused
      land sites, making any locations that are underutilized good candidates
      for
      improvement. So it is that downtowns generate land values many times those
      of farther reaches; each investment development fosters others. ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WSCP.htm">read the whole article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Little justification exists for taxing buildings, or improvements of any
    sort, so this question is easily disposed of. The practice is explained largely
    as a matter of historical inertia. Only in the recent century or two have
    buildings represented any significant capital value; prior to the rise of
    major cities, the value of real property lay essentially in land. American
    cities today typically record aggregate assessed land values &#8211; at least
    when the valuations are well-done &#8211; at about 40% to 60% of total taxable
    value, that is, of land and buildings taken together.31 Skyscrapers reflect
    enormous capital investment, and this expenditure is warranted because of
    the enormous value of locational sites. Each site gets its market price from
    the fact that the total neighborhood context creates an attractive market
    presence and ambience. By taxing buildings, however, we impose a penalty
    on their optimum development as well as on the incentives for their maintenance.
    Moreover, taxes on buildings take away from whatever burden would otherwise
    be imposed on sites, with the result that incentives for their highest and
    best use is weakened. Lastly, the technical and administrative challenges
    of properly assessing the value of improvements is daunting, particularly
    since they must be depreciated for tax and accounting purposes, evaluated
    for potential replacement, and so on. In fact most costs associated with
    administration of property taxation and appeal litigation involve disputes
    over the valuation of structures, not land values.</p>
  <p>Land value taxation, on the other hand, overcomes all these obstacles. Locations
    are the beneficiaries of community services whether they are improved or
    not. As has been forcefully argued by this writer and others elsewhere,32
    a tax on land value conforms to all the textbook principles of sound tax
    theory. Some further considerations are worth reviewing, however, when looking
    at ground rent as a flow rather than as a &#8220;present value&#8221; stock.
    The technical ability to trace changes in the market prices of sites &#8211; or
    as can also be understood, the variable flow of ground rent to those sites &#8211; by
    the application of GIS (geographic information systems) real-time recording
    of sales transactions invites wholesale changes in the maintenance of cadastral
    data. The transmittal of sales records as typically received in the offices
    of local governments for purposes of title registration over to Assessors&#8217; offices
    allows for the possibility of a running real-time mapping of market values.
    <strong>Given also that GIS algorithms can now calculate the land value proportions
    reasonably accurately, this means that &#8220;landvaluescapes&#8221; are
    easily created in ways analogous to maps that portray other common geographic
    features. These landvaluescapes reflect the flow of ground rent through local
    or regional economies, and can also be used to identify the areas of greatest
    market vitality and enterprise. </strong>The flow of economic rent can easily be taxed
    in ways that overcomes the mistaken notion that it is a stock. Just as income
    is recognized as a flow of money, rent too can (and should) be understood
    as such.</p>
  <p>The question still begs to be answered, &#8220;why tax land?&#8221; And
    what happens when we don&#8217;t tax land? Henry George answered this more
    than a century ago more forcefully and clearly, perhaps, than anyone has
    since. He recognized full well that the economic surplus not expended by
    human hands or minds in the production of capital wealth gravitates to land.
    Particular land sites come to reflect the value of their strategic location
    for market exchanges by assuming a price for their monopoly use. Regardless
    whether those who acquire title to such sites use them to the full extent
    of their potential, the flow of rent to such locations is commensurate with
    their full capacity. This is why John Stuart Mill more than a century ago
    observed that, &#8220;Landlords grow richer in their sleep without working,
    risking or economizing. The increase in the value of land, arising as it
    does from the efforts of an entire community, should belong to the community
    and not to the individual who might hold title.&#8221;33 Absent its recovery
    by taxation this rent becomes a &#8220;free lunch&#8221; to opportunistically
    situated titleholders. When offered for sale, the projected rental value
    is capitalized in the present value for purposes of attaching a market price
    and sold as a commodity. Yet simple justice calls for the recovery in taxes
    what is the community&#8217;s creation. Moreover, the failure to recover
    the land rent connected to sites makes it necessary to tax productive activities
    in our economy, and this leads to economic and technical inefficiency known
    as &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;34 It means that the economy performs suboptimally.</p>
  <p>Land, and by this Henry George meant any natural factor of production not
    created by human hands or minds, is ours only to use, not to buy or sell
    as a commodity. In the equally immortal words of Jefferson a century earlier, &#8220;The
    earth belongs in usufruct to the living; . . . [It is] given as a common
    stock for men to labor and live on.&#8221;35 This passage likely needs a
    bit of parsing for the modern reader. The word usufruct, understood since
    Roman times, has almost passed from use today. It means &#8220;the right
    to use the property of another so long as its value is not diminished.&#8221;36
    Note also that Jefferson regarded the earth as a &#8220;common stock;&#8221; not
    allotted to individuals with possessory titles. Only the phrase &#8220;to
    the living&#8221; might be subject to challenge by forward-looking environmentalists
    who, taking an idea from Native American cultures, argue that &#8220;we do
    not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children.&#8221; The
    presumption that real property titles are acquired legitimately is a claim
    that does not withstand scrutiny; rather all such titles owe their origin
    ultimately to force or fraud.37</p>
  <p>If we own the land sites that we occupy only in usufruct, and the rent that
    derives from those sites is due to community enterprise, it is not a large
    logical leap to argue that the community&#8217;s recovery of that rent should
    be the proper source of taxation. This is the Georgist argument: that the
    recapture of land rent is the proper &#8211; indeed the natural &#8211; source
    of taxation.38 ... <a href="../docs/Batt_WhoPaysNYST_1985.htm">read the whole commentary</a></p>

<p>Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_Market-Based.html">Market-Based Systems
      for Assigning Rental Value to Land</a>
  </div>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p>The system described so far presumes that there are many identical sites,
      so that the rents offered for ones that are relinquished can reveal the value
      of the ones in continued use. In fact, every site has unique characteristics,
      especially in terms of the distances from other locations that are economically
      relevant, and often in other ways as well. Fortunately, the initial assumption
      of identical sites, which was made to explore the system, is not necessary.
      It is possible to make good estimates of the rental value of all land from
      information about the rental value of a small percentage of sites, because
      the rental value of land tends to be a smooth function of location. Rents
      are highest in the centers of cities, diminishing gradually with distance
      from the center. Rents are also higher in places with characteristics such
      as proximity to transit facilities or especially good views, and tend to
      be lower in places that are
  close to the source of a noxious smell or noise.</p>
  <p>To take account of the differences among sites, the officials in charge
      of renting land can annually examine the results of recent auctions and construct
      a revised map of land rents. In constructing this map, the rent assigned
      to each site that is auctioned should be not the highest bid, but rather
      the second-highest bid, which represents the actual opportunity cost of a
    site, what it would be worth to have one more vacant site.</p>
  <p>Consider an example to highlight this point. Suppose that the highest bid
      for a site is 1,000 rubles per year, the second-highest bid is 800 rubles
      per year, and an adjacent site, with virtually identical characteristics,
      is occupied by someone for whom continued use is worth 900 rubles per year.
      If charged 1,000 rubles, this person will relinquish the site, and the rent
      that can then be obtained for it will presumably be the 800 rubles offered
      for the adjacent site. Thus it is counterproductive to assign rent that is
    greater than the highest offer that is refused.</p>
  <p><b>Summary of
  the System Involving Actual Delivery of Land</b></p>
  <p>To operate the system for determining annual rents from bids for sites that
      are actually delivered for use, the officials in charge of renting land simply
      auction every site that is relinquished by its previous user. According to
      the terms of the auction, the bid represents an offer of rent for the first
      year's use, with use of the site going to the highest bidder at a price of
      the second highest bid. The highest bidder also receives an option to continue
      to use the site into the indefinite future, upon payment of rent that will
      be determined, year by year, by rent maps constructed from bids in auctions
    that will be conducted in the same way.</p>
  <p>The user of any site is permitted to terminate use at any time, provided
      that the site is restored to a condition of bare land. To protect against
      the abandonment of sites in a condition in which it is expensive to restore
      them to an unimproved state, anyone who wishes to build can be required to
    post a bond against the cost of demolition.</p>
  <p>Any user of land is permitted to sell both the improvements on a site and
      the right to continue renting the site to anyone else, for any price on which
      they mutually agree. However, it can be expected that the prices that will
      secure agreement will reflect little if anything more than the value of the
      improvements, because the right to use sites can be obtained at auction just
      by offering a small amount more than what others are offering for the first
    year's rent.</p>
  <p>Each year the land-managing bureaucracy will construct a new map of land
      value, based on the second-highest bids for sites that have been auctioned
      recently. Rent bills for all land will then be sent out, based on this map.
