  Sixteen Tons<br>
  <br>
Mark Twain &nbsp; <a href="../docs/Twain_archimedes.html">Archimedes</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">I
know of a mechanical
force more powerful than anything the vaunting engineer of Syracuse
ever dreamed of. It is the force of land monopoly; it is a screw and
lever all in one; it will screw the last penny out of a man's pocket,
and bend everything on earth to its own despotic will. </span>Give me
the
private ownership of all the land, and will I move the earth? No; but
I will do more.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> I will undertake to
make slaves of all the human
beings on the face of it. Not chattel slaves exactly, but slaves
nevertheless. What an idiot I would be to make chattel slaves of
them. I would have to find them salts and senna when they were sick,
and whip them to work when they were lazy.</span></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>No, it is not good enough. Under
the system I propose the fools
would imagine they were all free. I would get a maximum of results,
and have no responsibility whatever. They would cultivate the soil;
they would dive into the bowels of the earth for its hidden
treasures; they would build cities and construct railways and
telegraphs; their ships would navigate the ocean; they would work and
work, and invent and contrive; their warehouses would be full, their
markets glutted, and: </small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b><span
 style="font-style: italic;">The beauty of the whole concern would be</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">That everything they made would
belong to me.</span> </b></small></center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be this way, you see: As
I owned all the land, they would
of course, have to pay me rent. They could not reasonably expect me
to allow them the use of the land for nothing. I am not a hard man,
and in fixing the rent I would be very liberal with them. I would
allow them, in fact, to fix it themselves. What could be fairer? Here
is a piece of land, let us say, it might be a farm, it might be a
building site, or it might be something else - if there was only one
man who wanted it, of course he would not offer me much, but if the
land be really worth anything such a circumstance is not likely to
happen. On the contrary, there would be a number who would want it,
and they would go on bidding and bidding one against the other, in
order to get it. I should accept the highest offer - what could be
fairer? Every increase of population, extension of trade, every
advance in the arts and sciences would, as we all know, increase the
value of land, and the competition that would naturally arise would
continue to force rents upward, so much so, that in many cases the
tenants would have little or nothing left for themselves.... <a

<br>
"A. J. O."&nbsp; (probably Mark Twain)&nbsp; <a
 href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html">Slavery</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Suppose I am the owner of an
estate and 100 slaves, all the land
about being held in the same way by people of the same class as
myself. It is a profitable business, but there are many expenses and
annoyances attached to it. I must keep up my supply of slaves either
by buying or breeding them. I must pay an overseer to keep them
continually to their work with a lash. I must keep them in a state of
brutish ignorance (to the detriment of their efficiency), for fear
they should learn their rights and their power, and become dangerous.
I must tend them in sickness and when past work. And the slaves have
all the vices and defects that slavery engenders; they have no
self-respect or moral sense; they lie, they steal, they are lazy,
shirking work whenever they dare; they do not care what mischief
their carelessness occasions me so long as it is not found out; their
labor is obtained by force, and given grudgingly; they have no heart
in it. All these things worry me. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>Suddenly a brilliant idea strikes me. I reflect that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">there is no
unoccupied land in the neighbourhood, so that if my laborers were
free they would still have to look to me for work somehow.</span> <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So they all set to at the old work
at the old place, and on the
old terms, only a little differently administered; that is, that
whereas I formerly supplied them with food, clothes, etc., direct
from my stores, I now give them a weekly wage representing the value
of those articles, which they w ill henceforth have to buy for
themselves.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a difference, too, in
some other respects, indicating a
moral improvement in our relations. I can no longer curse and flog
them. But then I don&#8217;t want to; it&#8217;s no longer necessary;
the threat of dismissal is quite as effective, even more so; and much
more pleasant for me.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I can no longer separate husband
from wife, parent from child. But
then again, I don&#8217;t want to. There would be no profit in it;
leaving them their wives and children has the double advantage of
making them more contented with their lot, and giving me greater
power over them, for they have now got to keep these wives and
children out of their own earnings.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>My men are now as eager as ever to
come to me to work as they
formerly were to run away from work. I have neither to buy or breed
them; and if any suddenly leave me, instead of letting loose the
bloodhounds, I have merely to hold up a finger or advertise, and I
have plenty of others offering to take their place. I am saved the
expense and worry of incessant watching and driving. I have no sick
to attend, or worn-out pensioners to maintain. If a man falls ill
there is nothing but my good nature to prevent my turning him off at
once; the whole affair is a purely commercial transaction -- so much
wages for so much work. The patriarchal relation of slave-owner and
slave is gone, and no other has taken its place. When the man is worn
out with long service I can turn him out with a clear business
conscience, knowing that the State will see that he does not
starve.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Instead of being forced to keep
my men in brutish ignorance, I
find public schools established at other people&#8217;s expense to
stimulate their intelligence and improve their minds, to my great
advantage, and their children compelled to attend these schools. The
service I get, too, being now voluntarily rendered (or apparently so)
is much improved in quality. In short, the arrangement pays me better
in many ways. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I gain in other ways besides
pecuniary benefit. I have lost
the stigma of being a slave driver, and have, acquired instead the
character of a man of energy and enterprise, of justice and
benevolence. I am a "large employer of labor," to whom the whole
country, and the laborer especially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, "See the power of capital! These poor laborers, having no
capital, could not use the land if they had it, so this great and
far-seeing man wisely refuses to let them have it, and keeps it all
for himself, but by providing them with employment his capital saves
them from pauperism, and enables him to build up the wealth of the
country, and his own fortune together."</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Whereas it is not my capital
that does any of these things. It is
not my capital but the laborer&#8217;s toil that builds up my fortune
and the wealth of the country. It is not my employment that keeps him
from pauperism, but my monopoly of the land forcing him into my
employment that keeps him on the brink of it. It is not want of
capital that keeps the laborer from using the land, but my refusing
him the use of the land that prevents him from acquiring capital. All
the capital he wants to begin with is an axe and a spade, which a
week&#8217;s earnings would buy him, and for his maintenance during
the first year, and at any subsequent time, he could work for me or
for others, turnabout, with his work on his own land. Henceforth with
every year his capital would grow of itself, and his independence
with it, and that this is no fancy sketch, anyone can see for himself
by taking a trip into the country, where he will find well-to-do
farmers who began with nothing but a spade and an axe (so to speak)
and worked their way up in the manner described. </small><br>
<br>
<small>But now another thought strikes me. Instead of paying an
overseer
to work these men for me, I will make him pay me for the privilege of
doing it. I will let the land as it stands to him or to another
&#8211; to whomsoever will give the most for the billet. He shall be
called my tenant instead of my overseer, but the things he shall do
for me are essentially the same, only done by contract instead of for
yearly pay.<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>For a moderate reduction in my profits, then &#8211; a reduction
equal to the tenant&#8217;s narrow margin of profit &#8211; I have all
the toil and worry of management taken off my hands, and the risk
too, for be the season good or bad, the rent is bound to be
forthcoming, and I can sell him up to the last rag if he fails of the
full amount, no matter for what reason; and my rent takes precedence
of all other debts. All my capital is set free for investment
elsewhere, and I am freed from the odium of a slave owner,
notwithstanding that the men still toil for my enrichment as when
they were slaves, and that I get more out of them than ever. If I wax
rich while they toil from hand to mouth, and in depressed seasons
find it hard to get work at all; it is not, to all appearances, my
doing, but merely the force of circumstances, the law of nature, the
state of the labor market &#8211; fine sounding names that hide the
ugly reality.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If wages are forced down it is not
I that do it; it is that greedy
and merciless man the employer (my tenant) who does it. I am a lofty
and superior being, dwelling apart and above such sordid
considerations. I would never dream of grinding these poor laborers,
not I! I have nothing to do with them at all; I only want my rent --
and
get it. Like the lilies of the field, I toil not, neither do I spin,
and yet (so kind is Providence!) my daily bread (well buttered) comes
to me of itself. Nay, people bid against each other for the privilege
of finding it for me; and no one seems to realise that the
comfortable income that falls to me like the refreshing dew is dew
indeed; but it is the dew of sweat wrung from the laborers&#8217;
toil. It is the fruit of their labor which they ought to have; which
they would have if I did not take it from them.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This sketch illustrates the fact
that chattel slavery is not the
only nor even the worst form of bondage. When the use of the earth
&#8211; the sole source of our daily bread &#8211; is denied unless one
pays a fellow creature for permission to use it, people are bereft of
economic freedom. The only way to regain that freedom is to collect
the rent of land instead of taxes for the public domain.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Once upon a time, labor leaders in
the USA, the UK and Australia
understood these facts. The labor movements of those countries were
filled with people who fought for the principles of &#8216;the single
tax&#8217; on land at the turn of the twentieth century. But since
then and they have gradually yielded to the forces of privilege and
power daring no longer to come to grips with this fundamental
question, lest they, too, become ridiculed. And so the world
continues to wallow in this particular ignorance &#8211; and in its
ensuing poverty and debt. <a href="../docs/ajo_slavery.html"><span

<blockquote>
  <p>Chattel slavery, thank God, is abolished at last. Nowhere, where the American
      flag flies, can one man be bought, or sold, or held by another. (Cheers) But
      a great struggle still lies before us now. Chattel slavery is gone; industrial
      slavery remains. The effort, the aim of the abolitionists of this time is to
      abolish industrial slavery. (Cheers)</p>
  <p>The free trade movement in England was a necessary step in this direction.
      The men who took part in it did more than they knew. Striking at restrictions
      in the form of protection, aiming at emancipating trade by reducing tariffs
      to a minimum for revenue only, they aroused a spirit that yet goes further.
      There sits, in the person of my friend, Mr. Briggs [Thomas Briggs], one
    of the men of that time, one of the men who, not stopping, has always aimed
    a
      a larger freedom, one of the men who today hails what we in the United
    States call the single tax movement, as the natural outcome and successor
    of the movement
      which Richard Cobden led.39 (A voice: &quot;Three cheers for Mr. Briggs,&quot; and

<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Landownership imparts superior
    bargaining power</span><br>
    Labor starves, in contests of endurance; land endures. <br>
    <br>
    A landowner is also a person with labor power.&nbsp; He or she can earn
      income like any worker.&nbsp; Landownership gives income above that,
      which gives discretionary spending or waiting power.<br>
    <br>
    In contests with capital, land has the greater waiting power because
      over time capital depreciates, while land appreciates.&nbsp; Thus
      landowners (when free of heavy taxation) are noted for their
      patience.&nbsp; Patience is the essence of bargaining power.<br>
    <br>
    Because land is fixed, more ownership by one person or group means less
      ownership by others.&nbsp; To expand is to preempt, unavoidably.&nbsp;
    Thus, the expanding agent necessarily weakens others by the same stroke
      that strengthens himself.&nbsp; Landownership often gives market power
      in the sale of specific commodities and services.
