  <p>William Ogilvie: <a

  Essay on the Right of Property in Land</a> (Scotland, 1782)  </p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The rent which may be taken for
land ought to be submitted to
regulations not less than the interest of money. Whatever good reasons
may be given for restraining money-holders from taking too high
interest, may with still greater force be applied to restraining
proprietors of land from an abuse of their right. By exacting
exorbitant rents, they exercise a most pernicious usury, and deprive
industry that is actually exerted of its due reward. By granting only
short leases, they stifle and prevent the exertion of that industry
which is ready at all times to spring up, were the cultivation of the
soil laid open upon equitable terms. It is of more importance to the
community, that regulations should be imposed on the proprietors of
land, than on the proprietors of money; for land is the principal stock
of every nation, the principal subject of industry, and the use of
which is most necessary for the happiness and due employment of every
individual. ... <a style="font-weight: bold;"

Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/Carter_Clarion.html"><small><small>A Clarion Call to Sanity, to Honesty, to
Justice</small></small></a>&nbsp; (1982)<br>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Let us begin this study of the
likely causes of our troubles by
asking two questions: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>Are we over-populated? 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Are the earth's
resources inadequate for this population? 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Our stage, of course, for
making this study will be this world of ours, for it is upon this
world that the drama of human living is played out, with all its joys
and all its sorrows, with all its great achievements and all its
failures, with all its nobilities and all its wickedness.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Regardless of its size relative to
other planets, with its
circumference of about twenty-five thousand miles, to any mere mortal
who must walk to the station and back each day, it is huge. Roughly
ninety-six million miles separate the sun from the earth on the
latter's eliptical journey around the sun. At this distance, the
earth makes its annual journey in its elliptical curve and it spins
on its own canted axis. Because of this cant, the sun's rays are
distributed far more evenly, thus minimizing their damage and
maximizing their benefits.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider the complementarity of
nature in the case of the two
forms of life we call vegetable and animal, in their respective uses
of the two gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide, the waste product of
each serving as the life-giving force of the other. Any increase in
the one will encourage a like response in the other.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Marvel at the manner in which
nature, with no help from man or
beast, delivers pure water to the highest lands, increasing it as to
their elevation, thus affording us a free ride downstream and free
power as we desire it. Look with awe at the variety and quantity of
minerals with which this world is blessed, and finally at the
fecundity nature has bestowed so lavishly throughout both animal and
vegetable life: Take note of the number of corn kernels from a single
stalk that can be grown next year from a single kernel of this year's
crop; then think of the vastly greater yields from a single cherry
pit or the seeds of a single apple, or grape or watermelon; or,
turning to the animal world, consider the hen who averages almost an
egg a day and the spawning fish as examples of the prolificacy that
is evident throughout the whole of the animal world, including
mankind.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If this marvelous earth is as rich
in resources as portrayed in
the foregoing paragraph, then the problem must be one of
distribution: 
</small></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>how is the land distributed among the earth's
inhabitants, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>how are its products in turn distributed?</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Land is universally treated as
either public property or private
property. Wars are fought over land. Nowhere is it treated as common
property.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>George has described this world as
a "well-provisioned ship" and
when one considers the increasingly huge daily withdrawals of such
provisions as coal and petroleum as have occurred say over the past
one hundred years, one must but agree with this writer. But this is
only a static view. Consider the suggestion of some ten years ago
that it would require the conversion of less than 20% the of the
current annual growth of wood into alcohol to fuel all the motors
then being fueled by the then-conventional means. The dynamic picture
of the future is indeed awesome, and there is every indication that
that characteristic has the potential of endless expansion. <b>So how
is it that on so richly endowed a Garden of Eden as this world of
ours we have only been able to make of it a hell on earth for vast
numbers of people?</b></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The answers are simple: we have
permitted, nay we have even more
than that, encouraged, the gross misallocation of resources and a
viciously wicked distribution of wealth, and we choose to be governed
by those whom we, in our ignorance, have elected. As the principal
focus of this paper is on inflation, let us give this process its
full name which is fiat money inflation and let us define this as the
process by which a government continues the issuance of irredeemable
paper money until the quantity so issued finally renders it
worthless.
