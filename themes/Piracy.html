    remember, how over and over again I have heard all questionings of slavery

    as much a crime as to take away his horse without payment. And whoever does
    not remember that far back, let him look over American literature previous
    to the war, and say whether, if the business of piracy had been a flourishing
    business, it would have lacked defenders? Let him say whether any proposal
    to stop the business of piracy without compensating the pirates would not
    have been denounced at first as a proposal to set aside vested rights? </span>... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>2. THE TWO KINDS OF DIRECT TAXATION</strong><br />
    <br />
Direct taxes fall into two general classes: (1) Taxes that are levied upon men
in proportion to their <em>ability to pay</em>, and (2) taxes that are levied
in proportion to the <em>benefits received</em> by the tax-payer from the public.
Income taxes are the principal ones of the first class, though probate and inheritance
taxes would rank high. The single tax is the only important one of the second
class.</p>
  <p> There should be no difficulty in choosing between the two.<strong> To tax
      in proportion to ability to pay, regardless of benefits received, is in
      accord with no
    principle of just government; it is a device of piracy.</strong> The single tax, therefore,
    as the only important tax in proportion to benefits, is the ideal tax.</p>
  <p> But here we encounter two plausible objections. One arises from the mistaken
    but common notion that men are not taxed in proportion to benefits unless
    they pay taxes upon every kind of property they own that comes under the
    protection of government; the other is founded in the assumption that it
    is impossible to measure the value of the public benefits that each individual
    enjoys. Though the first of these objections ostensibly accepts the doctrine
    of taxation according to benefits,12 yet, as it leads to attempts at taxation
    in proportion to wealth, it, like the other, is really a plea for the <strong>piratical</strong>    doctrine of taxation according to ability to pay. The two objections stand
    or fall together.</p>
  <p>Let it once be perceived that the value of the service which government
    renders to each individual would be justly measured by the single tax, and
    neither objection would any longer have weight. We should then no more think
    of taxing people in proportion to their wealth or ability to pay, regardless
    of the benefits they receive from government than an honest merchant would
    think of charging his customers in proportion to their wealth or ability
    to pay, regardless of the value of the goods they bought of him.&quot; 13</p>

  <p>Clarence Darrow: <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">How to Abolish
      Unfair Taxation</a> (1913)</p>
  <p>Everybody nowadays is anxious to help do something for the poor, especially
    they who are on the backs of the poor; they will do anything that is not
    fundamental. Nobody ever dreams of giving the poor a chance to help themselves.
    The reformers in this state have passed a law prohibiting women from working
    more than eight hours in one day in certain industries &#8212; so much do
    women love to work that they must be stopped by law. If any benevolent heathen
    see fit to come here and do work, we send them to gaol or send them back
    where they came from.</p>
  <p>All these prohibitory laws are froth. You can only cure effects by curing
    the cause. Every sin and every wrong that exists in the world is the product
    of law, and you cannot cure it without curing the cause. Lawyers, as a class,
    are very stupid. What would you think of a doctor, who, finding a case of
    malaria, instead of draining the swamp, would send the patient to gaol, and
    leave the swamp where it is? We are seeking to improve conditions of life
    by improving symptoms.</p>
  <p>Land Basic</p>
  <p>No man created the earth, but to a large extent all take from the earth
    a portion of it and mould it into useful things for the use of man. Without
    land man cannot live; without access to it man cannot labor. First of all,
    he must have the earth, and this he cannot have access to until the single
    tax is applied. It has been proven by the history of the human race that
    the single tax does work, and that it will work as its advocates claim. For
    instance, man turned from Europe, filled with a population of the poor, and
    discovered the great continent of America. Here, when he could not get profitable
    employment, he went on the free land and worked for himself, and in those
    early days there were no problems of poverty, no wonderfully rich and no
    extremely poor &#8212; because there was cheap land. Men could go to work
    for themselves, and thus take the surplus off the labor market. There were
    no beggars in the early days. It was only when the landlord got in his work &#8212; when
    the earth monopoly was complete &#8212; that the great mass of men had to
    look to a boss for a job.</p>
  <p>All the remedial laws on earth can scarcely help the poor when the earth
    is monopolized. Men must live from the earth, they must till the soil, dig
    the coal and iron and cut down the forest. <strong>Wise men know it, and
    cunning men know it, and so a few have reached out their hands and grasped
    the earth;
    and they say, &quot;These mines of coal and iron, which it took nature ages
    and ages to store, belong to me; and no man can touch them until he sees
    fit to pay the tribute I demand&quot;.</strong></p>
  <p>Pirates Demand Tribute</p>
  <p>Nature prepared the earth for ages to make a mine of iron ore, which is
    so useful in civilized life. It was here before man came, and will be here
    after he is gone, and yet a plundering, soulless, conscienceless band of
    pirates, called the steel trust, have taken possession of all the iron in
    America, and they say to every man who will use it: &quot;You must pay us
    tribute.&quot; And every time two dollars is paid for their product one dollar
    goes to labor, and one dollar is taken as plunder pure and simple, because
    of the foolish laws of man. They can take from the farmer and laborer all
    that they earn except enough to keep them alive still to toil for the monopolist.</p>
  <p>You
      may make eight-hour laws, you may make laws regulating sweat shops and
    factories, but so long as a few rich men own the earth, there will be a few
      rich and many millions of helpless poor. As population becomes more dense,
      the proportion of poor will increase. ... <a href="../docs/Darrow_How_to_abolish.html">read the whole speech</a></p>
