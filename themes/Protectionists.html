<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's Progress &amp; Poverty, Chapter 5: The Basic
    Cause of Poverty</a> (in the unabridged: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp051.html">Book
    V: The Problem Solved</a>) </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The great problem, of which these recurring seasons of industrial depression
      are but peculiar manifestations, is now, I think, fully solved, and the social
      phenomena which all over the civilized world appall the philanthropist and
      perplex the statesman, which hang with clouds the future of the most advanced
      races, and suggest doubts of the reality and ultimate goal of what we have
      fondly called progress, are now explained.</p>
  <p>The reason why, in spite of the increase of productive power, wages constantly
      tend to a minimum which will give but a bare living, is that, with increase
      in productive power, rent tends to even greater increase, thus producing a
      constant tendency to the forcing down of wages.</p>
  <p>Land being necessary to labor, and being reduced to private ownership, every
      increase in the productive power of labor but increases rent &#8212; the
      price that labor must pay for the opportunity to utilize its powers; and
      thus all
      the advantages gained by the march of progress go to the owners of land,
      and wages do not increase.*</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <font size="-1">*Whatever be the fact as to wages, the reader will, of
            course, recognize that higher money wages which merely balance higher living
            costs, are not to be reckoned as real wage increases. H.G.B</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The simple theory which I have outlined (if indeed it can be called a theory
      which is but the recognition of the most obvious relations) explains this conjunction
      of poverty with wealth, of low wages with high productive power, of degradation
      amid enlightenment, of virtual slavery in political liberty.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> It harmonizes, as results flowing from a general and inexorable law,
      facts otherwise most perplexing, and exhibits the sequence and relation
      between
          phenomena that without reference to it are diverse and contradictory.</li>
    <li> It explains why improvements which increase the productive power of
      labor and capital increase the reward of neither.</li>
    <li> It explains what is commonly called the conflict between labor and capital,
          while proving the real harmony of interest between them.</li>
    <li> <strong>It cuts the last inch of ground from under the fallacies of protection,
          while showing why free trade fails to benefit permanently the working
      classes.</strong></li>
    <li> It explains why want increases with abundance, and wealth tends to greater
          and greater aggregations.</li>
    <li> It explains the vice and misery which show themselves amid dense population,
          without attributing to the laws of the All-Wise and All-Beneficent
      defects which belong only to the shortsighted and selfish enactments of
      men.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The truth is self-evident. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/05_Basic_Cause_Poverty.htm">read

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What most strikingly shows how
opposed to Christianity is the
existing system of raising public revenue is its influence on thought.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Christianity teaches us that all
men are brethren; that their
true interests are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the
golden rule of life, that we should do to others as we would have
others do to us. But, out of the system of taxing the products and
processes of labor, and out of its effects in increasing the price of
what some have to sell and others must buy, has grown the theory of
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;Protection</span>,&#8221; which denies this
gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of
political economy, and proclaims laws for the nation utterly at
variance with His teaching.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>This theory
sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a
universal war of hostile tariffs; it teaches peoples that their
prosperity lies in imposing on the productions of other peoples
restrictions they do not wish imposed, on their own; and, instead of
the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood, it makes injury of
foreigners a civic virtue. ... 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The vice of Socialism in all its
degrees is its want of
radicalism, of going to the root.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Its advocates generally teach the
preposterous and degrading
doctrine that slavery was the first condition of labor. It assumes
that the tendency of wages to a minimum is the natural law, and seeks
to abolish wages; it assumes that the natural result of competition is
to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish competition by
restrictions, prohibitions, and extensions of governing power. Thus,
mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the state for
hitting it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not
worse are futile.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Associated though it is in many
places with democratic
aspiration, yet its essence is the same delusion to which the Children
of Israel yielded when, against the protest of their prophet, they
insisted on a king; the delusion that has everywhere corrupted
democracies and enthroned, tyrants &#8211; that power over the people can be
used for the benefit of the people; that there may be devised machinery
that through human agencies will secure for the management of
individual affairs more wisdom and mare virtue than the people
themselves possess. This superficiality and this tendency may be seen
in all the phases of Socialism.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Though not usually classed as
Socialists; both the Trade
Unionists and the Protectionists have the same essential character.
Take, for instance, Protectionism. The Protectionists seek by
governmental prohibitions or taxes on imports to regulate the industry
and control the exchanges of their country, so as they imagine, to
diversify home industries and prevent the competition of people of
other countries.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>What support Protectionism has,
beyond the mere selfish desire
of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their goods are
worth, springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not
consumption, is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than
money&#8217;s worth, and to sell more profitable than to buy; and, above all,
from a desire to limit competition, springing from an unanalysing
recognition of the phenomena that necessarily follow when men who have
the need to labor are deprived by monopoly of access to the natural
and indispensable element of all labor.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Its
methods involve the idea that Governments can more wisely
direct the expenditure of labor and the investment of capital than can
laborers and capitalists, and that the men who control Governments
will use this power for the general good and not in their own
interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict liberty, invent
crimes. They promote perjury, fraud, and corruption. And they would,
were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilisation
and reduce mankind to savagery....&nbsp;<a

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">The Condition of
    Labor &#8212; An Open Letter to Pope Leo XIII in response to <em>Rerum Novarum</em></a> <font size="-1">(1891)</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nor do we hesitate to say that this way of securing the equal right to the
    bounty of the Creator and the exclusive right to the products of labor is
    the way intended by God for raising public revenues. For we are not atheists,
    who deny God; nor semi-atheists, who deny that he has any concern in politics
    and legislation.</p>
  <p>It is true as you say &#8212; a salutary truth too often forgotten &#8212; that &#8220;man
    is older than the state, and he holds the right of providing for the life
    of his body prior to the formation of any state.&#8221; Yet, as you too perceive,
    it is also true that the state is in the divinely appointed order. For He
    who foresaw all things and provided for all things, foresaw and provided
    that with the increase of population and the development of industry the
    organization of human society into states or governments would become both
    expedient and necessary.</p>
  <p>No sooner does the state arise than, as we all know, it needs revenues.
    This need for revenues is small at first, while population is sparse, industry
    rude and the functions of the state few and simple. But with growth of population
    and advance of civilization the functions of the state increase and larger
    and larger revenues are needed.</p>
  <p>Now, He that made the world and placed man in it, He that pre-ordained civilization
    as the means whereby man might rise to higher powers and become more and
    more conscious of the works of his Creator, must have foreseen this increasing
    need for state revenues and have made provision for it. That is to say: The
    increasing need for public revenues with social advance, being a natural,
    God-ordained need, there must be a right way of raising them &#8212; some
    way that we can truly say is the way intended by God. It is clear that this
    right way of raising public revenues must accord with the moral law.</p>
  <p>Hence:</p>
  <p>It must not take from individuals what rightfully belongs to individuals.</p>
  <p>It must not give some an advantage over others, as by increasing the prices
    of what some have to sell and others must buy.</p>
  <p>It must not lead men into temptation, by requiring trivial oaths, by making
    it profitable to lie, to swear falsely, to bribe or to take bribes.</p>
  <p>It must not confuse the distinctions of right and wrong, and weaken the
    sanctions of religion and the state by creating crimes that are not sins,
    and punishing men for doing what in itself they have an undoubted right to
    do.</p>
  <p>It must not repress industry. It must not check commerce. It must not punish
    thrift. It must offer no impediment to the largest production and the fairest
    division of wealth.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to consider the taxes on the processes and products
    of industry by which through the civilized world public revenues are collected &#8212; the
    octroi duties that surround Italian cities with barriers; <strong>the monstrous
    customs duties that hamper intercourse between so-called Christian states</strong>; the taxes
    on occupations, on earnings, on investments, on the building of houses, on
    the cultivation of fields, on industry and thrift in all forms. Can these
    be the ways God has intended that governments should raise the means they
    need? Have any of them the characteristics indispensable in any plan we can
    deem a right one?</p>
  <p>All these taxes violate the moral law. They take by force what belongs to
    the individual alone; they give to the unscrupulous an advantage over the
    scrupulous; they have the effect, nay are largely intended, to increase the
    price of what some have to sell and others must buy; they corrupt government;
    they make oaths a mockery; they shackle commerce; they fine industry and
    thrift; they lessen the wealth that men might enjoy, and enrich some by impoverishing
    others.</p>
  <p>Yet what most strikingly shows how opposed to Christianity is this system
    of raising public revenues is its influence on thought.</p>
  <p>Christianity teaches us that all men are brethren; that their true interests
    are harmonious, not antagonistic. It gives us, as the golden rule of life,
    that we should do to others as we would have others do to us. <strong>But
    out of the system of taxing the products and processes of labor, and out
    of its
    effects in increasing the price of what some have to sell and others must
    buy, has grown the theory of &#8220;protection,&#8221; which denies this
    gospel, which holds Christ ignorant of political economy and proclaims laws
    of national well-being utterly at variance with his teaching. This theory
    sanctifies national hatreds; it inculcates a universal war of hostile tariffs;
    it teaches peoples that their prosperity lies in imposing on the productions
    of other peoples restrictions they do not wish imposed on their own; and
    instead of the Christian doctrine of man&#8217;s brotherhood it makes injury
    of foreigners a civic virtue.</strong></p>
  <p>&#8220;By their fruits ye shall know them.&#8221; Can anything more clearly
    show that to tax the products and processes of industry is not the way God
    intended public revenues to be raised?</p>
  <p>But to consider what we propose &#8212; the raising of public revenues by
    a single tax on the value of land irrespective of improvements &#8212; is
    to see that in all respects this does conform to the moral law.</p>
  <p>Let me ask your Holiness to keep in mind that the value we propose to tax,
    the value of land irrespective of improvements, does not come from any exertion
    of labor or investment of capital on or in it &#8212; the values produced
    in this way being values of improvement which we would exempt. The value
    of land irrespective of improvement is the value that attaches to land by
    reason of increasing population and social progress. This is a value that
    always goes to the owner as owner, and never does and never can go to the
    user; for if the user be a different person from the owner he must always
    pay the owner for it in rent or in purchase-money; while if the user be also
    the owner, it is as owner, not as user, that he receives it, and by selling
    or renting the land he can, as owner, continue to receive it after he ceases
    to be a user.</p>
  <p>Thus, taxes on land irrespective of improvement cannot lessen the rewards
    of industry, nor add to prices,* nor in any way take from the individual
    what belongs to the individual. They can take only the value that attaches
    to land by the growth of the community, and which therefore belongs to the
    community as a whole.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">* As to this point it may be well to add that all economists
        are agreed that taxes on land values irrespective of improvement or use &#8212; or
        what in the terminology of political economy is styled rent, a term distinguished
        from the ordinary use of the word rent by being applied solely to payments
        for the use of land itself &#8212; must be paid by the owner and cannot
        be shifted by him on the user. To explain in another way the reason given
        in the text: Price is not determined by the will of the seller or the
        will of the buyer, but by the equation of demand and supply, and therefore
        as to things constantly demanded and constantly produced rests at a point
        determined by the cost of production &#8212; whatever tends to increase
        the cost of bringing fresh quantities of such articles to the consumer
        increasing price by checking supply, and whatever tends to reduce such
        cost decreasing price by increasing supply. Thus taxes on wheat or tobacco
        or cloth add to the price that the consumer must pay, and thus the cheapening
        in the cost of producing steel which improved processes have made in
        recent years has greatly reduced the price of steel. But land has no
        cost of production, since it is created by God, not produced by man.
        Its price therefore is fixed &#8212;</font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font size="-1">1 (monopoly rent), where land is held in close monopoly,
          by what the owners can extract from the users under penalty of deprivation
          and consequently of starvation, and amounts to all that common labor
          can earn on it beyond what is necessary to life;<br>
        2 (economic rent proper), where there is no special monopoly, by what
        the particular land will yield to common labor over and above what may
        be had by like expenditure and exertion on land having no special advantage
        and for which no rent is paid; and,<br>
        3 (speculative rent, which is a species of monopoly rent, telling particularly
        in selling price), by the expectation of future increase of value from
        social growth and improvement, which expectation causing landowners to
        withhold land at present prices has the same effect as combination.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font size="-1">Taxes on land values or economic rent can therefore never
        be shifted by the landowner to the land-user, since they in no wise increase
        the demand for land or enable landowners to check supply by withholding
        land from use. Where rent depends on mere monopolization, a case I mention
        because rent may in this way be demanded for the use of land even before
        economic or natural rent arises, the taking by taxation of what the landowners
        were able to extort from labor could not enable them to extort any more,
        since laborers, if not left enough to live on, will die. So, in the case
        of economic rent proper, to take from the landowners the premiums they
        receive, would in no way increase the superiority of their land and the
        demand for it. While, so far as price is affected by speculative rent,
        to compel the landowners to pay taxes on the value of land whether they
        were getting any income from it or not, would make it more difficult
        for them to withhold land from use; and to tax the full value would not
        merely destroy the power but the desire to do so.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>To take land values for the state, abolishing all taxes on the products
    of labor, would therefore leave to the laborer the full produce of labor;
    to the individual all that rightfully belongs to the individual. It would
    impose no burden on industry, no check on commerce, no punishment on thrift;
    it would secure the largest production and the fairest distribution of wealth,
    by leaving men free to produce and to exchange as they please, without any
    artificial enhancement of prices; and by taking for public purposes a value
    that cannot be carried off, that cannot be hidden, that of all values is
    most easily ascertained and most certainly and cheaply collected, it would
    enormously lessen the number of officials, dispense with oaths, do away with
    temptations to bribery and evasion, and abolish man-made crimes in themselves
    innocent.</p>
  <p>But, further: That God has intended the state to obtain the revenues it
    needs by the taxation of land values is shown by the same order and degree
    of evidence that shows that God has intended the milk of the mother for the
    nourishment of the babe.</p>
  <p>See how close is the analogy. In that primitive condition ere the need for
    the state arises there are no land values. The products of labor have value,
    but in the sparsity of population no value as yet attaches to land itself.
    But as increasing density of population and increasing elaboration of industry
    necessitate the organization of the state, with its need for revenues, value
    begins to attach to land. As population still increases and industry grows
    more elaborate, so the needs for public revenues increase. And at the same
    time and from the same causes land values increase. The connection is invariable.
    The value of things produced by labor tends to decline with social development,
    since the larger scale of production and the improvement of processes tend
    steadily to reduce their cost. But the value of land on which population
    centers goes up and up. Take Rome or Paris or London or New York or Melbourne.
    Consider the enormous value of land in such cities as compared with the value
    of land in sparsely settled parts of the same countries. To what is this
    due? Is it not due to the density and activity of the populations of those
    cities &#8212; to the very causes that require great public expenditure for
    streets, drains, public buildings, and all the many things needed for the
    health, convenience and safety of such great cities? See how with the growth
    of such cities the one thing that steadily increases in value is land; how
    the opening of roads, the building of railways, the making of any public
    improvement, adds to the value of land. Is it not clear that here is a natural
    law &#8212; that is to say a tendency willed by the Creator? Can it mean
    anything else than that He who ordained the state with its needs has in the
    values which attach to land provided the means to meet those needs? <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>I have said enough to show your Holiness the injustice into which you fall
    in classing us, who in seeking virtually to abolish private property in land
    seek more fully to secure the true rights of property, with those whom you
    speak of as socialists, who wish to make all property common. But you also
    do injustice to the socialists.<br>
    <br>
    There are many, it is true, who feeling bitterly the monstrous wrongs of
    the present distribution of wealth are animated only by a blind hatred of
    the rich and a fierce desire to destroy existing social adjustments. This
    class is indeed only less dangerous than those who proclaim that no social
    improvement is needed or is possible. But it is not fair to confound with
    them those who, however mistakenly, propose definite schemes of remedy.</p>
  <p>The socialists, as I understand them, and as the term has come to apply
    to anything like a definite theory and not to be vaguely and improperly used
    to include all who desire social improvement, do not, as you imply, seek
    the abolition of all private property. Those who do this are properly called
    communists. What the socialists seek is the state assumption of capital (in
    which they vaguely and erroneously include land), or more properly speaking,
    of large capitals, and state management and direction of at least the larger
    operations of industry. In this way they hope to abolish interest, which
    they regard as a wrong and an evil; to do away with the gains of exchangers,
    speculators, contractors and middlemen, which they regard as waste; to do
    away with the wage system and secure general cooperation; and to prevent
    competition, which they deem the fundamental cause of the impoverishment
    of labor. The more moderate of them, without going so far, go in the same
    direction, and seek some remedy or palliation of the worst forms of poverty
    by government regulation. The essential character of socialism is that it
    looks to the extension of the functions of the state for the remedy of social
    evils; that it would substitute regulation and direction for competition;
    and intelligent control by organized society for the free play of individual
    desire and effort.</p>
  <p><strong>Though not usually classed as socialists, both the trades-unionists
      and the protectionists have the same essential character. </strong>The trades-unionists
    seek the increase of wages, the reduction of working-hours and the general
    improvement in the condition of wage-workers, by organizing them into guilds
    or associations which shall fix the rates at which they will sell their labor;
    shall deal as one body with employers in case of dispute; shall use on occasion
    their necessary weapon, the strike; and shall accumulate funds for such purposes
    and for the purpose of assisting members when on a strike, or (sometimes)
    when out of employment. <strong>The protectionists seek by governmental prohibitions
    or taxes on imports to regulate the industry and control the exchanges of
    each country, so as, they imagine, to diversify home industries and prevent
    the competition of people of other countries.</strong> <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>With the socialists we have some points of agreement, for we recognize fully
    the social nature of man and believe that all monopolies should be held and
    governed by the state. In these, and in directions where the general health,
    knowledge, comfort and convenience might be improved, we, too, would extend
    the functions of the state.</p>
  <p>But it seems to us the vice of socialism in all its degrees is its want
    of radicalism, of going to the root. It takes its theories from those who
    have sought to justify the impoverishment of the masses, and its advocates
    generally teach the preposterous and degrading doctrine that slavery was
    the first condition of labor. It assumes that the tendency of wages to a
    minimum is the natural law, and seeks to abolish wages; it assumes that the
    natural result of competition is to grind down workers, and seeks to abolish
    competition by restrictions, prohibitions and extensions of governing power.
    Thus mistaking effects for causes, and childishly blaming the stone for hitting
    it, it wastes strength in striving for remedies that when not worse are futile.
    Associated though it is in many places with democratic aspiration, yet its
    essence is the same delusion to which the children of Israel yielded when
    against the protest of their prophet they insisted on a king; the delusion
    that has everywhere corrupted democracies and enthroned tyrants &#8212; that
    power over the people can be used for the benefit of the people; that there
    may be devised machinery that through human agencies will secure for the
    management of individual affairs more wisdom and more virtue than the people
    themselves possess.    This superficiality and this tendency may be seen in all the phases of socialism.</p>
  <p><strong>Take, for instance, protectionism. What support it has, beyond the
      mere selfish desire of sellers to compel buyers to pay them more than their
      goods
    are worth, springs from such superficial ideas as that production, not consumption,
    is the end of effort; that money is more valuable than money&#8217;s-worth,
    and to sell more profitable than to buy; and above all from a desire to limit
    competition, springing from an unanalyzing recognition of the phenomena that
    necessarily follow when men who have the need to labor are deprived by monopoly
    of access to the natural and indispensable element of all labor. Its methods
    involve the idea that governments can more wisely direct the expenditure
    of labor and the investment of capital than can laborers and capitalists,
    and that the men who control governments will use this power for the general
    good and not in their own interests. They tend to multiply officials, restrict
    liberty, invent crimes. They promote perjury, fraud and corruption. And they
    would, were the theory carried to its logical conclusion, destroy civilization
    and reduce mankind to savagery.</strong></p>
  <p>Take trades-unionism. While within narrow lines trades-unionism promotes
    the idea of the mutuality of interests, and often helps to raise courage
    and further political education, and while it has enabled limited bodies
    of working-men to improve somewhat their condition, and gain, as it were,
    breathing-space, yet it takes no note of the general causes that determine
    the conditions of labor, and strives for the elevation of only a small part
    of the great body by means that cannot help the rest. Aiming at the restriction
    of competition &#8212; the limitation of the right to labor, its methods
    are like those of an army, which even in a righteous cause are subversive
    of liberty and liable to abuse, while its weapon, the strike, is destructive
    in its nature, both to combatants and non-combatants, being a form of passive
    war. To apply the principle of trades-unions to all industry, as some dream
    of doing, would be to enthrall men in a caste system.</p>
  <p>Or take even such moderate measures as the limitation of working-hours and
    of the labor of women and children. They are superficial in looking no further
    than to the eagerness of men and women and little children to work unduly,
    and in proposing forcibly to restrain overwork while utterly ignoring its
    cause &#8212; the sting of poverty that forces human beings to it. And the
    methods by which these restraints must be enforced, multiply officials, interfere
    with personal liberty, tend to corruption, and are liable to abuse.</p>
  <p>As for thoroughgoing socialism, which is the more to be honored as having
    the courage of its convictions, it would carry these vices to full expression.
    Jumping to conclusions without effort to discover causes, it fails to see
    that oppression does not come from the nature of capital, but from the wrong
    that robs labor of capital by divorcing it from land, and that creates a
    fictitious capital that is really capitalized monopoly. It fails to see that
    it would be impossible for capital to oppress labor were labor free to the
    natural material of production; that the wage system in itself springs from
    mutual convenience, being a form of cooperation in which one of the parties
    prefers a certain to a contingent result; and that what it calls the &#8220;iron
    law of wages&#8221; is not the natural law of wages, but only the law of
    wages in that unnatural condition in which men are made helpless by being
    deprived of the materials for life and work. It fails to see that what it
    mistakes for the evils of competition are really the evils of restricted
    competition &#8212; are due to a one-sided competition to which men are forced
    when deprived of land. While its methods, the organization of men into industrial
    armies, the direction and control of all production and exchange by governmental
    or semi-governmental bureaus, would, if carried to full expression, mean
    Egyptian despotism.</p>
  <p>We differ from the socialists in our diagnosis of the evil and we differ
    from them as to remedies. We have no fear of capital, regarding it as the
    natural handmaiden of labor; we look on interest in itself as natural and
    just; we would set no limit to accumulation, nor impose on the rich any burden
    that is not equally placed on the poor; we see no evil in competition, but
    deem unrestricted competition to be as necessary to the health of the industrial
    and social organism as the free circulation of the blood is to the health
    of the bodily organism &#8212; to be the agency whereby the fullest cooperation
    is to be secured. We would simply take for the community what belongs to
    the community, the value that attaches to land by the growth of the community;
    leave sacredly to the individual all that belongs to the individual; and,
    treating necessary monopolies as functions of the state, abolish all restrictions
    and prohibitions save those required for public health, safety, morals and
    convenience.</p>
  <p>But the fundamental difference &#8212; the difference I ask your Holiness
    specially to note, is in this: socialism in all its phases looks on the evils
    of our civilization as springing from the inadequacy or inharmony of natural
    relations, which must be artificially organized or improved. In its idea
    there devolves on the state the necessity of intelligently organizing the
    industrial relations of men; the construction, as it were, of a great machine
    whose complicated parts shall properly work together under the direction
    of human intelligence. This is the reason why socialism tends toward atheism.
    Failing to see the order and symmetry of natural law, it fails to recognize
    God.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, we who call ourselves single-tax men (a name which expresses
    merely our practical propositions) see in the social and industrial relations
    of men not a machine which requires construction, but an organism which needs
    only to be suffered to grow. We see in the natural social and industrial
    laws such harmony as we see in the adjustments of the human body, and that
    as far transcends the power of man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct
    as it is beyond man&#8217;s intelligence to order and direct the vital movements
    of his frame. We see in these social and industrial laws so close a relation
    to the moral law as must spring from the same Authorship, and that proves
    the moral law to be the sure guide of man where his intelligence would wander
    and go astray. Thus, to us, all that is needed to remedy the evils of our
    time is to do justice and give freedom. This is the reason why our beliefs
    tend toward, nay are indeed the only beliefs consistent with a firm and reverent
    faith in God, and with the recognition of his law as the supreme law which
    men must follow if they would secure prosperity and avoid destruction. This
    is the reason why to us political economy only serves to show the depth of
    wisdom in the simple truths which common people heard gladly from the lips
    of Him of whom it was said with wonder, &#8220;Is not this the Carpenter
    of Nazareth?&#8221;</p>
  <p>And it is because that in what we propose &#8212; the securing to all men
    of equal natural opportunities for the exercise of their powers and the removal
    of all legal restriction on the legitimate exercise of those powers &#8212; we
    see the conformation of human law to the moral law, that we hold with confidence
    that this is not merely the sufficient remedy for all the evils you so strikingly
    portray, but that it is the only possible remedy. ... <a href="../HG/the_condition_of_labor.htm">read

<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">In Liverpool: The Financial
    Reform Meeting at the Liverpool Rotunda </a>(1889)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is a deep pleasure for me to be here tonight, the guest of the Liverpool
      Financial Reform Association, and to speak at my last meeting in England with
      my honored countrymen, [including] William Lloyd Garrison of Massachusetts.
      (Cheers)</p>
  <p>You are right, Mr. Garrison. The true republic, the American Republic that
      we hope for and pray is not yet here. (Hear, hear) A poor thing is a republic
      where the tramp jostles the millionaire, where liberty is mocked by a paternal
      system of interference with human rights, where, under the pretext of protecting
      labor, labor is robbed! (Cheers) And here, in the motherland, in the United
      States, in Australia and New Zealand, we of the English tongue find the
    same difficulties confronting us. Liberty is not yet here; but, thank God,
    she is
      coming. (Cheers) Not merely the American Republic, not merely the Republic
      of the Southern Cross, not merely the Republic of Great Britain and Ireland
      is it that we see in the future, but that great republic that some day
    is to confederate the English speaking people everywhere (loud cheers) that
    is to
      bring a grander &quot;Roman peace&quot; to the world. (A voice: More than that.)
      Aye, more than that &#8212; that is to bring civilization as much higher,
      as much better than what we call a Christian civilization, as this is higher
      and
      better than barbarism. And already, in meetings such as this, it seems
      to me that I feel an earnest [presentiment] of the coming time when we
      of one blood
      and one speech are also to be one. (Cheers) For the same principles, for
      the same great cause that we stand in the United States we stand here.
      And in a
      little over a week from now I will be standing on an American platform
      speaking to men whose hearts are beating in the same cause in which we
      are engaged here.
      (Cheers)</p>
  <p>Our little local politics may differ; our greater politics are one and the
      same. We have the same evils to redress, the same truth to propagate, the same
      end to seek.</p>
  <p>And that end, what is it but liberty? (Hear, hear) He who listens to the voice
      of Freedom, she will lead and lead him on. Before I was born, before our friend
      there was born, there was in a southern city of the United States a young printer
      bearing the name William Lloyd Garrison. (Cheers) He saw around him the iniquity
      of negro slavery. (Hear, hear) The voice of the oppressed cried to him and
      would not let him rest, and he took up the cross. He became the great apostle
      of human liberty, and today in American cities that once hooted and stoned
      him there are now statues raised to William Lloyd Garrison.</p>
  <p>He began as a protectionist. As he moved on he saw that liberty meant something
      more than simply the abolition of chattel slavery. He saw that liberty also
      meant, not merely the right to freely labor for oneself, but the right to freely
      exchange one's production, and, from a protectionist, William Lloyd Garrison
      became a free trader. (Cheers)</p>
  <p>And now, when the first is gone, the second comes forward, to take one further
      step to realize that for perfect freedom there must also be freedom in the
      use of natural opportunities. (Hear, hear, and cheers)</p>
  <p>We have come . . . to the same point by converging lines. Why is freedom
    of trade good? Simply that trade &#8212; exchange &#8212; is but a mode of production.
      Therefore, to secure full free trade we must also secure freedom to the natural
      opportunities of production. (Hear, hear) Our production&#8212;what is it?
      We produce from what? From land. All human production consists but in working
      up the raw materials that we find in nature &#8212; consists simply in changing
      in place, or in form, that matter which we call land. To free production there
      must be no monopoly of the natural element. Even in our methods we agree primarily
      on this essential point &#8212; that everyone ought to be free to exert
      his labor, to retain or to exchange its fruits, unhampered by restrictions,
      unvexed
      by the tax gatherer. (Hear, hear) . . .</p>
  <p>Chattel slavery, thank God, is abolished at last. Nowhere, where the American
      flag flies, can one man be bought, or sold, or held by another. (Cheers) But
      a great struggle still lies before us now. Chattel slavery is gone; industrial
      slavery remains. The effort, the aim of the abolitionists of this time is to
      abolish industrial slavery. (Cheers)</p>
  <p>The free trade movement in England was a necessary step in this direction.
      The men who took part in it did more than they knew. Striking at restrictions
      in the form of protection, aiming at emancipating trade by reducing tariffs
      to a minimum for revenue only, they aroused a spirit that yet goes further.
      There sits, in the person of my friend, Mr. Briggs [Thomas Briggs], one
    of the men of that time, one of the men who, not stopping, has always aimed
    a
      a larger freedom, one of the men who today hails what we in the United
    States call the single tax movement, as the natural outcome and successor
    of the movement
      which Richard Cobden led.39 (A voice: &quot;Three cheers for Mr. Briggs,&quot; and
      cheers)</p>
  <p>And here, in your Financial Reform Association, you have the society that
      has best preserved the best spirit of that time, that has never cried &quot;Hold!&quot; [and]
      that has always striven to move forward to a fuller and a brighter day.
      (Hear, hear)</p>
  <p>In the United States, carried away by the heat of the great struggle, we
    allowed protection to build itself up. We have to now make the fight that
    you have
      partially won over here; but, in making that fight, we make the fight for
    full and absolute free trade. I don't believe that protection can ever be
    abolished
      in the United States until a majority of the people have been brought to
    see the absurdity and the wickedness of all tariffs, whether protective or
    for
      revenue only (hear, hear); have been brought to realize the deep truth
    of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man; have been led to see
    what Mr.
      Garrison has so eloquently said, that the interests of mankind are harmonious,
      not antagonistic, that one nation cannot profit at the expense of another,
      but that every people is benefited by the advance of other peoples &#8212; (cheers) &#8212; until
      we shall aim at a free trade that will enable the citizen of England to
      enter the ports of the United States as freely as today, the citizen of
      Massachusetts
      crosses into New York. (Cheers) ... <a href="../HG/Liverpool_1889.htm">read

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Go over to Europe; travel

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Just as you get to see that

trunks or in your carpet sacks, or rolled up in your shawl straps;
and you take that oath. The United States of America compels you to.
But the United States of America don't leave you there. The very next

box or package and to look through it for things dutiable, unless, as
may be, his eyes are stopped by a greenback. Well, now, everyone who
has made that visit does know that most passengers have things
dutiable; and I notice that the protectionists have them fully as

to benefit the whole people, and what has been the result? A system

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Sources of Great Wealth</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> An acquaintance of mine died in San Francisco
    recently, leaving $4,000,000, which will go to heirs to be looked up in England.
    I have known many men more industrious, more skilful, more temperate than
    he -- men who did not or who will not leave a cent. This man did not get
    his wealth by his industry, skill or temperance. He no more produced it than
    did those lucky relations in England who may now do nothing for the rest
    of their lives. He became rich by getting hold of a piece of land in the
    early days, which, as San Francisco grew, became very valuable. His wealth
    represented not what he had earned, but what the monopoly of this bit of
    the earth's surface enabled him to appropriate of the earnings of others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> A man died in Pittsburgh, the other day,
    leaving $3,000,000. He may or may not have been particularly industrious,
    skilful and economical, but it was not by virtue of these qualities that
    he got so rich. It was because he went to Washington and helped lobby through
    a bill which, by way of "protecting American workmen against the pauper labor
    of Europe," gave him the advantage of a sixty-per-cent, tariff. To the day
    of his death he was a stanch protectionist, and said free trade would ruin
    our "infant industries." Evidently the $3,000,000 which he was enabled to
    lay by from his own little cherub of an "infant industry" did not represent
    what he had added to production. It was the advantage given him by the tariff
    that enabled him to scoop it up from other people's earnings.</small></p>
<center style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <small>"Beneath all political problems lies the social problem of the distribution
  of wealth."</small>
</center>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> This element of monopoly, of appropriation
    and spoliation will, when we come to analyze them, be found largely to account
    for all great fortunes....</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Take the great Vanderbilt fortune. The
    first Vanderbilt was a boatman who earned money by hard work and saved it.
    But it was not working and saving that enabled him to leave such an enormous
    fortune. It was spoliation and monopoly. As soon as he got money enough he
    used it as a club to extort from others their earnings. He ran off opposition
    lines and monopolized routes of steamboat travel. Then he went into railroads,
    pursuing the same tactics. The Vanderbilt fortune no more comes from working
    and saving than did the fortune that Captain Kidd buried.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the great Gould fortune. Mr. Gould
    might have got his first little start by superior industry and superior self-denial.
    But it is not that which has made him the master of a hundred millions. It
    was by wrecking railroads, buying judges, corrupting legislatures, getting
    up rings and pools and combinations to raise or depress stock values and
    transportation rates. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> So, like wise, of the great fortunes which
    the Pacific railroads have created. They have been made by lobbying through
    profligate donations of lands, bonds and subsidies, by the operations of
    Credit Mobilier and Contract and Finance Companies, by monopolizing and gouging.
    And so of fortunes made by such combinations as the Standard Oil Company,
    the Bessemer Steel Ring, the Whisky Tax Ring, the Lucifer Match Ring, and
    the various rings for the "protection of the American workman from the pauper
    labor of Europe." </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Or take the fortunes made out of successful
    patents. Like that element in so many fortunes that comes from the increased
    value of land, these result from monopoly, pure and simple. And though I
    am not now discussing the expediency of patent laws, it may be observed,
    in passing, that in the vast majority of cases the men who make fortunes
    out of patents are not the men who make the inventions. </small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> Through all great fortunes, and, in fact,
    through nearly all acquisitions that in these days can fairly be termed fortunes,
    these elements of monopoly, of spoliation, of gambling run. The head of one
    of the largest manufacturing firms in the United States said to me recently, "It
    is not on our ordinary business that we make our money; it is where we can
    get a monopoly." And this, I think, is generally true.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;<b>The Evils of Monopolists</b></small> <br>
  <small> Consider the important part in building up fortunes which the increase
  of land values has had, and is having, in the United States. This is, of course,
  monopoly, pure and simple. When land increases in value it does not mean that
  its owner has added to the general wealth. The owner may never have seen the
  land or done aught to improve it. He may, and often does, live in a distant
  city or in another country. Increase of land values simply means that the owners,
  by virtue of their appropriation of something that existed before man was,
  have the power of taking a larger share of the wealth produced by other people's
  labor. Consider how much the monopolies created and the advantages given to
  the unscrupulous by the tariff and by our system of internal taxation -- how
  much the railroad (a business in its nature a monopoly), telegraph, gas, water
  and other similar monopolies, have done to concentrate wealth; how special
  rates, pools, combinations, corners, stock-watering and stock-gambling, the
  destructive use of wealth in driving off or buying off opposition which the
  public must finally pay for, and many other things which these will suggest,
  have operated to build up large fortunes, and it will at least appear that
  the unequal distribution of wealth is due in great measure to sheer spoliation;
  that the reason why those who work hard get so little, while so many who work
  little get so much, is, in very large measure, that the earnings of the one
  class are, in one way or another, filched away from them to swell the incomes
  of the other. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> That individuals are constantly making
    their way from the ranks of those who get less than their earnings to the
    ranks of those who get more than their earnings, no more proves this state
    of things right than the fact that merchant sailors were constantly becoming
    pirates and participating in the profits of piracy, would prove that piracy
    was right and that no effort should be made to suppress it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> I am not denouncing the rich, nor seeking,
    by speaking of these things, to excite envy and hatred; but if we would get
    a clear understanding of social problems, we must recognize the fact that
    it is due to monopolies which we permit and create, to advantages which we
    give one man over another, to methods of extortion sanctioned by law and
    by public opinion, that some men are enabled to get so enormously rich while
    others remain so miserably poor. If we look around us and note the elements
    of monopoly, extortion and spoliation which go to the building up of all,
    or nearly all, fortunes, we see on the one hand now disingenuous are those
    who preach to us that there is nothing wrong in social relations and that
    the inequalities in the distribution of wealth spring from the inequalities
    of human nature; and on the other hand, we see how wild are those who talk
    as though capital were a public enemy, and propose plans for arbitrarily
    restricting the acquisition of wealth. <strong>Capital is a good; the capitalist
    is a helper, if he is not also a monopolist. We can safely let any one get
    as rich as he can if he will not despoil others in doing so.</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small> There are deep wrongs in the present constitution
    of society, but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor
    in those social laws which are as truly the laws of the Creator as are the
    laws of the physical universe.&nbsp; They are wrongs resulting from bad adjustments
    which it is within our power to amend. The ideal social state is not that
    in which each gets an equal amount of wealth, but in which each gets in proportion
    to his contribution to the general stock. And in such a social state there
    would not be less incentive to exertion than now; there would be far more
    incentive. Men will be more industrious and more moral, better workmen and
    better citizens, if each takes his earnings and carries them home to his
    family, than where they put their earnings in a "pot" and gamble for them
    until some have far more than they could have earned, and others have little
    or nothing.&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

<p>Henry George: <em><a href="HG/PP/02_b1_c1_current_doctrine_wages.htm">Progress &amp; Poverty:</a></em><a href="HG/PP/01_introductory_the_problem.htm"> The
    Current Doctrine of Wages &#8212; Its Insufficiency</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><B>What gives to the fallacies of protection such a tenacious hold, in spite
      of their evident inconsistencies and absurdities, is the idea that the sum
      to be distributed in wages is in each community a fixed one, which the competition
      of "foreign labor" must still further
  subdivide. </B>The same idea underlies most of the theories which aim at the
  abolition of interest and the restriction of competition, as the means whereby
  the share of the laborer in the general wealth can be increased; and it crops
  out in every direction among those who are not thoughtful enough to have any
  theories, as may be seen in the columns of newspapers and the debates of legislative
  bodies.</p>
  <p>And yet, widely accepted and deeply rooted as it is, it seems to me that <B>this
      theory does not tally with obvious facts.</B> For, if wages depend upon the
      ratio between the amount of labor seeking employment and the amount of capital
      devoted to its employment, the relative scarcity or abundance of one factor
      must mean the relative abundance or scarcity of the other. Thus, capital
      must be relatively abundant where wages are high, and relatively scarce where
      wages are low. Now, as the capital used in paying wages must largely consist
      of the capital constantly seeking investment, the current rate of interest
      must be the measure of its relative abundance or scarcity. So, if it be true
      that wages depend upon the ratio between the amount of labor seeking employment
      and the capital devoted to its employment, then high wages, the mark of the
      relative scarcity of labor, must be accompanied by low interest, the mark
      of the relative abundance of capital, and reversely, low wages must be accompanied
      by high interest.</p>
  <p>This is not the fact, but the contrary. Eliminating from interest the element
    of insurance, and regarding only interest proper, or the return for the use
    of capital, is it not a general truth that interest is high where and when
    wages are high, and low where and when wages are low? Both wages and interest
    have been higher in the United States than in England, in the Pacific than
    in the Atlantic States. ... <a href="HG/PP/02_b1_c1_current_doctrine_wages.htm">read

THE protection of the masses has in all times been the pretense of tyranny &#8212; the
plea of monarchy, of aristocracy, of special privilege of every kind. The slave
owners justified slavery as protecting the slaves. British misrule in Ireland
is upheld on the ground that it is for the protection of the Irish. But, whether
under a monarchy or under a republic, is there an instance in the history of
the world in which the "protection" of the laboring masses has not meant their
oppression? The protection that those who have got the law-making power into
their hands have given labor, has at best always been the protection that man
gives to cattle &#8212; he protects them that he may use and eat them. &#8212; <em>Protection

IT is never intimated that the land-owner or the capitalist needs protection.
They, it is always assumed, can take care of themselves. It is only the poor
workingman who must be protected. What is labor that it should so need protection?
Is not labor the creator of capital, the producer of all wealth? Is it not the
men who labor that feed and clothe all others? Is it not true, as has been said,
that the three great orders of society are "workingmen, beggarmen, and thieves?" How,
then, does it come that workingmen alone need protection? &#8212; <em>Protection

WHAT should we think of human laws framed for the government of a country which
should compel each family to keep constantly on their guard against every other
family, to expend a large part of their time and labor in preventing exchanges
with their neighbors, and to seek their own prosperity by opposing the natural
efforts of other families to become prosperous? Yet the protective theory implies
that laws such as these have been imposed by the Creator upon the families of
men who tenant this earth. It implies that by virtue of social laws, as immutable
as the physical laws, each nation must stand jealously on guard against every
other nation and erect artificial obstacles to national intercourse.&#8212; <em>Protection
or Free Trade</em>, Chapter 4: Protection as a Universal Need&nbsp; <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT4.html">econlib </a><br>
            <br>
TO attempt to make a nation prosperous by preventing it from buying from other
nations is as absurd as it would be to attempt to make a man prosperous by preventing
him from buying from other men. How this operates in the case of the individual
we can see from that practice which, since its application in the Irish land
agitation, has come to be called "boycotting." Captain Boycott, upon whom has
been thrust the unenviable fame of having his name turned into a verb, was in
fact "protected." He had a protective tariff of the most efficient kind built
around him by a neighborhood decree more effective than act of Parliament. No
one would sell him labor, no one would sell him milk or bread or meat or any
service or commodity whatever. But instead of growing prosperous, this much-protected
man had to fly from a place where his own market was thus reserved for his own
productions. What protectionists ask us to do to ourselves in reserving our home
market for home producers, is in kind what the Land Leaguers did to Captain Boycott.
They ask us to boycott ourselves. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

WHEN not caused by artificial obstacles, any tendency in trade to take a certain
course is proof that it ought to take that course, and restrictions are harmful
because they restrict, and in proportion as they restrict. To assert that the
way for men to become healthy and strong is for them to force into their stomachs
what nature tries to reject, to regulate the play of their lungs by bandages,
or to control the circulation of their blood by ligatures, would be not a whit
more absurd than to assert that the way for nations to become rich is for them
to restrict the natural tendency to trade. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em>,

<p>Judge Samuel Seabury: <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">An Address delivered
    upon the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>WE are met to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Henry George.
      We meet, therefore, in a spirit of joy and thanksgiving for the great life
      which he devoted to the service of humanity. To very few of the children of
      men is it given to act the part of a great teacher who makes an outstanding
      contribution toward revealing the basic principles to which human society must
      adhere if it is to walk in the way which leads to freedom. This Henry George
      did, and in so doing he expressed himself with a clarity of thought and diction
      which has rarely been surpassed.</p>
  <p>The second principle to which I wish to refer is Henry George's advocacy
    of freedom of trade among the nations &#8212; not free trade introduced overnight,
      but freedom of trade as an end toward which the nations should move. When he
      wrote his great work on &quot;Protection or Free Trade,&quot; he demolished
      the protectionist argument and in chapter after chapter he showed the absurdities
      to which the protectionist principle led if carried to its logical conclusion.
      But even he, penetrating as his vision was, could not foresee that mankind
      was heading for a world order of economic nationalism and isolation, based
      upon the principle of protection carried to its utmost extreme. And yet
      that it is precisely the doctrine which is now currently accepted. If it
      becomes
      general, it can serve only to sow the seeds of destruction of that measure
      of civilization which we now have and force a lowering of the standard
      of living throughout the world.</p>
  <p>There are two ways by which the people of one nation can acquire the property
      or goods of the people of another nation. These are by war and by trade. There
      are no other methods. The present tendency among civilized people to outlaw
      trade must drive the states which prescribe such outlawry to acquire the property
      and goods of other peoples by war. Early in man's struggle for existence the
      resort to war was the common method adopted. With the advancement of civilization
      men resorted to trade as a practical substitute for war. The masses of men
      wish to trade with one another. The action of the states alone prevents them
      from so doing. In prohibiting trade, the state gives an importance to territorial
      boundaries which would not exist if freedom of trade existed. In accentuating
      the importance of mere boundary disputes, rather than assuring the right of
      peoples to trade with one another, the nations put the emphasis upon the precise
      issue which is, itself, one of the most prolific causes of war.</p>
  <p>All the great modern states are turning away from freedom of trade, and indeed,
      from trade itself, and forbidding their people the right to earn their own
      livelihood and to associate freely with one another in industry. In order to
      accomplish this end they are compelled to regiment the lives of their people
      under state bureaucracies and this can be accomplished only by a despotic state.
      If the powers of the modern states are to be augmented by conferring upon them
      the right to run all industry, despotism is inevitable. A dictator may, by
      reducing the standard of living and regimenting the people, run all industry
      within the state over which he rules, but a democracy, which, if it is to be
      true to itself, must preserve individual initiative, can not do so without
      transforming itself into a dictatorship. ... <a href="../docs/Seabury_HG100.htm">read the whole speech</a></p>
