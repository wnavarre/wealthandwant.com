<blockquote>
  <p>DWARFED into mere revenue reform the harmony and beauty of free trade are
    hidden; its moral force is lost; its power to remedy social evils cannot
    be shown, and the injustice and meanness of protection cannot be arraigned.
    The "international law of God" becomes a mere fiscal question which appeals
    only to the intellect and not to the heart, to the pocket and not to the
    conscience, and on which it is impossible to arouse the enthusiasm that is
    alone capable of contending with powerful interests. &#8212; <em>Protection
    or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter 29: Practical Politics - <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/George/grgPFT29.html">econlib</a> <br>
            <br>
THEY [the Physiocrats) were &#8212; what the so-called "English free-traders" who
have followed Adam Smith never yet have been &#8212; free traders in the full
sense of the term. In their practical proposition, the single tax, they proposed
the only means by which the free trade principle can ever be carried to its logical
conclusion &#8212; the freedom not merely of trade but of all other forms and
modes of production, with full freedom of access to the natural element which
is essential to all production. They were the authors of the motto that in the
English use of the phrase "Laissez faire!" "Let things alone," has been so emasculated
and perverted, but which on their lips was "Laissez faire, laissez aller!" "Clear
the ways and let things alone." This is said to come from the cry that in medieval
tournaments gave the signal for combat, The English motto which I take to come
closest to the spirit of the French phrase is, "A fair field and no favor!" &#8212; <em>The
Science of Political Economy</em><br>
            <br>
HERE is a traveler who, beset by robbers, has been left bound, blindfolded, and
gagged. Shall we stand in a knot about him and discuss whether to put a piece
of court-plaster on his cheek or a new patch on his coat, or shall we dispute
with each other as to what road he ought to take, and whether a bicycle, a tricycle,
a horse and wagon, or a railway, would best help him on? Should we not rather
postpone such discussion until we have cut the man's bonds? Then he can see for
himself, speak for himself, and help himself. Though with a scratched cheek and
a torn coat, he may get on his feet, and if he cannot find a conveyance to suit
him, he will at least be free to walk. <br>
            <br>
Very much like such a discussion is a good deal of that now going on over "the
social problem" &#8212; a discussion in which all sorts of inadequate and impossible
schemes are advocated to the neglect of the simple plan of removing restrictions
and giving Labor the use of its powers. &#8212; <em>Protection or Free Trade</em> &#8212; Chapter

<p>Dan Sullivan: <a href="../docs/Sullivan_RL.html">Are you a Real
      Libertarian, or a ROYAL Libertarian?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We call ourselves the "party of
principle," and we base property
rights on the principle that everyone is entitled to the fruits of
his labor. Land, however, is not the fruit of anyone's labor, and our
system of land tenure is based not on labor, but on decrees of
privilege issued from the state, called titles. In fact, the term
"real estate" is Middle English (originally French) for "royal
state." The "title" to land is the essence of the title of nobility,
and the root of noble privilege.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>The royal free lunch</b>
</small><br>
<small>When the state granted land titles to a fraction of the
population, it gave that fraction devices with which to levy, and
pocket, tolls on the fruits of the labor of others. Those without
land privileges must either buy or rent those privileges from the
people who received the grants or from their assignees. Thus the
state titles enable large landowners to collect a transfer payment,
or "free lunch" from the actual land users.</small></div>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>The widow is gathering
nettles for her children's
dinner; a perfumed seigneur, delicately lounging in the Oeil de Boeuf,
hath an alchemy whereby he will extract the third nettle and call it
rent.</i> --Carlyle</small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Tortured
rationalizations</b>
</small><br>
<small>According to royal libertarians, land becomes private property
when one mixes one's labor with it. And mixing what is yours with
what is not yours in order to own the whole thing is considered great
sport. But the notion is filled with problems. How much labor does it
take to claim land, and how much land can one claim for that labor?
And for how long can one make that claim?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>According to classical liberals,
land belonged to the user for as
long as the land was being used, and no longer. But according to
royal libertarians, land belongs to the first user, forever. So, do
the oceans belong to the heirs of the first person to take a fish out
or put a boat in? Does someone who plows the same field each year own
only one field, while someone who plows a different field each year
owns dozens of fields? Should the builder of the first
transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn't we at least
have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to
the earth at all? To royal libertarians there are not, but classical
liberals recognized that unlimited ownership of land never flowed
from use, but from the state:</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>A right of property in
movable things is admitted before
the establishment of government. A separate property in lands not till
after that establishment.... He who plants a field keeps possession of
it till he has gathered the produce, after which one has as good a
right as another to occupy it. Government must be established and laws
provided, before lands can be separately appropriated and their owner
protected in his possession. Till then the property is in the body of
the nation.</i> --Thomas Jefferson</small></blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>"But we're used to
it"</b>
</small><br>
<small>A favorite excuse of royal libertarians is that the land has
been
divided up for so long that tracing the rightful owners would be
pointless. But there can be no rightful owners if we all have an
inalienable right of access to the earth. It is not some ancient
injustice we seek to rectify, but an ongoing injustice. The piece of
paper granting title might be ancient, but the tribute levied on the
landless goes on and on.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>One might as well have accepted
monarchy under the excuse that
whatever conquest led to monarchy occurred centuries ago, and that
tracing the rightful monarchs would be pointless. Indeed, landed
aristocracy is the last remnant of monarchy.<strong> ... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Who has the
authority to collect land rent?</b>
</small><br>
<small>Many libertarians struggle with the legitimate question of how
any
governing body achieves rightful jurisdiction in a community, and we
join them in opposing collection by such super-statist organizations
as the United Nations, which is substantially a federation of
tyrannies. However, royal libertarians raise the question selectively
and rhetorically in regard to community collection of land rents.
They acknowledge that there must be courts to settle, among other
things, property disputes. It seems rather obvious that whatever
entity has authority to rule on who gets the land also has authority
to rule on who gets the land rent.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Fear of a funded
government</b>
</small><br>
<small>There is also a well founded libertarian concern that land rent
could provide funds enough to support a corrupt and oppressive
government. Most libertarian supporters of the governmental
collection of land rent therefore fall into two camps. One would give
the people power to limit how much money the government can take, but
would stipulate that all such money come entirely from ground rents
and natural resource severance royalties. The other would take the
full rent, but would stipulate that the government can still only
spend what the citizens authorize it to spend. The rest would be
distributed on a per-capita basis.</small><br>
<br>
<small><b>Ending excuses
for big government</b></small><br>
<small>Much of the government spending to which libertarians
strenuously
object is made necessary by its taxing productivity instead of land
values.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The property tax falls mostly on
improvements, so less housing is
built, giving the government an excuse to build public housing.
Profits are taxed, leading to less employment and giving government
an excuse to spend money on economic stimulus projects. Family income
is taxed to the point that they have difficulty buying a house or
sending their children to college, so government institutes
subsidized mortgages and student loans.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even the indirect effects are
substantial. Land speculations gone
sour chew up inner cities, so poor people turn to crime (if drug
selling and prostitution be crimes) and the government gets an excuse
to beef up the police state.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Politically connected real estate
interests see that they can buy
up land in the boondocks for a pittance and then get other taxpayers
to build them a superhighway, increasing the value of their holdings
by orders of magnitude. With land value tax they would have
ultimately paid for their own highway or more likely would not have
had it built in the first place.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even welfare increases do not stay
in the hands of welfare
recipients, but are quickly greeted by higher rent demands from
ghetto landlords. (The War on Poverty did little to end poverty, but
it did a lot to enrich absentee owners of poor communities.)</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><i>All goes back to the
land, and the land owner is enabled
to absorb to himself a share of almost every public and every private
benefit, however important or however pitiful those benefits may be. </i>

<p>H.G. Brown: <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">Significant
    Paragraphs from Henry George's <strong><em>Progress &amp; Poverty</em></strong>:
    10. Effect of Remedy Upon Wealth Production</a> (in the unabridged <em>P&amp;P</em>: <a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Part
    IX &#8212; Effects of the Remedy: Chapter 1 &#8212; Of the effect upon the
    production of wealth</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The elder Mirabeau, we are told, ranked the proposition of Quesnay, to substitute
      one single tax on rent (the <em>imp&ocirc;t unique</em>) for all other taxes,
      as a discovery equal in utility to the invention of writing or the substitution
      of the use of money for barter.</p>
  <p>To whosoever will think over the matter, this saying will appear an evidence
      of penetration rather than of extravagance. The advantages which would be gained
      by substituting for the numerous taxes by which the public revenues are now
      raised, a single tax levied upon the value of land, will appear more and more
      important the more they are considered.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> This is the secret which would transform the little village into the
      great city.*</li>
    <li> With all the burdens removed which now oppress industry and hamper exchange,
          the production of wealth would go on with a rapidity now undreamed
      of.</li>
    <li> This, in its turn, would lead to an increase in the value of land &#8212; a
          new surplus which society might take for general purposes.</li>
    <li> And released from the difficulties which attend the collection of revenue
          in a way that begets corruption and renders legislation the tool of
      special interests, society could assume functions which the increasing
      complexity
          of life makes it desirable to assume, but which the prospect of political
          demoralization under the present system now leads thoughtful men to
      shrink from. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect upon the production of wealth.</p>
  <p>To abolish the taxation which, acting and reacting, now hampers every wheel
      of exchange and presses upon every form of industry, would be like removing
      an immense weight from a powerful spring. Imbued with fresh energy, production
      would start into new life, and trade would receive a stimulus which would be
      felt to the remotest arteries. The present method of taxation operates upon
      exchange like artificial deserts and mountains;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> it costs more to get goods through a custom house than it does to carry
          them around the world.</li>
    <li> It operates upon energy, and industry, and skill, and thrift, like a
      fine upon those qualities.</li>
    <li> If I have worked harder and built myself a good house while you have
      been contented to live in a hovel, the taxgatherer now comes annually to
      make
          me pay a penalty for my energy and industry, by taxing me more than
      you.</li>
    <li> If I have saved while you wasted, I am mulct, while you are exempt.</li>
    <li> If a man build a ship we make him pay for his temerity, as though he
      had done an injury to the state;</li>
    <li> if a railroad be opened, down comes the tax collector upon it, as though
          it were a public nuisance;</li>
    <li> if a manufactory be erected we levy upon it an annual sum which would
          go far toward making a handsome profit.</li>
    <li> We say we want capital, but if any one accumulate it, or bring it among
          us, we charge him for it as though we were giving him a privilege.</li>
    <li> We punish with a tax the man who covers barren fields with ripening
      grain,</li>
    <li> we fine him who puts up machinery, and him who drains a swamp.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>How heavily these taxes burden production only those realize who have attempted
      to follow our system of taxation through its ramifications, for, as I have
      before said, the heaviest part of taxation is that which falls in increased
      prices.</p>
  <p>To abolish these taxes would be to lift the whole enormous weight of taxation
      from productive industry. The needle of the seamstress and the great manufactory;
      the cart horse and the locomotive; the fishing boat and the steamship;
    the farmer's plow and the merchant's stock, would be alike untaxed. All would
    be
      free to make or to save, to buy or to sell, unfined by taxes, unannoyed
    by the taxgatherer. Instead of saying to the producer, as it does now, &quot;The
      more you add to the general wealth the more shall you be taxed!&quot; the state
      would say to the producer, &quot;Be as industrious, as thrifty, as enterprising
      as you choose, you shall have your full reward! You shall not be fined
      for making two blades of grass grow where one grew before; you shall not
      be taxed
      for adding to the aggregate wealth.&quot;</p>
  <p>And will not the community gain by thus refusing to kill the goose that lays
      the golden eggs; by thus refraining from muzzling the ox that treadeth out
      the corn; by thus leaving to industry, and thrift, and skill, their natural
      reward, full and unimpaired? For there is to the community also a natural reward.
      The law of society is, each for all, as well as all for each. No one can keep
      to himself the good he may do, any more than he can keep the bad. Every productive
      enterprise, besides its return to those who undertake it, yields collateral
      advantages to others. If a man plant a fruit tree, his gain is that he gathers
      the fruit in its time and season. But in addition to his gain, there is a gain
      to the whole community. Others than the owner are benefited by the increased
      supply of fruit; the birds which it shelters fly far and wide; the rain which
      it helps to attract falls not alone on his field; and, even to the eye which
      rests upon it from a distance, it brings a sense of beauty. And so with everything
      else. The building of a house, a factory, a ship, or a railroad, benefits others
      besides those who get the direct profits.</p>
  <p>Well may the community leave to the individual producer all that prompts him
      to exertion; well may it let the laborer have the full reward of his labor,
      and the capitalist the full return of his capital. For the more that labor
      and capital produce, the greater grows the common wealth in which all may share.
      And in the value or rent of land is this general gain expressed in a definite
      and concrete form. Here is a fund which the state may take while leaving to
      labor and capital their full reward. With increased activity of production
      this would commensurately increase.</p>
  <p>And to shift the burden of taxation from production and exchange to the value
      or rent of land would not merely be to give new stimulus to the production
      of wealth; it would be to open new opportunities. For under this system no
      one would care to hold land unless to use it, and land now withheld from use
      would everywhere be thrown open to improvement.</p>
  <p>The selling price of land would fall; land speculation would receive its death
      blow; land monopolization would no longer pay.* Millions and millions of acres
      from which settlers are now shut out by high prices would be abandoned by their
      present owners or sold to settlers upon nominal terms. And this not merely
      on the frontiers, but within what are now considered well settled districts.</p>
  <p>And it must be remembered that this would apply, not merely to agricultural
        land, but to all land. Mineral land would be thrown open to use, just as agricultural
        land; and in the heart of a city no one could afford to keep land from its
        most profitable use, or on the outskirts to demand more for it than the use
        to which it could at the time be put would warrant. Everywhere that land had
        attained a value, taxation, instead of operating, as now, as a fine upon improvement,
        would operate to force improvement. Whoever planted an orchard, or sowed a
        field, or built a house, or erected a manufactory, no matter how costly, would
        have no more to pay in taxes than if he kept so much land idle.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The monopolist of agricultural land would be taxed as much as though
      his land were covered with houses and barns, with crops and with stock.</li>
    <li> The owner of a vacant city lot would have to pay as much for the privilege
          of keeping other people off of it until he wanted to use it, as his
      neighbor who has a fine house upon his lot.</li>
    <li> It would cost as much to keep a row of tumble-down shanties upon valuable
          land as though it were covered with a grand hotel or a pile of great
      warehouses filled with costly goods.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the bonus that wherever labor is most productive must now be paid before
      labor can be exerted would disappear.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The farmer would not have to pay out half his means, or mortgage his
      labor for years, in order to obtain land to cultivate;</li>
    <li> the builder of a city homestead would not have to lay out as much for
          a small lot as for the house he puts upon it*;</li>
    <li> the company that proposed to erect a manufactory would not have to expend
          a great part of its capital for a site.</li>
    <li> And what would be paid from year to year to the state would be in lieu
          of all the taxes now levied upon improvements, machinery, and stock. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Consider the effect of such a change upon the labor market. Competition
              would no longer be one-sided, as now. Instead of laborers competing
      with each other
        for employment, and in their competition cutting down wages to the point
      of bare subsistence, employers would everywhere be competing for laborers,
      and
        wages would rise to the fair earnings of labor. For into the labor market
      would have entered the greatest of all competitors for the employment of
    labor, a
        competitor whose demand cannot be satisfied until want is satisfied &#8212; the
        demand of labor itself. The employers of labor would not have merely
        to bid against other employers, all feeling the stimulus of greater trade
        and increased
        profits, but against the ability of laborers to become their own employers
        upon the natural opportunities freely opened to them by the tax which
        prevented monopolization.</p>
  <p> With natural opportunities thus free to labor;</p>
  <ul>
    <li> with capital and improvements exempt from tax, and exchange released
      from restrictions, the spectacle of willing men unable to turn their labor
      into
          the things they are suffering for would become impossible;</li>
    <li> the recurring paroxysms which paralyze industry would cease;</li>
    <li> every wheel of production would be set in motion;</li>
    <li> demand would keep pace with supply, and supply with demand;</li>
    <li> trade would increase in every direction, and wealth augment on every
      hand. ... <a href="../HG/PP/SP/10_Effect_upon_Prod.htm">read the whole chapter</a></li>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is a bumper sticker that
says, "If you want peace, then work

important half-truth. At a deeper level, it contains a more profound
half-truth. To understand these half-truths and why they are only
half true, we need to know what peace is, what justice is, and we

which they are subject are righted. Demonstrators shout: "No justice.
No peace." The apparent meaning of peace in this case is tranquility,
the absence of strife. And if this meaning of peace is accepted, the
slogan is true. You cannot expect to end strife as long as people
have unresolved grievances. But the reason that this is only half
true is that this meaning is only a shadow of what peace really
is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Peace is more than armistice, more
than the cessation of violence.
Peace is unity and harmony. In a peaceful world people are all
pleased to cooperate with one another. When we have attained true
peace, there will be no person who has any purpose that any other
person seeks to thwart. In a peaceful world, everyone will feel the
truth of John Donne's meditation,</small></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Is it imaginable that we might
ever attain a world where everyone
felt so? And if we do so, what will be the role of justice in that
world? What is justice? 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There are so many conflicting,
strident claims for different
conceptions of justice that a person might reasonably despair of ever
finding a meaning of justice that people would agree upon. Any
conception of justice may seem to be no more than one person's
opinion. And yet there are things that we all know about justice. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Even the utilitarian proposal
that conflicting claims should be
settled in the way that yields the greatest possible utility must be
rejected as an elitist imposition of a particular goal on people who
may have other plans. If I choose to pursue a life that can be
guaranteed to lead to depression and despair, I have as much claim to
the protection of justice in that pursuit as if I choose the path
that leads to bliss. Justice must be neutral in its evaluation of
people and their goals. <strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If we commit ourselves to
neutrality, does that provide a unique
definition of justice? No, it doesn't. There are a number of
definitions of justice that might claim to satisfy neutrality,
although the claims of some definitions are dubious, and other
definitions can be rejected on other grounds.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Consider first the <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservative </span>claim
that justice is defined by
traditional rules.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Next, consider the claim that justice is defined by what the
majority wants. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">majoritarian </span>says,
"If you want to know who
should prevail in a conflict, take a vote." As appealing as
majoritarianism may be on the surface, it cannot provide a coherent
theory of justice. ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>
If voting cannot be used to define justice, one might entertain
the possibility of using a <span style="font-weight: bold;">contractarian
</span>formulation: What is just is
the rules to which people would have agreed if they did not know
their personal circumstances.&nbsp; <strong>...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>This is a reasonable recipe for
implementing the Golden Rule and a
fine idea for seeking agreement about the principles by which
complaints shall be judged. If people were to follow this suggestion
and achieve the agreement that is described, they would achieve
fairness.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
However, this does not make Rawls's suggestion a good way to
identify justice.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><strong></strong></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Next, consider <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">egalitarianism</span>. The egalitarian says
that justice
is equality. There is a conceptual difficulty in specifying how
beings as different from each other as humans are could ever be
equal, unless we create a society where all humans are female clones
of one another. (This should be technologically feasible within a few
decades, if it is not already.) But I do not think that egalitarians
want a society of clones. <strong>... </strong></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
John Rawls has proposed that the talents that individuals possess
be regarded as a common pool, so that anyone who has more than his
share has an obligation to compensate those who have less then their
shares.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></small></small><small><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">
</span></small></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>All of these suggestions should be
rejected. Talents are not a
common pool from which some persons have taken more then their
shares. If we are all fishing in the same pond, the quantity of fish
that you take will diminish the quantity that is available to me. But
the quantity of talent that you have in no way diminishes the
quantity that is available to me. Your talent is not acquired at my
expense.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>From the perspective of peace, no
man is an island; each of us is
a part of mankind. And any of us who has been graced with an extra
measure of talent should recognize that, often, the best use of our
talent is to provide for others. Nevertheless, from the perspective
of justice, each of us must be allowed to act like an island if he
wishes. .

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Suppose that a bone-marrow transplant from me would save your
life--or at least prolong it. <strong>...</strong></small><br>
<small>
If you do not mind requiring a bone-marrow transplant of me, then
what about a kidney?<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<small>
If you do not mind requiring me to donate a kidney, then what
about my heart?&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
A good egalitarian should require me to part with the one available
heart after I have had my share of years.
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>But I don't think you would. I
don't think anyone would. We are
not egalitarians. We recognize the sanctity of the boundaries of the
human body. In a peaceful world I will gladly give a spare kidney to
anyone who needs it. But in a just world, no one will forcefully
extract a kidney from me, even to save someone else's life. Justice
is not egalitarianism.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Just as I own my kidneys, so do I own my talents. In a peaceful
world I will use them for the benefit of all mankind. But the sword
of justice should not be used to force me to compensate those with
less talent. Nor should it be used to force me to abide by the
insurance contract that you believe I would have signed, if I had had
the chance, before I knew what talents I would have.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A proper definition of justice
begins with the principles of
classical liberalism. In a just world each person is permitted to
determine the purposes to which his or her body is put--the hands and
the brain no less than the kidneys. We each have rights of
self-determination. This includes the right of ownership of what we
produce, at least, as John Locke said, when we leave as much in
natural opportunities for others as we appropriate for our own
productive activities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[11]</span></small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We have the right to co-operate
with whom we choose for whatever
mutually agreed purposes we choose. Thus we have the right to trade
with others, without any artificial hindrances, and we have the right
to keep any wages or interest that we receive from such trading.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These components of the classical
liberal conception of justice
are held by two groups that hold conflicting views on a companion
issue of great importance: <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">how
are claims of exclusive access to
natural opportunities to be established?
</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><small>
John Locke qualified his statement that we own what we produce
with his famous "proviso" that there be "as much and as good left in
common for others." A few pages later, writing in the last decade of
the seventeenth century, he said that private appropriations of land
are actually not restricted, because anyone who is dissatisfied with
the land available to him in Europe can always go to America, where
there is plenty of unclaimed land.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[12]</span></small>
Locke does not address
the issue of rights to land when land is scarce.
One tradition in classical liberalism concerning claims to land is
that of the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading libertarians</span>"&nbsp;<strong>
...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The other tradition is that of the
"<span style="font-weight: bold;">geoists</span>," as inspired if not
exemplified by Henry George, who say that, whenever natural
opportunities are scarce, each person has an obligation to ensure
that the per capita value of the natural opportunities that he leaves
for others is as great as the value of the natural opportunities that
he claims for himself.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[14]</span> Any excess
in one's claim
generates an obligation to compensate those who thereby have less.
George actually proposed the nearly equivalent idea, that all or
nearly all of the rental value of land should be collected in taxes,
and all other taxes should be abolished. The geoist position as I
have expressed it emphasizes the idea that, at least when value
generated by public services is not an issue, rights to land are
fundamentally rights of individuals, not rights of governments.</small></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
There are two fundamental problems with the position of
homesteading libertarians on claims to land.&nbsp;<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The second fundamental problem
with the position of the
homesteading libertarians is that, even if there were previously
unsettled land to be allocated, say a new continent emerging from the
ocean, first grabbing would make no sense as a criterion for
allocating land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It would be inefficient, for one
thing, as people stampeded to do
whatever was necessary to establish their claims. But that is not
decisive because, if we are concerned with justice, it might be
necessary for us to tolerate inefficiency. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">But the homesteading
libertarian view makes no sense in terms of justice. "I get it all
because I got here first," isn't justice.</span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Justice -- the balancing of the scales -- is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geoist </span>position, "I
get exclusive access to this natural opportunity because I have left
natural opportunities of equal value for you."&nbsp;<strong> ... </strong></small><br>
<br>
<small>
Justice is thus a regime in which persons have the greatest
possible individual liberty, and all acknowledge an obligation to
share equally the value of natural opportunities. Justice is economic
reform -- the abolition of all taxes on labor and capital, the
acceptance of individual responsibility, the creation of institutions
that will provide equal sharing the value of natural
opportunities.<strong> ...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>So if you want a peace for others,
then work for justice. Work for
freedom. Work for the elimination of all taxes on the productive
things that people do. Work for equality in the right to benefit from
natural opportunities. All these things will make it easier for
people to make the leap to peace.</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>

<small></small>Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_Coercion_PF.html">The
Ethics of Coercion in Public Finance</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Utilitarian and Contractarian
theories of justice share the
feature that they do not acknowledge self-ownership. Under
Utilitarianism, persons are inputs into the generation of aggregate
utility. Under Contractarianism, persons might have owned themselves
in the contractual setting, but there they sold themselves. The
rights of real people are gone. Theories in these classes can be
contrasted with a class of theories that justify power with direct
responses to those who question power, treating them as individuals
who own themselves. <b>There are two theories in this class:
Liberalism and Libertarianism. The two theories share the idea of
self-ownership, the idea that each person is free to decide the
purpose of his or her life, provided that the rights of others to do
the same are respected.</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>T<b>he fundamental difference
between Libertarianism and
Liberalism concerns the basis for claims to own things. The
Libertarian axiom (Rothbard, 1982, pp. 29-43) is that everything in
nature is the property of the first person who transforms it. This
contrasts with the Liberal axiom (Ackerman, 1980, pp. 11, 31- 68)
that the claims that people make on natural opportunities are
respectable only if the person making the claim leaves as much for
others as she takes for herself.</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When a Libertarian is asked, "Why
should you have that opportunity
instead of me?" he can reply, within his own theory, "Because I got
here first and did something." The Liberal says that any
appropriation of natural opportunities that leaves less for those who
come later fails to satisfy the condition of evenhandedness that is
required for justice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The Libertarian and Liberal
theories both have limitations in
terms of efficiency. Acceptance of the Libertarian theory promotes a
land rush, in which people waste resources doing the minimal work
necessary to establish claims to land, so that they can later sell it
to others. (Whoever burns down the most rain forest gets the most
land.) This first inefficiency is compounded by a continuing
inefficient use of land, arising from the inability of people to
manage all that they have claimed. If the Liberal theory is accepted,
an opposite inefficiency occurs. There is no incentive for people to
seek to discover opportunities hidden in nature, because whatever is
discovered belongs equally to all.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>While it may be difficult to avoid
having these inefficiencies
color our evaluations of the theories, we should remember that the
pursuit of justice does not guarantee efficiency. It is possible that
a commitment to justice will entail accepting some inefficiency.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The basic problem with the justice
of Libertarian theory is that
it allows the first arrivers to deprive those who come later of any
natural opportunities that it suits the first arrivers to claim and
transform. To permit this is inconsistent with the evenhandedness
that justice requires.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A Libertarian might allege that it
would never be possible for the
first arrivers to leave as much for all later arrivers as they take
for themselves, because there may be an endless stream of
generations, and each person would be unable to claim even enough
land to stand on. This objection presumes that any claims would be
made on the stock of land, rather than on the flow of land services.
Under Liberalism, each person may respectably claim the use of an
amount of land during her lifetime that leaves as much land rent per
person for others who are alive at the same time as the rent of the
land that the claimant reserves for herself. People may also
respectably reserve more for themselves, if they compensate those who
therefore have less. There will be plenty of room for everyone to
stand.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Libertarianism is an excellent
framework for analyzing justice
when there is no scarcity of natural opportunities. But when natural
opportunities are scarce it denies the equal rights of those who come
later.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>...&nbsp;

<p><small></small>Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements.<strong> ... <br>
</strong><br>
Libertarians rival greens as the most ready to hear the PTS message.
The PTS is a plank in the platform of the state parties of Virginia and
of Maryland (the home state of this writer whose friends are the party
activists responsible for these planks). Why? Not only is it possible
to draw public revenue from public values (instead of from private
ones), it is also possible to collect this rent with fees rather than
with taxes. For instance, land rent, the largest type of public value,
could be collected not via a land tax but via a deed fee; that is, from
a higher and periodic charge for registering and defending titles to
sites and resources. These two potentials of the PTS -- exempting
private values and eschewing taxation -- win support from the more
socially-conscious libertarians.<br>
<br>
<font size="3"><small>A big problem needs a big solution which in turn

Fred Foldvary: <a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Underprivileged
or Rights-Deprived?</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Poor folk are often labeled "underprivileged" and
    richer folk are called "privileged." For example, there is a book titled "<span style="font-style: italic;">One
    Nation, Underprivileged: Why American Poverty Affects Us All</span>." But "privileged" and "underprivileged" are
    confused and misleading expressions. If you think the poor are "underprivileged," then
    you don't really understand poverty.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> What is a "privilege?" The term originally meant "private law." A privilege
  is a special advantage or prerogative or immunity or benefit given only to
  some people only because they have power or are favored by those with power.
  If everyone is entitled to something, like freedom of expression, or if everyone
  may obtain an item such as a passport with the same rules applying to all,
  then it is not a privilege but a right.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small></small><small>So if a person is poor, it is not because he is lacking
  in special protections, subsidies, and other privileges. A person is usually
  poor because he has been deprived of the natural right to work. Governments
  world-wide impose barriers between labor and productive resources, keeping
  some workers deprived of labor and others who do work deprived of their earnings
  from labor. ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small> Taxes on wages create a wedge between the cost of labor to employers
  and the take-home pay of the worker. More costly labor results in less employment.
  Taxes on the income from capital goods and on the sale of goods has the same
  effect. There are unemployment taxes, disability taxes, and payroll taxes that
  increase the tax wedge. On top of that, there are minimum-wage laws that prevent
  the least productive workers from getting hired. There are permits, zoning,
  and other rules and costs that also prevent some workers from becoming self-employed.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small> Deprived of the full natural right to peaceful enterprise and labor,
  and the natural right to fully keep one's earnings, the poor have little or
  no income, and depend on charity and governmental assistance. To call them "underprivileged" is
  a lie. The rights-deprived poor do not need privileges. They just need government
  to stop interfering with their right to work and save! ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small> There has been confusion about what is a right and what is a privilege. <strong>... </strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small> Some consider a patent a privilege, but it too is a right. <strong>...</strong></small><strong><br>
  </strong><br>
  <small> Some also consider a corporation to be a privilege, since the firm
  has a charter from a government.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><br>
  <br>
  <small> Real privileges are favors arbitrarily given to some groups and not
  others.&nbsp; <strong>... </strong></small><strong><br>
  </strong><br>
  <small> The really underprivileged folks are all consumers, taxpayers and those
  who are restricted from peaceful and honest practices or have to pay extra
  to the government while others are unrestricted and non-taxed. These people
  lack privileges which others have. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The proper remedy is not to expand privileges, but
  to eliminate all governmental privileges. That is why libertarians and geoists
  alike have the motto: "Equal rights for all; privileges for none!"</span></small> <small><a href="../docs/Foldvary_Rights-Deprived.html">Read

<p>Fred E. Foldvary &#8212; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">The
      Ultimate Tax Reform:
Public Revenue from Land Rent</a></span><a href="../../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm"> </a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Several prominent libertarians have recognized land value or rent as the
    source of public finance most compatible with liberty. Albert Jay Nock, for
    example,
      distinguished between the improper political means of obtaining wealth,
    such as from arbitrary taxation, and the proper economic means, from enterprise.
      He regarded public revenue from land rent as within the economic means,
    since
      the &#8220;monopoly of economic rent, on the other hand, gives exclusive rights
      to values accruing from the desire of other persons to possess that property;
      values which take their rise irrespective of any exercise of the economic means
      on the part of the holder.&#8221;25 (He used the term &#8220;monopoly&#8221; in
      its classical meaning, in which a new entrant cannot increase the supply,
      hence together, the landowners have a monopoly.)</p>
  <p>Frank Chodorov, a fervent individualist and founding editor of The Freeman,
      published by the Foundation for Economic Education and still a leading
    libertarian journal of ideas, became in 1937 director of the Henry George
    School of Social
      Science in New York City, serving until 1942. Like most followers of Henry
      George, Chodorov regarded a charge on land value as not a true tax, which
    arbitrarily extracts wealth, but a &#8220;payment for the use of a location, determined
      by the higgling and haggling of the market, and it makes no difference to the
      land user whether he pays rent to the city fathers or to a private owner.&#8221;26
      Explaining the value of a location derives to a great extent from community
      services, rather than the efforts of the landowner as such, Chodorov noted &#8220;it
      would seem logical that this value&#8212;which we call land rent&#8212;should
      go to defray the expenses of these common services.&#8221;27</p>
  <p>Friedrich Hayek was ambivalent about using rent for public finance. Hayek
      was first inspired to study economics after being exposed to Georgist ideas.
      He thought using rent for public finances is a good idea if the land value
      could be separated from the value of the improvements, which in practice
    can be and is done by professional assessors and appraisers, as discussed
    above.28
      Hayek regarded any tax as inherently socialist, but he regarded a tax on
    rent as the least-bad &#8220;socialist&#8221; tax.</p>
  <p>The libertarian thinker Murray Rothbard thought it was impossible to tax rent,
      since doing so would drive land prices to zero, also eradicating rent. But
      that proposition would apply equally to private rent collection by landlords
      of mobile homes, who would by that logic be unable to collect rent. Rent in
      fact does not get reduced when taxed. (See the book Critics of Henry George
      (ed. Robert Andelson) for an analysis of how Murray Rothbard, Spencer Heath,
      Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, and other libertarians viewed and criticized
      public revenue from land rent.) My suggestion to tap 80 percent of the rent
      would avoid the Rothbard criticism. Even Henry George proposed the owner keep
      some of the rent. The accusation that land value must drop to zero is not an
      argument against taxing some or even most of the geo-rent. ... <a href="../docs/Foldvary_UTR.htm">read the whole document</a></p>

Efficiency and Preventing Exploitation in Taxing and Spending Decisions</a></small></small></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>George Reisman advocates what might be called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">conservative
    classical liberalism</span>." This position is that certainty in property
    rights is so valuable that one should never ask whether unjustifiable violence
    was used
    in establishing the existing pattern of control
    over natural opportunities.</p>
  <p>Every natural opportunity belongs to whoever most recently succeeded in establishing
    control over it.</p>
  <p>Murray Rothbard, by contrast, took what might be called the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">homesteading
        libertarian</span>" position. This is the position that when we can know
        who first used a natural opportunity, it belongs to that person, or to
        his or her successor in title through gift and exchange. All thefts from
        victims
        with identifiable successors should be undone. When we cannot identify
        the proper successor of the first user, the a thing belongs to whoever
        is using
        it now, unless that person stole it, in which case it properly belongs
        to whoever brings the thief to justice.</p>
  <p>The third position, which might be called "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">geoliberalism</span>" emerges from the work of Henry
      George. This is the position that all persons have equal rights to natural
      opportunities, which rights should be secured by having the public treasury
      collect the rental value of exclusive access to land and other natural
    opportunities, with the revenue used for public purposes and guaranteed incomes.</p>
  <p>Of these three approaches, I find geoliberalism most attractive. It fits my
    sense of justice that all persons should have equal rights to natural opportunities.
    In addition, by providing funding for guaranteed incomes, geoliberalism offers
    a greater prospect for removing more of the distorting taxes that finance the
    welfare state.</p>
  <p>A possible difficulty with classical liberalism as a justification for government
    action is that it may justify little if any government action. Taxes intrude
    upon individual liberty. How is this intrusion to be justified? One way to
    try to get around this difficulty is by the claim that some expenditures on
    protecting individual rights are so valuable that anyone would understand that,
    for these expenditures, the reduction in individual liberty from taxation is
    less than the addition to individual liberty from the protection of individual
    rights that is possible with taxation. However, if improving the well-being
    of all citizens is the justification, then one should ask whether there is
    adequate justification for even these government actions if they do not have
    unanimous support. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_IEaPEiTaSD.html">read the whole
