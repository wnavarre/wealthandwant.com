      goods which are made overseas, the lower costs of food relative to other items,

</blockquote>
<p>Henry George: <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">The Common Sense of Taxation</a> (1881
  article)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As to amount of taxation, there is no principle which imposes any arbitrary
    limit. Heavy taxation is better for any community than light taxation, if
    the increased revenue be used in doing by public agencies things which could
    not be done, or could not be as well and economically done, by private agencies.
    Taxes could be lightened in the city of New York by dispensing with street-lamps
    and disbanding the police force. But would a reduction in taxation gained
    in this way be for the benefit of the people of New York and make New York
    a more desirable place to live in? Or if it should be found that heat and
    light could be conducted through the streets at public expense and supplied
    to each house at but a small fraction of the cost of supplying them by individual
    effort, or that the city railroads could be run at public expense so as to
    give every one transportation at very much less than it now costs the average
    resident, the increased taxation necessary for these purposes would not be
    increased burden, and in spite of the larger taxation required, New York
    would become a more desirable place to live in. It is a mistake to condemn
    taxation as bad merely because it is high; it is a mistake to impose by constitutional
    provision, as in many of our States has been advocated, and in some of our
    States has been done, any restriction upon the amount of taxation. A restriction
    upon the incurring of public indebtedness is another matter. In nothing is
    the far-reaching statesmanship of Jefferson more clearly shown than in his
    proposition that all public obligations should be deemed void after a certain
    brief term &#8212; a proposition which he grounds upon the self-evident truth
    that the earth belongs in usufruct to the living, and that the dead have
    no control over it, and can give no title to any part of it. But restriction
    upon public debts is a very different thing from restriction upon the power
    of taxation, and reasons which urge the one do not apply to the other. Nor
    is increased taxation necessarily proof of governmental extravagance. Increase
    in taxation is in the order of social development, for the reason that social
    development tends to the doing of things collectively that in a ruder state
    are done individually, to the giving to government of new functions and the
    imposing of new duties. Our public schools and libraries and parks, our signal
    service and fish commissions and agricultural bureaus and grasshopper investigations,
    are evidences of this.</p>
  <p> But while no limit can be properly fixed for the amount of taxation, the
    method of taxation is of supreme importance. A horse may be anchored by fastening
    to his bridle a weight which he will not feel when carried in a buggy behind
    him. The best ship may be made utterly unseaworthy by the bad stowage of
    a cargo which properly placed would make her the stiffer and more weatherly.
    So enterprise may be palsied, industry crushed, accumulation prevented, and
    a prosperous country turned into a desert, by taxation which rightly levied
    would hardly be felt. <font size="+1"><strong>...</strong></font></p>
  <p>For, keeping in mind the fact that all wealth is the result of human exertion,
    it is clearly seen that, having in view the promotion of the general prosperity,
    it is the height of absurdity to tax wealth for purposes of revenue while
    there remains, unexhausted by taxation, any value attaching to land. We may
    tax land values as much as we please, without in the slightest degree lessening
    the amount of land, or the capabilities of land, or the inducement to use
    land. But we cannot tax wealth without lessening the inducement to the production
    of wealth, and decreasing the amount of wealth. We might take the whole value
    of land in taxation, so as to make the ownership of land worth nothing, and
    the land would still remain, and be as useful as before. The effect would
    be to throw land open to users free of price, and thus to increase its capabilities,
    which are brought out by increased population. But impose anything like such
    taxation upon wealth, and the inducement to the production of wealth would
    be gone. Movable wealth would be hidden or carried off, immovable wealth
    would be suffered to go to decay, and where was prosperity would soon be
    the silence of desolation.<font size="+1"><strong> ...</strong></font></p>
  <p>See how unjust and short-sighted is this system. Here is a man who, gathering
    what little capital he can, and taking his family, starts West to find a
    place where he can make himself a home. He must travel long distances; for,
    though he will pass plenty of land nobody is using, it is held at prices
    too high for him. Finally he will go no further, and selects a place where,
    since the creation of the world, the soil, so far as we know, has never felt
    a plowshare. But here, too, in nine cases out of ten, he will find the speculator
    has been ahead of him, for the speculator moves quicker, and has superior
    means of information to the emigrant. Before he can put this land to the
    use for which nature intended it, and to which it is for the general good
    that it should be put, he must make terms with some man who in all probability
    never saw the land, and never dreamed of using it, and who, it may be, resides
    in some city, thousands of miles away. In order to get permission to use
    this land, he must give up a large part of the little capital which is seed-wheat
    to him, and perhaps in addition mortgage his future labor for years. Still
    he goes to work: he works himself, and his wife works, and his children work &#8212; work
    like horses, and live in the hardest and dreariest manner. Such a man deserves
    encouragement, not discouragement; but on him taxation falls with peculiar
    severity. Almost everything that he has to buy &#8212; groceries, clothing,
    tools &#8212; is largely raised in price by a system of tariff taxation which
    cannot add to the price of the grain or hogs or cattle that he has to sell.
    And when the assessor comes around he is taxed on the improvements he has
    made, although these improvements have added not only to the value of surrounding
    land, but even to the value of land in distant commercial centers. Not merely
    this, but, as a general rule, his land, irrespective of the improvements,
    will be assessed at a higher rate than unimproved land around it, on the
    ground that &quot;productive property&quot; ought to pay more than &quot;unproductive
    property&quot; &#8212; a principle just the reverse of the correct one, for
    the man who makes land productive adds to the general prosperity, while the
    man who keeps land unproductive stands in the way of the general prosperity,
    is but a dog-in-the-manger, who prevents others from using what he will not
    use himself.</p>
  <p>Or, take the case of the railroads. That railroads are a public benefit
    no one will dispute. We want more railroads, and want them to reduce their
    fares and freight. Why then should we tax them? for taxes upon railroads
    deter from railroad building, and compel higher charges. Instead of taxing
    the railroads, is it not clear that we should rather tax the increased value
    which they give to land? To tax railroads is to check railroad building,
    to reduce profits, and compel higher rates; to tax the value they give to
    land is to increase railroad business and permit lower rates. <strong>The
    elevated railroads, for instance, have opened to the overcrowded population
    of New
    York the wide, vacant spaces of the upper part of the island. But this great
    public benefit is neutralized by the rise in land values. Because these vacant
    lots can be reached more cheaply and quickly, their owners demand more for
    them, and so the public gain in one way is offset in another, while the roads
    lose the business they would get were not building checked by the high prices
    demanded for lots. The increase of land values, which the elevated roads
    have caused, is not merely no advantage to them &#8212; it is an injury;
    and it is clearly a public injury.</strong> The elevated railroads ought
    not to be taxed. The more profit they make, with the better conscience can
    they be
    asked to still further reduce fares. <em><strong>It is the increased land
    values which they have created that ought to be taxed, for taxing them will
    give the public
    the full benefit of cheap fares. </strong></em>... <a href="../HG/George_TCSoT_1881.htm">read

  <p>IF we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must finally pay

    high enough to pay the regular profit and the tax besides. If we impose a
    tax upon manufactures or imported goods, the manufacturer or importer will
    charge it in a higher price to the jobber, the jobber to the retailer, and
    the retailer to the consumer. Now, the consumer, on whom the tax thus ultimately
    falls, must not only pay the amount of the tax, but also a profit on this
    amount to everyone who has thus advanced it &#8212; for profit on the capital
    he has advanced in paying taxes is as much required by each dealer as profit
    on the capital he has advanced in paying for goods. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

          <br>
  THE way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost of production, and checking
  supply. But land is not a thing of human production, and taxes upon rent cannot
  check supply. Therefore though a tax on rent compels the landowners to pay
  more, it gives them no power to obtain more for the use of their land, as it
  in no way tends to reduce the supply of land. On the contrary, by compelling
  those who hold land on speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a
  tax on land values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus
  to reduce the price of land. &#8212; <em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html">Progress &amp; Poverty</a></em><a href="http://www.schalkenbach.org/library/george.henry/pp083.html"> &#8212; Book

  <p><em>Q45. Why tax $1,000 invested in a vacant lot while exempting $1,000

A. Because: (1) the land is made worth $1,000 and so maintained at public expense
without any contribution from the owner; (2) the $1,000 New York Central stock

    Dear Home</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>So why is the cost of housing so high?</p>
  <p>We learn that the average new house nationwide now sells for nearly $300,000.
      The writer tells us, &quot;I asked (a builder) what our children -- my
      kids are both under 8, I told him -- would be paying when they're ready
      to buy.</p>
  <p>&quot;'They're going to live with us until they're 40,' (the builder) said
      matter-of-factly. 'And when they have their second kid, then we'll finally
      kick them out and make them pay for the house that we paid for. And that
    house will cost them 45 to 50 percent of their income.'&quot;</p>
  <p>Such data are dismaying, but perspective helps. &quot;In Britain,&quot; the
      builder explains, &quot;you pay seven times your annual income for a home;
      in the U.S. you pay three and a half.&quot; The Brits get 330 square feet per
      person in their homes; Americans, 750 square feet. But choice parts of the
      United States face &quot;build-out.&quot; Consider New Jersey. It currently
      averages 1,165 people per square mile -- denser than India (914) and Japan
      (835).</p>
  <p>And we confront, finally and inevitably, the question: What is to be done
      about it?</p>
  <p>Almost without exception, housing specialists concur, high home prices are
      owing to zoning. Twenty years ago, in many quarters of the country, one
    year would go by before the political authority would permit a developer
    to begin
      housing construction. In New Jersey, that interval now approaches eight
    years. Delays of that kind have the effect of shrinking the amount of land
    on which
      houses can be constructed. We get the inflated costs so familiar. &quot;(Some
      authorities) used sample prices from 25 areas to show that the cost of housing
      in a metropolitan area appears to be in direct correlation to its degree of
      zoning ordinances,&quot; Gertner writes.</p>
  <p>This is a politically remote source of trouble. People who have to wait for
      a zoning agency to change its conventions, regulations, traditions and idiosyncrasies
      will be very old before they acquire a new home.</p>
  <p> Henry George, the eminent social philosopher of a century ago, turned the
      attention of planners and economists, however briefly, to the indefeasible
      factor of land scarcity. Capital and labor can increase; land cannot. ... ... <a href="file:///C|/wealthandwant/docs/Buckley_HDH.htm">read the whole

Jeff Smith and Kris Nelson: <a href="../docs/Smith_PTS.html">Giving
Life to the Property Tax Shift (PTS)</a>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>John Muir is right. "Tug on any
one
thing and find it connected to everything else in the universe." Tug on
the property tax and find it connected to urban slums, farmland loss,
political favoritism, and unearned equity with disrupted neighborhood
tenure. Echoing Thoreau, the more familiar reforms have failed to
address this many-headed hydra at its root. To think that the root
could be chopped by a mere shift in the property tax base -- from
buildings to land -- must seem like the epitome of unfounded faith. Yet
the evidence shows that state and local tax activists do have a
powerful, if subtle, tool at their disposal. The "stick" spurring
efficient use of land is a higher tax rate upon land, up to even the
site's full annual value. The "carrot" rewarding efficient use of land
is a lower or zero tax rate upon improvements. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small><font size="3"><small>The other potentially supportive
businesses -- service providers -- do
not consume much in the way of resources or prime locations. Even
service providers on valuable sites, were they to pay more, could still
come out ahead in the better business climate of zero taxes on sales,
on paid wages, on customers' income, and of less onerous mortgage.
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Presently taxes and mortgages consume
about 65% of the average worker's
income, drastically reducing discretionary spending. ... </span></small></font></small><br>
<br>
<small><font size="3"><small>A big
problem needs a big solution which in turn needs a
matching shift of our prevailing paradigm. Geonomics -- advocating that
we share the social value of sites and natural resources and untax
earnings -- does just that. </small></font><a

Herbert J. G. Bab:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Bab_PT_Unemployment.html">Property
Tax -- Cause of Unemployment</a>&nbsp; (circa 1964)<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When analysing property taxes we
shall distinguish between that part of
the tax which is assessed on improvements and that part which is
assessed on land.</small><br>
<br>
<small>That part of the tax that is assessed on buildings penalizes
everybody
who improves his land, his buildings or intends to construct
residential, commercial or industrial property. The most serious
incidence of property taxes is on new housing. When rental property or
houses are newly constructed these taxes add 15 to 20% to the annual
cost depending on assessment practices and tax rates.</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">
  <p><small> "In 1962 property taxes on new F.H.A. insured houses averaged $14.30
  per month, or $171.60 per year, excluding that part of the tax that was
  assessed on the land. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Assuming that a family
  spends 20% of its income
  on housing</span>, the income of a family must increase by $858 per
  year in
  order to afford the purchase of a home. In this way many families in
  the lower income group are priced, or taxed, out of the market. And
  residential construction, a mainstay of our economy, is discouraged."</small></p>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>
"In 1963 HOUSING STARTS reached a level of 1.6 million units,
representing a value of about $20 billions. Yet very few houses were
built in the central areas of our cities and a large part of these
houses were built for families in the middle or upper income group. Of
these single-family homes, only 15% were sold for less than $12,500.
Another 15% sold for between $12,500 and $15,000. Thus 70% of these
homes cost $15,000 or more. This is so because under our income tax
laws property taxes and interest charges are deductible items. A person
in the 75% bracket pays only 25% of these costs and a person in the 50%
bracket pays only half the property taxes and half the interest
charges."<br>
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The steep increase in the level
of rentals represents a true and
accurate yardstick of our housing shortage. During the period 1950 to
1961</small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>the average rental rose from $71.13 per month to $186.79
or by
160%. <br>
    </small></li>
  <li><small>During the same period median urban family income rose
from
$3,497 to $5,924 or by only 69%.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small></li>
  <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Construction costs per square foot rose
from $8.68 in 1950 to $11.32 in 1961 or by only 30.4%.</span></small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The ever widening gap between
the level of rentals and the urban family income constitutes a rental
squeeze, which has brought untold misery and hardship to families in
the lower income group, especially to those belonging to minority
groups. The rental squeeze has also aggravated overcrowding and slum
conditions.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In the
press, on the radio and on television we are often warned about the
threat of inflation. Hardly ever are we told, that the increase in the
cost of living is to a large extent due to the increase in housing
costs brought about by the housing shortage.</span><small><small><big><big><a

The Most Rev. Dr Thomas Nulty, Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath
(Ireland): <a href="../docs/Nulty_BttL.html">Back to the Land</a>
(1881)&nbsp;<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Higher Money Wages but Lower
Purchasing Power.</b>
</small><br>
<small>Does it therefore follow that the strong, widespread and
permanent
feeling of discontent which prevail among the labourers is the result
of fancy or imagination, having no solid foundation whatever in
fact?</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Undoubtedly this feeling proves
the labourers to have substantial
grievances, although I think they have failed to trace them to the
causes that have really produced them. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The
money wage of the English
operative is now considerably higher than in any past period of
English history. But if his money wage is now high, the price of the
raw products of the soil, that is to say, of the necessaries and
comforts of life, is vastly higher still.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A given amount of money will not
now procure for him the same
quantity of food and of the other necessaries of life as formerly. In
purchasing the raw products of the soil, he must pay not only for the
necessaries and comforts of life which he enjoys himself, but also
for the comforts and luxuries which go to the enjoyment of the owners
of the soil. The price, therefore, of the raw products is a payment
and a tax; a payment for what he consumes himself, and a tax for what
is consumed by others.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then again, a vast margin of the
earnings of the English people is
expended in direct and indirect taxation. The public burdens of every
nation fall mainly on the vast masses of that nation, and the
operatives of England are the vast masses of the English nation.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>If the English operatives could
only retain for their own use and
benefit the vast sums which, under the existing system of Land
Tenure, go on the one hand to the owners of the soil, and the sums
that an economical system of taxation would save for them on the
other, their material comforts and enjoyments would be multiplied a
hundred fold. Under the existing state of things their condition is
utterly incapable of any improvement in the future. <a

<p>Weld Carter: <a href="../docs/CarterW_intro.html">An Introduction
to Henry George</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another area in which George
applied these inherent differences
between land and products was the field of taxation. To determine the
incidence of taxation, George had to know what was to be taxed,
products or the value of land. In each case he traced out the effect
from the essential nature of the thing to be taxed: "...all taxes
upon things of unfixed quantity increase prices, and in the course of
exchange are shifted from seller to buyer, increasing as they go.
...If we impose a tax upon buildings, the users of buildings must
finally pay it, for the erection of buildings will cease until
building rents become high enough to pay the regular profit and the
tax besides. ...In this way all taxes which add to prices are shifted
from hand to hand, increasing as they go, until they ultimately rest
upon consumers, who thus pay much more than is received by the
government. Now, the way taxes raise prices is by increasing the cost
of production, and checking supply. But land is not a thing of human
production, and taxes upon...[land value] cannot check
supply. Therefore, though a tax on...[land value] compels the
land owners to pay more, it gives them no power to obtain more for
the use of their land, as it in no way tends to reduce the supply of
land. On the contrary, by compelling those who hold land on
speculation to sell or let for what they can get, a tax on land
values tends to increase the competition between owners, and thus to
reduce the price of land." </small><br>
<br>
<small>Here, then is another derivative difference between land and
products, according to George: taxation on products causes an
increase in the price of products; taxation on the value of land
causes a drop in the price of land.&nbsp; ... <a
