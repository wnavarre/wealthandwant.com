<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp; Dinner has ended. Over a
cup of tea, Sara is talking
with Vernon:</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "... and so those new policies are justified
because
of the Polluter Pays Principle." <span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span></small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp; But Vernon says, "It is not obvious to me. I do not
agree with the Polluter Pays Principle. Why does it have to be the
polluter's problem when he causes damage to the life or property or
rights of others? Maybe it should be all the taxpayers' problem, or
only the problem of people whose names start with the letter K."</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what is Sara supposed to do? What can you

We were four college sophomores. And we were not going to live in a
dorm, no sir, we figured that we were smart, mature fellows and so we
arranged to rent a house. Each person would have his own private
bedroom and we would share the bathroom. Four guys, one bathroom. That
sounds reasonable, right? ...</small><br>
<br>
<small>Is there a solution? Of course there is. It's a simple solution.

Bill Batt: <a

Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Underlying the whole agenda is a
commitment beyond simple description
to sustainable development economics and to Daly&#8217;s &#8220;steady state&#8221;
economics. This entails the institution of environmental safeguards,
protection of cultural and biological diversity, minimal resource use,
and recycling. It further means protection of small countries and
localities &#8212; of both ecosystems and populations &#8212; against
all-encompassing economic units that preclude the possibility of their
being able to survive independently. It presumes also that not just
humans alive today have entitlements, especially privileged elements of
wealthy countries; it recognizes rather the justice and moral claims of
people and natural ecosystems yet to live to survive as intact and
integral units. It recognizes that governments must take a hand in the
preservation of such ecosystems, as&nbsp;markets forces
left to themselves will wreak destruction on the most vulnerable parts
of the earth and ultimately upon the earth itself. It accepts the fact
that the carrying capacity of the earth is&nbsp; limited, and that we
appear to have already exceeded that carrying capacity in our ignorance.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">119</span></small><big><br>
</big><small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><small><big>119One oft-cited
article is that
of Peter Vitousek, et al,
&#8220;Human Appropriation of the Products of Photosynthesis,&#8221; BioScience,
Vol. 36, No.6 (1986), pp. 368-373, available at
http://dieoff.org/page83.htm. It calculates that consumption of earth&#8217;s
resources is doubles at an ever increasing rate, and that humans have
already appropriated 40% of terrestrial biological productivity. The
most comprehensive collection of articles addressing this perspective
is created and maintained by retired Cornell Professor Jay Hanson, at
www.dieoff.org. The site name arises from his view that the world
economy&#8217;s dependence upon fossil fuels faces an imminent end, and the
earth will then be capable of supporting only about two billion people.
Hence a looming dieoff. </big></small></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The distinction between CAC approaches to environmental
challenges as
compared with pricing approaches is central to all this analysis.
Daly&#8217;s shows a strong preference for the latter. In what he calls
&#8220;graded ecozoning,&#8221; for example, potential atmospheric impacts are
divided into three areas. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>First, for emissions that do not cause significant damage
and do
not accumulate in significant concentrations, taxpayers would be
charged a general fee. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Second, in instances where incentives require altered
behavior to
address problems such as high ozone or carbon monoxide emissions in
certain local areas, more targeted taxes would apply. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Finally for those pollutants that have profoundly damaging
impacts, regulation and perhaps criminal liability would be called for
in cases of their release. These classes are labeled the &#8220;property
rights zone,&#8221; the &#8220;incentive zone,&#8221; and the &#8220;regulatory zone&#8221;
respectively. The model follows the growing interest and preference for
pricing approaches over more heavy-handed and administratively
inefficient CAC approaches.
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Green taxes, sometimes also
called corrective taxes or Pigouvian taxes,
are their first candidates for consideration. This is because they can,
if priced right, recover the costs of externalities in ways that allow
individuals to use their own discretion about employing environmentally
damaging practices. But the authors extend their thinking to cover
goods and materials that may have negative ecological impacts although
not yet conclusively demonstrated by science. The answer there is to
rely upon a &#8220;<span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">precautionary
polluter pays principle</span>&#8221; based on the
present value of the forecast impact should the worst case scenarios be
borne out. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">The
annual cost of using a car in the early 1990s, for example, was $51,656
according to their calculations.</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">120</span></small> This
would obviously entail an enormous imposition of taxes, far above the
less than $7,000 direct annual costs typically shouldered by drivers
now,<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">121</span></small>
the rest of which are now passed on to society generally. Grave doubt
exists about the potential impact of various externalities of driving,
along with concern about the extent of damage which might possibly
occur to
the ecosystem; this warrants employment of the precautionary principle
and calls for policy solutions to curtail this travel mode. Complete
prohibition of certain materials and chemicals may be warranted in some
cases.... <a

Pollution: Tractable Solutions to Intractable Problems</a><span

</a></span>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The frustrated economist, unable
to tax runoff,
still has a bag of tricks.&nbsp; He looks for surrogates to tax,
something in a sack or bottle that moves through a market: Aha!
pesticides, fertilizers, salt, they'll do nicely to tax.&nbsp; Thus we
will "internalize the externalities" and have "proper pricing of
inputs" to create incentives for correct "trade-offs" in the
"production functions," and we're nearly home.&nbsp; Well, halfway
home.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Well, we've made a start.&nbsp; A few problems
remain.&nbsp; One is that a plurality of economists don't like the
effluent charge approach anyway, even for point sources.&nbsp; They
follow Coase and prefer to grant pollution entitlements to be traded in
a free market.&nbsp; Incredibly (to me) this view has prevailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>In principle they profess not to care what worthy
few get the original entitlements, but in practise a select company of
ancient and honorable polluters get them.&nbsp; We now call these
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">"offset
rights,"</span> a new form of property.&nbsp; In the L.A. Basin (South
Coast Air Quality Management District), a few have grown rich by
establishing their respective histories of pollution which they can now
sell to others who wish to continue this wholesome tradition.&nbsp; The
demonstration effect on those contemplating new and as yet unregulated
forms of pollution may be imagined.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>Those needing air to breathe?&nbsp; Well, according
to the modern philosophers they can enter the market, buy up offset
rights and retire them.&nbsp; Thus is fulfilled Robert Ingersoll's
forecast a century ago that if some corporation could bottle the air
they would charge us to breathe.&nbsp; It seems to confirm this dour
warning from a former Secretary of Labor: &nbsp;</small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>"We soon&nbsp; discovered
...&nbsp; the
danger of allowing economic
policy to be dominated by business or financial interests or, which
usually comes to the same thing, orthodox economic analysis."&nbsp;
(Marshall, p.ix) (emphasis added)
</small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
<small>The public has learned what is being done to it,
finally, and is rebelling at the Coase logic, which only a Chicago
economist could love.&nbsp; Offset rights are on the ropes.&nbsp; To
simplify, therefore, I am not going to speculate how Coase might be
applied to nonpoint, but just ignore it.&nbsp; I will treat effluent
charges, and taxes on surrogates, as the conventional economic solution
to pollution.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>But before leaving this there is a lesson in
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">The holders of offset
rights, whether "ancient and
honorable" or "innocent purchasers," are demanding compensation.&nbsp;
Never mind about asking them to pay the victims; they demand payment to
stop!</span>&nbsp;</span> (Polakovic, 1987) &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">They will probably get it, for
if the
system be
changed, there will be a taking of something, which they claim is
property.&nbsp;</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such
is the force of the Great Secular Superstition,
that unearned gains are sacred, even those originating with something
as unworthy as dumping crud on other human beings.</span>&nbsp; This
superstition is why effective control seems so expensive.&nbsp; My
remarks will not be instructed by it.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The solution is land
stewardship, a
new-old ethic to
supplant the cowboy ethic in which western man has wallowed over
several centuries of territorial expansion.&nbsp;</span> &nbsp;</small><br>
<br>
<small>To reprise from the section on forestry, we must
synthesize two concepts of land stewardship.&nbsp; Concept A says "save
for the future"; Concept B says put land to full use right now, to
serve and employ people.&nbsp; Concept AB says do both, but each in the
right place.&nbsp; Use the good land, use it well and fully, employ the
workers, serve everyone's needs.&nbsp; Congregate and cooperate on
central, low, flat, fertile ground, as efficient markets and efficient
public policies would dictate anyway.&nbsp; Leave the marginal land in
peace.&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;</small>

    3.0: Preface (pages ix.-xvi)</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>    But who should own the sky? That question became a kind of Zen koan for me,
      a seemingly innocent query that, on reflection, opened many unexpected
      doors. I pondered the possibility of starting a planet-saving, for-profit,
      sky-owning business; after all, I&#8217;d done well by doing good before.
      When that didn&#8217;t seem right, I wondered what would happen if we,
      as a society, created a trust to manage the atmosphere on behalf of future
      generations, with present-day citizens as secondary beneficiaries. Such
      a trust would do exactly what Waste Management Inc. would do if it owned
      the sky: charge dumpers for filling its dwindling storage space. Pollution
      would cost more and there&#8217;d be steadily less of it. All this would
      happen, after the initial deeding of rights to the trust, without government
      intervention. But if this trust &#8212; not Waste Management Inc. or some
      other corporation &#8212; owned the sky, there&#8217;d be a wonderful bonus:
      every American would get a yearly dividend check.</p>
  <p>This thought experiment turned into a proposal known as the sky trust and
    has made some political headway. It also served as the epicenter of my thinking
    about the commons, which led to this book. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read

<blockquote>
  <p>MANDATORY RESPONSIBILITY<br>
    I don&#8217;t think it will ever happen, but consider this scenario. <strong>Imagine
    Congress passes a law requiring every corporation &#8212; in exchange for
    limited liability &#8212; to have a triple bottom line. The law also says
    that at least a third of corporate directors should represent workers, nature,
    and communities in which the company operates.</strong> And it protects directors
    from lawsuits if they favor nature over profit. You&#8217;re the CEO of Acme
    Corporation. What changes do you make after the law takes effect?</p>
  <p>Well, you might start by increasing your accounting budget. You&#8217;ll
    need, henceforth, to keep track not only of money but also of your nonmonetary
    impacts on society and nature. This isn&#8217;t easy, though presumably shortcuts
    will be developed. Next, you assign people to find ways to reduce Acme&#8217;s
    negative impacts on nature and society, ranking the proposals by years to
    payback. You budget a modest sum for the most cost-effective projects, giving
    preference to those with public relations value. You publish ads and reports,
    patting yourself on the back for doing what the law requires. And you remind
    your board of directors that, if they choose, they can snub offers from the
    likes of Charles Hurwitz and forgo large capital gains for shareholders.</p>
  <p>All this would be well and good. But given the algorithms that still rule,
    how much difference would it make? And even if it did have some effect, would
    it make enough difference in the right ways? After all, you might spend your
    small green budget on one thing, while nature most needs something else.</p>
  <p><strong>Now, as an alternative, imagine that the price of nature is no longer
      zero.</strong>    All of a sudden, it costs big bucks to pollute or degrade ecosystems. Overnight,
    your managers scramble to cut pollution and waste. The higher the price,
    the faster their behavior changes. And it changes in response to specific
    natural scarcities, as indicated by specific prices.</p>
  <p>The question is, which of these approaches would work better &#8212; mandatory
    social responsibility, or increases in the price of nature? The answer, without
    doubt, is the latter. ... <a href="http://onthecommons.org/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">read
