  <p>Most of us would say, if asked, that he who works should keep the fruits of
      his labors, and that if there is a revenue source for public spending that
      does not take from the person who works his wages or that which he produced,
      such a source would be a good idea.</p>
  <p>Most of us would also endorse the idea that a system which puts in the pocket
    of those who don't work the fruits of the labors of others who do work is
    probably not a just system. If you asked them for an example, though, they
    might point to welfare payments to those unable to support themselves,
    but they probably wouldn't recognize the kinds of privilege we give to landholders &#8212; to
    pocket as if it were rightly theirs the rental value of land which few if
    any could claim to have created; to corporations
    we gift with
    subsidies
    and other kinds of corporate welfare.</p>
  <p>Land Value Taxation's goal is to collect for the commons that which rightly
    belongs to the commons, while leaving in private pockets that which is legitimately
    private property. It makes finer distinctions than most of us regularly make.
    But our conflation of land and capital allows so-called capitalists to pocket
    for themselves the value of land, which rightly belongs to the commons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shortsighted is the philosophy which counts on selfishness as the master
    motive of human action. It is blind to facts of which the world is full.
    It sees not
      the present, and reads not the past aright. If you would move men to action,
      to what shall you appeal? Not to their pockets, but to their patriotism;
    not to selfishness, but to sympathy. Self-interest is, as it were, a mechanical
      force &#8212; potent, it is true; capable of large and wide results. But there
      is in human nature what may be likened to a chemical force; which melts and
      fuses and overwhelms; to which nothing seems impossible. &quot;All that a man
      hath will he give for his life&quot; &#8212; that is self-interest. But
      in loyalty to higher impulses men will give even life. ...</p>
  <p>To remove want and the fear of want, to give to all classes leisure, and comfort,
      and independence, the decencies and refinements of life, the opportunities
      of mental and moral development, would be like turning water into a desert.
      The sterile waste would clothe itself with verdure, and the barren places where
      life seemed banned would ere long be dappled with the shade of trees and musical
      with the song of birds. Talents now hidden, virtues unsuspected, would come
      forth to make human life richer, fuller, happier, nobler. For</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>    Q: Your academic work led you to formulate what you called &quot;The Henry
    George Theorem.&quot; This demonstrated that public spending &#8212; where
    this was efficient &#8212; generated additional rental value that surfaced
    in the land market. Other distinguished scholars, such as the late Nobel
    prize winner, William Vickrey, confirmed your findings. You also noted in
    one of your books, co-written with Anthony Atkinson, that the Henry George
    Theorem was attractive both because it was the revenue-raiser that did not
    distort private incentives and because &quot;it is the 'single tax' required
    to finance the public good.&quot; [Anthony B. Atkinson &amp; Joseph E. Stiglitz,
    Lectures on Public Economics, London: McGraw-Hill, 1980, p. 525] Now, public
    investment, unless of the wasteful kind designed to serve the privileged
    interests of rent seekers (the classic type being a land speculator), should
    be viewed as working in partnership with the private sector and not a drain
    on the community. How can the reputation of publicly provided services and
    investments be rescued?</p>
  <p>JES: That's a very good question. What we did when I was at the Council
    of Economic Advisors was some studies to try to show what the social returns
    would be to public investment in R&amp;D, etc. And we became convinced that
    the rates of return of those investments are very high. So you ask the question, &quot;what
    can we do to restore confidence in public investment?&quot; We need to realize
    how much we depend on them. I keep telling people, &quot;The Internet.&quot; That's
    one example. It was publicly funded. It's now a public-private partnership.
    The government did the basic research, and the private sector ran off with
    it. But, arguably, we would never have had the Internet if it were not for
    government expenditure. So I think a major industry in the United States &#8212; biotech &#8212; is
    based on NIH (National Institutes of Health). NIH does all the basic research.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We've already seen how
speculators can presently hold on to idle
parcels of land, waiting for unearned increases in their value to
accrue to them. But here's another curse of land speculation: by
locking up productive land, it forces newcomers out to less productive
land. By "pushing back the margin", the evil of speculation
simultaneously raises rents and lowers wages. LVT makes it impossible
for speculators to enjoy unearned income.</small><br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Let's broaden our
understanding of rent by looking at some current real-world examples. </small></div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li><small>To tackle traffic congestion, governments often limit the
number of taxis by issuing licences. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>Because transmission bandwidths are limited (and sometimes
because of political influence), a limited number of TV operating
licences is issued. 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>To prevent overfishing, fishing licences are issued. 
    </small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">History
shows us that, because of
relative scarcity or changing circumstances, such licences often become
enormously valuable and are resold in the open market for huge sums.
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">This excess is what is meant
by economic rent, and plutocrats, big-time
speculators and businesspeople dealing with such licences or privileges
are called rent-seekers.</span></span></small><br>
<br>
<small>We can now see that the term "economic rent" encompasses a wide
range
of resources, and can be defined as the excess over a competitive rate
of return attributable to owning an asset or resource whose supply is
limited, at least in the short run. Note the underlined words, for they
indicate sort of some monopoly privilege, as we have seen.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The problems above have exact parallels with the land problem.
The
monopolistic privileges have often been sold off once and for all to
the highest cash bidder (or perhaps given away or even stolen) instead
of being auctioned and then regularly (annually?) assessed to determine
the economic rent that belongs to the community.</small><br>
<br>
<small>A limited resource is usually a gift of Nature. The windfall
profits
arising from the granting of timber and mining rights are other
instances of uncollected economic rent. Otherwise, economic rent mainly
arises as the result of monopolies, duopolies, oligopolies and cartels.
The solution is either to regularly assess and collect the economic
rent, or to prevent natural monopolies (such as "public" utilities)
from falling into private hands in the first place. ... </small><br>
<br>
<small>Green taxes have long been supported by Geonomists. Full
resource
rentals imposed on such things as timber extraction or commercial
fishing prevent undervaluation, wastage and overexploitation. "Polluter
pays" pricing policies preserve the planet from plunderers (sorry). In
fact, the whole range of carbon taxes are forms of LVT in the sense of
being charges for use and abuse of air, water and other natural
resources.</small><br>
<br>
<small>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">electromagnetic spectrum</span>
also falls within the wide definition of land. To sell it off for good
to the highest cash bidder is to set up an exploitative and
economically inefficient monopoly. The spectrum belongs to the people
who increase its value as much as they increase that of land.
Government should act as its custodian, auctioning off for rent the
various segments of the bandwidth. To prevent changing economic
circumstances or technological developments from dropping big chunks of
economic rent into the laps of bandwidth lessees, rents should be
regularly and appropriately reviewed and raised. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">That Kerry Packer's
broadcasting licences have appreciated by well over a billion dollars
shows the foolishness of failing to distinguish, for tax purposes,
between land and capital. And perhaps shows the political influence of
a powerful rent-seeker. ... <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><a

Nic Tideman:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Tideman_PJER.html">Peace, Justice
and Economic Reform</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Consider first the conservative
claim that justice is defined by
traditional rules. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservative </span>says,
"I don't say that I'm
better than anyone else, nor do I say that my conception of the good
is better than anyone else's. I may not even like what tradition
demands. But if you want to be just, you will follow the rules that
have traditionally been followed." I have seen one drawing of justice
that reflects this conservative view by portraying justice as a
seated woman, with a book in her lap. The book is clearly the
received law, the source that justice cites as the foundation of her
decrees. But this is not the standard image of justice.</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>There is an important virtue of
conservatism. This is that it
eliminates the waste of resources in fighting over who has what
rights, the waste from what economists call <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">rent-seeking</span>.
Furthermore, there will be some situations where there is no time to
secure agreement on anything other than the status quo. Thus there is
reason to have at least some element of conservatism in the
procedures by which disputes are resolved. But conservatism cannot be
the ultimate rule of a just society. It would perpetuate slavery, the
selling of daughters as brides, racial and sexual inequalities in
civil rights, and every other historical injustice that, through our
moral evolution, we have overcome. The neutrality of Conservatism is
superficial. Conservatism cannot claim to offer either the
evenhandedness that the blindfold promises or the equality that
scales require. ...<a style="font-weight: bold;"

Distinctive Factor of Production</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Another thing libertarian
philosophers must paper over is the rent-seeking that occurs in the
creation of private tenures.&nbsp; They avidly push privatization as a
grand Panacea, but ignore the process of privatization and its
consequences.&nbsp; Private tenure is often granted under customs that
make it a prize for occupying or fixing some capital on land, and
continuing to operate it with "due diligence" ("use it or lose
it").&nbsp; Premature investment, settlement and development are
frequent results, seriously distorting the allocation of land, labor
and capital and contributing to the "Congested Frontier" problem
(cf.&nbsp; B-2<small>.</small><big><small>)</small><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span></big></small></div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <p><small><small><big>High land price
  guides investors to prefer kinds of capital that
  substitute for land.&nbsp; Although capital cannot be converted into
  land, it can substitute for land, and does so when rents and land
  prices
  are high.&nbsp; John Stuart Mill long ago pointed out that the
  structure
  and character of capital is determined by the level of rents and
  wages.<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19&nbsp;</span></big></small></small>    </p>
  <p><small>Such substitution is an integral part of the
      equilibrating function of markets; the human race could never have
      attained its present numbers and density without it.&nbsp; High wages
      evoke labor-saving capital; high rents evoke land-saving capital.&nbsp; It
      is useful to carry this farther, and recognize five kinds of substitutive
    capital evoked by high rents and land prices:</small></p>

Mason Gaffney:&nbsp; <a href="../docs/Gaffney_RSaGC.html">Rent Seeking
and Global Conflict</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>National governments originate
historically to acquire, hold and
police land. Other functions are assumed later, but sovereignty over
land is always the first business. Private parties hold land from the
sovereign: every chain of title goes back to a grantor who originally
seized the land.</small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>When economists today speak of
"rent-seeking" they usually are
thinking not of basic land rent, but in subtle and sophisticated
terms, looking at dribs and drabs of transfer rent derived from
contracting advantages. They develop abstract models for gaming
optimally with imperfect information, and so on. By emphasizing the
arcane while ignoring the basic they are in danger of matching the
proverbial expert who fine-tunes all the details and elaborations as
he forges on to the grand disaster.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Indeed, we have had one such
disaster. Viet Nam was viewed by many
as an economists' war, rationally planned and led by the best and the
brightest systems' analysts, exemplified by the brilliant, energetic
Secretary of Defense. One should not be surprised at the post-Viet
Nam decline of interest in applying modern economic theory to
questions of global conflict.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>We would be more useful to
statesmen if we looked first at
rent-seeking in the grosser sense of "land-grabbing", where the whole
bundle is at stake. </b>When William of Normandy conquered England
the prize was land rent, all of it. He and his retainers dispossessed
the local rent-collectors. It was simple, gross, and basic, and much
more consequential than the trivial rent-seeking we model today.
<b>The bulk of the natives may have been affected only marginally:
they just paid Lord B instead of Lord A. But it made all the
difference to Lords B and A, the ones who made basic decisions about
global conflict and cooperation. ...</b></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Self-evidently, rivalry to
appropriate limited rent-yielding
resources must lead to conflict. It has to, because land is not
produced, nor stored up like capital by saving. Modern economics
glosses over this by stressing that land, like other resources, is
allocated by the market. That may be, but distribution is something
else. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Every land title in the world
goes back to a taking by
force.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>It will be objected that one can
buy in peacefully once a tenure
is firmly established, with alienable titles. There is certainly no
intent to deny this. The problem is that a successor-in-interest
stands on no firmer footing than the original. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">There is no
laundering: every landholder can consult his chain of title and see
how it originated.. Indeed, it has been said that those who buy
stolen property are the chief cause of crime. Fencing itself is a
crime.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>However one may side on that
question, it helps account for the
extreme alarm with which US statecraft startles at any foreign
country, however weak and innocuous, which expropriates any such
successor-in-interest. Demonstration effects are contagious and
threatening. The defensiveness of the insecure is a major cause of
global conflict.</small></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>More
destabilizing yet is the ambitious
rent-seeker offshore, who
finds his biggest gains in the riskiest ways, ways that unfortunately
impose high risks on the U.S. The biggest gains to rent-seekers come
from buying in on the ground floor, cheap, when tenures are
precarious or uncertain. ...&nbsp;</small> <small><a

<blockquote><small>Rent is dissipated through prematurity of
investments.
Squatters' Rights (<b>Preemption Act of 1841</b>), and residence
requirement of <b>Homestead Act (1862)</b>, traditional examples.
Prior appropriation doctrine of water rights, simple example. Air
routes; broadcast licenses; extending utility franchises; zoning;
offset rights to pollute; other modern examples. </small>
  <p><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Offset rights to pollute
are
doubly effective in dissipating rent.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">By generating a nuisance and
lowering the value of surrounding land, a polluter is rewarded by
receiving a valuable vested right to continue the nuisance in
perpetuity, or sell it.</span></small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Internationally, rent-seeking via warfare, or big-stick
policies
threatening warfare, may be seen to dissipate rent when we deduct the
public cost from the private gain.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <ul>
    <li><small>Open access to exploration, followed by claims, as in
minerals
act of 1872.</small></li>
    <li><small>Noncompetitive leasing (free entry,
first-come-first-served) as
in Alaska until fairly recent times.</small></li>
    <li><small>Open access for preliminary forms of exploration,
followed by
leases for exploratory drilling.</small></li>
    <li><small>Leasing on demand ("nomination"), i.e. at the
convenience of
the first potential lessee, rather than the lessor. In conjunction with
the bonus bid system, leasing on demand puts a premium on financial or
front-money power as the triggering force. It also puts a premium on
sequestering information and treating it as proprietary, and forcing as
much duplication of effort as there are competitors.</small>  </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><small>Subsidizing exploration. A subsidy, almost by
definition,
causes waste in the amount of the subsidy, by causing people to spend
more to produce things than they are worth. With minerals, subsidies
cause submarginal lands to be developed. Submarginal in this case
generally means "premature," since rising scarcity probably means the
submarginal will eventually become superior.</small></li>
    <li><small>Direct subsidies</small></li>
    <li><small>Tax preferences (a long list). I premise the tax-subsidy
concept, i.e. that those who pay less taxes on the supposed principle
of taxation are being subsidized by others who pay more.</small></li>
    <li><small>Unlimited license to acquire leaseholds. Gale Johnson,
Stephen
Cheung and others have shown the rational landlord may make a system of
share tenancy work only if he limits the land each tenant may have.
State and Federal lessors generally impose royalties and other charges
on a unit-of-production basis, so their lessees are share-croppers; but
they put no upper limit on leasehold acquisition. </small>
      <p><small>There are time limits on holding without producing, but
these
may be met by token compliance.</small></p>
      </li>
    <li><small>Leverage of private investment over public investment
and
public services.</small></li>

exploration, transportation, refining and consumption all receive heavy
subsidies of this kind. (However, cf. #14, Goldplating.)</small></li>

  </ul>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Slowing down use and extraction of minerals once
discovered. In
tandem with incentives to premature exploration, this generates an
unduly capital-freezing industry. It attracts capital too soon, and
releases it too slowly. In the Austrian sense, it becomes too
capital-intensive.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>Freezing up capital is not free. To justify each year
capital is
frozen, interest must be paid. This wasted interest comes out of rent,
in the form of lower bids for leaseholds.</small></p>

  <small>Appendix: "Natural Capitalism" -- A Case Study in Blindness to
  Land Value Taxation </small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
  <small><span style="font-weight: bold;">It should also be noted that
    the
    advantages of LVT extend far beyond the immediate and direct
    contribution to environmental solutions - they give rise to economic
    efficiency, social justice, individual liberty, world peace, effective
    third world aid and more.</span> An understanding of the nature of
    economic rent and rent-seeking behaviour would assist the appreciation
    of some points made here, but an explanation of this extends beyond the
    immediate ambit of this paper. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This
  succinct summary, however, may assist: </span></small><br>
  <br>
  <small>"For the failure to make people pay
    rent for access, or possession of, natural resources is at the heart of
    all major environmental problems, and is the cause of some of the most
    fractious geo-political problems .... <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">There
    are no remedies for the ecocrises that do not include a heightened
    awareness of the value of economic rent and the process of the land
    market"</span><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>.&nbsp;
  ... </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The process of monitoring and assessing LVT itself leads to a
    more
    subtle, more environmentally-appreciative understanding of how best to
    prioritise conflicting demands on land. Should a tract of land best be
    used for green space for local residents, a light rail corridor or
    employment providing development? LVT assessment inherently weighs the
    pros and cons of a whole range of intangible costs and benefits for the
    wider community now and into the future, and eliminates corrupting
"NIMBY" motives and rent-seeking behaviour that influence existing
    planning and development decisions. In response to the accusation that
    LVT assessment is little more than a best guess at quantifying values
    that are inherently unquantifiable, LVT advocates respond "Guilty as
    charged!" However, they then add, "Our good guesses are based on solid,
    objective methodology and are better than wild guesses, and even most
    wild guesses are better than the decisions made today." <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Currently,
    many natural resources are almost assigned a worthless value because,
    not entering the mainstream marketplace, they usually have no $ tags
    hanging off them - hence the existence of externalities whereby the
    environment is plundered as near worthless.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">So
    even wild guesses at the value of land and other natural resources are
    better than the present situation, in which the "no guess" decision
    effectively assigns natural and community resources a zero value.</span>...&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </small><br>
  <br>
  <small>LVT and its 19th-century champion, <a href="../George_P&P.html">Henry
    George</a>,
    achieved huge acclaim before being buried by the "purpose-built" body
    of neoclassical economics financed largely by rent-seeking American
    plutocrats.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[18]</span></small>
  In one form or another, Henry George's writings on the need to tax land
    values was preceded or endorsed by various biblical prophets, and by
    Carlyle, Churchill, Einstein, Franklin, Aldous Huxley, Jefferson,
    Lincoln, Locke, J.S. Mill, Paine, Penn, Rousseau, Bertrand Russell,
    Adam Smith, Spencer, Spinoza, Sun Yat Sen, James Tobin, Tolstoy, Twain,
    Voltaire, Winstanley, Frank Lloyd Wright and many more.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">[19]</span></small>
  Just how this wisdom has been lost sight of is a long - too long for
  this paper - and tragic story.</small><br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Here, for this conference, is the quirk - <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">environmental
considerations played almost no part in the compelling endorsements
lavished on LVT! The main bill, then and now, is its powerful
explanation of the great causes of social injustice, with the second
billing going to an exposure of a whole range of economic
inefficiencies and deadweight losses of our present economic system,
which should more accurately be termed land-monopoly capitalism.</span>

    </small></li>
  <li><small>contributions to world peace, and 
    </small></li>
  <li><small>an end to boom &amp; bust cycles.</small></li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The appeal of LVT to some others
is more its philosophical basis and
how its implementation must turn the economy the right way up, such
that the cause of the "madness" (because completely unnecessary) of
involuntary unemployment is eliminated, which of necessity then leads
to the range of benefits just mentioned.</small><br>
<br>
<small>This is not a meandering departure from the subject of this
conference.
No significant, effectual solutions can be made to our environment if
the all-embracing economic system is only nibbled at, piecemeal, from
the angle of taxation alone.</small><br>
<br>
<small>LVT is not a mere taxation solution, but an integrated economic
solution, impacting on land management and cutting at the heart of
privilege and injustice. Yes, environmental tax reformers must indeed
address the looting of undervalued natural resources driven by
bourgeois habits of overconsumption. Let us not, however, overlook the
destruction resulting from short-term perspectives driven by poverty
and desperation. LVT deals with both worlds. ...&nbsp; <a

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have already shown that the
land of every country is the public
property of the people of that country, and consequently, that its
exclusive appropriation by a class is a substantial injustice and
wrong done to every man in that country", whom it robs of his fair
share of the common inheritance. The injustice of this appropriation
is enormously enhanced by the fact that it further enables the
landlords, without any risk or trouble, and in fact makes it a matter
of course for them, to appropriate a vast share of the earnings of
the nation besides. They plundered the people first of God's gifts in
the land, and that act of spoliation puts them under a sort of
necessity of plundering them again of an enormous amount of their
direct earnings and wages. The line of argument that leads directly
to this conclusion seems abundantly clear. <a

Bill Batt: <a href="../docs/Batt_GEE.html">The
Compatibility of Georgist Economics and Ecological Economics <br>
</a>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">The
next important step in
understanding Georgist economics is
recognition that each factor of production has its economic price: the
price of labor is wages, the price of capital is interest, and the
price of land is rent.</span> When any of these prices are unpaid,
distortions
result in the economic equilibrium and problems become manifest in
other realms of nature and society. In neoclassical economics
compensation for the use of labor and capital continue to be important
in the formulas and calculations employed to explain the economy. But
for neoclassical economics, David Ricardo&#8217;s &#8220;law of rent&#8221; is
essentially ignored and has be come for all practical purposes an
artifact in the history of economics. Rent continues to exist of
course; it is simply uncollected, left in the hands of those who
maintain monopoly control of certain services of nature, adding to
their market value in ways that distort the balance of markets. Failure
to recognize the importance of land rent (sometimes called economic
rent) is for Georgists critical to an understanding of the problems of
contemporary economies and economic analysis.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span></small></small><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small>14The phenomenon of rent and
rent-seeking is a proper consideration not just in economics but also
particularly for the study of politics. A recent paper originally
published in Political Studies /Vol. 45 (September, 1997), pp. 639-658,
makes this clear: Paul Hutchcroft, &#8220;The Politics of Privilege:

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>A worm in the apple was waste of
water. The same policy that
promoted close economy and rapid conversion of land also tolerated
waste of water, and even subsidized it by basing the quantity of
rival water claims on histories of use - what economists now call
"rent-seeking." It was once a minor problem, but times change, and
"circumstances alter cases." Today we are stuck with much of our
water, a limiting natural resource, frozen in lower uses and withheld
from higher ones - exactly what Georgist policy is supposed to
prevent. The solution, clearly, is for the State to charge each
Irrigation District (and other diverters) per unit of water they
take, and reallocate the great surpluses they would immediately stop
taking. ... <a href="../docs/Gaffney_RLT&GLT.html"><span

Economics of Abundance: Replacing dismal choices with practical

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b> Fostering
economy in government in the very process of raising revenue</b></small>
</div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Anti-governmentalists often
identify any tax policy with public
extravagance. Georgist tax policies, on the contrary, help save
public funds in at least two general ways.</small></p>
<blockquote style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>a. Putting the unemployed
to work saves many public costs,
like welfare, obviously, crime-fighting, and, ultimately, putting down
civil disturbances and insurrections. </small>
  <p><small>b. Putting the unemployed to work also raises demand and,
by so
doing, helps make plain to all the desirability of unleashing supply.
Now, supply in some industries is deliberately held down to support
prices. U.S. agriculture is a good example: supply restraints are
transparent because they are matters of public law. The U.S.D.A. pays
landowners to fallow some 60 million acres each year, to raise food and
clothing prices. Under Georgist policy those acres would go to work
producing food and paying taxes, both.</small></p>
  <small> </small>
  <p><small>c. Georgist policies obviate subeconomic extensions of
public
works, which now are pushed by the powerful combination of land
speculators seeking increments, the jobless seeking work, and the
homeless seeking shelter. Georgist policies open up the naturally
better land to settlement, thus relieving the pressure to invade flood
plains, steep erosive slopes, flammable brushlands, wetlands, and other
places that soak up heavy public funds to reach, develop, service, and
protect.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 40px;"><small>At the same
time, these policies deflate
the "rent-seeking"
motivations of land speculators to sue for state and federal aid. Under
George's scheme, the unearned increments secured by
"rent-seeking" lobbying for public works would be taxed away.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>In the longer run it seems
reasonable to expect that more genuine
productive job opportunities at home would reduce the pressures for
military spending, at least those portions which are strictly
boondoggling of a make-jobs nature.<span style="font-weight: bold;">...</span><a

<p>Ed Clarke: <a
 href="../docs/Clarke_Geoism.html">Geoisim and the Practice of Public
Economics</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>I have long been sympathetic to the Geoist
    position, and to the extent that you will let me characterize my views as
    Geoclassical rather than Neoclassical, Geoism represents a position that
    many in the public economics profession can gradually be attracted to, as
    I was over the course of thirty years.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>The geoist position, at least as developed by people like <a href="../auth/Feder.html">Feder</a>and <a href="../auth/Tideman.html">Tideman</a>,
  is simply to advance principles of public economics known as benefit taxation,
  to structure incentives that will constrain rent-seeking behavior, and share
  rents from use of natural resources and the exercise of government privileges
  more equitably among citizens (present and future, ours and the world's citizens).</small> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> ...</span><br>
  <br>
  <small>The ideas are contained in several recent articles by Martin Bailey,
  one of Chicago's most famous public finance professors, who recently died.
  Nic Tideman has taken on the task of publishing his posthumous work on <span style="font-style: italic;">A
  Constitution for A Future Country</span>. In his articles (Public Choice, 1996,
  1997), Bailey structures a set of incentive compatible decision mechanisms
  and agenda setting/referendum arrangements that essentially mimic the operation
  of the private market in the public sphere.</small><br>
  <br>
  <small>These markets largely eliminate the incentive to rent-seeking and politically
  exploitative behavior and to the extent that community-created values are appropriately
  reflected in land rents (ie., the building of a dam or flood control project)
  as opposed to some good that has non-material or symbolic value (Bailey, 1996,
  uses the example of public support of a monarchy), then there is a strong motivation
  to adopt what amounts to LVT and/or the appropriate (supplementary) marginal
  cost (user) charges. ...</small> <big><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span></big> <small><a
